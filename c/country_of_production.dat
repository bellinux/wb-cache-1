40|$|As {{companies}} become {{ever more}} globalised, manufacture firms choose to outsource production to lower labour cost countries. However, as studies have shown, such a relocation of production {{may lead to}} undesirably decreased quality perceptions by consumers as the brand origin and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are de-coupled. This quality perception linked to congruity between brand origin and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> has been studied for various products and product classes, but little {{has been written about}} how a luxury bed manufacturer may be affected by this phenomenon known as the country of origin effect. Thus in theory quality perceptions are higher if the brand origin and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are congruent and are further amplified if that country is already regarded highly in terms of production competence. In our study, we set out to verify this theory through a consumer-based questionnaire. Our results give strong evidence in support of this theory which is why we ultimately claim, from a theoretical standpoint, that the company we focus on should maintain its production location in Sweden...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{manufacturing}} and marketing international products is increasingly complex {{and especially for}} multinational corporations that strive to lower production costs while adapting their products and services to match local preferences. Localization of international business {{has been shown to}} generate differing country of origin (COO) effects in terms of the brand origin and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> (COP) congruity issue. Both <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and brand origin may not be the same, which questions the effect of incongruity on a brand, consumer ethnocentrism and localization issues particularly when a well known brand are from a developed country and COP is in a developing country. This study extends past studies on the COO effect to examine whether a negative COP affects consumer product perception and consumer purchase decision of a well-known brand. Hypotheses are tested empirically against survey consumer data from the UK (developed country) and People's Republic of China (developing country) using Sony as a global brand. The main findings show that both brand origin and COP are particularly important for consumers in a developed country in their product evaluations while perceived brand image of a developing country and price are key factors for consumers in a developing country. In addition, knowledge of the extent of consumer ethnocentrism can be a major determinant for branding decisions related to using product information cues about <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and/or an international brand image. 9 page(s...|$|E
