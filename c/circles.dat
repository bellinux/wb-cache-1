5|$|Any initial two {{disjoint}} given <b>circles</b> can {{be rendered}} concentric as follows. The radical {{axis of the}} two given <b>circles</b> is constructed; choosing two arbitrary points P and Q on this radical axis, two <b>circles</b> can be constructed that are centered on P and Q and that intersect the two given <b>circles</b> orthogonally. These two constructed <b>circles</b> intersect each other in two points. Inversion in one such intersection point F renders the constructed <b>circles</b> into straight lines emanating from F and the two given <b>circles</b> into concentric <b>circles,</b> with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows because the system of <b>circles</b> is equivalent {{to a set of}} Apollonian <b>circles,</b> forming a bipolar coordinate system.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} to construct all the <b>circles</b> that intersect three given <b>circles</b> at a precise angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ1, θ2 and θ3; the ordinary Apollonius' problem corresponds to a special {{case in which the}} crossing angle is zero for all three given <b>circles.</b> Another generalization is the dual of the first extension, namely, to construct <b>circles</b> with three specified tangential distances from the three given <b>circles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} stimulated much further work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres—and beyond have been studied. The {{configuration}} of three mutually tangent <b>circles</b> has received particular attention. René Descartes gave a formula relating the radii {{of the solution}} <b>circles</b> and the given <b>circles,</b> now known as Descartes' theorem. Solving Apollonius' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket, {{which is one of}} the earliest fractals to be described in print, and is important in number theory via Ford <b>circles</b> and the Hardy–Littlewood circle method.|$|E

5|$|Gergonne's {{approach}} is to consider the solution <b>circles</b> in pairs. Let a pair of solution <b>circles</b> be denoted as CA and CB (the pink <b>circles</b> in Figure6), and let their tangent points with the three given <b>circles</b> be denoted as A1, A2, A3, and B1, B2, B3, respectively.

5|$|If {{the three}} given <b>circles</b> are {{mutually}} tangent, Apollonius' problem has five solutions.

5|$|If two of {{the three}} given <b>circles</b> do not intersect, a center of {{inversion}} can be chosen so that those two given <b>circles</b> become concentric. Under this inversion, the solution <b>circles</b> must fall within the annulus between the two concentric <b>circles.</b> Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution <b>circles</b> enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E

50|$|A <b>circle</b> not {{passing through}} O inverts to a <b>circle</b> not passing through O.

5|$|In general, any three {{distinct}} <b>circles</b> {{have a unique}} circle—the radical circle—that intersects all of them perpendicularly; {{the center of that}} circle is the radical center of the three <b>circles.</b> For illustration, the orange circle in Figure6 crosses the black given <b>circles</b> at right angles. Inversion in the radical circle leaves the given <b>circles</b> unchanged, but transforms the two conjugate pink solution <b>circles</b> into one another. Under the same inversion, the corresponding points of tangency of the two solution <b>circles</b> are transformed into one another; for illustration, in Figure6, the two blue points lying on each green line are transformed into one another. Hence, the lines connecting these conjugate tangent points are invariant under the inversion; therefore, they must pass through the center of inversion, which is the radical center (green lines intersecting at the orange dot in Figure 6).|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} approach, the given <b>circles</b> are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their tangency) until one given circle is shrunk {{to a point}} P. In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to the CCP , which {{is the problem of}} finding a {{solution}} circle tangent to the two remaining given <b>circles</b> that passes through the point P. Inversion in a circle centered on P transforms the two given <b>circles</b> into new <b>circles,</b> and the solution circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed solution is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given <b>circles.</b> There are four such solution lines, which may be constructed from the external and internal homothetic centers of the two <b>circles.</b> Re-inversion in P and undoing the resizing transforms such a solution line into the desired solution circle of the original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the <b>circles</b> according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given <b>circles</b> may be shrunk to a point for different solutions.|$|E
