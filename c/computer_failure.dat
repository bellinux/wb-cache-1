5000|$|The M5 East {{has been}} beset by many closures, due to {{accidents}} and <b>computer</b> <b>failures</b> within the tunnel, which cause gridlock. Between 2002 and 2008 {{there were six}} closures attributed to technical and <b>computer</b> <b>failures</b> alone in the tunnel. The Government of New South Wales must pay penalties to the operators of the M5 East, BHBB, due to more traffic using the M5 than originally forecast. The penalties were expected to amount to $13 million by 2011. Some of this increase in demand {{was caused by the}} State Government's [...] "Cashback" [...] scheme, which involves public money subsidising motorists for using the adjoining, tolled M5 South-West Motorway.|$|R

30|$|The {{need for}} {{practical}} means to assess Web services robustness is corroborated by several {{studies that show}} a clear predominance of software faults (i.e., program defects or bugs) [5 – 7] as {{the root cause of}} <b>computer</b> <b>failures</b> and, given the huge complexity of today’s software, the weight of software faults will tend to increase. Web services are no exception, as they are normally intricate software components that frequently implement a compound task, in some cases using compositions of several services, which makes them even more complex.|$|R

In all, the orbiter {{was able to}} use the satellite for 65 of the planned 89 orbits, and could make successful use of the connection on about forty. The Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System equipment functioned as planned, processing several hundred times more material than would have been possible on Earth, and the Asahi Shimbun crystal experiment, flown for the second time, was able to produce snow crystals after the canister was redesigned.|$|R

Problems and Issues in IS development Information technology provides the links for global communication and information support systems. However, in recent times there have been a great number of cases of <b>computer</b> system <b>failures</b> causing many problems for those trying to use them. The failures have affected both private and public institutions. For example, the failure of the London Ambulance computer system created problems for staff, managers and patients (Wastell and Newman, 1996). There are others, the child support agency cancelled after a spend of £ 600 m (Jones, 1997), the London Stock Exchange system, Taurus (Drummond, 1986), Wessex Health Authority (Kirby-Green, 1993), the HISS initiative (Jones, 1997), the pathway initiative cancelled after £ 878 m (Ranger, 2000).

50|$|Construction of the Wenshan Line {{began in}} December 1988 {{at a cost}} of NT$42.6 billion. It was plagued by controversy, cost overruns and {{technical}} problems from its development up to a few years after its opening. Originally slated to commence passenger service in December 1991, its revenue operation was repeatedly delayed up to 28 March 1996 owing to numerous accidents. Public confidence was shakened as incidents of lightning strikes, <b>computer</b> <b>failures,</b> two instances of rolling stock derailment and catching fire each were reported during the testing phase. In 1999, cracks were found on the elevated pillars forcing the line to shut down temporarily.|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} for a dive computer to malfunction during a dive. If the diver has been monitoring decompression status and is within the no-decompression limits, a <b>computer</b> <b>failure</b> can be safely managed by simply surfacing at the recommended ascent rate, and if possible, doing a short safety stop near the surface. If, however the computer could fail while the diver has a decompression obligation, or cannot make a direct ascent, some form of backup is prudent.|$|E

These surveys, focusing on computer usage, design methodology, and the adaptation of pen-based computers, will be a basis for future research in landscape architecture.
