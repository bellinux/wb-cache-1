Here, providing a safe & reliable power supply to all sectors in the country has become a great challenge to the utility company.

ITER uses the sueperconducting magnet systems for trapping and maneuvering plasma inside the giant tokamak machines. Superconductivity only entails under the critical conditions of temperature, magnetic field and current density. If any of these parameters surpass the critical value, the quench ensues in the cable. In the real system scenarios, electromagnetic, radiative & conductive loads are present, which may affect {{the performance of the}} machine. The magnet designer can change the parameters in terms of current and magnetic field to ensure that the critical conditions are met, {{but when it comes to}} temperature, it is really hard to locate the hot spot locations. To envisage such situations, it is essential to study thermal hydraulics and hence system code is needed for the whole superconducting magnet system. For such purposes, Cryogenic <b>Circuit,</b> <b>Conductor</b> and Coil code (4 C) was built, imbibing the thermal hydraulic modeling of the cable in Conduit conductors (including strands) coupled with structures (which give support to the winding pack, wound by conductors) and an external cryogenic circuit.

40|$|The {{design of}} novel {{solutions}} for packaging {{and integration of}} power semiconductor devices to deliver switches with advanced performance and reliability is very important aspect of power electronics technology evolution. The advancement of technology {{in this area is}} committed to bring significant improvements in the design and implementation of power converters particularly in the enhancement of efficiency, higher power density and better cooling system as compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. A power module is a combination of either multiple semiconductor or discrete devices which are connected to form an electrical circuit of certain structure. They are mainly constructed with a stack of four main parts (power semiconductor devices, insulating substrate with <b>circuit</b> <b>conductor,</b> baseplate, and interconnecting material encapsulated in a plastic case) and each of these parts is of a different material. Some of the interfaces within the module are prone to failure with thermal cycling such as wire-bond, solder die attach and substrate. Therefore reducing the number of interfaces in the assembly will greatly reduce the thermal resistance from the junction to ambient and yields noticeable increase of performance. Moreover, using solid posts as opposed to wires to connect the surface of vertical power components enable a significant improvement in power density as compared with standard modules based on wire bond technology. Additionally, the replacement of wires with such posts drastically reduces the distributed parasitic inductance, together with double-sided cooling of the devices, results in an increase of performance and reliability of the components and assemblies. In this work, 70 um thick Infineon technology power devices which are rated at 600 V/ 200 A were used for the assembly of a Bi-directional switch based converter and discussing the challenges and trade-offs related to selecting processes and materials.

A basic partial discharge test was also taken to demonstrate the performance of the insulation. This research has presented an advanced modular integration approach for power device packaging demonstrating the progress beyond the state of the art in power system assembly by proposing a solution which significantly improves electromagnetic and thermomechanical performance of the power module.
