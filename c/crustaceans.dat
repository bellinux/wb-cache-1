5|$|<b>Crustaceans</b> have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} fossil record, which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age Burgess Shale. Most of the major groups of <b>crustaceans</b> appear in the fossil record {{before the end of}} the Cambrian, namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including barnacles and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate as to whether or not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods, which would otherwise start in the Ordovician. The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no fossil record, and the Remipedia, which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the Carboniferous. Most of the early <b>crustaceans</b> are rare, but fossil <b>crustaceans</b> become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards.|$|E

5|$|Many <b>crustaceans</b> are {{consumed}} by humans, and nearly 10,700,000tons were produced in 2007; {{the vast majority}} of this output is of decapod crustaceans: crabs, lobsters, shrimp, crawfish, and prawns. Over 60% by weight of all <b>crustaceans</b> caught for consumption are shrimp and prawns, and nearly 80% is produced in Asia, with China alone producing nearly half the world's total. Non-decapod <b>crustaceans</b> are not widely consumed, with only 118,000tons of krill being caught, despite krill having one of the greatest biomasses on the planet.|$|E

5|$|Most <b>crustaceans</b> are {{free-living}} aquatic animals, {{but some}} are terrestrial (e.g. woodlice), some are parasitic (e.g. Rhizocephala, fish lice, tongue worms) and some are sessile (e.g. barnacles).

More than 10 million tons of <b>crustaceans</b> are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption, the majority of it being shrimp and prawns.

5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, the {{sluggish}} and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: <b>crustaceans</b> (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, mantis shrimp, and hermit crabs), annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including anchovies, jack macherels, and gobies), cephalopods (including squid), and fish offal. Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is <b>crustaceans,</b> followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem to prefer polychaetes, while females prefer <b>crustaceans.</b> It has been observed attacking a common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) by tearing off an arm with a twisting motion.|$|E
5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} is {{a fairly}} inactive species that spends {{long periods of time}} buried motionless in sediment. It feeds primarily on polychaete worms (particularly those of the family Maldanidae) and <b>crustaceans</b> (including amphipods, decapods, and tanaids). Nematodes and sipunculids may also be consumed on rare occasions. Juvenile rays consume polychaetes and <b>crustaceans</b> in roughly equal proportions, while adults consume mostly polychaetes. This dietary shift may reflect increasing experience with age, as polychaetes are burrowing animals and thus more difficult to locate and capture than <b>crustaceans.</b> Like other members of its family, the Tasmanian numbfish can defend itself with a modest electric shock. Its predators include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). The tapeworm Anthobothrium hickmani is a parasite of this species.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the Arctic tern varies {{depending}} on location and time, but is usually carnivorous.

Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the marine <b>crustaceans</b> eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Food webs in {{northern}} temperate lakes frequently exhibit tightly linked interactions between adjacent trophic levels {{that lead to}} top-down effects from piscivores to phytoplankton. To determine if these interactions occur in reservoirs dominated by an omnivorous planktivore, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, we experimentally quantified <b>crustacean</b> zooplankton and phytoplankton responses to age- 0 gizzard shad (23 - 90 mm total length) at four gizzard shad densities across three reservoirs, each with a different level of <b>crustacean</b> zooplankton productivity. Age- 0 gizzard shad exerted strong top-down effects on <b>crustacean</b> zooplankton, eliminating it from most enclosures within 2 weeks. This decline in <b>crustacean</b> zooplankton {{did not lead to}} increases in phytoplankton unless Daphnia spp. were initially abundant. As detritivores, gizzard shad can remain abundant when planktonic food resources are depleted. This trophic decoupling probably allows gizzard shad to structure reservoir food webs by overconsumption of <b>crustacean</b> zooplank-ton, which in turn may compromise recruitment of sport fishes with zooplanktivorous larvae. In our view, the potential for increasing <b>crustacean</b> zooplankton density by controlling gizzard shad with stocked predators will be limited to reservoirs where age- 0 gizzard shad density can be reduced below 10 fish/m 3 and where daily zooplankton productivity exceeds 220 mg/nv...|$|R
