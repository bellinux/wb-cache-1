50|$|The {{situation}} on the field was heavily disrupted by off field troubles, and the squad was made up only 10 players with little experience just weeks {{before the start of}} the season, before three wealthy local businessmen took charge of the club to provide much needed short term investments. Ndriçim Babasi was appointed president, whilst former president Refik Halili and Lulzim Morina were also <b>co-donors</b> during the 2013-14 season, and they were able to bring in some new players ahead of the season. Despite the collective efforts of Babasi, Halili and Morina to build a squad days {{before the start of the}} season, the club made a poor start to the campaign which led to the departure of head coach Dede, who was replaced by Alpin Gallo, who himself lasted only 5 games before being fired. The board opted for an experienced head coach and hired Gugash Magani, who was given the task of avoiding relegation, which is something the club had never experienced. Magani succeeded in keeping the club up as they finished 6th in what is considered to be one of the worst seasons in the club's history.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} years, many studies {{reported}} on the antioxidant effects of ferulic acid (FA) in preclinical models of dementia through the activation of the heme oxygenase/biliverdin reductase (HO/BVR) system. However, only a few studies evaluated whether FA could improve neurological function under milder conditions, such as psychological stress. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of FA (150 mg/kg intraperitoneal route) on cognitive function in male Wistar rats exposed to emotional arousal. Animals were randomly assigned to two experimental groups, namely not habituated or habituated to the experimental context, and the novel object recognition test was used to evaluate their cognitive performance. The administration of FA significantly increased long-term retention memory in not habituated rats. Ferulic acid increased the expression of HO- 1 in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of not habituated rats only, whereas HO- 2 resulted differently modulated in these cognitive brain areas. No significant effects on either HO- 1 or HO- 2 or BVR were observed in the cerebellum of both habituated and not habituated rats. Ferulic acid activated the stress axis in not habituated rats, as shown by the increase in hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone levels. Pre-treatment with Sn-protoporphyrin-IX [0. 25 μmol/kg, intracerebroventricular route (i. c. v.) ], a well-known inhibitor of HO activity through which carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin (BV) are generated, abolished the FA-induced improvement of cognitive performance only in not habituated rats, suggesting a role for HO-derived by-products. The <b>CO-donor</b> tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) (30 nmol/kg i. c. v.) mimicked the FA-related improvement of cognitive skills only in not habituated rats, whereas BV did not have any effect in any group.

40|$|Heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), an {{inducible}} enzyme up-regulated in Alzheimer’s disease, catabolises heme to biliverdin, Fe 2 + and carbon monoxide (CO). CO can protect neurones from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by inhibiting Kv 2. 1 channels, which mediates cellular K+ efflux {{as an early}} step in the apoptotic cascade. Since apoptosis contributes to the neuronal loss associated with amyloid β peptide (Aβ) toxicity in AD, we investigated the protective effects of HO- 1 and CO against Aβ 1 - 42 toxicity in SH-SY 5 Y cells, employing cells stably transfected with empty vector or expressing the cellular prion protein, PrPc, and rat primary hippocampal neurons. Aβ 1 - 42 (containing protofibrils) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability, attributable {{at least in part}} to induction of apoptosis, with the PrPc-expressing cells showing greater susceptibility to Aβ 1 - 42 toxicity. Pharmacological induction or genetic over-expression of HO- 1 significantly ameliorated the effects of Aβ 1 - 42. The <b>CO-donor</b> CORM- 2 protected cells against Aβ 1 - 42 toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. Electrophysiological studies revealed no differences in the outward current pre- and post-Aβ 1 - 42 treatment suggesting that K+ channel activity is unaffected in these cells. Instead, Aβ toxicity was reduced by the L-type Ca 2 + channel blocker nifedipine, and by the CaMKKII inhibitor, STO- 609. Aβ also activated the downstream kinase, AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). CO prevented this activation of AMPK. Our findings indicate that HO- 1 protects against Aβ toxicity via production of CO. Protection does not arise from inhibition of apoptosis-associated K+ efflux, but rather by inhibition of AMPK activation, which has been recently implicated in the toxic effects of Aβ. These data provide a novel, beneficial effect of CO which adds to its growing potential as a therapeutic agent...|$|E
40|$|Besides nitric oxide, carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) also activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). CO {{as well as}} the <b>CO-donor</b> CORM- 2 have been shown to possess vasodilatory properties. Whether these vasodilatory properties by CO can be attributed to sGC activation is still a matter of debate. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the involvement of sGC and its different subunits in CO and CORM- 2 induced vasodilatation within different vascular tissues. Isometric tension recordings were performed using mice isolated aortic rings, femoral artery ring segments as well as corpora cavernosa (CC). To be able to distinguish between the different sGC subunits we evaluated responses to saturated CO solutions and CORM- 2 in both sGCa 1 -/- and sGCβ 1 KI/KI mice and their wild-type controls. Saturated CO solution was unable to relax mice isolated blood vessels, whereas it induced concentration-dependent relaxations in mice CC. In CC of wild-type mice, the response to CO was completely inhibited by the sGC inhibitor ODQ. The involvement of sGC in the CO-induced corporal relaxation was further confirmed by the loss of response to CO in CC isolated from sGCβ 1 KI/KI mice. Moreover, the vasodilatory responses of CO in the corporal tissue of sGCa 1 -/- mice were strongly inhibited although not completely abolished. In contrast to CO, CORM- 2 was able to relax all vascular tissues examined in the present study, although ODQ only partially blocked the response to CORM- 2 in the aorta. Interestingly ODQ did not affect the CORM- 2 induced relaxation in the femoral arteries and the CC, indicating that sGC is not involved, which was confirmed using the transgenic mice. This study clearly illustrates that the molecular mechanism of CORM- 2 induced vasorelaxation differs from that of CO induced vasorelaxation. While the CO induced vasorelaxation depends on activation of sGC, primarily the sGCa 1 β 1 heterodimer, the vasorelaxing properties of CORM- 2 are only partially dependent or even completely independent upon sGC activation. The observation that CO is more effective in relaxing CC tissues than other cardiovascular tissues investigated in the present study suggests that the heme-oxygenase/CO pathway may present a potential new target for therapeutic approaches towards erectile dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Transition metal {{complexes}} {{are widely}} used as homogeneous catalysts mediating a variety of organic reactions, such as s-bond activation/formation, regio-/ enantio-selective reactions, oxygen transfer, homo-/co-polymerization, etc. Among miscellaneous supporting ligands, bidentate ligands bearing a sulfonate donor have drawn considerable attention. Phosphine sufonate ligands have been successfully developed for neutral palladium alkyls that promote incorporation of polar vinyl monomers into polyethylene chains producing highly linear copolymers. In the past decade, extensively investigated sulfonate ligands are mainly three types, phosphine-sulfonate, NHC-sulfonate, and olate-sulfonate. Phosphine-sulfonate ligands support palladium(II) for catalysis of ethylene copolymerization with polar vinyl monomers. They also support ruthenium(II) and (IV) forming complexes that are catalysts in regioselective alkylation reactions. NHC-sulfonate ligands form copper(I) complexes promoting asymmetric conjugate addition with high enantioselectivity. One olate-sulfonate ligand is known. It can stabilize Ru(II) to form a Ru(II) alkenylidene complex to perform ring closure metathesis (RCM). The literature has shown that sulfonate ligands have unique catalytic properties. Pursuing enhanced donor capability and tunable electronic and steric properties while retaining the unique catalytic properties of the sulfonate donor, we have developed a series of phosphinimine-sulfonate ligands which employ phosphinimine as a <b>co-donor.</b> The phosphinimine-sulfonate ligands are synthesized in their zwitterionic forms from commercially available toluidine-sufonic acid and in 7 steps. The synthetic steps include chlorination of sulfonic acid, formation of alkyl sulfonate esters, diazotization of amines, azidation of diazonium salts, formation of phosphazene group via Staudinger reaction, and protonation-deprotection of the phosphazene. The zwitterionic ligands are air-stable and convenient for creation of a ligand library. The desired anionic ligands can be readily generated by deprotonation with sodium hydride. Phosphinimine-sulfonate ligands show good coordination ability with palladium precursors such as (cod) PdMeCl or Py 2 PdMeCl to form corresponding palladium methyl complexes. Palladium methyl complexes containing triphenyl, methyldiphenyl, di-n-butylphenyl, and tri-n-butylphosphinimine-sulfonate ligands have been synthesized. A thermal behavior study of the synthesized palladium methyl complexes showed that 2, 6 -positions of the phosphiniminobenzene rings are subjected to orthopalladation. An ethylene reactivity test showed that phosphinimine sulfonate palladium methyl complexes can oligomerize ethylene forming alkanes and are catalyst candidates for polymerization. A study on the introduction of ortho-bulky groups to maintain proper steric properties required for blocking axial faces of the palladium 2 ̆ 7 s coordination plane in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization {{will be required to}} develop the phosphinimine motif further...|$|E
40|$|The wall {{painting}} on the façades of St. Nicholas in Ljuboten near Skopje, the endowment of 'Lady Danica', a noblewoman {{in the time of}} King Dušan, was destroyed in 1928, during the restoration of the church. Evidence of the appearance of the hitherto unnoticed decoration on the western facade and the southern entrance can be seen on glass plates in the Photograph Collection of the National Museum in Belgrade. When the photographs Nos. 1438, 1444 and 1567 were taken, the {{painting on}} the Ljuboten church façades, although damaged or washed away, was still partly visible. On the western façade it extended in three zones (the socle, the standing figures and the busts) across the entire façade and from the ground to the porch, the roof of which stood {{at the foot of the}} western wall archivolt, while the ornamentation of the southern façade covered the lunette above the entrance and its archivolt. Although in 1925, the painting did not contain a single legible signature or physiognomy, thematically, the outer ornamentation of Ljuboten is essentially clear. The bust of the Mother of God with the infant Christ, facing south, was in the centre of the compositional focus of the western façade. Three figures stood on the left and on the right sides of the portal, one on each of the pilasters, and one monumental figure in each of two niches. From the south, a church hierarch, with short, curly beard, was moving in a stooping position towards the Mother of God. He, certainly, could be identified as the patron of the church, St. Nicholas. The saint raises his right hand in a gesture of exhortation. Behind him, a figure in monastic habit was painted. This person holds a model of the church in the left hand, with the right hand in a gesture of prayer. Undoubtedly, it was the donatrix of the church painted here. As opposed to the figures in the southern part of the western façade, those in the northern part were facing forward. We recognized a saint on the pilaster beside the entrance, by the traces of his robes, but this was insufficient for establishing what category of saints he belongs; there was a standing image of a holy warrior in a niche, clad in a tunic and cloak, while the outermost northern pilaster was occupied by the image of a holy martyr. Evidence of the zone of the busts (between the figures and the roof) is to be seen only fragmentarily (above the figure of the patron) with the traces of clothing that was typical for martyrs. The depictions in the lunette and in the niches were framed by ornamental bands but it is not known what the socle looked like. Above the southern entrance there was a bust of St. Nicholas, recognizable by the remains of presentations of Christ and the Mother of God, who, on the images of this saint, were holding out a Gospel and an omophorion to this courageous hierarch. The painting of external façades was a widely cultivated feature in the region of Macedonia, from the twelfth century at the very latest. According to the volume of façade surfaces covered with frescoes, Ljuboten belongs to the churches in which ornamentation of this kind occupied a significant place. In keeping with a practice that had been cultivated for centuries, the painter chose the façades that had an entrance and portals as the basis for his painting, and as the starting point for the gradation of themes according to their importance. The frescoes on the west façade, where it concerns the position of the details in the whole, follow a program topology that is typical of the external ornamentation of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The entrance to the church was already reserved in the time of Constantine the Great, for the visualization of the religious and legal aspects of the donor's undertaking. The general features of the art of this epoch included also the donor's portrait supraporta. Positioned in such a way for the merits of the founder already to be visible on entering the churchyard, the portrait of Lady Danica, both in terms of its structure and its place in the whole - thanks to the symbolism of the entrance - placed the eschatological meaning of φιλοκτεσια in the foreground. Owing to the condition in which it existed before its destruction, the fresco {{painting on the}} western façade does not offer much material for an iconographical analysis. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to note that, in conceptualizing the composition of the donor, the painter decided on a formula of modesty and praesentatio, less frequently practiced in the fourteenth century, and that in depicting the donatrix, he opted for a symbiosis of the motive of supplication and guiding by the hand, retaining from the previous model, the position of the model of the endowment, and finally, in writing out the inscription, he used 'cartouches', combining, like some contemporaries, tabulae and circular 'shields'. In terms of style, the façade frescoes (the shallow volume, broad forms, soft, languid lines and the mild contrast) are linked with the younger layer of fresco paintings of the Ljuboten interior (1343 - 1345), attributed to the fresco painters of Mateič and Dradnja. The article systematically explains the dating of the younger paintings of the church of St. Nicholas, and suggests a more precise time frame for its creation, in the years 1343 - 1344, expressing the conviction that the façade was painted during the same campaign, just before the task was completed in the naos. As for the history of Ljuboten, the fresco painting on the west façade is the only proper addition to the data offered by the inscription carved on the lintel of the western portal. The fact that the credit for building the church is attributed only to one member of the donor's family in the time of decorating the lower zones of the naos with frescoes, most clearly supports the conclusion that the portrait of the Lady Danica stood in the southern niche. A detail of importance for prosopographic research is provided by the robes of the prudent donatrix. Lady Danica took the veil at some time between 1336 / 1337, when the inscription was carved above the entrance, and the painting of the western façade (1343 - 1345). Today, unfortunately, we do not know whether the founders of the church building also financed the painting of her endowment. In searching for the reasons why the work on the decoration of the church was suspended, the author considers that the reasons for the interruption must have been serious. He believes that the work was suspended due to events in the donatrix's life, perhaps as a result of her death (already in her mature years at the time when the church was built), which would mean, consequently, that the noblewoman Danica only financed the first phase of the church's painting works. Who - if this were so - would be the donor of the younger part of paintings? In the absence of proof that would provide the right answer, the author returns to the thesis of I. M. Djordjević, according to which the monogram Dmitar, carved into the lower side of the lintel on the western entrance, reveals in fact the name of the younger son of Lady Danica, the <b>co-donor</b> of his mother at the time when the building was erected. This name is concealed on the inscription from the face of the mentioned lintel ('other son'). For Dmitar, the care taken to complete the task of painting the frescoes would be the resumption of an endeavour that had been undertaken much earlier. In support of this would be the fact that a holy warrior was painted in the northern niche, as the counterpart of the donatrix. The appearance of a saint of this type in such an important place in the fresco decoration of the noblewoman's endowment would primarily reflect the social status of the donor's family, but - due to the frequent coincidence of the name of the client and his protector - one cannot neglect the possibility, either, that it was connected with the person from the monogram, i. e. that St. Demetrius was standing opposite the donatrix. It would also indicate that this choice of saint in the northern niche served as testimony of the participation of the 'other son' in the decoration of his mother's endowment. ...|$|E
