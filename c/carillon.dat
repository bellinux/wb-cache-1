5|$|A 2-octave Schulmerich {{electronic}} <b>carillon</b> {{of twenty-five}} bells {{was installed in}} the tower in June 1958. It was played from the organ console by a carillonneur on Sunday mornings before and after services, {{as well as on}} special occasions, such as Christmas Eve and as part of the traditional noontime nationwide peal of church bells on the Fourth of July. Hymns were also played daily on the <b>carillon</b> by a music roll until it was discontinued in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of <b>Carillon,</b> {{also known}} as the 1758 Battle of Ticonderoga, was fought on July 8, 1758, during the French and Indian War (which was part of the global Seven Years' War). It was fought near Fort <b>Carillon</b> (now known as Fort Ticonderoga) on the shore of Lake Champlain in the {{frontier}} area between the British colony of New York and the French colony of New France.|$|E
5|$|The Rizal Centenary <b>Carillon,</b> {{built in}} 1996, {{is named after}} Philippine National Hero José Rizal. It has 37 bells ranging from F three octaves below middle C up to G above middle C, making it the second largest {{non-traditional}} <b>carillon</b> in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of number of bells. It {{is one of only}} two non-traditional carillons in the Philippines.|$|E
50|$|As {{interest}} in <b>carillons</b> increased, Johan Eijsbouts purchased bells from two English foundries, John Taylor Bellfounders and Gillett & Johnston, and installed them in <b>carillons.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Carillons</b> with between 23 and 27 bells are {{referred}} to as two-octave <b>carillons.</b> Players of these instruments often use music arranged specifically for their limited range of notes.|$|R
50|$|Early {{automated}} <b>carillons</b> used electric timers {{that simply}} played selected bell strikes or tunes. Modern computerized <b>carillons</b> can {{be programmed to}} play selections for Easter, {{as well as other}} fixed and movable holidays.|$|R
5|$|The {{clock and}} <b>carillon</b> (bell tower) of 23 bells was erected in 1922, {{the same year}} as Lutyens' memorial, on the corn {{exchange}} in the town centre. Three of the bells were inscribed with names of casualties from the war, chosen to represent all of Spalding's war dead, while others were inscribed with names of those involved in the commemorations. The corn exchange was demolished in 1972 and replaced with the South Holland Centre, an arts venue, with the clock and <b>carillon</b> re-housed in a tower on the roof. After refurbishment of the South Holland Centre in 1998, a new glass tower was built to house the clock and <b>carillon</b> after the bells were cleaned. On Armistice Day (11 November) 1998, the Western Front Association unveiled a plaque on the South Holland Centre to explain the significance of the clock tower.|$|E
5|$|Lake Burley Griffin {{contains}} six islands, three unnamed small {{islands and}} three larger named islands. Of the larger islands, Aspen Island {{is located in}} Central Basin while Springbank and Spinnaker Island {{are located in the}} West Lake. Aspen Island is connected to dry land by a footbridge, and is the site of the Australian National <b>Carillon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lake Burley Griffin is {{the site}} of the Captain James Cook Memorial and the National <b>Carillon.</b> Other sites of {{interest}} include the Telstra Tower, the Australian National Botanic Gardens, the National Zoo and Aquarium, the National Dinosaur Museum and Questacon – the National Science and Technology Centre.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carillons</b> was {{composed}} by Grace Williams for oboe and symphony orchestra (but without woodwind instruments) in 1965 {{in response to}} a request from the BBC for a light, entertaining piece. <b>Carillons</b> originally included three movements but Williams revised the work in 1973, adding a fourth movement.|$|R
5|$|Montcalm and Vaudreuil, {{who did not}} {{get along}} with each other, {{differed}} {{on how to deal}} with the British threat. They had fewer than 5,000 regular troops, an estimated six thousand militia men, and a limited number of Indian allies, to bring against British forces reported to number 50,000. Vaudreuil, who had limited combat experience, wanted to divide the French forces, with about 5,000 each at <b>Carillon</b> and Louisbourg, and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the British in the Mohawk River on the northwestern frontiers of the Province of New York. Montcalm believed this to be folly, as the plan would enable the British to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the French attack. Vaudreuil prevailed, and in June 1758 Montcalm left Quebec for <b>Carillon.</b>|$|E
5|$|News of {{the battle}} was {{received}} in England shortly after news {{of the fall of}} Louisbourg, putting a damper on the celebrations marking that victory. The full scope of British victories in 1758 did not reach English shores until later in the year, when Pitt learned of the successes at Forts Duquesne and Frontenac, key steps in completing the conquest of New France. Had <b>Carillon</b> also fallen in 1758, the conquest might have been completed in 1758 or 1759; as it happened, Montreal (the last point of resistance) did not surrender until 1760, with campaigns launched from Fort Oswego, Quebec, and <b>Carillon,</b> which was captured and renamed Ticonderoga in 1759 by forces under the command of Jeffrey Amherst, the victor at Louisbourg.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 1758, James Abercromby {{attacked}} Fort <b>Carillon</b> on Lake Champlain, but was repelled {{with heavy}} losses. In August, Montgomery and the 17th foot sailed to Boston, marched {{to join with}} Abercromby's forces in Albany and then moved to Lake George. On November 9, Abercromby was recalled; Amherst replaced him as commander-in-chief. The British high command, for the 1759 campaign, developed {{a plan for a}} three-pronged attack into Canada, in which forces including the 17th foot would assault Fort <b>Carillon</b> and also capture Fort St. Frédéric, near Crown Point, New York. Under Amherst's command, Montgomery and the 17th Foot participated in the capture of Fort <b>Carillon.</b> While the army was gathering prior to the battle, Montgomery's company was on guard duty; he ordered his men to remain vigilant for French and Indian ambush parties. On May 9 his suspicions proved correct when 12 men from the 17th were attacked. Montgomery and the 17th met stiff resistance at first. Montgomery ordered that his men were not to fire at night, fearing they would shoot their comrades. On July 21, the army began its movement toward Fort Carillon; by the 26th they were in position outside the fort's walls, from which the French had already withdrawn most of their forces to Fort St. Frédéric. That night, after some exchange of cannon fire during the day, the French blew up Carillon's powder magazine, and Fort St. Frédéric the next day, and withdrew {{to the far end of}} Lake Champlain.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions of}} both commanders have been {{extensively}} analyzed in this action. While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some tactical options escaped his notice, {{and some of}} his actions in preparing the defenses at <b>Carillon</b> are open to question. In contrast, almost everything Abercrombie did has been questioned. It is widely held among historians that he was an incompetent commander.|$|E
5|$|The clock {{faces on}} the tower were {{added in the}} 1920s, {{possibly}} around the time the <b>carillon</b> was added. The 1897 image of the city hall above shows the tower without the clock faces (though the stonework shows obvious intent to have clock faces installed). City hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1972.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the operas, recordings have been issued of several orchestral works, including the ballet Le <b>carillon,</b> the piano concerto in E, the Fantaisie for cello and orchestra, and orchestral suites. Many individual mélodies by Massenet were included in mixed recitals on record during the 20th century, and more have been committed to disc since then, including, for the first time, a CD in 2012, exclusively devoted to his songs for soprano and piano.|$|E

5|$|M. de Rouilly, {{the leader}} of the supply convoy Rogers had intercepted, {{returned}} to <b>Carillon</b> and alerted Paul-Louis de Lusignan, the fort's commander. According to Lusignan's report, he immediately sent out a party of about 90 regulars from the Languedoc regiment under the command of Capitaine de Basserode, accompanied by about 90 Canadian militia and Indians. The Indians were primarily Ottawa under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade, one of the French-Indian leaders at Braddock's defeat in 1755.|$|E
5|$|On January 21, 1757, Captain Robert Rogers and {{a band of}} his rangers were on a {{scouting}} expedition near Fort <b>Carillon</b> on Lake Champlain {{when they}} were ambushed by a mixed troop of French regulars, Canadien militiamen, and Indians. The fighting ended when darkness set in, with significant casualties on both sides. The French in their reports claimed the British had a distinct advantage due to their snowshoes.|$|E

5|$|Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, {{in command}} of Fort <b>Carillon</b> prior to Montcalm's arrival, knew by June 23 that a major British {{offensive}} was about to begin. He had sent a messenger bearing a letter from Vaudreuil to Abercrombie (part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders) on June 10, expecting him to return; {{the fact that the}} British held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the British camp. Bourlamaque increased scouting activities, and learned from captured British scouts the approximate size of the British force.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms of Abercrombie {{begin with}} his {{reliance}} on relatively poor intelligence. Reports reached {{him that the}} French strength at <b>Carillon</b> was 6,000, and that a further 3,000 were expected. Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives, and Abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry. Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm. The same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort, a sign that a siege would have ended quickly.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, two {{tourist attractions}} {{were added to}} the middle of Central Basin. The Captain James Cook Memorial was built by the {{government}} to commemorate the Bicentenary of (then Lieutenant) James Cook's first sighting of the east coast of Australia. It includes a water jet fountain located in the central basin (based on the Jet d'eau in Geneva) and a skeleton globe sculpture at Regatta Point showing the paths of Cook's expeditions. On 25 April 1970, Queen Elizabeth II officially inaugurated the memorial. As part of the same ceremony, Queen Elizabeth also opened the National <b>Carillon</b> on Aspen Island, a set of 53 bronze bells donated by the British Government to commemorate the city's 50th anniversary.|$|E
