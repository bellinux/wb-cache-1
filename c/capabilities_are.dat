5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host. Similar reduced metabolic <b>capabilities</b> <b>are</b> seen in endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E

25|$|Disparities {{in housing}} explain {{variations}} in the conversion of income into human capabilities over differing social climates. Put more simply; income does not always translate to desirable outcomes like healthcare, education, and happiness. The quality of one's housing is one factor that determines if such <b>capabilities</b> <b>are</b> readily available to an individual. The economist and philosopher Amartya Sen reasons that a person's available freedoms, or <b>capabilities,</b> <b>are</b> significant indicators {{of the kind of}} life one values or has reason to value. As economic equality varies between economic systems, historical periods, societies so do the housing inequality.|$|E
