5|$|On {{the right}} of the Union line, three regiments of Cutler's brigade were fired on by Davis's brigade before they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> {{position}} on the ridge. Davis's line overlapped {{the right of}} Cutler's, making the Union position untenable, and Wadsworth ordered Cutler's regiments back to Seminary Ridge. The commander of the 147th New York, Lt. Col. Francis C. Miller, was shot before he could inform his troops of the withdrawal, and they remained to fight under heavy pressure until a second order came. In under 30 minutes, 45% of Gen. Cutler's 1,007 men became casualties, with the 147th losing 207 of its 380 officers and men. Some of Davis's victorious men turned toward the Union positions south of the railroad bed while others drove east toward Seminary Ridge. This defocused the Confederate effort north of the pike.|$|E

25|$|The {{attack by}} the 180th and 179th Brigades (60th Division) and the 31st Brigade (10th Division) on the Kauwukah and Rusdi systems of trenches, {{on the western side}} of the railway, began after the 74th (Yeomanry) Division {{captured}} the railway. Seeing a number of Ottoman soldiers retiring, Brigadier General Fitz J. M. Edwards (commanding 179th Brigade) ordered the attack to be launched at 13:35, before the 180th Brigade <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> position, so the 179th Brigade suffered heavy artillery and machine gun fire. The 2/18th and 2/19th Battalions, London Regiment (180th Brigade) and the 2/13th and 2/16th Battalions, London Regiment (179th Brigade) launched the attack, with one additional brigade in close support.|$|E
25|$|After {{he learned}} that the Army and Navy flying schools were not taking any {{candidates}} the year he graduated from high school, he decided to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. Cooper left for MCRD Parris Island as soon as he graduated. However, World War II had ended before he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> combat. He was assigned then to the Naval Academy Preparatory School and was an alternate for an appointment to Annapolis, Maryland. The man who was the primary appointee made the grade so Cooper was reassigned in the Marines on guard duty in Washington, D.C. He was serving with the Presidential Honor Guard in Washington when he was released from duty along with other Marine reservists.|$|E
25|$|That changed, however, {{in early}} February 1862. In a battle fought on 7–8 February, the joint {{operation}} of a Union Army division under Major General Ambrose E. Burnside and a naval flotilla under Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough captured Roanoke Island, a position in Croatan Sound that had previously shielded the sounds from Federal encroachment. Earlier, Union ships trying to enforce the blockade on the canals {{would have had to}} enter Pamlico Sound through Hatteras Inlet, then pass several Confederate batteries on Roanoke Island before they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Albemarle Sound. With the elimination of the batteries, however, all that stood {{in the way of the}} Union Navy was the Mosquito Fleet of the Confederate States Navy.|$|E

In 1773, Necker won the prize of the Académie Française for a defense of state corporatism framed as a eulogy in honor of Louis XIV's minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. In 1775, he published his Essai sur la législation et le commerce des grains, in which he attacked the free-trade policy of Turgot.

25|$|Redi {{took six}} jars and divided them {{into two groups}} of three: In one experiment, in the first jar of each group, he put an unknown object; in the second, a dead fish; in the last, a raw chunk of veal.

After several days, he saw maggots appear on the objects in the open jars, on which flies had been able to land, but not in the gauze-covered jars. In the second experiment, meat was kept in three jars. One of the jars was {{uncovered}}, and two of the jars were covered, one with cork and the other one with gauze. Flies could only enter the uncovered jar, and in this, maggots appeared. In the jar that was covered with gauze, maggots appeared on the gauze but did not survive.|$|E

25|$|The 1965 Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway {{was one of}} {{the wildest}} races in NASCAR history. Rookie driver Buren Skeen died after two cars ran into the side of his car in the early laps. Sam McQuagg was leading the race, when Cale Yarborough tried to muscle past McQuagg for the lead. Yarborough flew over the guardrail, rolled around six times, and ended {{up at the end of}} the parking lot by a light post. Yarborough waved to the crowd as he walked back to the pits. A video clip of the wreck was used on ABC's Wide World of Sports for several years. With 44 laps left, Fred Lorenzen and Darel Dieringer were {{fighting}} for the lead far ahead of Jarrett. Lorenzen's motor expired, and even before he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the pits Dieringer's motor started smoking too. Dieringer continued at a slower pace to finish third.

25|$|After {{extensive}} and complex arrangements {{to support the}} infantry advance, the 60th (2/2nd London) and the 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions were to attack Beersheba from the west, while the Anzac Mounted Division with the Australian Mounted Division in reserve attacked the town from the east, after riding between 25 to 35 miles (40 to 56km) to circle around Beersheba. The infantry attacks began with a bombardment and the capture of Hill 1070 which enabled the guns to move forward to target the trenches defending Beersheba. Intense hand to hand fighting continued until 13:30 when the Ottoman trench line {{on the western side}} of Beersheba, was captured. Meanwhile Anzac Mounted Division advanced circling Beersheba, to cut the road north to Hebron and Jerusalem to prevent reinforcement and retreat from Beersheba, and launched their attack on Tel el Saba. The strongly entrenched defenders on Tel el Saba were initially attacked by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, but by 10:00 they had been reinforced by the 1st Light Horse Brigade. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Australian Mounted Division) was later ordered to reinforce the Anzac Mounted Division's attack on this Ottoman position, but before they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> position a general attack began at 14:05, resulting in the capture of Tel el Saba at 15:00.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May a Bristol Bombay crashed {{near the}} airfield. It was {{carrying}} spare parts and their loss effected the squadrons operational readiness, leaving {{most of the}} squadron grounded. Later that day Carey conducted a lone patrol to Lille and Douai and spotted three unescorted He 111s but all were shot down by another squadron before he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> position. In the afternoon, in the same sector, he dispatched a Stab./KG 54 (Command squadron) He 111. Three airmen were captured and two were killed. On the ground the situation was rapidly deteriorating in Belgium. Belgian border defences were breached by 11 May and German forces were advancing on Hannut and Gembloux. On 12 May 3 Squadron flew air superiority support for the French 1st Army at the Battle of Hannut (12 May–14 May). Carey flew four missions—his first in the Battle of Belgium. Hew flew one over Hannut where the squadron met heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire but no enemy aircraft. Another patrol over Louvain yielded the same result. On a later sortie, south of Brussels, 3 Squadron intercepted 12 He 111s and Carey claimed one destroyed and one probably destroyed. 3 Squadron lost Flying Officer D Ball. Ball was probably shot down by a Bf 109 from Jagdgeschwader 21 and died of his wounds in a German hospital.|$|E

25|$|After Chickamauga, the Army of Tennessee besieged the Union army in Chattanooga, {{taking up}} {{defensive}} {{positions on the}} surrounding hills, especially on Missionary Ridge, which formed the Confederate center, and Lookout Mountain on the Confederate left. Bragg considered a direct attack on the city too costly, {{and a lack of}} supplies and pontoons caused him to reject a plan to cross the river and break the Union supply line to Nashville. Instead he spread the Confederate army along the Tennessee River, cutting the Union railroad supply line into the city and reducing the amount of supplies the Union army <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the city. During the next several weeks, Bragg became embroiled with a dispute with the army's corps commanders. Bragg became involved in a personal dispute with Forrest, which led to Forrest being reassigned to Mississippi and West Tennessee, with his cavalry corps merged with Wheeler's corps. Meanwhile, Hill, Buckner, and Longstreet, along with several division commanders, signed a petition to Davis, asking that Bragg be relieved of command. After Davis rejected the petition, Bragg made several changes to the command structure of the army. Polk was relieved of command and was charged with disobedience during the Chickamauga campaign and failure to attack when ordered; instead of being court martialed, Polk was transferred to Mississippi and Hardee took command of the First Corps. Hill was also relieved of command and replaced by John C. Breckinridge; both the Third Corps and Reserve Corps were merged into the other two corps, with Buckner and Walker demoted to division command.|$|E
25|$|Freight and World War II traffic helped pay {{off some}} of the debt the SIRT had accumulated, briefly making the SIRT profitable. B freight trains {{operated}} to Staten Island, in addition to Jersey City. Around this time, B crews began running through without changing at different junctions. Regular B crews, and Staten Island crews were separated, meaning that the crews had to change before they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Staten Island. All traffic to and from Cranford Junction in New Jersey was handled by the SIRT crews. During the war, all east coast military hospital trains were handled by the SIRT–the trains came onto Staten Island via Cranford Junction, with some trains stopping at Arlington to transfer wounded soldiers to a large military hospital. The Baltimore & New York Railway line become extremely busy between Cranford Junction and the Arthur Kill, with troop movements, prisoner-of-war trains and war material operating over this stretch to get to their appointed destinations. Two B subsidiaries, the B and the Staten Island Rapid Transit, were merged on December 31, 1944. Since the Baltimore & New York Railway opened in 1890, the SIRT operated this line with locomotives belonging to itself and to its parent company, the B Around the time of the second World War, the B operated special trains for important officials. One special was operated for former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill. The train took him to Stapleton, from where he boarded a boat to cross the Atlantic. The SIRT made special accommodations for the trip, including a shined-up locomotive with sporting polished rods, white tires, and an engine crew clad in white uniforms.|$|E
