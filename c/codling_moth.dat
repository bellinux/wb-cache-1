5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the <b>codling</b> <b>moth,</b> among others.|$|E
5|$|The {{corn earworm}} {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest, with a large host range encompassing corn and many other crop plants. H. zea is the second-most important economic pest species in North America, next to the <b>codling</b> <b>moth.</b> The estimated annual cost of the damage is more than US$100 million, though expenditure on insecticide application has reached up to $250 million. The moth’s high fecundity, ability to lay between 500 and 3,000 eggs, polyphagous larval feeding habits, high mobility during migration, and a facultative pupal diapause {{have led to the}} success of this pest.|$|E

They were also shot on Lord Howe Island for attacking chickens. However, they are seen as beneficial in forestry as they consume phasmids, and also in agriculture for eating cocoons of the <b>codling</b> <b>moth.</b>|$|E

The insects were heated to four temperatures (461 C, 481 C, 501 C, and 521 C) held for predetermined periods followed by 24 h storage at 41 C before mortality evaluation. Thermal death kinetics for fifth-instar <b>codling</b> <b>moths</b> followed a 0. 5 th order of kinetic reaction.

No larval survival was observed in samples of 600 insects after exposure to 461 C, 481 C, 501 C, and 521 C for 50, 15, 5, and 2 min, respectively. Activation energy for thermal kill of fifth-instar <b>codling</b> <b>moths</b> at the heating rate of 181 Cmin 1 was estimated to be about 472 kJmol 1.

The <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> larvae consume the OB. Next the OB is degraded by the alkaline gut of the <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> larvae.

50|$|Palila also eat naio {{berries and}} other fruit (such as the {{introduced}} Cape gooseberry), and māmane flowers, buds, and young leaves. Additionally, they feed on caterpillars, {{particularly those of}} Cydia species (māmane <b>codling</b> <b>moths)</b> and more rarely on those of Uresiphita polygonalis virescens (māmane snout moth). These caterpillars {{as well as other}} insects, along with the very nutritious māmane seeds, provide the palila's main source of protein. Nestlings, apparently not yet able to cope with the amount of poison contained in the seeds, are fed to a large extent on Cydia caterpillars. These destroy or discard the māmane's toxins they take up with their food, so that the caterpillars themselves are non-toxic. They do contain high amounts of phenolic compounds they probably sequester from their food and quite likely taste as bad. Palila do not seem to mind the adverse taste or are physically unable to perceive it, given that they {{go to great lengths to}} obtain this food during breeding season.|$|R
5000|$|Frass is an {{informal}} term and accordingly it is variously used and variously defined. It {{is derived from}} the German Fraß, a past participle verbal noun of fressen, which means to gobble or to feed as an animal might. The English usage derives the idea of excrement from what larvae had eaten, and similarly also, the refuse left behind by insects. Such usage dates back to the mid nineteenth century. In modern technical English sources differ on the precise definition, though there is little actual direct contradiction. One glossary from the early 20th century speaks of [...] "...excrement; usually the excreted pellets of caterpillars." [...] In some contexts frass refers primarily to fine, masticated material, often powdery, that phytophagous insects pass as indigestible waste after they have processed plant tissues as well as their physiology would permit. Other common examples include the fecal material that insects such as the larvae of <b>codling</b> <b>moths</b> leave as they feed inside fruit, or that the likes of Terastia meticulosalis leave as they bore in the pith of Erythrina twigs, or the larvae of Cerambycidae or powder post beetles leave inside or below their tunnels when boring in solid or rotting wood.|$|R

However, {{beneficial}} effects of sugar feeding on moth fitness have not been demonstrated. Longevity, fecundity, and egg fertility were examined for female/male pairs of moths maintained with the following food regimens: water, sucrose water, honey water, apple juice, apple flesh, or starved, i. e., no food or water provided. Longevity and total fecundity were enhanced in all treatments relative to the starved treatment moths. Sucrose water, honey water, and apple juice treatments yielded the highest longevity, but total fecundity was highest for moths maintained on honey water or apple juice. Total egg fertility did not differ among treatments. However, egg fertility declined more gradually over the female lifespan for the three aqueous solution diets of sucrose water, honey water, and apple juice. Similarly, fecundity per day declined more gradually over time for honey water and apple juice treatments. Performance of moths maintained with apple flesh was generally intermediate between that of moths with water and the three aqueous solution treatments. This suggests that moths benefit from feeding on ripe apple flesh, although apple may {{be more difficult to}} ingest or its nutrients less concentrate...|$|R

Populations were classified as either unsprayed or sprayed. The ranges of enzyme activities across field populations varied 15 -fold, 485 -fold and fourfold for GST, MFO and EST, respectively. MFO was the only enzyme whose activity differed in 1 binomial classification of orchards based on their spray history. Few differences in enzyme activities were found due to sex among populations; and, in these cases, males had higher GST and lower MFO and EST activities than females. Activities of the three enzymatic systems across all Populations were positively correlated. Populations from Greece, Argentina and Uruguay had significant percentages of moths with elevated GST and MFO activities.

40|$|Flight mills {{have often}} been used to detect the effects of {{treatment}} on the flight ability of insects in the laboratory (Henneberry et al., 1968; Skelton and Hunter, 1970; Rowley, 1970; and others), but only {{few studies have been}} concerned with the effects of gamma irradiation on insect flight. In one of the earliest studies, Shepard et al., (1968) reported that the flight of 3 to 4 -day-old adult fall armyworms, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), treated with 40 krad as 6 -day-old pupae, was reduced in regard to sustained and total flight times, distances, and peak velocities; also males flew less readily than females. Likewise, Noblet et al., (1968) found that 2 -, 5 -, and 10 -day-old secondary screwworm flies, Cochliomyia macellaria (F.), irradiated with 25 krad as 5 -day-old pupae (ca. 5. 6 X greater than the normal dose required to produce 100 % sterility) had reduced total and sustained flight distances and spent less time in flight. In contrast, White et al., (unpublished data) reported enhanced (but not significantly different) flight by male <b>codling</b> <b>moths,</b> Laspeyresia pomonella (L.), treated with 30 krad. Also, the flight of house flies,Musca domestica L., treated as 5 -day-old pupae with 4. 5 and 7. 0 R was not adversely affected when they were tested 2, 5, and 10 days after eclosion (Shepardet al., 1972). Moreover, flight mill research with irradiated oriental fruit flies, Dacus dorsalis Hendel, treated with 10 krad (the sterilizing dose) revealed reduced flight velocities by 16 -day-old males but enhanced flight times and distances by 12 -day-old females (Sharp, unpublished data). We therefore made a more intensive study of the potential effects of irradia tion on fruit flies by doubling the dose applied to D. dorsalis and by studying the effect of 10 krad (sterilizing dose) on Mediterranean fruit flies, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). !Diptera: Tephritidae. 2 Published with the approval of the Director of the Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Statio...|$|R
