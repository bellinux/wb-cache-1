40|$|With US {{trade and}} current account deficits {{approaching}} 6 % of GDP, {{some have argued}} that the country is "on the comfortable path to ruin" and that the required "adjustment'' may be painful. We suggest instead that things are fine: although national saving is low, the ratios of household and <b>consolidated</b> <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> to GDP remain high. In our view, the most striking features of the world at present are the low rates of investment and growth in some of the richest countries, whose surpluses account for about half of the US deficit. The result is that financial capital is flowing out of countries with low investment and growth and into the US and other fast-growing countries. Oil exporters account for much of the rest. ...|$|E

40|$|Going into retirement, near-retirees {{are looking}} at {{increased}} debt levels, which can offset any asset accumulations and reduce retirement income. By {{using data from the}} 2008 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), this study examines the debt and negative <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> of near-retirees. This study further investigates what factors are associated with the likelihood of holding consumer debt, holding mortgage debt, and holding home equity debt over holding no debt, and what factors are associated with the likelihood of holding negative <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> over holding a high level of <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> among near-retirees. The study sample includes 3, 745 individuals between the ages of 51 and 64. The results of the multinomial logistic regression analysis indicate that, all else being equal, human capital factors such as education, physical health problems, and depression symptoms {{play a significant role in}} predicting the likelihood of holding debt and negative <b>net</b> <b>worth.</b> In particular, education is positively associated with the likelihood of holding consumer, mortgage, and home equity debt over holding no debt, while it is negatively associated with the likelihood of having negative <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> over having a high level of <b>net</b> <b>worth.</b> Among the socioeconomic characteristics that influence the likelihood of near-retirees holding debt and negative <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> are household income, working in the labor force, and race. In particular, household income positively influences the likelihood of holding mortgage debt over holding no mortgage debt as well as the likelihood of holding home equity debt over holding no home equity debt. However, household income negatively influences the likelihood of having negative <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> over having a higher level of <b>net</b> <b>worth.</b> The findings of this study could help financial educators, financial planners, and policymakers understand the differences in human capital and socioeconomic characteristics of near-retirees who hold some levels of debt over no debt and who hold no <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> or a lower level of <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> over a higher level of <b>net</b> <b>worth.</b> This study concludes that it is important for professionals, consumer educators, and financial planners to provide those who hold higher levels of debt and lower levels of <b>net</b> <b>worth</b> with financial literacy education; therefore, these individuals might be able to attain economic well-being in retirement...|$|R
