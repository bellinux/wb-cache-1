5|$|The <b>corms</b> of the {{tuberous}} sundews {{native to}} Australia {{are considered a}} delicacy by the Australian Aborigines. Some of these <b>corms</b> were also used to dye textiles, while another purple or yellow dye was traditionally prepared in the Scottish Highlands using D. rotundifolia. A sundew liqueur is also still produced using a recipe from the 14th century. It is made using fresh leaves from mainly D. capensis, D. spatulata, and D. rotundifolia.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{typically}} {{includes a}} large variety of plants, and invertebrates and small mammals, {{as well as}} birds. The olive baboon eats leaves, grass, roots, bark, flowers, fruit, lichens, tubers, seeds, mushrooms, <b>corms,</b> and rhizomes. <b>Corms</b> and rhizomes are especially important in times of drought, because grass loses {{a great deal of}} its nutritional value. In dry, arid regions, such as the northeastern deserts, small invertebrates like insects, spiders, and scorpions fill out its diet.|$|E
5|$|Vegetative {{reproduction}} occurs {{naturally in}} some species that produce stolons or when roots {{come close to}} the surface of the soil. Older leaves that touch the ground may sprout plantlets. Pygmy sundews reproduce asexually using specialized scale-like leaves called gemmae. Tuberous sundews can produce offsets from their <b>corms.</b>|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} effect of <b>corm</b> density on yield and {{qualitative}} traits of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) under different biological and chemical nitrogen fertilizers, a factorial experiment based on completely randomized block design with 3 replications was done in 2014 at Shahr-e-Rey region (Ghomi Abad). The experimental factors were: <b>corm</b> density in 3 levels (60, 120 and 180 <b>corm</b> per square meter) and biological and chemical nitrogen fertilizers in 4 levels (without fertilizer application, 150 kg. ha- 1 of Urea, 5 L. ha- 1 of Nitroxin and 75 kg. ha- 1 of Urea + 5 L. ha- 1 of Nitroxin). The {{results indicated that the}} <b>corm</b> density affects number of daughter <b>corm,</b> fresh daughter <b>corm</b> weight, <b>corm</b> diameter, dry stigma and style weight, dry and fresh flower weight significantly. Mean comparisons also indicated that by increasing <b>corm</b> density from 6 o to 180, saffron dry yield of saffron improved by 2. 7 fold. However, increasing <b>corm</b> density reduced <b>corm</b> diameter, fresh <b>corm</b> daughter weight and their numbers per square meter. It can be concluded that nitroxin as an organic fertilizer, increases vegetative traits and saffron dry yield (stigma + style weight) to 2. 08 kg. ha- 1 and highly improves in qualitative traits like Safranal, Picrocrocin, and Crocin. It can be also said that combined use of nitroxin and urea would be an alternative method to reduce application of urea...|$|R
5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, <b>corms,</b> fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large flocks, {{particularly}} when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows. Some cockatoo {{species have been}} adversely affected by habitat loss, particularly from a shortage of suitable nesting hollows after large mature trees are cleared; conversely, some species have adapted well to human changes and are considered agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Saffron {{cultivation}} in Europe declined steeply {{following the}} fall of the Roman Empire. For several centuries thereafter, saffron cultivation was rare or non-existent throughout Europe. This was reversed when Moorish civilisation spread from North Africa to settle the Iberian peninsula as well as parts of France and southern Italy. One theory states that Moors reintroduced saffron <b>corms</b> to the region around Poitiers after they lost the Battle of Tours to Charles Martel in AD 732. Two centuries after their conquest of Spain, Moors planted saffron throughout the southern provinces of Andalucia, Castile, La Mancha, and Valencia.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{innovations}} {{have been documented}} by 170–160,000 {{years ago at the}} site of Pinnacle Point 13B on the southern Cape coast of South Africa. This includes the oldest confirmed evidence for the utilization of ochre and marine resources in the form of shellfish exploitation for food. Based on his analysis of the MSA bovid assemblage at Klasies, Milo reports MSA people were formidable hunters and that their social behavior patterns approached those of modern humans. Deacon maintains that the management of plant food resources through deliberate burning of the veld to encourage the growth of plants with <b>corms</b> or tubers in the southern Cape during the Howiesons Poort (c. 70–55 ka) is indicative of modern human behavior. A family basis to foraging groups, color symbolism and the reciprocal exchange of artifacts and the formal organization of living space are, he suggests, further evidence for modernity in the MSA.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{gene expression}} patterns that occur during taro <b>corm</b> development. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis identified several different prevalent proteins that accumulate during <b>corm</b> development. Microsequencing studies indicated {{that some of}} these proteins are related to taste-modifying proteins, such as curculin and miraculin, and proteins found in other storage organs, such as sporamin and the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor. A curculin-encoding cDNA clone, designated as TC 1, was identified that corresponds to a highly prevalent 1 -kb <b>corm</b> mRNA. The TC 1 mRNA accumulates during <b>corm</b> development, is more prevalent in <b>corm</b> apical than basal regions, and is either absent, or present at low concentrations, in other vegetative organs such as the leaf and root. In situ hybridization experiments showed that the TC 1 mRNA is highly concentrated in <b>corm</b> storage parenchyma cells and is absent, or present in reduced concentrations, in other <b>corm</b> cells and tissues. Our results show that <b>corm</b> development is associated with the differentiation of specialized cells and tissues, and that these differentiation events are coupled with the temporal and spatial expression of corm-specific genes...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} Investigation some soil {{characteristics}} and filed age effects on flower and <b>corm</b> yield of saffron, an experiment was conducted as factorial based on complete randomized design with five replications in two regions of Neyshabur during growing season 2009 - 2010. Treatments were included different filed ages (2, 4 and 6 years) and two geographical regions (Eshagh abad and Soltan abad). Different {{characteristics such as}} fresh and dry weight of <b>corm,</b> <b>corm</b> number, number of <b>corm</b> sprout and flower and stigma yield of saffron were determined. Soil physical and chemical characteristics such as soil texture, pH and EC were measured. Results showed that effect of filed age on all characteristics was statistically significant. Flower and stigma yield were affected by region and filed age and region interaction significantly. Positive significant regression was shown between field age and parameters such as fresh and dry weight of <b>corm,</b> number of <b>corm</b> sprout and <b>corm</b> number. With increasing field age to 4 years, saffron yield increased and then decreased.

5|$|Saffron {{made its}} way to the New World when {{thousands}} of Alsatian, German, and Swiss Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled religious persecution in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after <b>corms</b> were first brought to Americain a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany. Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold.|$|E
5|$|This {{trend was}} {{documented}} by the Dean of Manchester, Reverend William Herbert. He collected samples and compiled information on {{many aspects of}} the saffron crocus. He was concerned about the steady decline in saffron cultivation {{over the course of the}} 17th century and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution; the introduction in Europe of easily grown maize and potatoes, which steadily took over lands formerly flush with <b>corms,</b> did not help. In addition, the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such intriguing new arrivals as chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla. Only in the south of France or in Italy and Spain, where the saffron harvest was culturally primal, did significant cultivation prevail.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for edible fruit, nuts, stems, leaves, <b>corms,</b> and tubers, {{scavenged}} for dead animals and hunted living ones for food. Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing {{is thought to be}} the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed. While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{was aimed at}} revealing the chlorophyll content, leaf area (the plant characters), and the <b>corm</b> production of taro as catch crop under the young rubber stand. This {{research was}} conducted by means of Nested Design with nine replication. The intercropping planting used independent variables i. e. N 0 (open condition), N 1 (under the two-year-old young rubber), and N 2 (under the three-year-old young rubber). The dependent variables were the chlorophyll content, leaf area, and production of the taro <b>corm.</b> The parameters investigated were the leaves area, the chlorophyll a and b content, the weight of fresh <b>corm,</b> the weight of dry <b>corm,</b> and the <b>corm</b> production per plots. The research result showed that the leaves area, and the chlorophyll a and b content significantly increased, while the weight of fresh <b>corm,</b> {{and the weight of}} dry <b>corm</b> significantly decreased (P< 0. 05). The fresh <b>corm</b> production per plots under the young rubber two- and three-year-old were significantly decreased compared the control (P< 0. 05).

5|$|While some {{cockatoos}} are generalists {{taking a}} wide range of foods, others are specialists. The glossy black cockatoo specialises in the cones of trees of the genus Allocasuarina, preferring a single species, A. verticillata. It holds the cones in its foot and shreds them with its powerful bill before removing the seeds with its tongue. Some species take large numbers of insects, particularly when breeding; in fact the bulk of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo's diet is made up of insects. The large bill is used in order to extract grubs and larvae from rotting wood. The amount of time cockatoos have to spend foraging varies with the season. During times of plenty they may need to feed for only a few hours in the day, in the morning and evening, then {{spend the rest of the}} day roosting or preening in trees, but during the winter most of the day may be spent foraging. The birds have increased nutritional requirements during the breeding season, so they spend more time foraging for food during this time. Cockatoos have large crops, which allow them to store and digest food for some time after retiring to a tree. During hard times, the cockatoos also display versatility in their diet, travelling widely in order to find food, feeding on more green plant material and in some species using their large bills to dig up <b>corms.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{varieties}} are recorded in Sri Lanka, several being edible, others being toxic to humans {{and therefore not}} cultivated.

25|$|The <b>corms,</b> {{which have}} a light purple color due to {{phenolic}} pigments, are roasted, baked or boiled, and the natural sugars give a sweet nutty flavor.

40|$|Increasing {{demand on}} glucomannan as healthy diet in develop countries, {{promotes}} higher planting area of Amorphophallus. Iles-iles <b>corm</b> (Amorphophallus muelleri) contains {{high percentage of}} glucomannan. In order to meet with increasing demand, providing mass planting materials is a great concern in Indonesia. Therefore, the study on skin <b>corm</b> and bulbil as propagation materials was conducted. In the first experiment, bulbil with different size and section, i. e., very small, small, medium and large, and half section and ¼ section were used. In the second experiment, we evaluated the prospect of skin <b>corm</b> as propagul where different size of skin <b>corm</b> was used, i. e., 1 cm x 1 cm, 2 cm x 2 cm, and 4 cm x 4 cm. Results showed that both bulbil and skin <b>corm</b> could be utilized as prospectivepropagules of iles-iles. Propagation using bulbil was more superior as compared to skin <b>corm.</b> Bulbil of both whole and sectioned had high emergence of bud (> 90 %), except very small sized ones. Very small bulbil (diameter less than 1 cm) resulted in ca 605 of emergence. Skin <b>corm</b> sized 4 cm x 4 cm produced equal emergence to medium bulbil. In general, increasing size of skin <b>corm</b> increased success of emergent bud. Delaying emergence on small sized skin <b>corm</b> could be assessed by smaller nutrient reserved. Most unseccessemergence of small sized skin and very small bulbil was due to decay of the propagules.

However, under the higher temperature regime, the plant allocated more carbon to cell wall material, and the amount of glucose within the <b>corm</b> declined earlier in the season. Hexose to sucrose ratios might control the duration of <b>corm</b> growth in C. vernus by influencing the timing of the cell division, elongation, and maturation phases.
