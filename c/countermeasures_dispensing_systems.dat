40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} is the Airborne Countermeasures Ejection and/or Release (ALE) -XX Cockpit Control Unit (CCU) <b>Countermeasures</b> <b>Dispensing</b> <b>System</b> Network Controller (CMDSNC) design. ALE-XX CCU CMDSNC was {{designed}} {{as part of the}} total ALE-XX system to replace the problematic ALE- 40. Fiber optic technology is incorporated into ALE-XX as the communication medium to eliminate Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). ALE-XX CMDSNC uses a star network to solve system operation failures from the existing daisy-chain topology. A comprehensive Built-In-Test (BIT) allows fault diagnose and isolation of hardware problems reported on the CCU Visual Display. Digital electronics replace the electro-mechanical devices, lowers the number of Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), and raises the Mean-Time-Between-Failures (MTBF). The information contained herein {{could be used as a}} design aid for future CMDSNCs or other related instrumentation...|$|R
5|$|The JF-17 has a {{defensive}} aids system (DAS) composed of various integrated sub-systems. A radar warning receiver (RWR) provides data such as direction and proximity of enemy radars, and an electronic warfare (EW) suite {{housed in a}} fairing {{at the tip of}} the tail fin interferes with enemy radars. The EW suite is also linked to a Missile Approach Warning (MAW) system to defend against radar-guided missiles. The MAW system uses several optical sensors across the airframe to detect the rocket motors of missiles across a 360-degree coverage. Data from the MAW system, such as direction of inbound missiles and the time to impact, is shown on cockpit displays and the HUD. A <b>countermeasures</b> <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> releases decoy flares and chaff to help evade hostile radar and missiles. The DAS systems will also be enhanced by integration of a self-protection radar-jamming pod that will be carried externally on a hardpoint.|$|R
50|$|The RWR {{can be an}} {{important}} tool for evading threats if avoidance has failed. For example, if a SAM system or enemy fighter aircraft has fired a missile (for example, a SARH-guided missile) at the aircraft, the RWR may be able to detect the change in mode that the radar must use to guide the missile and notify the pilot with much more insistent warning tones and flashing, bracketed symbols on the RWR display. The pilot then can take evasive action to break the missile lock-on or dodge the missile. The pilot may even be able to visually acquire the missile after being alerted to the possible launch. What's more, if an actively guided missile is tracking the aircraft, the pilot can use the direction and distance display of the RWR to work out which evasive maneuvers to perform to outrun or dodge the missile. For example, the rate of closure and aspect of the incoming missile may allow the pilot to determine that if they dive away from the missile, it is unlikely to catch up, or if it is closing fast, {{that it is time to}} jettison external supplies and turn toward the missile in an attempt to out-turn it. The RWR may be able to send a signal to another defensive system on board the aircraft, such as a <b>Countermeasure</b> <b>Dispensing</b> <b>System</b> (CMDS), which can eject countermeasures such as chaff, to aid in avoidance.|$|R
500|$|The Hornet Upgrade Program (HUG) {{began in}} 1999, {{and has had}} three main phases. In Phase 1, which ran from mid-2000 through 2002, the Hornets' {{computer}} systems, navigation system and radio were replaced. The aircraft were also fitted to operate the ASRAAM air-to-air missile; these weapons replaced the AIM-9 Sidewinder. HUG Phase 2 comprised four sub-elements and sought to improve the Hornets' combat performance. During Phase 2.1 the APG-65 radar was replaced with the improved AN/APG-73, and the aircraft were fitted with a secure voice encryption communications system as well as various updates to their computer systems. In HUG Phase 2.2, {{the most important element}} of the program, the Hornets were fitted with a Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System, equipment needed to share data through the Link 16 network, a new <b>countermeasures</b> <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> and several upgrades to their cockpit displays. All of the Hornets were upgraded to this standard between January 2005 and December 2006. In Phase 2.3, an improved Electronic Counter Measures system was fitted to the Hornets; the AN/ALR-2002 was originally selected, but proved unsuccessful. It was replaced by the ALR-67 Radar Warning Receiver in late 2006. As of early 2012, 14 Hornets had been fitted with the system and the remainder were scheduled to receive it {{by the end of the}} year. During HUG Phase 2.4 the Hornets were modified to be able to use the AN/AAQ-28(v) [...] "LITENING" [...] targeting pod and 37 of these systems were purchased; this phase was completed in 2007.|$|R

40|$|A 3 -axis <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> is {{utilized}} {{to control the}} initiating and terminating fiber positions and trajectory via the dispensing software. The polymer fiber length and orientation {{is defined by the}} spatial positioning of the <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> 3 -axis stages. The fiber diameter is defined by the prescribed dispense time of the <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> valve, the feed rate (the speed at which the stage traverses from an initiating to a terminating position), the gauge diameter of the dispensing tip, the viscosity and surface tension of the polymer solution, and the programmed drawing length. The stage feed rate affects the polymer solution’s evaporation rate and capillary breakup of the filaments. The <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> consists of a pneumatic valve controller, a droplet-dispensing valve and a dispensing tip. Characterization of the direct write process to determine the optimum combination of factors leads to repeatedly acquiring the desired range of fiber diameters. The advantage of this robotic <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> is the ease of obtaining a precise range of micron/sub-micron fibers onto a desired, programmed location via automated process control.

30|$|This paper {{introduces}} a pneumatic <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> {{to control the}} velocity of nanoliter droplets with small variation of volume. The system consists of a flexible membrane integrated with a backflow stopper. This unique dispensing mechanism can control the velocity of droplets according to applied positive pressures regardless of other operating conditions and design parameters. The range of droplet velocities is shifted by the flow resistance at the outlet under the same cross-section area. Our <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> can eject droplets of desired volume at a velocity {{that can be easily}} controlled by selecting design parameters and operating conditions. This <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> will provide a reliable performance within an optimized condition stably to deposit droplets onto accurate locations.|$|R
30|$|For a {{patterning}} process to be successful, {{the velocity of}} droplets must be controlled, {{to prevent them from}} splashing and to achieve accurate and precise directionality. In the most <b>dispensing</b> <b>systems,</b> a droplet’s volume and velocity are both linearly dependent on the magnitude of the driving force or on the transferred kinetic energy [[20]–[23]]. Therefore, in conventional <b>dispensing</b> <b>systems</b> the droplet’s velocity cannot be controlled without affecting its volume.|$|R
30|$|We {{developed}} a pneumatic <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> {{to control the}} velocity of nanoliter droplets with small variation of their volume. The ability of the <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> to control droplet velocities was assessed under various design parameters and operating conditions. Droplet volume saturated because the maximum deflected volume of the membrane {{is limited by the}} chamber size. Droplet velocity increased depending on applied positive pressure after volume saturation. The velocity of droplets was affected mainly by the magnitude of positive pressure regardless of the duration time over which it was applied. The range of droplet velocities was strongly affected by the flow resistance at the outlet when the cross-section area of the outlet was held constant. The velocity of droplets ejected by our <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> can be easily controlled at a desired droplet volume by selecting design parameters and operating conditions that correspond to a specific patterning condition. For successful achievement of a patterning process, this <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> will provide a reliable performance within an optimized condition stably to deposit droplets onto accurate locations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the design, fabrication {{and control of}} a piezoelectric-type droplet generator which is applicable for on-line dispensing. The piezoelectric-actuated <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> consists of a linear piezoelectric motor (LPM) actuated table, a plastic syringe, a nozzle, a linear encoder and a PC-based control unit. Adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) control is applied to overcome nonlinear hysteresis inherited in the LPM. The adaptive learning rates are derived based on the Lyapunov stability theorem so that convergence of the tracking error can be assured. Unlike open-loop <b>dispensing</b> <b>system,</b> the system proposed can potentially generate droplets with high accuracy. Experimental verifications including regulating and tracking control are performed firstly to assure {{the reliability of the}} proposed control schemes. Real dispensing is then conducted to validate the feasibility of the piezoelectric-actuated drop-on-demand droplet generator. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme works well in developing the piezoelectric-actuated drop-on-demand <b>dispensing</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} goal of my diploma {{thesis is}} creating {{an application for}} configurating computer-controlled beverages <b>dispensing</b> <b>systems.</b> In the preamble of my thesis I present the theoretical platform for point of sale <b>systems</b> and beverages <b>dispensing</b> <b>systems,</b> which are required for {{the understanding of the}} target problematics. As with many other fields, computer tehnologies entered the field of managing bars and restaurants quite some time ago. Basic components of every bar or restaurant are point of sale <b>systems</b> and beverages <b>dispensing</b> <b>systems.</b> Less demanding owners of bars or restaurants are satisfied with simplest of the point of sale systems, which implement only the most basic functions. At the same time they do not invest much in <b>dispensing</b> <b>systems,</b> which are most often made up of only unconnected drink dispensers, such as coffee machines or dispensers for beer. More demanding owners {{pay more attention to the}} mentioned systems, which often results in larger investments in them. Thus it si possible to introduce a computerized point of sale system, which in conjunction with beverages <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> represents a complete whole that allows the owner a more comprehensive way of controlling the operation of the bar or a restaurant. A computer-controlled beverages <b>dispensing</b> <b>system</b> needs to be configurated before operating. For this purpose I wrote an application that simplifies this process. The application implements communication with dispensing computer which is the essence of computer-controlled beverages <b>dispensing</b> <b>system.</b> Data from the dispensing computer are reprezented in a tabelaric form. Such manner enables a simple entry of new values, which can then be saved on the dispensing computer. Communication between dispensing computer and any other copmuter demands a protocol, whis is also described in this thesis. The application also allows a configuration to be saved in a XML file or to be read from one. In the description of the application I initially describe the basic procedures and functions that allow me to accomplish most of the tasks. Every description also contains a flow chart diagram of the procedure or the function. In continuation I describe the graphical user interface of the application. At this point I also explain some interesting cases of dealing with dynamic graphical interface and assurance of entering data of correct values in the configuration table. ...|$|R
