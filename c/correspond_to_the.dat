25|$|Given {{again the}} finite-dimensional case, if bases have been chosen, then the {{composition}} of linear maps <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> matrix multiplication, the addition of linear maps <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> matrix addition, and the multiplication of linear maps with scalars <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> multiplication of matrices with scalars.|$|R
50|$|Categorical constructions {{lead to some}} examples.

Similarly, Product topology <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coproduct of C*-algebras, the tensor product of algebras. In a more specialized setting,compactifications of topologies <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> unitizations of algebras. So <b>the</b> one-point compactification <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> minimal unitization of C*-algebras, <b>the</b> Stone-Čech compactification <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> multiplier algebra, and corona sets corresponds with corona algebras.|$|R
