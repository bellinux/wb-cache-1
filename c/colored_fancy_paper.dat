50|$|The {{color in}} red {{diamonds}} is assessed {{according to its}} hue and saturation. Red diamonds can occur with secondary colors, such as brown-red, orange-red, or purple-red, but red is not a modifying color for any other diamond color. Additionally, red diamonds never appear with a tertiary modifying color, {{as is the case}} in other diamond colors. A pure red diamond is ideal but an even rarer find than a red with a secondary color. Like with other diamond colors, a purely red diamond will fetch a higher per carat price than one with a secondary hue. Brownish red and Orangey red diamonds are generally considered inferior to Purplish Red diamonds and are priced accordingly. All of these colors run upwards of $400,000 per carat, but a pure red diamond can cost significantly more per carat. Few <b>colors</b> of <b>fancy</b> <b>color</b> diamonds are characterized by having a singular color intensity. This phenomenon only exists with three colors: black diamonds, white diamonds, and red diamonds. Since the source of the red in red diamonds is considered to be a hyper-concentrated occurrence of pink, this would actually make red the darkest shade of pink possible, which is why it is only able to appear in one intensity. Red diamonds will only be graded Fancy Red, Fancy Brownish Red, Fancy Purplish Red, or Fancy Orangey Red. An easy way to tell whether a red diamond is fake is if the seller is offering it with an intensity grade like other diamond <b>colors</b> (<b>Fancy</b> Light, Fancy Intense, Fancy Vivid etc.). There are so few red diamonds that the GIA records show that over a 30 year period from 1957-1987, not a single GIA lab report with the term “red” was issued. Some diamond polishers have achieved a GIA grading of Fancy Red for a diamond by re-polishing a Fancy Deep Pink diamond, although this is very hard to accomplish and has only been successfully completed less than a handful of times.|$|R

50|$|Red diamond is {{a diamond}} which {{displays}} red color throughout its prism, and exhibits {{all the same}} mineral properties as colorless diamonds. Red diamonds {{are commonly known as}} the most expensive and the rarest diamond color in the world, even more so than pink diamonds or blue diamonds. Red diamonds, just like pink diamonds are greatly debated as to the source of their color, but the gemological community most commonly attributes both colors to gliding atoms in the diamond’s structure as it undergoes enormous pressure during its formation. Red diamonds are among the 12 <b>colors</b> of <b>fancy</b> <b>color</b> diamonds, and are the most expensive price per carat. They will typically run in {{the hundreds of thousands of}} dollars per carat range. Since they are the rarest color, it is difficult to find them in large sizes, and they are mostly found in sizes less than 1 carat. Red diamonds only exist with one <b>color</b> intensity, <b>Fancy,</b> although their clarities can range from Flawless to Included, just like white diamonds. The largest and most flawless red diamond is the 5.11 carat Fancy Red Moussaieff Red Diamond, which has internally flawless clarity.|$|R
5000|$|All {{diamonds}} {{are examined}} under a loupe {{to determine their}} clarity.

Like all diamonds, pink diamond clarity is measured on a scale from Flawless to Included. Only 7% of pink diamonds are either Flawless or Internally Flawless (IF), and majority are Slightly Included (SI). [...] Like most of the <b>colors</b> of <b>fancy</b> <b>color</b> diamonds, the clarity has little effect on a pink diamond’s value. Since pink diamonds are formed by a deformation on their lattice structure, their probably of a low clarity grade is higher, making high clarity pink diamonds extremely rare (<7%).|$|R

2500|$|The {{majority}} of diamonds that are mined {{are in a}} range of pale yellow or brown color that is termed the normal color range. Diamonds that are of intense yellow or brown, or any other <b>color</b> are called <b>fancy</b> <b>color</b> diamonds. Diamonds that are of the very highest purity are totally colorless, and appear a bright white. The degree to which diamonds exhibit body color is one of the four value factors by which diamonds are assessed. [...] Diamonds have a color grading system that refers to the absence of color. This system goes from D to Z.The more colorless a diamond is, the rarer and more valuable is because it appears white and brighter to the eye.|$|R

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to yellow or brown hues, diamonds of other colors are more rare and valuable.

40|$|Early in {{the nineteenth}} century the London {{publishers}} and printsellers, S. and J. Fuller, packaged paper dolls and storybooks together in their Temple of <b>Fancy</b> <b>paper</b> doll books. This article examines the tension between the narratives of these works—typically moral tales for children in which a love of clothing is punished—and the accompanying paper dolls, which celebrate costume and dressing up. The textual morals against love of clothing are gendered in problematic ways, with female characters mortified for this flaw more readily than male characters. However, the variety of potential reading experiences offered by the form of the paper doll book, in which picture and word are separate, is viewed as a challenge to the gendered moral content of the stories. Ultimately this article argues that the form of the paper doll book sheds new light on D. F. McKenzie's (1986) ideas about how readers make meaning from texts...|$|R
