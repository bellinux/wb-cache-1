500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments {{it is hard to}} watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mind and forget it. What {{we have here is a}} blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with Associated Press (AP) reporter Lorena Hickok, who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and [...] "fell madly in love with her". During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to [...] "Hick", who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady. The letters included such endearments as, [...] "I want to put my arms around you & kiss you at the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mouth," [...] and, [...] "I can't kiss you, so I kiss your 'picture' good night and good morning!" [...] At Franklin's 1933 inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised Roosevelt's liberalism, her stance regarding civil rights, and her and her husband FDR's criticisms of Hoover's surveillance tactics, and so Hoover maintained a large file on Roosevelt, which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar (2011) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship, which Hoover intended to blackmail Roosevelt with. Compromised as a reporter, Hickok soon resigned her position with the AP to be closer to Eleanor, who secured her a job as an investigator for a New Deal program.|$|E

2500|$|However several Buddhist leaders {{including}} Thích Nhất Hạnh, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Shodo Harada and the Dalai Lama {{among others}} [...] condemned the violence against Muslims in Myanmar {{and called for}} peace, supporting {{the practice of the}} fundamental Buddhist principles of non-harming, mutual respect and compassion. The Dalai Lama said [...] "Buddha always teaches us about forgiveness, tolerance, compassion. If from one <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mind, some emotion makes you want to hit, or want to kill, then please remember Buddha's faith. We are followers of Buddha."

5000|$|The Bible {{states in}} Leviticus 19:2, [...] "You shall not round off the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> heads nor mar the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> beard." [...] Talmudic {{tradition}} explains it {{to mean that}} a man may not shave his beard with a razor with a single blade since the cutting action of the blade against the skin [...] "mars" [...] the beard. Because scissors have two blades, some opinions in halakha (Jewish law) permit their use to trim the beard, as the cutting action comes from contact of the two blades and not the blade against the skin. For this reason, some poskim (Jewish legal deciders) rule that Orthodox Jews may use electric razors to remain cleanshaven, as such shavers cut by trapping the hair between the blades and the metal grating, halakhically a scissor-like action. Other poskim like Zokon Yisrael KiHilchso, maintain that electric shavers constitute a razor-like action and consequently prohibit their use.|$|R

After {{a trip to}} Hawaii during which Amos learned about legendary volcano goddess Pele, the album began taking shape; Amos conceived of the songs as representing stealing fire from the men in her {{life as well as}} a journey to finding her own fire as a woman. From there, Amos explained, the songs just came. [...] "Sometimes the fury of it would make me step back, I began to live these songs as we separated. The vampire in me came out.

I have never read books. I {{do not know how}} to read. But Four Eyes taught me much. My grammar is good. He taught me. And in his own eyes I have seen the trouble of the hunger for the world. He was often hungry for the world. Yet here was good meat, and fish in plenty, and the berries and the roots, and often flour came back for the furs through the Porcupines and the Luskwas. Yet was he hungry for the world. Is the world so good that you, too, are hungry for it? Four Eyes had nothing. But you have me." [...] She sighed and shook her head.

50|$|Many superstitions were {{attached}} to pysanky. Pysanky were thought to protect households from evil spirits, catastrophe, lightning and fires. Pysanky with spiral motifs were the most powerful, as the demons and other unholy creatures would be trapped within the spirals forever. A blessed pysanka {{could be used to}} find demons hidden in the dark <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> house. Pysanky held powerful magic, and had to be disposed of properly, lest a witch get a hold of one. She could use the shell to gather dew, and use the gathered dew to dry up a cow's milk. The witch could also use bits of the eggshell to poke people and sicken them. The eggshell had to be ground up very finely (and fed to chickens to make them good egg layers) or broken into pieces and tossed into a running stream.|$|R

50|$|The rule of epoché sets aside any initial {{theories}} {{with regard}} to what {{is presented in the}} meeting between therapist and client. The rule of description implies immediate and specific observations, abstaining from interpretations or explanations, especially those formed from the application of a clinical theory superimposed over the circumstances of experience. The rule of horizontalization avoids any hierarchical assignment of importance such that the data of experience become prioritized and categorized as they are received. A Gestalt therapist using the phenomenological method might say something like, “I notice a slight tension at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mouth when I say that, and I see you shifting on the couch and folding your arms across your chest … and now I see you rolling <b>your</b> eyes back”. <b>Of</b> course, the therapist may make a clinically relevant evaluation, but when applying the phenomenological method, temporarily suspends the need to express it.|$|R

Some day, you believe, within these five, or ten, or twenty years, for every one of us the judgment will be set, and the books opened. If that be true, far more than that must be true. Is there but one day of judgment? Why, for us every day is a day of judgment--every day is a Dies Irae, and writes its irrevocable verdict in the flame of its West. Think you that judgment waits till the doors of the grave are opened? It waits at the doors <b>of</b> <b>your</b> houses--it waits at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> streets; {{we are in the midst}} of judgment--the insects that we crush are our judges--the moments we fret away are our judges--the elements that feed us, judge, as they minister--and the pleasures that deceive us, judge, as they indulge.
