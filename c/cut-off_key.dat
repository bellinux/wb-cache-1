We {{obtain the}} mean field limit and the {{propagation}} of chaos for a system of particles interacting with a singular interaction force of the type 1 /|x|α, with α < 1 in dimension d ≥ 3. We also provide results for forces with singularity up to α < d − 1 but with large enough cut-off. This last result thus almost includes the most interesting case of Coulombian or gravitational interaction, {{but it is also}} interesting when the strength of the singularity α is larger but close to one, in which case it allows for very small <b>cut-off.</b> <b>Key</b> words.

40|$|Potential {{indicators}} {{were assessed}} {{for the two}} classifications of protein-energy malnutrition in the guidelines for integrated management of childhood illness: severe malnutrition, which requires immediate referral to hospital, and very low weight, which calls for feeding assessment, nutritional counselling and follow-up. Children aged < 2 years require feeding assessment and counselling as a preventive intervention. For severe malnutrition, we examined 1202 children admitted to a Kenyan hospital for any association of the indicators with mortality within one month. Bipedal oedema indicating kwashiorkor, and two marasmus indicators (visible severe wasting and weight-for-height (WFH) Z-score of < - 3) were associated with a significantly increased mortality risk (odds ratios, 3. 1 - 3. 9). Very low weight-for-age (WFA) (Z-score of < - 4. 4) {{was not associated with}} an increased risk of mortality. Because first-level health facilities generally lack length-boards, bipedal oedema and visible severe wasting were chosen as indicators of severe malnutrition. To assess potential WFA thresholds for the very low weight classification, our primary source of data came from 1785 Kenyan outpatient children, but we also examined data from surveys in Nepal, Bolivia, and Togo. We examined the performance of WFA at various thresholds to identify children with low WFH and, for children aged < or = 2 years, low height-for-age (HFA). Use of a WFA threshold Z-score of < - 2 identified a considerable proportion of children (from 13 % in Bolivia to 68 % in Nepal) which, in most settings, would pose an enormous burden on the health facility. Among ill children in Kenya, a threshold WFA Z-score of < - 3 had a sensitivity of 89 - 100 % to detect children with WFH Z-scores of < - 3, and, with an identification rate of 9 %, would avoid overburdening the clinics. Potential modifications include use of a more restrictive cut-off in countries with high rates of stunting, or the elimination of the WFA screen in order to concentrate efforts on intervention for all children below the 2 -year age <b>cut-off.</b> <b>Key</b> issues in every country include the capacity to provide counselling for many children and linkage to nutritional improvement programmes in the community...|$|E
50|$|In 2009 the dam {{wall was}} {{upgraded}} by ensuring {{the safety of}} the dam wall during a maximum probable flood. The upgrade involved the removal of the top of the wall, the installation of a concrete <b>cut-off</b> wall <b>keyed</b> into the impermeable clay core, followed by replacement of the gravel and road over the dam wall.|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} two-electron scattering {{states and}} verify their tensor product struc- ture in the infrared-regular massless Nelson model. The proof follows {{the lines of}} Haag- Ruelle scattering theory: Scattering state approximants are defined {{with the help of}} two time-dependent renormalized creation operators of the electrons acting on the vacuum. They depend on the ground state wave functions of the (single-electron) fiber Hamiltonians with infrared cut-off. The convergence of these approximants as t → ∞ is shown with the help of Cook’s method combined with a non-stationary phase argument. The removal of the infrared cut-off in the limit t → ∞ requires sharp estimates on the derivatives of these ground state wave functions w. r. t. electron and photon momenta, with mild dependence on the infrared <b>cut-off.</b> These <b>key</b> estimates, which carry information about the localization of the electrons in space, are obtained in a companion paper with the help of iterative analytic perturbation theory. Our results hold in the weak coupling regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} personality factor-associated predictors of smartphone addiction predisposition (SAP). Participants were 2, 573 men and 2, 281 women (n = 4, 854) aged 20 - 49 years (Mean ± SD: 33. 47 ± 7. 52); participants completed the following questionnaires: the Korean Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale (K-SAPS) for adults, the Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System questionnaire (BIS/BAS), the Dickman Dysfunctional Impulsivity Instrument (DDII), and the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS). In addition, participants reported their demographic information and smartphone usage pattern (weekday or weekend average usage hours and main use). We analyzed the data in three steps: (1) identifying predictors with logistic regression, (2) deriving causal relationships between SAP and its predictors using a Bayesian belief network (BN), and (3) computing optimal cut-off points for the identified predictors using the Youden index. Identified predictors of SAP were as follows: gender (female), weekend average usage hours, and scores on BAS-Drive, BAS-Reward Responsiveness, DDII, and BSCS. Female gender and scores on BAS-Drive and BSCS directly increased SAP. BAS-Reward Responsiveness and DDII indirectly increased SAP. We found that SAP was defined with maximal sensitivity as follows: weekend average usage hours > 4. 45, BAS-Drive > 10. 0, BAS-Reward Responsiveness > 13. 8, DDII > 4. 5, and BSCS > 37. 4. This study raises the possibility that personality factors contribute to SAP. And, we calculated <b>cut-off</b> points for <b>key</b> predictors. These findings may assist clinicians screening for SAP using cut-off points, and further the understanding of SA risk factors...|$|R
30|$|These studies though do {{not also}} {{take account of}} fertility. A number of {{analytic}} studies though have sought to address the challenging deep issues of endogeneity that affect the educational, fertility and work choices of young women. A {{number of studies have}} looked at the impact of early childbirth on educational outcomes of young women, using different techniques to try to address the endogeneity issues to seek to find causal relationships (e.g. Ranchhod et al. 2011 and Ardington et al. 2015 for South Africa; Herrera and Sahn: Early childbearing, school attainment and cognitive skills: evidence from Madagascar, forthcoming, for Madagascar). Agüero and Marks (2011) use infertility as an instrument in looking at the causal impact of children on female labour force participation. Other studies seek to consider education, marriage/childbirth and labour supply together in one analysis. Heath and Mobarek (2015) study these choices in the case of Bangladesh, allowing for the proximity or not of garment factories (which offer many employment opportunities for young women) as an exogenous intervention. They use this to model educational attainment, marriage, childbirth and time of starting work, using duration models for some of these outcomes. Marchetta and Sahn (2016) study educational, marriage, childbirth and work outcomes for young women in Senegal, based on high-quality data that enable plausible exclusion restrictions at each stage. With a broadly similar econometric approach to Heath and Mobarek, they find that access to primary and secondary schools and improved school quality both increase grade attainment and the chances of staying on at school. Additionally, using data on the girls’ parents, they find that higher levels of parents’ education reduce both the chances at a given age of marriage and the age of first birth. Ozier (2015) uses a regression discontinuity design linked on a <b>key</b> <b>cut-off</b> score in the Kenya Certificate of primary education examination that substantially increases the likelihood of secondary school admission, to look at the impact of secondary schooling on human capital attainment, teenage pregnancy and better labour market outcomes.|$|R
40|$|The {{imaging radar}} ASAR of the {{satellite}} Envisat provides us the directional wave spectrum limited to a wavelengths range (typically above 200 m wavelength swells). Recent work has demonstrated that the assimilation of ASAR wave spectra has a significant positive impact for swell wave analyses and predictions. The upgraded ASAR level 2 algorithms have well improved {{the quality of the}} retrieved directional wave spectra (see Aouf et al. 2006). First, this paper presents the validation of upgraded ASAR level 2 wave products with the wave model WAM for four months period (September to December 2005). Secondly, this work discusses the impact of using the upgraded ASAR directional wave spectra in the assimilation system for a long period. The validation study has mainly revealed that the low frequency wave height H 10 and mean period T 10 are well improved in comparison with the old level 2 wave products. In addition, the root mean square error with the wave model is significantly reduced. In other respects, the upgraded level 2 algorithms have corrected the overestimation of the wave height at low wind speed resulted in the old processing. The quality control procedure for ASAR data depending on the normalized variance of ASAR image, the wind speed at the ocean surface and the ratio of signal to noise works efficiently before the assimilation procedure and rejects in average 12 % of the data from the analysis process. The wavelength <b>cut-off</b> represents a <b>key</b> parameter in the assimilation system. A method based on the analysis of the peak frequency of ASAR wave spectra is implemented for determining the optimal wavelength cut-off. The assimilation experiments show that the assimilation of ASAR wave spectra produces a significant positive impact on the estimate of mean wave parameters (wave height, mean period). The impact stays efficient after 3 -day forecast, depending on the area of interest. The results of the assimilation runs have been evaluated by comparisons with independent wave data from altimeters (Jason- 1) and buoys. Further discussions and conclusions will be commented in the final paper...|$|R
