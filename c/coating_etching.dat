Plasma activation is where species in the plasma like ions, electrons, or radicals are used to chemically or physically modify the surface. Lastly, plasma coating is where material is coated to the surface in the form of a thin film. Plasma coating can be used to add hydrocarbons to surfaces which can make a surface non-polar or hydrophobic. The specific type of plasma coating used to add hydrocarbons is called plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process or PCVD.|$|E

30|$|A {{new concept}} of perfect {{absorber}} is now based on metamaterials where {{the enhancement of}} the absorption can be obtained thanks to the excitation of the surface plasmon resonance for example in gold and silver [6 – 13].

Alternatively structured phase change materials [18 – 23] and chiral metamaterials [24 – 27] have been recently used so to obtain an active switching of the absorption properties thanks to the metal-insulator transition in one case, or to intrinsic/extrinsic dichroism in the other case.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an activity-based cost model for {{printed wiring board}} (PWB) fabrication in which the process steps are defined by material processing activities. The model {{is designed to be}} used during system planning and tradeoff analysis prior to physical design. In many activity-based manufacturing cost models, activities are based on equipment and facilities (“equipment-centric”). In the present model, the process steps are based on material processing activities (“material-centric”). Equipment-centric models are appropriate for integrated circuit (IC) manufacture where the processing cost is driven by facilities and equipment; however, in PWB manufacturing, where a sig-nificant portion of the cost is materials, it is more appropriate to focus the process modeling around material activities. The models presented in this paper compute the volume of materials used and wasted by the activities associated with the fabrication of PWB’s, and in turn, use the computed volumes as inputs for predicting fabrication and waste disposition costs. Activities included in the model are open- and closed-loop plating, <b>coating,</b> <b>etching,</b> stripping, desmearing, plasma etching, lamina-tion, drilling, filling, singulation, and scrapping. Additionally, waste disposition activities that operate on the waste inventory are supported. The models presented here have been integrated into a software tradeoff environment that concurrently performs cost and performance analysis for electronic systems. A tradeoff study is presented that compares the cost and waste associated with fabricating mechanically drilled and plated through-hole PWB’s with conventional and alternative resists and two fully-additive photolithographic microvia PWB fabrication processes.

The devices were created using Pyrex and silicon substrates, as well as microfabrication techniques such as deep reactive ion etching, low-temperature fusion bonding, and anodic bonding. The emitters are coated with black silicon, which acts as a wicking material for transporting the liquid to the emitter tips. The extractor electrode uses a 3 -D MEMS packaging technology that allows hand assembly of the two components with micrometer-level precision. Experimental characterization of the MEMS electrospray array includes current-voltage characteristics, time-of-flight mass spectrometry, beam divergence, and imprints on a collector. The data show that with both ionic liquids and in both polarities, the electrospray array works in the pure ionic regime, emitting ions with as little as 500 V of bias voltage.

30|$|ZnO is {{regarded}} as one of the most promising semiconductor material for the application of ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) due to its excellent optical and electrical properties, including a direct wide bandgap (3.37  eV) and a high exciton binding energy (60  meV) at room temperature. Especially ordered ZnO nanorod arrays, which have a lower defect density, an improvement in the light extraction efficiency of the LEDs, and a broadband suppression in reflection, are the most attractive [1 – 5]. In addition, by choosing an optimal diameter of the ZnO nanorod arrays, electroluminescence (EL) emission from the LED device can be enhanced further, because the waveguiding property of ZnO nanorods is closely related to the diameter [5, 6]. Recently, ZnO nanorod array-based LEDs have been reported by many groups, which presents improved EL performance compared with the ZnO film-based LEDs [5 – 7]. However, the fabrication of ZnO nanorod array-based LEDs with a traditional indium-tin-oxide (ITO) current spreading layer is very complicated. Since ZnO nanorods do not form a continuous layer, it is necessary to protect the nanorods and isolate electrical contacts on the ZnO nanorods from the underlying substrate. This can be achieved by spin coating an insulating polymer layer to fill up the gaps between nanorods. And then, an oxygen plasma etching was used to remove the insulating polymer coated on the surface of ZnO nanorods and expose the nanorod tips for contact formation. However, the complete filling and moderate etching of the insulating polymer are very difficult to control, and moreover, the plasma may introduce damage of ZnO nanorods leading to the degradation of the electrical properties of LEDs [6, 8]. Recently, graphene has emerged as a promising material for transparent conductive electrode, considering its excellent characteristics such as high transparency and low sheet resistance [9 – 11]. For ZnO nanorod array-based LEDs, the device fabrication process can be considerably simplified by adopting graphene as a current spreading layer instead of ITO, since the spin <b>coating</b> and <b>etching</b> of insulating polymer can be completely omitted.|$|R
