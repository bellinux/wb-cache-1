He assumed the chair at a tumultuous time, as the presidential election had just concluded the previous month with no clear winner. The Democratic candidate, Samuel J. Tilden of New York, had 184 electoral votes, just shy of the 185 needed for victory. Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican, had 163; the remaining 22 votes were in doubt.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Lakes assumed {{their present}} levels, the {{waterfall}} was inundated and Mackinac Island took on its current size. The steep cliffs {{were one of}} the primary reasons for the British army's <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island for a fortification; their decision differed from that of the French army, which had built Fort Michilimackinac about 1715 near present-day Mackinaw City. The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is Arch Rock, a natural limestone arch, 146feet (45m) above the ground. Other popular geologic formations include Devil's Kitchen, Skull Cave, and Sugar Loaf.|$|E
5|$|Because Helm died so {{soon after}} taking office, a special {{election}} {{for the remainder of}} his term was set for August 1868. Democrats held a convention in Frankfort on February 22, 1868 and nominated Stevenson to finish out Helm's term. R. Tarvin Baker, formerly Stevenson's opponent in the election for lieutenant governor, was the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republicans. The Republicans faced many disadvantages, including the national party's persecution of President Johnson and a lack of local organization in many Kentucky counties. Despite Stevenson's shortcomings as a public speaker, he was elected in a landslide—115,560 to 26,605. At the time, it was the largest majority obtained by any candidate in a Kentucky election.|$|E

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|Deligiannis mobilized the Hellenic Army, and the British Royal Navy {{blockaded}} Greece. The admiral {{in charge}} of the blockade was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who had been the first <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greeks to be their king in 1863, and the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time was Lord Ripon, whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before. This was not the last time that King George discovered that his family ties were not always to his advantage. Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.|$|E

5|$|In 1823, Wickliffe {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives and served five {{consecutive}} terms. Again he succeeded his cousin and friend, Ben Hardin. Though a Whig, he disagreed with many of the positions of the party's founder, Henry Clay. When no candidate received a majority of the electoral votes in the 1824 presidential election, the constitution mandated that the election be decided in the House. Wickliffe bucked Clay's advice to vote for him and instead voted for Andrew Jackson, who was the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky legislature.|$|E

The matrix depends on the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bases: different choices of bases give rise to different, but equivalent matrices. Many of the above concrete notions can be reinterpreted in this light, for example, the transpose matrix AT describes the transpose of the linear map given by A, with respect to the dual bases.|$|E

5|$|Located in {{the bottom}} of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a {{diameter}} of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the north-western side of the monument are considerably larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in south-western Scotland, and was potentially a deliberate <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle's builders, to whom it may have had symbolic meaning.|$|E

The British government also objected, favoring Patrick Curtis instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests. The Vatican agreed, and Pope Pius VII appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sees of Philadelphia or Madras; Conwell chose Philadelphia. Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop William Poynter, the Vicar Apostolic of the London District, assisted by Fathers James Bramston and Joseph Francis Carpue.|$|E
