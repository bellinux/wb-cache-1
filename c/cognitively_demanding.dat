25|$|Another {{source of}} {{evidence}} for the effect of environment stimulation upon the human brain is cognitive reserve (a measure of the brain’s resilience to cognitive impairment) {{and the level of}} a person’s education. Not only is higher education linked to a more <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> educational experience, but it also correlates with a person’s general engagement in <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> activities. The more education a person has received, the less the effects of aging, dementia, white matter hyperintensities, MRI-defined brain infarcts, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury. Also, aging and dementia are less in those that engage in complex cognitive tasks. The cognitive decline of those with epilepsy could also be affected by the level of a person’s education.|$|E

In one study, when {{participants were given}} <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> concurrent tasks, the results showed a paradoxical higher frequency of target thoughts than controls. However other controlled studies have not shown such effects. For example, Wenzlaff and Bates found that subjects concentrating on a positive task experienced neither paradoxical effects nor rebound effects—even when challenged with cognitive load. Wenzlaff and Bates also note that the beneficiality of concentration in their study participants was better optimized when the subjects employed positive thoughts.|$|E
25|$|Dickens and Flynn (2001) {{have argued}} that genes for high IQ {{initiate}} an environment-shaping feedback cycle, with genetic effects causing bright children to seek out more stimulating environments that then further increase their IQ.

Users can change their perspective on the data by rotating or decomposing the 3 D cube. These manipulations can produce a range of different 2 D visualizations that emphasize specific aspects of the dynamic network suited to particular analysis tasks. We describe Matrix Cubes and the interactions that can be performed on them in the Cubix system. We then show how two domain experts, an astronomer and a neurologist, used Cubix to explore and report on their own network data...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive {{performance}} fluctuates {{during the}} day due to diurnal variations in alertness level. This study examined: (1) whether cognitive performance in school-aged children is affected by time-of-day; (2) which functional domains are particularly vulnerable to time-of-day effects; and (3) whether the effects are more pronounced for <b>cognitively</b> more <b>demanding</b> tasks or task conditions. Children, aged 10 - 12 yrs, {{were randomly assigned to}} a test session starting either at 08 : 30 (n = 802), 10 : 00 (n = 713), or 13 : 00 h (n = 652). Speed and accuracy of information processing were evaluated by tasks that assess input-related cognitive processes (e. g., stimulus encoding), central cognitive processes (e. g., working memory, sustained attention), and output-related processes (e. g., response organization) using the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks program. Time-of-day effects in children were identified in specific neurocognitive domains, such as visuospatial processing and working memory, but only under <b>cognitively</b> more <b>demanding</b> task conditions. Sustained attention showed a speed-accuracy tradeoff with increased slowness and lapses in the early morning, but with better feedback responsiveness and perceptual sensitivity than in the early afternoon. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction of time-on-task with time-of-day for tempo, with the afternoon group increasing in tempo with time-on-task, and the early-morning group first showing a slowing of tempo with time-on-task, followed {{at the end of the}} task by a speed increase towards the initial levels. To conclude, the authors found time-of-day effects in preadolescents, which were confined to <b>cognitively</b> more <b>demanding</b> tasks tapping input-related and central cognitive processes.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{a study on the}} {{relationship}} between cognitive task complexity and linguistic performance in L 2 writing. In the study, two models proposed to explain the influence of cognitive task complexity on linguistic performance in L 2 are tested and compared: Skehan and Foster’s Limited Attentional Capacity Model (Skehan, 1998; Skehan & Foster, 1999, 2001) and Robinson’s Cognition Hypothesis (Robinson, 2001 a, 2001 b, 2005). In the experiment, 91 Dutch university students of Italian and 76 students of French performed two writing tasks with prompts of differing cognitive complexity. Linguistic performance was operationalized in terms of syntactic complexity, lexical variation, and accuracy. The study provides support for the Cognition Hypothesis insofar as the written products of the <b>cognitively</b> more <b>demanding</b> task {{turned out to be more}} accurate, with significantly lower error ratios per T-unit than those of the <b>cognitively</b> less <b>demanding</b> task. No effects on the written output could be observed on measures of syntactic complexity or lexical variation. The implications of the findings for both Skehan and Foster’s model and Robinson’s Cognition Hypothesis with regard to L 2 writing pedagogy are discussed and suggestions are made for the direction in which further research on the influence of task complexity on text quality should be developed...|$|R

500|$|The show's {{extensive}} use of research in its development and production process inspired several studies that provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool. Field tests showed that the attention and comprehension of young viewers increased with each repeat viewing. In 1999, Anderson {{and a team of}} researchers, some of which were his colleagues at Nickelodeon, studied how episode repetition affected comprehension, audience participation, and visual attention. The researchers tested whether repeated viewings of the show resulted in mastery over the material presented, or whether viewers would habituate or become bored. They discovered that audience participation was lower for the first few viewings, because children paid more attention to unfamiliar material, and because it was more <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> to understand and solve the problems presented. After five viewings, more of the viewers' cognitive resources were available for interaction and participation, so they answered more questions. Episode repetition seemed to empower viewers, as shown in their enthusiastic efforts to solve the problems presented to them. Repetition, which the researchers called [...] "an inexpensive tool to maximize comprehension," [...] improved comprehension, held children's attention, and increased audience participation. Children were not only tolerant of repetition, they were [...] "positively enthusiastic" [...] about it. Nielsen ratings of the show's first season, when the same episode was shown daily, were flat over the five-day period, which indicated to Anderson that young children did not tire of its repetition or of its complexity over time. Anderson and Crawley felt that the telecast strategy helped increase the show's ratings and called it a success.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Dickens and Flynn {{presented}} {{a model for}} resolving several contradictory findings regarding IQ. They argue that the measure [...] "heritability" [...] includes both a direct effect of the genotype on IQ and also indirect effects such that the genotype changes the environment, thereby affecting IQ. That is, those with a greater IQ tend to seek stimulating environments that further increase IQ. These reciprocal effects result in gene environment correlation. The direct effect could initially have been very small, but feedback can create large differences of IQ. In their model, an environmental stimulus can have a very great effect on IQ, even for adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition during early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The Flynn effect {{can be explained by}} a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that any program designed to increase IQ may produce long-term IQ gains if that program teaches children how to replicate the types of <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> experiences that produce IQ gains outside the program. To maximize lifetime IQ, the programs should also motivate them to continue searching for <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> experiences after they have left the program.|$|E

40|$|Narrative {{tasks are}} often {{used to examine the}} {{language}} development of children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). These tasks are complex, due to both linguistically and <b>cognitively</b> <b>demands.</b> Earlier studies show that age matched typically developing children (TD) outperform children with SLI on both content (semantic-pragmatic skills) and form (morphosyntactic skills) of narratives and that children with SLI show a dissociation between form and content skills. However, there is less information about narrative skills of children with SLI in comparison to younger, language matched TD children. Therefore, this study compares narrative ability of children with SLI (age 6 & 7) to that of younger TD children (age 4 & 5) matched on passive vocabulary. Both a story generation and a story retelling task were conducted and analyzed for content and form (morphosyntactical complexity and correctness). The results show that children with SLI in the domain of narrative content only differ from younger TD children for variety of content words during story retelling. There are no differences found for morphological complexity, but significantly more morphosyntactic errors were made in the SLI group. Thereby, the children in the SLI group show most often a dissociation in which form is relatively less developed than content, where the TD children show a balanced development. Task effects were found in favor of story retelling for content variables. The results indicate that children with SLI show a delay for both content and form, but that realizing adequate morphosyntactic sentences seem to be most vulnerable during narration. With these results clinical linguists and speech therapists have more information about the narrative development in young children and in children with SLI which can guide their diagnostic and therapeutic work...|$|R
