5|$|Lukić {{notes that}} the {{mortality}} rate among the <b>children</b> <b>at</b> Jastrebarsko was much {{lower than that of}} <b>children</b> <b>at</b> Stara Gradiška and Sisak for two reasons. Firstly, that almost half the <b>children</b> <b>at</b> Jastrebarsko were older children more able to cope with the harsh conditions. More importantly, that from the end of July, twenty-six volunteer nurses from the teachers' school at Rude near Samobor, along with several doctors and other medical personnel, under the leadership of Marinić, began to intervene with the camp administration and Ustaše guards to improve the health of the children. The Ustaše propaganda soon took advantage of the improved condition of the children.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the idea}} of the greater Elves, Tolkien also {{developed}} {{the idea of}} children visiting Valinor, the island-homeland of the Elves in their sleep. Elves would also visit <b>children</b> <b>at</b> night and comfort them if they had been chided or were upset. This theme, linking elves with children's dreams and nocturnal travelling was largely abandoned in Tolkien's later writing.|$|E

5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For <b>children</b> <b>at</b> risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E

5|$|The {{apparent}} seasonality {{may also}} be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors, near infected people, and specifically <b>children</b> <b>at</b> school. There is some controversy {{over the role of}} low body temperature as a risk factor for the common cold; the majority of the evidence suggests that it may result in greater susceptibility to infection.|$|E

5|$|According to the 2006 Canadian census, {{there were}} 10,994 {{people living in}} 4,650 {{households}} within the city (the official provincial estimate was 11,093 people). Of the federally surveyed households, 33% were one-person households, slightly above the 28% average provincewide; households consisting of couples with <b>children,</b> <b>at</b> 26%, were {{very close to the}} provincial average; and households of couples without <b>children,</b> <b>at</b> 24%, were below the provincial average of 30%. Among its 3,000 census families, Dawson Creek had a smaller proportion of married couples than the province, 62% compared to 73%, but the same average number of persons per family, 2.9. With 92% of Dawson Creek residents being Canadian-born, and 93% speaking only English, the city has few visible minorities. Only 17% of residents aged 35–64 had a university certificate or diploma, compared to the provincewide rate of 29%. Among those aged 25–64, 20% did not have a high school certificate or equivalent, much higher than the 12% provincewide rate.|$|E

5|$|Cal also {{exhibits}} feminine characteristics, {{which allows}} Dr. Luce to classify her as possessing a female gender identity. In a home video taken when Cal was a child, his mother {{gives him a}} doll and he nurses it with a milk bottle.

Luce then concludes that gender identity is nurtured and etched into <b>children</b> <b>at</b> their young ages.|$|E

30|$|In Birth order 4, mother’s education, religion, gender, breastfeeding, wealth index, {{standard}} of living, size of <b>child</b> <b>at</b> birth and birth interval are statistically significant. Breastfeeding, wealth index and {{standard of}} living increase the chance of under-five survival. A below average size of <b>child</b> <b>at</b> birth {{increases the risk of}} dying by {{two and a half times}} compared to an above average size of <b>child</b> <b>at</b> birth (OR, 2.56, 95 % CI, 1.80 - 3.65). A birth interval of greater than 24 months increases under-five survival significantly. Muslim religion acts as a protective factor in under-five survival compared to Hindu religion. Female <b>children</b> are <b>at</b> a 26 % (OR, 1.26; 95 % CI, 1.01 – 1.58) greater risk of dying than male children.|$|R
5|$|Croup is a {{relatively}} common condition that affects about 15% of <b>children</b> <b>at</b> some point.

Before vaccination, croup was frequently caused by diphtheria and was often fatal. This cause is now very rare in the Western world due {{to the success of}} the diphtheria vaccine.|$|E

5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated <b>children</b> <b>at</b> the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his {{arguments}} against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E
