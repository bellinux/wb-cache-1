The reconstruction of this data is considered possible by some characters, allegedly due to the requirement of access to the voting machines and knowledge of the password. As an extra measure of reassurance, the CNE agreed to format the data held on the voting machines as soon as these finished transmitting their precinct totals to the CNE. As long as every voting machine also printed its precinct totals, it was easy for all involved parties to check the validity of the data as reported in both instances, the printed precinct totals and the partial results reported in the CNE tallying center.|$|R

40|$|Background: Obesity-related {{diseases}} cause {{costs to}} society. We studied {{the cost of}} work absenteeism before and after gastric bypass {{and the effects of}} postoperative diabetes resolution. Patients and Methods: Data were obtained from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg) (national coverage > 98 %) and <b>cross-matched</b> with <b>data</b> from the Social insurance Agency (coverage 100 %) for the period ± 3 years from operation. In 2010, a total of 7454 bariatric surgeries were performed; the study group is 4971 unique individuals with an annual income of > 10, 750 Euros and complete data sets. A sex-, age-, and income-matched reference population was identified for comparison. Results: Patients with obesity had preoperatively a 3. 5 -fold higher absenteeism. During follow-up (FU), the ratio relative to the reference population remained constant. An increase of 12 – 14 net absenteeism days was observed in the first 3 months after surgery. Female sex (OR 1. 5, CI 1. 13 – 1. 8), preoperative anti-depressant use (OR 1. 5, CI 1. 3 – 1. 9), low income (OR 1. 4, CI 1. 2 – 1. 8), and a history of sick leave (OR 1. 004, CI 1. 003 – 1. 004) were associated with increased absenteeism during FU. Diabetes resolution did not decrease absenteeism from preoperative values. Conclusions: Patients with obesity have higher preoperative absenteeism than the reference population. Operation caused an increase the first 90 days after surgery of 12 – 13 days. There were no relative increases in absenteeism in the next 3 years; patients did not deviate from preoperative patterns but followed the trend of the reference population.

40|$|Fundamental atomic parameters, such as {{oscillator}} strengths, play a {{key role}} in modelling and understanding the chemical composition of stars in the universe. Despite the significant work underway to produce these parameters for many astrophysically important ions, uncertainties in these parameters remain large and can propagate throughout the entire field of astronomy. The Belgian repository of fundamental atomic data and stellar spectra (BRASS) aims to provide the largest systematic and homogeneous quality assessment of atomic data to date in terms of wavelength, atomic and stellar parameter coverage. To prepare for it, we first compiled multiple literature occurrences of many individual atomic transitions, from several atomic databases of astrophysical interest, and assessed their agreement. Several atomic repositories were searched and their data retrieved and formatted in a consistent manner. Data entries from all repositories were cross-matched against our initial BRASS atomic line list to find multiple occurrences of the same transition. Where possible we used a non-parametric cross-match depending only on electronic configurations and total angular momentum values. We also checked for duplicate entries of the same physical transition, within each retrieved repository, using the non-parametric cross-match. We report the cross-matched transitions for each repository and compare their fundamental atomic parameters. We find differences in log(gf) values of up to 2 dex or more. We also find and report that ~ 2 % of our line list and Vienna Atomic Line Database retrievals are composed of duplicate transitions. Finally we provide a number of examples of atomic spectral lines with different log(gf) values, and discuss the impact of these uncertain log(gf) values on quantitative spectroscopy.

40|$|Modern Astrophysics {{is based}} on multi-wavelength data {{organized}} into large and heterogeneous catalogs. Hence, the need for efficient, reliable and scalable catalog cross-matching methods {{plays a crucial role}} in the era of the petabyte scale. Furthermore, multi-band data have often very different angular resolution, requiring the highest generality of cross-matching features, mainly in terms of region shape and resolution. In this work we present C- 3 (Command-line Catalog Cross-match), a multi-platform application designed to efficiently cross-match massive catalogs. It {{is based on}} a multi-core parallel processing paradigm and conceived to be executed as a stand-alone command-line process or integrated within any generic data reduction/analysis pipeline, providing the maximum flexibility to the end-user, in terms of portability, parameter configuration, catalog formats, angular resolution, region shapes, coordinate units and cross-matching types. Using real data, extracted from public surveys, we discuss the cross-matching capabilities and computing time efficiency also through a direct comparison with some publicly available tools, chosen among the most used within the community, and representative of different interface paradigms. We verified that the C- 3 tool has excellent capabilities to perform an efficient and reliable <b>cross-matching</b> between large <b>data</b> sets.

40|$|The WISE {{satellite}} {{surveyed the}} entire sky multiple times in four infrared (IR) wavelengths (3. 4, 4. 6, 12, and 22 μm, Wright et al. 2010). This all-sky IR photometric survey {{makes it possible}} to leverage many of the large publicly available spectroscopic redshift surveys to measure galaxy properties in the IR. While characterizing the <b>cross-matching</b> of WISE <b>data</b> to a single survey is a straightforward process, doing it with six different redshift surveys takes a fair amount of space to characterize adequately, because each survey has unique caveats and characteristics that need addressing. This work describes a data set that results from matching five public redshift surveys with the AllWISE data release, along with a reanalysis of the data described in Lake et al. 2012. The combined data set has an additional flux limit of 80 μJy (19. 14 AB mag) in WISE's W 1 filter imposed in order to limit it to targets with high completeness and reliable photometry in the AllWISE data set. Consistent analysis of all of the data is only possible if the color bias discussed in Ilbert et al. (2004) is addressed (for example: the techniques explored in the first paper in this series Lake et al. 2017 b).

40|$|Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) aims {{to reduce}} pain and improve mobility, {{function}} {{and quality of}} life in patients with osteoarthritis, when non-surgical treatment has failed. Despite good or excellent results in the majority of patients, some of them are dissatisfied. This variability in outcome is multifactorial. Preoperative information, hospital care and postoperative rehabilitation may be more demanding if the patient is not familiar with the domestic language, belongs to a cultural minority or lives in poor socioeconomic circumstances. This thesis aimed to investigate the influence of ethnicity and socioeconomic factors on the outcome after primary THA. Demographic information and data relating the surgical procedure, patient reported outcome collected preoperatively and one year after the operation and any subsequent revision/reoperation were retrieved from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register. <b>Cross-matching</b> with <b>data</b> from the Patient Register and Statistics Sweden was performed to retrieve information about comorbidities, cohabiting, education, and country of birth. Interviews and a self-administered questionnaire on given preoperative information, pre- and postoperative pain and patient satisfaction including the DASS 21 score for mental health of patients were also used. The interviews were analyzed using content analysis according to Graneheim and Lundman. The patients were analyzed in four groups (born in Sweden, the Nordic countries, Europe and outside Europe including the Soviet Union) or two groups (born in or outside Sweden). Patients from both groups in the qualitative study, expressed concern about inadequate pre-operative information on implants used, pain relief, choice of anaesthesia, no or too short a time to put questions to the surgeon and an overall stressful clinical situation. All the immigrant groups had more negative interference relating to self-care (p≤ 0. 02), some immigrant groups tended to have more problems with their usual activities (p≤ 0. 05) and patients from Europe and outside Europe more frequently reported problems with anxiety/depression (p≤ 0. 005). Patients born abroad showed an overall tendency to report more pain on the VAS than patients born in Sweden. One year after the operation the immigrant groups reported lower values in all EQ- 5 D dimensions. After adjustment for covariates including the preoperative baseline value most of these differences remained apart from pain/discomfort and regarding immigrants from the Nordic countries, anxiety/depression as well. One year after the operation pain according to the VAS had decreased substantially in all groups. The immigrant groups indicated however more pain than those born in Sweden both before and after adjustment for covariates (p< 0. 001). Patients born outside Sweden had generally a poorer mental health than those born in Sweden. The risk of revision and reoperation within a period of two years did not differ between immigrants and patients born in Sweden. The difficulties for the patients born outside Sweden may depend on cultural differences, communication problems and differences in indications. This patient group could benefit from improved pre-and postoperative information and other measures to facilitate and improve their rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|The {{datasets}} {{described here}} bring together quality-controlled seawater temperature measurements from over 130  years of departmental government-funded marine science investigations in the UK (United Kingdom). Since before {{the foundation of}} a Marine Biological Association fisheries laboratory in 1902 and through subsequent evolutions as the Directorate of Fisheries Research and the current Centre for Environment Fisheries & Aquaculture Science, UK government marine scientists and observers have been collecting seawater temperature data as part of oceanographic, chemical, biological, radiological, and other policy-driven research and observation programmes in UK waters. These datasets start with a few tens of records per year, rise to hundreds from the early 1900 s, thousands by 1959, and hundreds of thousands by the 1980 s, peaking with [*]>[*]  1  million for some years from 2000 onwards. The data source systems vary from time series at coastal monitoring stations or offshore platforms (buoys), through repeated research cruises or opportunistic sampling from ferry routes, to temperature extracts from CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) profiles, oceanographic, fishery and plankton tows, and data collected from recreational scuba divers or electronic devices attached to marine animals. The datasets described have not been included in previous seawater temperature collation exercises (e. g. International Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set, Met Office Hadley Centre sea surface temperature data set, the centennial in situ observation-based estimates of sea surface temperatures), although some summary data reside in the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) archive, the Marine Environment Monitoring and Assessment National (MERMAN) database and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) data centre. We envisage the data primarily providing a biologically and ecosystem-relevant context for regional assessments of changing hydrological conditions around the British Isles, although <b>cross-matching</b> with satellite-derived <b>data</b> for surface temperatures at specific times and in specific areas is another area in which the data could be of value (see e. g. Smit et al.,  2013). Maps are provided indicating geographical coverage, which is generally within and around the UK Continental Shelf area, but occasionally extends north from Labrador and Greenland to east of Svalbard and southward to the Bay of Biscay. Example potential uses of the data are described using plots of data in four selected groups of four ICES rectangles covering areas of particular fisheries interest. The full dataset enables extensive data synthesis, for example in the southern North Sea where issues of spatial and numerical bias from a data source are explored. The full dataset also facilitates the construction of long-term temperature time series and an examination of changes in the phenology (seasonal timing) of ecosystem processes. This is done for a wide geographic area with an exploration of the limitations of data coverage over long periods. Throughout, we highlight and explore potential issues around the simple combination of data from the diverse and disparate sources collated here.
