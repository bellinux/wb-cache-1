40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{a valuable tool}} for winemaking industry to measure the acidity parameters with rapid response, simple sample handling, with no or minimal pre-treatment. Thus, a sequential injection analysis (SIA) system with spectrophotometric detection was used as platform {{for the development of}} methodologies for the quantification of volatile and total acidity in wine samples. Both procedures make use of the same <b>colour</b> <b>reagent,</b> bromothymol blue (BTB) that changes its intrinsic colour {{in the presence of the}} acidity compounds. The volatile acidity value was attained with the separation of the volatile fraction of acids by means of a membrane separation technique, a gas-diffusion unit. For the total acidity value, the sample was merged with the <b>colour</b> <b>reagent</b> on the way towards detection. The fixed acidity is a result of the difference from the total and the volatile acidity. The presented tool displayed a low sample and reagent consumption, 346 and 102 μL of sample and 37 and 32 μg of BTB, for the volatile acidity (VA) and for the total acidity (TA), respectively. The observed limits of detection and quantification were 0. 03 and 0. 01 g L− 1 (VA) and 0. 09 and 0. 02 g L− 1 (TA) with high determination rates, 35 (VA) and 62 (TA) determinations per hour.

This expands the film, stressing the PVDF and generating an electric charge which is measured using a lock-in amplifier. The signal dependence on optical absorption length, thermal diffusion length, film uniformity and porosity, chopper frequency and amplifier phase synchronisation are reviewed. The design and selection of molecular receptors for phenols, and the fabrication of thin films suitable for SPR, are described together with results demonstrating response patterns to different phenols and products of atmospheric aging of phenol solutions.

Cyanide is said to be released during the processing of cyanogenic plant parts which tobacco plant is one of them. This work determines the concentration of total cyanide in waste water collected in and around a tobacco company. Distillation was carried out followed by spectrophotometric analysis with pyridine-barbituric acid as the <b>colour</b> forming <b>reagent</b> and absorbance was measured at 578 nm using UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The result revealed total cyanide in each sample as follows (mg/l) : 0. 641 + 0. 004, 0. 443 + 0. 007, 0. 319 + 0. 007, 0. 184 + 0. 001 and 0. 403 + 0. 004, for untreated wastewater sample, treated waste water sample from the factory, Lake water sample beside the factory where the effluent is released, upstream and downstream of a river located about 1 km away from the factory, respectively. Highest value was recorded for sample collected from down-stream of the river while, sample collected from the upstream have the minimum level. The levels are significantly higher than the maximum permissible levels recommended by WHO (0. 2 mg/l), European Union and National Agency for Food, Drugs and Administration Control (NAFDAC) (0. 001 mg/l) at P= 0. 05. Based on these findings, water from the lake and river beside the factory may not be good for drinking...|$|R
30|$|Starch {{content was}} {{determined}} using a modified method of Takeshita et al. (2014). Briefly, 0.5  g of each sample was homogenized in 80  % ethanol at 50  °C to remove sugars. The residue was separated by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 10  min then washed repeatedly with 80  % ethanol at 50  °C until the washings {{did not give}} a <b>colour</b> with anthrone <b>reagent</b> and removed all pigments. This residue was completely dried over a water bath then 2.5  mL of water and 2.5  mL of 60  % perchloric acid were added. These tubes were kept at 0  °C for 20  min for starch extraction. The supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 10  min and stored. The extraction was repeated using fresh 60  % perchloric acid and the supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 10  min. From the supernatant, 1  mL of extract was pipetted and 4  mL of anthrone reagent was added to each tube. Afterwards, the test tubes were heated in a boiling water bath for 10  min then cooled to room temperature, and the absorbance at 630  nm was measured using a spectrophotometer. Glucose {{was used as a}} standard for calibration graph to determine glucose concentration in samples. Starch content was calculated by multiplying the value by a factor 0.9.|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Rapid {{susceptibility}} {{testing of}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains is imperative for therapy selection but traditional drug susceptibility tests take weeks or are expensive. In {{this study we}} evaluated nitrate reductase assay which utilizes the detection of nitrate reduction {{as an indication of}} growth and therefore results can be obtained faster than by visual detection of colonies. Methods: One hundred clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis were tested for four first line antitubercular drugs by nitrate reductase assay (NRA) and were compared with standard proportion method. The bacteria were inoculated on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium with primary antitubercular drugs and potassium nitrate was incorporated. After incubation for 7 - 14 days, nitrate reduction indicating growth could be detected by <b>colour</b> change when <b>reagents</b> were added. Results: Resistance of isolates as determined by both methods for isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol was 32, 35, 62 and 15 per cent respectively. Agreement between NRA and proportion method was 99 per cent for isoniazid and ethambutol. Complete agreement (100 %) was found for rifampicin and streptomycin. Results were available in 7 - 14 days by NRA as compared to proportion method which takes 4 - 6 wk. Interpretation & conclusion: Nitrate reductase assay is a rapid and inexpensive method for susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis for primary antitubercular drugs and could be an appropriate alternative to existing methods, particularly in resource-poor settings...|$|R
