40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the voltage {{balancing}} problem in flying capacitor multilevel inverters (FCMI). Multilevel inverters have been {{proved to be a}} preferred solution for medium- and high-voltage applications.

In this thesis, the cause of capacitor voltages instability in FCMI under sub-harmonic PWM modulation has been particularly studied. Voltage transients of <b>clamping</b> <b>capacitors</b> were characterized. For three-level FCMI operating under sub-harmonic PWM modulation, the <b>clamping</b> <b>capacitor</b> voltage is self-balancing.

The foremost objectives are to develop high efficiency, high power density topologies such as: buck, synchronous buck and multiphase buck converters, {{with the implementation of}} soft switching technology to reduce switching losses maintaining voltage and current stresses within the permissible range. Demand of low voltage power supply for telecom system leads to narrow duty cycle which compels to increase operating switching frequency. Design of conventional buck converter under narrow duty cycle is quite objectionable since it leads to poor utilization of components as well as it degrades the system efficiency.
