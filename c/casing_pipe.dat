40|$|Corrosion {{monitoring}} and {{early detection of}} pits and wall thinning {{is important to the}} gas and petroleum industry. A new noncontact AC electromagnetic induction system has been developed for {{monitoring and}} detecting corrosion in multistring casing configuration. The system includes a sonde which has a transmitter coil and three receiver coils, with the transmitter circuit generating three low different frequencies at the same time. The multifrequency AC current through the transmitter coil induces in the pipe wall a longitudinal alternating magnetic field which is sensed by three receiver coils located at different distances. The multiple transmitter frequencies and the multiple transmitter-receiver spacings can provide the maximum flexibility and the most extensive information in quantitatively determining the total wall thickness in single, dual, and three-string casing configuration. The transmitter circuits are designed to work at up to 175 °C without having a second breakdown. Since the dynamic range of received signal is very broad and the 2 ̆ 2 road note 2 ̆ 2 is severe, the high-stable high-accurate band pass filter and hard limiters are adopted in the receiver circuit and phase detect circuit.

40|$|AbstractWorking {{conditions}} of <b>casing</b> <b>pipes</b> in drilling rigs can significantly influence the initiation {{and development of}} damage in the material, and therefore also the safe service of the entire system. In this work, an integrity assessment of a steel pipe with initial defect (machined surface crack) is presented. The position of this defect is on the external surface; unlike transport pipes, where internal surface is often endangered due to the contact with the fluid, <b>casing</b> <b>pipes</b> are often exposed to damages at the external surface. Analyzed crack is in axial direction, bearing in mind {{that this type of}} defect most significantly decreases the load carrying capacity of the cylindrical pressurized components. A pipe segment exposed to internal pressure is analyzed experimentally and numerically, using the finite element method. The experimental setup included the tracking of crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) values, as well as J integral, which is determined by application of direct measurement. Criteria for pipe failure are determined on finite element models of the pipe; fracture initiation and plastic collapse are considered as failure mechanisms. The size of the crack is varied in the finite element models; several 3 D models with different crack sizes (length and depth) are evaluated. Dependence of maximum internal pressure on the defect size is obtained. 2 D plane strain models are also examined, with an aim to determine the applicability limits of this simplified approach. Based on the obtained results, integrity assessment criteria for the analyzed geometries are discussed...|$|R

In some areas A.S.T.M. specifications may be required by project engineers. The specification most commonly called for is A.S.T.M. 139 Grade B.

50|$|The process {{starts with}} the {{receiving}} hole and entrance pits. These pits will allow the drilling fluid to be collected and reclaimed to reduce costs and prevent waste. The first stage drills a pilot hole on the designed path, and the second stage (reaming) enlarges the hole by passing a larger cutting tool known as the back reamer. The reamer's diameter depends {{on the size of}} the pipe to be pulled back through the bore hole. The driller increases the diameter according to the outer diameter or the conduit and to achieve optimal production.

40|$|Using the {{conventional}} well cements {{consisting of the}} calcium silicate hydrates (CaO-SiO{sub 2 }-H{sub 2 }O system) and calcium aluminum silicate hydrates (CaO-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }-SiO{sub 2 }-H{sub 2 }O system) for the integrity of geothermal wells, the serious concern confronting the cementing industries was their poor performance in mechanically supporting the metallic well <b>casing</b> <b>pipes</b> and in mitigating the pipe's corrosion in very harsh geothermal reservoirs. These difficulties are particularly acute in two geological regions: One is the deep hot downhole area ({approx} 1700 m depth at temperatures of {approx} 320 C) that contains hyper saline water with high concentrations of CO{sub 2 } (> 40, 000 ppm) in conjunction with {approx} 100 ppm H{sub 2 }S at a mild acid of pH {approx} 5. 0; {{the other is the}} upper well region between the well's surface and {approx} 1000 m depth at temperatures up to 200 C. The specific environment of the latter region is characterized by highly concentrated H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } (pH < 1. 5) brine containing at least 5000 ppm CO{sub 2 }. When these conventional cements are emplaced in these harsh environments, their major shortcoming is their susceptibility to reactions with hot CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }SO 4, thereby causing their deterioration brought about by CO{sub 2 }-catalyzed carbonation and acid-initiated erosion. Such degradation not only reduced rapidly the strength of cements, lowering the mechanical support of <b>casing</b> <b>pipes,</b> but also increased the extent of permeability of the brine through the cement layer, promoting the rate of the pipe's corrosion. Severely carbonated and acid eroded cements often impaired the integrity of a well in less than one year; in the worst cases, casings have collapsed within three months, leading to the need for costly and time-consuming repairs or redrilling operations. These were the reasons why the geothermal well drilling and cementing industries were concerned about using conventional well cements, and further their deterioration was a major impediment in expediting the development of geothermal energy resources...|$|R
30|$|The {{ultrasonic}} {{pulse echo}} method {{is one of}} the primary methods for detection of important parameters outside the well casings (Ellis and Singer 2007). The radial measurement technique of this method reduces the effect of the microannulus (Guo et al. 2009) outside the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe</b> and is much less sensitive to tool centralization (Tubman et al. 1984). However, the method has some inherent measurement problems. Numerous studies have tried to eliminate several of these problems. Albert et al. (1988) analyzed the ability of cement bond logs (CBL), ratio bond tool (RBT), and pulse echo tool (PET) logs to detect channels in the casing circumference using a physical model. Pialucha and Cawley (1994) studied the relationship of impedances, layer thickness, and wavelength of the ultrasonic waves employed. Yao et al. (2002, 2005) carried out a quantitative inversion of the wave impedance and the thickness of the media outside the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe</b> with a composite reflection coefficient. Che and Qiao (2003) and Ding et al. (2011) analyzed the spectral properties of reflected waves and developed a semi-quantitative detection method for wave impedance and thickness of the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe.</b> Yuning and Xiaoyu (2013) studied the effect of the microannulus on acoustic amplitude. Yuhuan et al. (2014) analyzed the effect of microannulus size on sonic wave propagation. The studies described above revealed the existence of a complex multi-peak-search problem in thickness determination. The above methods overcome this problem by transformations of the objective function. However, the accuracy of the determination methods depends on accurate parameter estimation (e.g., the thickness of the <b>casing</b> <b>pipe).</b> In practice, it is difficult to measure or estimate these parameters accurately.|$|E
