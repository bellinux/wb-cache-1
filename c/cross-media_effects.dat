40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} role of fit between campaign ads in generating <b>cross-media</b> <b>effects.</b> Using an ecologically valid design, this article enhances our understanding of <b>cross-media</b> <b>effects</b> in real life. By combining a content analysis of Dutch cross-media campaigns with a secondary data analysis of tracking studies on the same campaigns (n = 900), this research revealed that fit contributed positively to campaign evaluations yet contributed negatively to brand and campaign memory. In conclusion, this research shows that fit {{is an important factor}} in understanding cross-media synergy but might have both positive and negative effects...|$|E
40|$|Effects of persuasive {{messages}} {{depend on}} the content of the message itself and on the media or tools that deliver the persuasive messages. Nowadays almost all campaigns make use of multiple media or multiple promotional tools. Therefore, it is important to study so-called cross-media (or cross-tools) effects. <b>Cross-media</b> <b>effects</b> and cross-tools effects are mainly studied in the field of advertising and marketing. In cross-media campaigns, marketers seek to maximize the effectiveness of their budgets by exploiting the unique strengths of each advertising medium (for example, advertising on television and on the Internet). In cross-tools campaigns, marketers combine multiple promotion instruments or marketing communication forms, such as advertising, publicity, direct marketing, and sales promotion. Cross-tools effects {{are an important part of}} the concept of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC). The ultimate goal of cross-media or cross-tools campaigns is to induce synergy, whereby the combined effect of multiple marketing activities exceeds the sum of the individual effects. While cross-media and cross-tools effects are a hot topic in the advertising industry, academic theoretical and empirical literature is very scarce. This bibliography provides an overview of the existing academic literature and consists of two parts. The first part focuses on <b>cross-media</b> <b>effects,</b> the second part on cross-tools effects. The main streams of research within these two topics are distinguished and the most important citations are provided...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} gives {{insight into}} two {{elements that are}} critical for expanding {{our understanding of the}} websites of brands. The first element represents the key characteristic of websites: interactivity. The dissertation investigates two forms of interactivity: actual and perceived interactivity. It also disentangles the relationship between these constructs on the websites of the top 100 global brands. The second element is related to the role of websites in marketing communication campaigns: its contribution to <b>cross-media</b> <b>effects.</b> The dissertation shows why cross-media campaigns are more effective than single medium campaigns. It also investigates the role of media sequence and product involvement in cross-media campaigns using websites in combination with TV commercials...|$|E
40|$|Cross-media advertising, {{in which}} more than one medium {{platform}} is used to communicate related brand content, has become widespread. Several reasons for cross-media strategies can be distinguished: target group extension, complementary effects, repetition, and synergy. Media synergy—the added value of a medium {{as a result of the}} presence of another medium—is considered a possible main advantage of cross-media advertising. Four processes which may underlie <b>cross-media</b> synergy <b>effects</b> are described in this chapter: encoding variability, multiple source credibility, forward encoding, and backward retrieval. This chapter also discusses factors that influence the <b>effects</b> of <b>cross-media</b> advertising, such as fit, sequence, and the multitasking consumer. There is little media planning data for cross-media campaigns, because audience readership research has traditionally focused on each medium separately; thus, information about the overlaps between people’s use of various media is lacking. The chapter discusses new developments in audience readership research which are important for cross-media campaigns, as well as designs for <b>cross-media</b> <b>effect</b> research...|$|R

In this article, a structural-dynamic model of a livestock-crop operation is calibrated with data from a representative farm and is used to predict the effects of nitrogen regulations. Policy simulations clarify the importance of dynamic elements and demonstrate three main results: (1) cost estimates are relatively high; (2) <b>cross-media</b> pollution <b>effects</b> are potentially large; and (3) improved input management appears most promising for reducing both emissions and waste management costs.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} years, {{the number of}} {{installed}} biofuels power plants is increased in northern Italy, due to favorable legislation on renewable energy sources, posing the issue to assess the resulting environmental effects. The European legislation on emissions for renewable fuels power plants provides guidelines to be integrated in the local regulations; moreover, local authorities have to identify the critical power plants in terms of pollution and the key parameters to grant licenses for the future plants. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe a methodology and the calculation routine developed to assess the environmental effects of biomass plants in terms of simple indexes. The used approach is based on the <b>Cross-Media</b> <b>Effects</b> described by a European Commission Reference Document. In particular, several indexes are introduced to cover the most relevant environmental effects, as: air toxicity, global warming, acidification, eutrophication and photochemical ozone creation. For every considered pollutant (such as NOx, CO, etc.) directly emitted by the power plant, specific factors have been identified, in order to calculate the contribution to the different environmental indexes. Finally, a numerical evaluation of different biomass power plants, installed in Emilia Romagna region, is provided, in order to assess their environmental cross-media potential and to compare such kind of power plants with large scale, fossil-fuelled power plants...|$|E
40|$|Despite their popularity, {{the reasons}} why {{cross-media}} campaigns are more successful than single medium campaigns are still unknown. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study is (a) to investigate which psychological processes are present when people are exposed to cross-media campaigns, and (b) to examine to what extent these processes contribute to campaign results. Three psychological processes are investigated to gain insight into the effectiveness of cross-media campaigns: forward encoding (i. e., the ad in the first medium primes interest in the ad in the second medium); image transfer (i. e., mentally replaying the ad previously viewed during exposure to the ad in the second medium); and multiple source perception (i. e., believing the brand is good and popular because of the amount of advertising). To identify the role of these processes, 219 participants were exposed to one of four media conditions (two cross-media conditions and two repeated media conditions). The results showed that two processes were present when participants were exposed to the cross-media combinations: forward encoding and multiple source perception. We also found support for the hypothesis that these two processes contributed to campaign results. However, the third process, image transfer, was present in all conditions and did not add to the explanation of <b>cross-media</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|E
40|$|Public Service Media (PSM) online is {{a highly}} up to date topic. There is no clear {{consensus}} among researchers if Public Service Media should have a le-gitimization online and if so to which extent. Some authors still demand for an extensive role of public service provision in the digital era whereas others either argue against PSM {{on the internet at}} all or assign them a restrictive and complementing function at the most. The question has furthermore concerned the European Commission as well as several Member States for many years now. Public service broadcasters have been accused of distorting competition online – an area that up to then seemed to have worked being left to the market. Though the extension of public service providers towards the internet is legitimized by the European Commission it seems appropriate to analyze if there is a true economic justification for having Public Service Media online and if so to which extent. This article contributes to enter into that question against the background that the traditional public service broadcasting system (i. e. television and radio) is taken as given and unchangeable for the analysis. The paper thereby waives to repeat the fundamental discussion of pros and cons of public service provision and, instead, concentrates specifically on elaborating possible <b>cross-media</b> <b>effects.</b> media economics, two-sided markets, competition, public service broadcasting, public service media...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of <b>cross-media</b> {{advertising}} <b>effects</b> {{is mainly}} based on explicit psychological measures, such as self-reports. To {{fully understand the}} mechanisms responsible {{for the success of}} cross-media advertising, it is important to also use implicit measures. We used both types of measures to assess whether exposure to different media combinations affects the cognitive and evaluative impact of advertising. Results show that participants performed better on all explicit and implicit measures of memory and brand preference after exposure (versus no exposure) to target ads, which validated the use of these measures. Comparison of cross-media versus single medium exposure showed differences on the explicit level, but not on the implicit level. This suggests (1) that cross-media advantages may be driven by explicit rather than implicit memory mechanisms, and (2) that implicit advertising effects may require more drastic manipulations than context changes, such as varying the combination of media used for exposure to advertising...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the Finnish {{contribution}} to the second exchange of information defined in the Council Directive 96 / 61 /EC and to {{the preparation of the}} second Reference Document of the European Commission on Best Available Techniques in the Pulp and Paper Industry (BREF). The report is the work of Pöyry Forest Industry Consulting Oy on behalf of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation and Finnish Environment Institute. In this report, a series of suggestions for improvements to the BREF are given. The suggestions are shored up with reasoning and examples behind them. Among key messages in this document we find: - Uphold and emphasise the key principles of the BAT BREF, and increase the readability of the BREF. - The need for ensuring smooth running and minimising accidental releases should be emphasised in the BREF. One way to ensure smoother running is to use simpler processes. - <b>Cross-media</b> <b>effects</b> should be further emphasised in the BREF. Lack of cross-media information and integrated views in decision making can result in wrong measures taken. -  The chapters dealing with new techniques could be improved by reshaping them into a readable, clear and concise analysis of the current technology trends and selected techniques, not forgetting key principles of the BREF. -  Based on information on both Finnish and international mills, it seems that not all the BAT ranges are on same level of stringency. In addition, BAT techniques do not necessarily go hand in hand with BAT emissions levels. It is recommended that this report is read together with the first pulp and paper BREF...|$|E
40|$|The Climate and Pollution Agency (Klif) {{consider}} {{target of}} national environmental policies when determining which abatement costs are cost-effective. They demand transparent cost/benefit evaluations from operators when considering both {{emissions to air}} {{in light of the}} climate policy and dicharges to sea in light of the zero hazardous discharge policy. This work has established performance evaluation criteria for the documentation of BAT through a BAT report. The requirements and performance specifications could be used by Klif or other parties to assess whether the BAT evaluations (of Environmental Impact Assessments) are sufficient. The requirements and performance specifications could be used by Statoil to assess and give feedback on BAT evaluations done by contractors. The performance specifications rated ''Acceptable'' and ''Excellent'' should be used to develop guidelines for BAT evaluations. The performances could be converted to steps in a novel guideline or be used as performance specifications to steps in a guideline developed from another basis, e. g. the BAT Reference Document on Economics and <b>Cross-Media</b> <b>Effects.</b> It is recommended that Statoil performs an evaluation of the impact different ways of organising HSE work in projects influences the quality of BAT evaluations. One or preferably more development projects should be evaluated to see whether BAT evaluations were performed in time for BAT to be implemented. Any cases where too late evaluation of processes have blocked the best available techniques or entailed additional costs should be further analysed to find ways to improve company routines to avoid this in the future. Best practices found in such and a discussion of the place of BAT evalution in the project phases and the information flow between project disciplines would give input to guidelines for scheduling and allocating responsibilities in BAT evaluations. Combined with the requirements to reporting established by this work Statoil could develop complete guidelines for BAT evaluations in projects. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{identify}} and characterize known and new environmental consequences associated with CO 2 capture from power plants, {{transport by pipeline}} and storage in geological formations (CCS). The DPSIR framework, describing environmental Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses, is used to systematically review environmental impact assessment procedures and scientific literature on CCS. Also, it is investigated whether crucial knowledge on environmental impacts is lacking that may postpone the implementation of CCS projects. The {{findings of this study}} are that the capture of CO 2 from power plants results in a change in the environmental profile of the power plant. This change encompasses trade-offs and synergies in the reduction of key atmospheric emissions, being: NOx, SO 2, NH 3, particulate matter, Hg, HF and HCl. The largest trade-offs are found for the emission of NOx and NH 3 when equipping power plants with post-combustion capture. Synergy is expected for SO 2 emissions, which are low for all power plants with CO 2 capture. An increase in water consumption ranging between 32 % and 93 % and an increase in waste and by-product creation with tens of kilotonnes annually is expected for a large-scale power plant (1  GWe), but exact flows and composition are uncertain. The <b>cross-media</b> <b>effects</b> of CO 2 capture are found to be uncertain and not quantified. For the assessment of the safety of CO 2 transport by pipeline at high pressure an important knowledge gap is the absence of validated release and dispersion models for CO 2 releases due to pipeline failures. There is also uncertainty in estimating the failure rates for CO 2 pipelines. Furthermore, uniform CO 2 exposure thresholds, detailed dose-response models and specific CO 2 pipeline regulation are absent. Most gaps in environmental information regarding the CCS chain are identified and characterized for the risk assessment of the underground, non-engineered, part of the storage activity. This uncertainty is considered to be larger for aquifers than for hydrocarbon reservoirs. Failure rates are found to be heavily based on expert opinions and the doseresponse models for ecosystems or target species are not yet developed. Integration and validation of various sub-models describing fate and transport of CO 2 in various compartments of the geosphere is at an infant stage. Concluding, {{it is not possible to}} execute a quantitative risk assessment for the non-engineered part of the storage activity with high confidence. Finally, several recommendations have been formulated to deal with the knowledge gaps identified in this study...|$|E
