In 2006, a documentary <b>called</b> <b>Deliver</b> Us From Evil was made about sexual abuse and primarily focused on one priest and his crimes; it also showed the lengths the Catholic Church would go {{to in order to}} cover up the many reports of sexual abuse.|$|R
50|$|No. 206 Squadron was a Royal Air Force unit employed, until 2005, in the {{maritime}} patrol role with the Nimrod MR.2 at RAF Kinloss, Moray. It {{was announced in}} December 2004 that 206 Squadron would disband on 1 April 2005, with half of its crews being redistributed to Nos. 120 and 201 Squadrons, also stationed at Kinloss. This {{was a part of}} the UK Defence Review <b>called</b> <b>Delivering</b> Security in a Changing World; the Nimrod MR.2 fleet was reduced in number from 21 to 16 as a consequence.|$|R

50|$|One of Wilson's most overtly {{politically}} charged works, a lithograph <b>called</b> <b>Deliver</b> Us From Evil, was created {{while he was}} a student of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1943. In this piece, he comments on the paradoxical nature of World War II, critiquing the United States for fighting for democratic rights in Europe while simultaneously denying African-American citizens those same rights. The left side of the image shows a concentration camp, Nazi soldiers, and Jewish victims, while the right side shows run-down tenement buildings, a lynch mob, and African-American victims. However, despite his criticism of the American government, he did support the war in theory, as he was against fascism and anti-Semitism.|$|R

50|$|The Dement-Zinser House is a {{historic}} house located at 105 Zinser Place in Washington, Illinois. The house was built in 1858 for Richard C. Dement, a businessman and riverboat owner. Its Greek Revival design features a transom and sidelights around the front door, a cornice with a frieze board, and a gable roof with eave returns. The house is the only standing Greek Revival house in Washington and may be the oldest house in the city. Dement sold the house only three years after building it, and it passed through several owners until Dr. Harley Zinser acquired it in 1905. Zinser used his home as his doctor's office, from which {{he served as a}} respected village doctor; he also made house <b>calls,</b> <b>delivered</b> babies, and even treated animals as part of his work. The house remained in Zinser's family until 1994, when the Washington Historical Society bought it for a museum.|$|R

40|$|Making oral presentations {{is one of}} the {{assessment}} components in an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course. Due to tight class schedule, the writer has conducted a two-year research on investigating to what extent an online multi media language-learning package <b>called</b> <b>Delivering</b> Effective Presentations can help students learn and master oral presentation skills. The package was developed by a web-based training company called Learn 2 University (L 2 U) and is accessible via the University Library web page. This paper will first discuss the suitability of the package from the perspective of students. Then it will report the findings of classroom observations. Students were required to conduct two oral presentations, one before using the package (called Classroom Practice or ‘CP’) while the other one after using it (called Assessed Presentation or ‘AP’). Comparisons were made between the two presentations of each student. Results can be summarized by the model proposed by the writer called ‘FACE’, which stands for Freezing, Acquiring, Confirming and Eliminating...|$|R
