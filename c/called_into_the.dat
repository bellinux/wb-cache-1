5|$|He was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Wales Semi-Pro {{team for}} their match against England C in February 2008 {{and made his}} debut in this match, with Wales being {{defeated}} 2–1. He was named in the squad for the Four Nations tournament in May.|$|E
5|$|Buttler was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> senior England squad for the Twenty20 International {{against the}} touring Indian team in 2011. He made his debut for the {{side in the}} match as a {{specialist}} batsman before going on to play against the touring West Indies side later the same season. During the winter of 2011 Buttler was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> England winter performance programme for a batting and wicket-keeping focussed programme in India, and played in the England Lions tours of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. He played against India in Kolkata and then toured with England to play Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates in early 2012, making his One Day International debut. Buttler continued to play regular T20 cricket for England throughout 2012. Against South Africa at Edgbaston he joined Somerset teammate Craig Kieswetter with England on 64/3 with only 16 balls remaining. The pair gave a brutal display of power hitting, raising the final score to 118/5, with Buttler hitting 32 off one over from bowler Wayne Parnell, the second most productive over in International Twenty20 at the time. He was selected in the England squad for the ICC T20 World Cup, playing in all of England's matches in the competition.|$|E

5|$|Despite his low {{score in}} the {{preceding}} match against Middlesex, Harvey was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> team for the Fourth Test at Headingley {{at the expense of}} Barnes. The selectors had overlooked Brown as a replacement for Barnes's opening position. Instead, vice-captain Hassett would move from the middle-order to accompany Morris {{at the top of the}} innings, while Harvey would slot into the middle-order.|$|E
5|$|Ingham was capped {{once for}} Northern Ireland at under-18 level, making his only {{appearance}} in a 2–1 home defeat to the Republic of Ireland on 9 March 1999 in 1999 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualifying. After being understudy to David Miskelly for two under-21 matches in 2000, Ingham made his debut in a 2–0 home defeat to the Czech Republic on 23 March 2001 in 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying. Having made his last under-21 appearance in a 4–0 defeat to the Czech Republic on 5 June 2001 in another qualifier, his international career {{at this level}} concluded with four caps. Ingham was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> senior Northern Ireland squad in August 2002 after Roy Carroll was released. He was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Northern Ireland B squad in May 2003, but was forced to withdraw because of injury. Ingham's form during a loan at Wrexham saw him placed on standby for Northern Ireland's match with Serbia and Montenegro in April 2004. He was named in the Northern Ireland squad for their tour of the Caribbean in May 2004, but dislocated a finger in training in June, which meant he missed out on making his debut.|$|E
5|$|Key {{returned}} to the Test match side after an excellent start to the 2004 season. He reached 1,000runs for the season by 2 June, the earliest date the milestone had been reached for 16 years, and had a run of five centuries in seven innings. However, his limited-overs form was not as goodhe passed fifty only once all season. Despite this, he was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> squad for the NatWest Series against the West Indies and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|As a 16-year-old, Chapman was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> England U–18 team, and captained {{her country}} at that level. Chapman made her senior debut for England at 17, during the 2001 UEFA Women's Championship {{qualification}} tournament, replacing Samantha Britton after 73minutes of a 1–0 win over Switzerland in Bristol on 6May2000. Chapman's first senior start came in an 8–0 reverse to Norway in June2000. Despite the heavy defeat she was praised for her performance by national coach Hope Powell. England {{qualified for the}} final tournament with Chapman named Player of the Match in the away leg of the play-off win over Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 19, Harvey was the {{youngest}} player of the touring party—more than six and half years younger {{than all the other}} members of the squad. An attacking left-handed middle-order batsman, Harvey had become {{the youngest}} Australian to score a Test century, by making 153 in the Fifth Test against India in the preceding Australian summer. However, Harvey struggled early in the tour and had difficulty adapting to English conditions. After being omitted from the first-choice team in the early part of the tour, Harvey's performances improved with increasing familiarity with local conditions, and he was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> team for the Fourth Test, where he batted at No. 5 behind Miller and in front of Loxton due to the injury to Barnes. Upon Barnes’ return for the Fifth Test, the trio were each pushed down one position.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2003–04 season, Kartik took 2/118 and 2/41 for India A in a match against the touring New Zealanders, and was {{overlooked}} for the Test series against the visitors. He managed only a total of 1/84 from 18 overs in the Challenger Trophy but was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ODI team and gained semi-regular appearances during the TVS Trophy against New Zealand and Australia, competing with Kumble and Harbhajan for a regular position in the team. In four matches during the competition, he was economical although not very penetrative, taking four wickets at 38.25 at an economy rate of 3.82.|$|E

5|$|Coulson was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> England {{national}} C team in September 2010 for a {{match against}} Wales, but injury {{prevented him from}} making his debut. In February 2012, he received a second call up, being selected in the squad to face Italy in the 2011–13 International Challenge Trophy on 28 February. Coulson started to make his England C debut, playing the entire match as he and fellow winger Matty Blair played well on the flanks, the match finishing a 1–1 home draw. He finished his England C career with two caps, earned in 2012.|$|E
5|$|During the 193233 {{season that}} saw England tour Australia under Douglas Jardine with their Bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling high speed deliveries at the batsmen's body, rumours circulated that Halcombe could be {{selected for the}} Tests. Halcombe's pace saw him touted as a possible retaliatory outlet against the English. At {{the beginning of the}} season, Halcombe played for Western Australia in a tour match against England. He took 3/48 and 1/38 in a drawn match, including the Bodyline mastermind and captain Douglas Jardine, Bob Wyatt, Les Ames and the Nawab of Pataudi. He was then <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Australian XI in a subsequent tour match. He was less successful on this occasion, taking 1/81 as England scored 7/583. Halcombe was not selected for any other first-class matches during the season.|$|E

In August 1950, Kouma, who was then a Sergeant First Class, sailed for Korea along {{with much of the}} 2nd Infantry Division. It arrived there in late August and was moved into line at the Pusan Perimeter, where US troops were fighting a tight defensive line around the port city of Pusan.|$|E

The two Mercedes cars were separated by two-tenths of a second with the two Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen behind, another half a second down. Red Bull had a slight upturn in fortune, with Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat finishing fifth and sixth respectively. McLaren-Honda had another problematic session as Fernando Alonso stopped the car just after starting his installation lap. Teammate Jenson Button was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit lane as well, citing a similar problem with the engine, but was able to continue later in the session. Felipe Massa experienced smoke in his cockpit both on Friday and Saturday, apparently caused by the new titanium plates underneath the cars which also create sparks when driving over bumps on the track.|$|E
5|$|Heskey {{was called}} into manager Fabio Capello's first squad against Switzerland, {{but had to}} {{withdraw}} due to an injury. He was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> squad for a friendly against the Czech Republic in August 2008 and came on as a 46th-minute substitute, in a match that finished 2–2. He featured in the following 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification victories against Andorra and Croatia. Heskey was alleged to have been racially abused during the match against Croatia, with monkey chants being heard from sections of the Croatia support, after which FIFA opened an investigation, and eventually fined the Croatian Football Federation £15,000 for the incident.|$|E

Elements of the division including the 2nd Brigade participated in one final mission in the United States before inactivation; quelling the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, called Operation Garden Plot.

5|$|Kartik was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Test squad to tour New Zealand in late 2002 after Kumble withdrew, {{but in the}} warm-up match he bowled {{one only}} over, {{in which he was}} {{hammered}} for 23 runs. He then watched from the sidelines as India only fielded one spin bowler—Harbhajan—in the Tests, held on green, pace-friendly surfaces. Kartik returned to India and was ineffective in the zonal one-dayers, taking a total of 1/148 from 24 overs in three matches, conceding more than a run a ball. Combined with his results against the West Indies, the poor returns saw him left out of the 2003 Cricket World Cup squad, with Harbhajan and Kumble preferred.|$|E
5|$|Mackin was <b>called</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> under-21 squad {{for their}} match against England in September 2005. His {{first and only}} {{appearance}} came in a 1–0 defeat to Northern Ireland on 28 February 2006, {{in which he was}} substituted for Rob Davies in the 56th minute. Mackin returned to the under-21 team after being named on the standby list for a match against Turkey in September. He was named on standby for a two-legged play-off against England in October 2008. He was named in the Semi-Pro squad for a friendly against Poland in September 2009, although he was forced to withdraw due to an injury.|$|E
5|$|Mackin was {{involved}} in two matches with the Wales under-17 team, against Scotland and Norway in 2001 and 2002 respectively, {{although he did not}} play in either and remained on the substitutes' bench.
