This study shows {{the results of a}} full scale, building incorporated vertical garden that measured 1. 5 m wide by 2. 8 m high. Air flowed behind the garden substrate, where it was cooled and humidified as it flowed down the back of the garden through its contact with the humid surface. The experimental results were compared to the mathematical model developed by Davis and Hirmer [2]. Overall, it was suspected that variations in ambient temperatures during the measurements taking process had a major influence on the results. In taking the data considered most reliable into account however, the results of the mathematical model end experimental data were within 0. 44 °C.

40|$|Gas turbine (GT) {{power plants}} {{operating}} in arid climates suffer {{a decrease in}} output power during the hot summer months {{because of the high}} specific volume of air drawn by the compressor. <b>Cooling</b> the <b>air</b> intake to the compressor has been widely used to mitigate this shortcoming. Energy and exergy analysis of a GT Brayton cycle coupled to a refrigeration <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> shows a promise for increasing the output power with a little decrease in thermal efficiency.

A relative error on the calculated air velocities of 26 % was observed. The RNG k - epsilon model does not help to improve the prediction of the recirculation.

25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and <b>cooling,</b> see <b>Air</b> flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be <b>cooled</b> with <b>air</b> flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> required. Transpiration <b>cooling</b> results in a much more even temperature profile, as the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is uniformly introduced through pores. Film <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film <b>cooling).</b> Using less <b>air</b> for <b>cooling</b> allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|R
