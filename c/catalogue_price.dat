It was a painting in the post-impressionist manner, and it had arrived after the close of the exhibition in Weldon Street, at which Marjorie had bought it. She had bought it in obedience to a sudden impulse, and its imminence had long weighed upon her conscience. She had gone to the show with Sydney Flor and old Mrs. Flor, Sydney's mother, and a kind of excitement had come upon them at the idea of possessing this particular picture. Mrs. Flor had already bought three Herbins, and her daughter wanted to dissuade her from more. [...] "But they're so delightful," [...] said Mrs. Flor. [...] "You're overrunning your allowance," [...] said Sydney. Disputing the point, they made inquiries for the price, and learnt that this bright epigram in colour was going begging--was even offered at a reduction from the <b>catalogue</b> <b>price.</b> A reduced price always had a strong appeal nowadays to Marjorie's mind. [...] "If you don't get it," [...] she said abruptly, [...] "I shall." ...|$|E

50|$|Unlike other dealers' {{catalogue}}s, Stanley Gibbons {{state that}} their catalogue is a retail price list. In other words, {{if they had}} that exact stamp in stock in the exact condition specified, the current <b>catalogue</b> <b>price</b> is the price that they would charge for it. This contrasts with most other catalogues which are produced by firms that do not sell stamps and therefore base their pricing on an average of market values {{in the country where}} the catalogue is published. In practice, the actual price charged by Stanley Gibbons for an individual stamp may be different from the <b>catalogue</b> <b>price</b> because the specimen for sale is of a different grade, the market conditions have changed since the catalogue was produced, the firm has a plentiful or restricted supply of that stamp, or for a variety of other reasons.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} an important topic of A Tree felling {{in an area}} of garden and landscape design. Although, the tree felling is completely usual process, it is a neglected and very marginal topic {{from the point of view}} of garden and landscape design. In literary sources we can find especially the tree felling from a forestry viewpoint. That is the reason why goals of my thesis are to summarize available information and do an overview of the current state legislation. In the methodical part the thesis is focused on a survey of <b>catalogue</b> <b>price</b> from price lists Areas and landscaping: 823 - 1, Restoration: 823 - 2.

40|$|International audienceThis paper uses stamp <b>catalogue</b> <b>prices</b> to {{investigate}} the returns on British collectible postage stamps over the period 1900 - 2008. We find an annualized return on stamps of 7. 0 % in nominal terms, or 2. 9 % in real terms. These returns are higher than those on bonds but below those on equities. The volatility of stamp prices approaches that of equities. Stamp returns are impacted by movements in the equity market, but the systematic risk of stamps remains low. Stamps partially hedge against unanticipated inflation. Estimates of average after-cost returns for individual investors show that stamps may rival equities in terms of realized performance...|$|R

Instead of adding semantic annotations to a page itself or publishing the content separately, {{the elements of}} a web-page are annotated and published in an external file, maybe even on an external site. A semantic agent can use these annotations like an instruction manual {{to find out how to}} interpret the page’s content and how to access databases such as product <b>catalogues,</b> <b>price</b> lists or technical specifications for components. Since these annotations can be published separately from the actual page, anyone can annotate any website and make it accessible for semantic agents. I...|$|R
