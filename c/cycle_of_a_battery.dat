40|$|The {{increased}} {{activity in}} the field of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) have led to an increase in standardization work, performed by both world-wide organizations like the IEC or the ISO, as by regional and national bodies such as CEN, CENELEC, SAE or JEVA. The issues of these standards cover several topics: safety, performance and operational/dimension issues. This paper reports a brief overview of current standardization activities of lithium batteries based on IEC 62660 - 1 / 2 and ISO 12405 - 1 / 2. Furthermore, in this paper, a series of innovative test procedures for lithium-ion batteries are presented. Thanks to these tests, the general characteristics of a battery such as charge and discharge capabilities, power performances and life cycle can be determined. Then, a new approach for extracting the life <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> in function of depth of discharge has been developed...|$|E
40|$|An {{economic}} feasibility study of vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) frequency regulation is performed {{in consideration of}} battery wear. Usually, a transaction for frequency regulation is made in terms of power capacity while the battery-wear proceeds {{in proportion to the}} absolute amount of energy transferred. In order to relate the two quantities, we first estimate the amount of transferred energy in terms of contracted power capacity, and hence regulation income, by analyzing actual regulation signals and transactions. On the other hand, the amount of transferrable energy during the life <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> is estimated analyzing some pervasive specifications for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The expected V 2 G income is then estimated and compared with battery prices to judge the {{economic feasibility}} of V 2 G regulation. In {{the latter part of the}} paper, the assessment result is validated with actual cycle life data of an EV battery cell. As a result, it is concluded that the estimated profit exceeds current market price of EV batteries, indicating that V 2 G regulation is an economically feasible service...|$|E
40|$|State {{of charge}} (SOC) and {{state of health}} (SOH) are key issues for the {{application}} of batteries, especially the absorbent glass mat valve regulated lead-acid (AGM VRLA) type batteries used in the idle stop start systems (ISSs) that are popularly integrated into conventional engine-based vehicles. This {{is due to the fact}} that SOC and SOH estimation accuracy is crucial for optimizing battery energy utilization, ensuring safety and extending battery life cycles. The dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF), which provides an elegant and powerful solution, is widely applied in SOC and SOH estimation based on a battery parameter model. However, the battery parameters are strongly dependent on operation conditions such as the SOC, current rate and temperature. In addition, battery parameters change significantly over the life <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery.</b> As a result, many experimental pretests investigating the effects of the internal and external conditions of a battery on its parameters are required, since the accuracy of state estimation depends on the quality of the information regarding battery parameter changes. In this paper, a novel method for SOC and SOH estimation that combines a DEKF algorithm, which considers hysteresis and diffusion effects, and an auto regressive exogenous (ARX) model for online parameters estimation is proposed. The DEKF provides precise information concerning the battery open circuit voltage (OCV) to the ARX model. Meanwhile, the ARX model continues monitoring parameter variations and supplies information on them to the DEKF. In this way, the estimation accuracy can be maintained despite the changing parameters of a battery. Moreover, online parameter estimation from the ARX model can save the time and effort used for parameter pretests. The validation of the proposed algorithm is given by simulation and experimental results...|$|E

40|$|Ion {{insertion}} into electrode {{materials can}} be used to store energy in battery applications. In this thesis, photoelectron spectroscopic and x-ray absorption spectroscopic methods have been used to study the change of the electronic structure of host materials during electrochemical ion insertion. Specifically, the properties of ion insertion into nanoporous TiO 2 were studied. It is demonstrated that the insertion of Li ions results in <b>a</b> reduction <b>of</b> the Ti 4 + sites in TiO 2 to Ti 3 + sites close to the inserted Li ion. The intensity of the Ti 3 + is directly correlated to the number of inserted electrons. It is also shown that the two phases resulting from moderate insertion can be detected by studying the electronic structure of inserted Li ions and the behavior observed can be correlated with electrochemical measurements. Insertion of ions into tungsten oxides is a potential candidate for smart window and display applications. Ion insertion into these materials was, also studied with electron spectroscopic methods. The insertion of H+ reduces W 6 + to W 5 + and further insertion results in a reduction to W 4 +. Cyclic voltammerty shows two reduction peaks where the first peak implies reduction of W 6 + to W 5 + and the second peak can be associated with further reduction to W 4 +. During the first charge/discharge <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> based on graphite anodes a solid electrolyte interface layer is formed on the electrode surface.

40|$|Abstract â€” <b>Cycle</b> life <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> largely varies {{according}} to the battery operating conditions, especially the battery temperature. In particular, batteries age much faster at high temperature. Extensive experiments {{have shown that the}} battery temperature varies dramatically during continuous charge or discharge process. This paper introduces a forced convection cooling technique for the <b>batteries</b> that power <b>a</b> portable system. Since the cooling fan is also powered by the same battery, it is critical to develop a highly effective, low power-consuming solution. In addition, there is a fundamental tradeoff between the service time <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> equipped with fans and the <b>cycle</b> life <b>of</b> the same battery. In particular, as the fan speed increases, the power dissipated by the fan goes up and hence the full charge capacity of the battery is lost at a faster rate, but at the same time, the battery temperature remains lower and hence the battery longevity increases. This is the first work that formulates the adaptive thermal management problem for batteries (ATMB) in portable systems and provides a systematic solution for it. A hierarchical algorithm combining reinforcement learning at the lower level and dynamic programming at the upper level is proposed to derive the ATMB policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} and economic feasibility of applying used electric vehicle (EV) batteries in stationary applications was evaluated in this study. In addition to identifying possible barriers to EV battery reuse, steps needed {{to prepare the}} used EV <b>batteries</b> for <b>a</b> second application were also considered. Costs of acquiring, testing, and reconfiguring the used EV batteries were estimated. Eight potential stationary applications were identified and {{described in terms of}} power, energy, and duty cycle requirements. Costs for assembly and operation of battery energy storage systems to meet the requirements of these stationary applications were also estimated by extrapolating available data on existing systems. The calculated life <b>cycle</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> energy storage system designed for each application was then compared to the expected economic benefit to determine the economic feasibility. Four of the eight applications were found to be at least possible candidates for economically viable reuse of EV batteries.

The energy resources include PV, battery storage, natural gas GenSet, fuel cells, and active thermal storage for commercial buildings.

These batteries offer high specific energy, high energy density, very low self-discharge rates, and flexibility in packaging; however, problems have inhibited their introduction into the marketplace. This report summarizes findings to examine processes that occur with Li/SPE secondary batteries upon cyclic charging/discharging.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} physical parameters for state estimation in battery based Energy Storage Systems (ESS) is the temperature. This physical quantity does not only strongly influence state estimation for battery management systems, but also significantly affects lifetime and return on investment finally. Thus, monitoring the cell temperature is essential when high performance and efficiency is demanded.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a preliminary economic {{study on the}} feasibility of using electric vehicles (EVs) to provide demand response, carried out {{as part of the}} GREEN Grid project. A mathematical model is developed to track the charge <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> EV <b>battery,</b> and this in turn provides estimates of the cost associated with battery life degradation under different scenarios. Three case studies are presented in this paper: the first investigates the potential cost saving for the EV owner by confining the charging <b>of</b> <b>an</b> EV <b>battery</b> to the night tariff period; the second investigates the financial gain associated with regulating the charging <b>of</b> <b>an</b> EV <b>battery</b> based on spot prices; and the third investigates the possible economic benefit for the EV owner of participating in the electricity market by buying energy at low prices and selling at high prices. The first case also includes the situation <b>of</b> just <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> being used to store energy during the night to run a household during the day. Results show that it is most economical to charge an EV during the night (Case 1), but that it varies considerably depending on the region in New Zealand. Regulating the charging rate depending on the spot price (Case 2) provides a small benefit. Using the EV to trade energy (Case 3) is, in most cases, uneconomic given the degradation of battery life. The variation of Case 1 also shows that at current battery costs, it is not economic to store energy during the night for use during the day. Given that there will be other costs associated with these activities, such as the charger equipment capable of both importing and exporting energy from the grid, the economics do not appear to favour use of EVs for demand response provision, except for the case of simply adjusting the time of charging to suit the tariff...|$|R

The capacity is often used as the fade indicator for estimating the remaining <b>cycle</b> life <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lithium-ion <b>battery.</b> For spacecraft requiring high reliability and long lifetime, in-orbit RUL estimation and reliability verification on ground should be carefully addressed. However, it is quite challenging to monitor and estimate the capacity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lithium-ion <b>battery</b> on-line in satellite applications.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the development of theory and continuum-scale models to characterize transport and kinetics in metal/oxygen batteries. Newmanâ€™s concentrated-solution theory is extended to elucidate two transport mechanisms associated with the volumes dissolved electrolytes occupy: the â€˜excluded-volume effectâ€™ and â€˜Faradaic convectionâ€™. Both mechanisms can be accounted for in the concentrated-solution theory by incorporating a thermodynamic state equation. Two dimensionless parameters quantify the importance of these phenomena, which prove relevant when modeling nonaqueous electrolytes. Accurately measured material properties are of great significance in modeling battery systems. An analysis of binary electrolytic solutions in planar electrochemical cells that support symmetric electrode reactions is performed to serve as a foundation for experimental measurements of diffusivities and transference numbers. Prior theory is extended to include a nonlinear relationship between concentration polarization and cell voltage, as well as accounting for solute-volume effects. The extended theory provides significant corrections when concentration polarization is very large or when electrolytes are very concentrated, rationalizing unexpected voltage responses that have been observed during prior transport-property measurements. The modified concentrated-solution theory is next incorporated into a porous-electrode theory, which is used to model the positive electrodes in metal/oxygen <b>batteries.</b> Continuum simulations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> discharging lithium/oxygen cell are implemented and compared with experimental data to examine how cell capacity is controlled by macroscopic mass transfer, interfacial kinetics, and electronic conduction through the discharge product. The model accounts for the three-phase nature of the positive electrode, including an explicit discharge-product layer whose volume distribution depends on the local depth of discharge. Three hypothetical deposition mechanisms involving different product morphologies and electron-transfer sites are studied. â€˜Sudden deathâ€™ of lithium/oxygen cells is explained by macroscopic oxygen-diffusion limitations in the positive electrode, which are exacerbated by pore clogging as the discharge product forms. Finally, the multicomponent, multiphase continuum model is applied to simulate the first discharge/charge <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sodium/oxygen <b>battery.</b> Simulated discharge/ recharge curves are compared with experiments. Unlike the lithium/oxygen cell, the sodium/oxygen system exhibits low total overpotentials for both discharge and charge, suggesting that the positive-electrode reaction mechanism may follow a reversible pathway...|$|R

The half-life of BaPbO 3 in the battery acid at room temperature, determined from the rate constant of decomposition, is about 4 years.

In this work, changes in magnetization and structure of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) -grown Fey's (magnetite) thin films, Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, and CrO 2 nanoparticles have been investigated upon electrochemical lithiation. The reasonable electrical conductivity of magnetite opens the possibility of modifying the saturation magnetization by inserting Li+ ions into thin films grown on conducting substrates. A substantial decrease in M 8 (up to 30 %) was observed in PLD-grown thin films. Significantly larger reduction in moment (up to 75 %) was observed in commercially available nanoparticles upon addition of 2 moles of Li per formula unit, along with changes in remanence and coercivity. The smaller drop in M 8 observed in thin films is attributed to a kinetic effect due to high density and greater diffusion lengths in PLD-grown films. (cont.) The electrochemical lithiation process has also been applied to needle-shaped particles of chromium dioxide and a model has been proposed to explain the observations. The effects of cycling and discharge-charge rate on these CrO 2 particles have been studied. It has been shown that the process may be partially reversible for low Li contents. The effects of increasing the temperature of cycling and decreasing the length of the CrO 2 particles have been explored. These changes in magnetic moment may be rendered useful in magnetomechanical or magnetoelectronic applications. by Vikram Sivakumar. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The complete driveline consists of three main components: the battery, the flywheel machine and the wheel motor.

The connections of different components of the system are made electrically through power converter devices. The present thesis focuses on the electrical converters and control strategies used in the flywheel based all-electric driveline. The control of power converters is responsible for the logic and functionality of the driveline, being a challenging step within this project. Different power converter topologies have been investigated: a DC/DC plus a DC/AC converter on the LP side, and an AC/DC/AC converter on the HP side.

40|$|This {{literature}} study provides <b>an</b> overview <b>of</b> the current knowledge of environmental concerns {{from the use}} of metals in LIBs, with the purpose to identify what elements are most important to recycle from an environmental and resource perspective. Impacts are assessed along the life <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries.</b> <b>A</b> combined evaluation <b>of</b> criticality studies, supply and demand prognoses, and LCA studies point out the potential future supply risk of lithium. In order to meet future Li demands, largely driven by an expected rapid growth of EV production, Li production capacity must increase and the limited reserves implies recycling of Li must increase in a medium (decadal) time perspective. Li is currently not recycled to any significant extent as there is little commercial value of lithium species resulting from current recycling practices. Cobalt is identified as a critical element. Total Co resources and reserves are limited and <b>a</b> large part <b>of</b> total Co demand is projected to come from batteries. Recycling processes for Co are however in commercial use. The production of batteries and especially the manufacturing of active material matrices are generally pointed out as high contributor to environmental impact in battery life <b>cycles.</b> In LCAs <b>of</b> EVs LIB production contributes significantly to the total impact per km accounting both for WTW and equipment life <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle. Assumptions about electricity production as well as recycling scenario has a large impact on results regarding the overall performance of the EV per km. The refinement of elements including Li to active anode and cathode material is energy intensive and expensive. Hence, energy savings and corresponding avoided environmental burden significantly depend on in what form and at what stage the recycled metal products are fed back in the production of new batteries. Assessment of impact factors for extraction and emission of elements from LCIA methods combined with average elemental composition of LIBs indicate that high potential impact from emissions of Mn and Cu. This suggests that efforts to avoid Mn and Cu emissions from end-of-life processes including recycling should be prioritized. The rapid development of LIB technology makes it difficult to assess. Recycling technologies are also under development. Much ongoing development of technologies, policies and markets, scarce and often inconclusive data makes it difficult to predict the future.

40|$|Purpose: Lithium-ion (Li-ion) {{battery packs}} {{recovered}} from end-of-life electric vehicles (EV) present potential technological, {{economic and environmental}} opportunities for improving energy systems and material efficiency. Battery packs can be reused in stationary applications as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 2 Ì† 01 csmart grid 2 Ì† 01 d, for example to provide energy storage systems (ESS) for load leveling, residential or commercial power. Previous work on EV battery reuse has demonstrated technical viability and shown energy efficiency benefits in energy storage systems modeled under commercial scenarios. The current analysis performs a life cycle assessment (LCA) study on <b>a</b> Li-ion <b>battery</b> pack used in an EV and then reused in a stationary ESS. Methods: A complex functional unit is used to combine energy delivered by the battery pack from the mobility function and the stationary ESS. Various scenarios of cascaded 2 Ì† 01 cEV mobility plus reuse in stationary clean electric power scenarios 2 Ì† 01 d are contrasted with 2 Ì† 01 cconventional system mobility with internal combustion engine vehicles plus natural gas peaking power. 2 Ì† 01 d Eight years are assumed for first use; with 10 years for reuse in the stationary application. Operational scenarios and environmental data are based on real time-of-day and time-of-year power use. Additional data from LCA databases are utilized. Ontario, Canada, is used as the geographic baseline; analysis includes sensitivity to the electricity mix and battery degradation. Seven environmental categories are assessed using ReCiPe. Results and discussion: Results indicate that the manufacturing phase of the Li-ion battery will still dominate environmental impacts across the extended life <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> the pack (first use in vehicle plus reuse in stationary application). For most impact categories, the cascaded use system appears significantly beneficial compared to the conventional system. By consuming clean energy sources for both use and reuse, global and local environmental stress reductions can be supported. Greenhouse gas advantages of vehicle electrification can be doubled by extending {{the life of the}} EV batteries, and enabling better use of off-peak low-cost clean electricity or intermittent renewable capacity. However, questions remain concerning implications of long-duration use of raw material resources employed before potential recycling. Conclusions: Li-ion battery packs present opportunities for powering both mobility and stationary applications in the necessary transition to cleaner energy. <b>Battery</b> state-of-health is <b>a</b> considerable determinant in the life <b>cycle</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Li-ion <b>battery</b> pack.

40|$|Spectroscopy in {{the near}} {{infrared}} range is {{a powerful tool for}} the qualitative and quantitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> materials in the gas liquid or solid phases. The use of optical fibers as <b>a</b> means <b>of</b> performing cost effective in-situ spectroscopic analysis has gained <b>a</b> lot <b>of</b> attention in many fields in the past three decades. Intensity based fiber optic sensors, which rely on variations in transmission power at a fixed wavelength for the characterization of material, are relatively inexpensive to fabricate and provide an easy to read signal. The objective of this thesis will be to present an analytical model developed for a multimode fiber optic evanescent wave sensor (FOEWS) capable of monitoring the charge <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lithium-ion <b>battery</b> cell. The sensor is fabricated by partial removal of the cladding material surrounding the core <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multimode fiber optic. The thinned cladding section allows for transmission loss via evanescing waves which radiate power out from the core as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> the external environment. In contrast to FOEWS designs which use a single mode optical fiber, the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multimode fiber causes difficulty in numerical modeling of the system. Single mode optical fibers have core diameters which are small relative to the wavelength of light propagating within. As such, solving for the transmission response <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single mode fiber can be accomplished using a numerical solver. By using a multimode optical fiber the fiber core diameter is orders of magnitude larger than the wavelength of propagating light. Attempting to accurately mesh a multimode optical fiber requires an unmanageably large mesh which cannot be solved in a reasonable time frame. Alternative approaches for the modeling <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multimode FOEWS have been proposed in the past. However, these methods make use of effective attenuation coefficients to estimate the transmission coefficient of the sensor and thus, they do not include <b>a</b> direct analysis <b>of</b> the electromagnetic field solutions of the thin cladding region. An analytical method for accurately solving the attenuation coefficient using the transfer matrix method is presented. Adoption of the analytical method extends the theoretical description of FOEWS model allowing for more accurate prediction of the sensor behavior by directly accounting for cladding thickness without the use of empirically determined attenuation coefficients. FOEWS fabricated using commercially available step index multimode fibers etched with buffered hydrofluoric acid were used to verify predictions of the newly modified model. Model predictions are matched with experimental tests performed using known index of refraction samples of glycerol and calibrated thermal optic oil ranging from 1. 451 to 1. 466. The experimentally observed intensity variations are compared to model predictions for verification. The fabricated FOEWS was determined to have <b>a</b> cladding thickness <b>of</b> 0. 485 Â± 0. 1 Âµm. Comparison with direct measurement under scanning electron microscope (SEM) place the variations of the model from the experimental results within one standard deviation of the fabrication tolerances of the optical fiber. Building on the increased capabilities of the transfer matrix method to analytically model the thin film reflection coefficient, a method is put forth to simulate the partial contact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solid analyte with a FOEWS. A case study is presented which investigates the FOEWS response behavior to a solid lithium-ion graphite anode held in partial contact to the fiber. SEM images of lithium-ion anode materials held in sensing contact with a fabricated FOEWS are analyzed to determine the fractional contact area of the fiber optic sensing region with the solid anode. <b>A</b> statistical average <b>of</b> the fractional contact area as well as mean depth of non-contact regions is determined. The presence of partial contact between the fiber thin cladding and anode material creates a fourth thin film region which is filled with electrolyte liquid from the cell. The addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fourth thin film region is added to the transfer matrix method analysis of the sensing region of the FOEWS to account for the presence of liquid electrolyte between the fiber sensing region and anode bed. By splitting the model analysis of the sensing region into two separate sections representing the fractional full and fractional partial contact regions effects of partial is then studied using simulated results. In summary, the ability to directly model thin film cladding effects using the transfer matrix method has been added to pre-existing FOEWS models. This new functionality is tested against fabricated devices using solutions of various index of refraction. The model is then used to predict the effect of partial contact of the sensor with a solid anode analyte from a lithium-ion cell...|$|R

40|$|Rechargeable lithium-based {{batteries}} are mainly used in portable devices, {{due to their}} high specific energy. In the future they will also {{play an important role}} for grid-scale storage and the electrification of vehicles. In this PhD thesis, three types of batteries were investigated in the frame of three research projects. Each type of battery has certain improved properties compared to current lithium-ion <b>batteries.</b> In <b>a</b> first project, high voltage cathode materials were investigated. Materials like Li 2 MSiO 4 result in a 5 V lithium-ion battery. Therefore new electrolytes are required with a high electrochemical stability. Ionic liquids are known for their broad electrochemical window, which makes them suitable for high voltage lithium-ion batteries. Unfortunately due to their high viscosity, they have slow kinetics. Preceding research within the Binnemans and Fransaer groups resulted in the development of liquid metal salts. These ionic liquids contain the metal ion of interest in the cationic and/or anionic structure of the ionic liquid, resulting in a very high metal ion concentration. By coordinating neutral ligands around the lithium ion, new complexes were discovered and characterized. These coordination compounds showed an improved (electro) chemical stability compared to the non-coordinated neutral ligands, and a broad electrochemical window of approx. 5 V vs. Li+/Li was obtained. From these ionic liquids it was also possible to deposit lithium metal at high current densities, which makes them suitable as battery electrolyte for high power applications. Batteries based on solids improve the safety <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery,</b> due to the avoidance of flammable, liquid electrolytes. In a second project, it was the challenge to deposit electrode materials conformally on 3 D substrates, in our case silicon pillars. Therefore, the deposition process needs to be self-limiting which is not commonly observed for electrodeposition. Here the proof-of-concept is given for the deposition of thin manganese oxide films (80 nm). This oxide was deposited by the electro-precipitation via oxygen reduction, similar to the deposition of Li 2 O 2 in lithium-air batteries. Since the manganese oxide is less conductive than the current collector, the deposition of new oxide material is preferential on the non-coated current collector. As a result the electro-precipitation of metal oxides is a self-limiting deposition technique, where the electrochemical reduction of dissolved oxygen is followed by the chemical formation of the metal oxide. In the third project, lithium-air batteries were investigated due to their very high specific energy. This type of batteries is still in an early development stage and the focus of our research was on the deposition of the cathode material. Here, oxygen from the atmosphere is used as reagent for the formation of Li 2 O 2. The efficient deposition and dissolution of Li 2 O 2 {{is one of the major}} challenges for the <b>cycle</b> life <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lithium-air <b>battery.</b> The deposition/dissolution mechanism was investigated from a mass point-of-view by an in-situ technique, using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. It was found that in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) there are two possible pathways, a solution or a surface pathway, which is determined by the applied potential. The followed pathway for deposition also influenced the ease of dissolution. Where the solution pathway was suitable for deposition and dissolution, it was found that the surface pathway led to the formation of insoluble lithium oxide species. A redox mediator was used for the dissolution of the latter lithium oxide species. Another challenge of lithium-air batteries is the limited discharge rate, or in other words, the deposition rate of Li 2 O 2. For this, the electrolyte plays an important role, due to crucial properies such as a low volatility, a high chemical stability and a high oxygen solubility. Ionic liquids were investigated as electrolyte because they are known for their low volatility and high stability. However the oxygen solubility in ionic liquids is rather low and the Li 2 O 2 deposition rate highly depends on the dissolved oxygen concentration. To improve the latter, ionic liquids were functionalized with a fluorinated alkyl chain attached to the cation or anion. As a result the oxygen solubility of the ionic liquids could be increased up to six times compared to the solubility in the commercial ionic liquid without the fluorinated chain. Although these results are promising, future research will confirm whether the rate performances of the lithium-air battery can be improved by using these fluorinated ionic liquids. The involvement in the three research projects and knowledge about the three types <b>of</b> <b>batteries,</b> led to <b>a</b> cross-fertilization. Ionic liquids, originally developed for the deposition of materials for all-solid-state batteries, were used for high voltage batteries. The deposition mechanism at the cathode <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lithium-air <b>battery</b> was used for the deposition of electrode materials for all-solid-state batteries. Finally, ionic liquids were developed for the improvement of the cathode reaction in <b>a</b> lithium-air <b>battery.</b> The uniqueness of this PhD thesis lies in the combination of the three research projects, that led to new insights and lifted the research to a higher level. status: publishe...|$|R
