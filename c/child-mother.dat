50|$|Research {{on whether}} or not {{paternal}} sensitivity has an effect on the security of father-child attachment has produced mixed results. Some studies have shown significant correlations between paternal sensitivity and secure father-child attachments. One study suggests that a father’s sensitivity while playing with his child is as important to the child-father attachment relationship as maternal sensitivity during caregiving is for the <b>child-mother</b> attachment relationship. Furthermore, one study has found that the harm of a father’s frightening behaviours on a child’s future development can be mitigated if the father also has high levels of paternal sensitivity. Having a father who is both insensitive and exhibits frightening behaviours during infancy has been linked to emotional under-regulation at the age of 2 as well as attention problems at the age of 7. However, other studies have failed to find a correlation between paternal sensitivity and infant-father attachment.|$|E

50|$|Savithrikkutty, eldest {{daughter}} of an aged poor Nambuthiri Brahmin is married off to an aged widower (a priest) of the same caste. The new family where she is received comprises two other members, Appu (the man’s son who is just a boy) and Amminiyamma. Amminiyamma’s son is working in a distant place. Until Savithri’s arrival she was the sole helper of the widower. The age disparity between the man and Savithri causes their sexual life to be without colors. The man soon engages himself in temple matters and the woman, finding {{no better way to}} kill her time plays with the man’s kid and does her chores without charm. One day a young man named Aravindan comes to his ancestral house in the village. On his way he meets aged people who stare at him as if they never have seen a young man lately. His uncle, Kizhakkethil Raman Menon receives him cordially who reminisces his (Menon’s) valiant efforts at a time when his elders would frown upon education, to send his sister, Aravindan’s mother, to her studies in the city. However we come to know that city culture has destroyed her soft sides and that she now lives an unorganized life of an addict to intoxicants. Meanwhile, Appu, the boy-child of the priest, easily makes friends with his new wife Savithri. Appu’s strange behaviors and restlessness, though he is just a boy compels us to wonder if he really is the priest’s son. Amminiyamma’s comments regarding the boy’s behavior, though not seriously strengthens the doubt. Strong <b>child-mother</b> affection develops between Appu and his stepmother Savithri. On some day, at a ritual performance, Aravindan and Savithri encounters each other for the first time. Aravindan, basically of a wandering nature does nothing significant after his arrival to the village. He then meets Savithri and their relationship develops sooner as the two can easily associate with one another’s sorry lives. Aravindan, who was not cared well by his mother and as somebody who earlier had many unfulfilled and failed relationships with other women was looking for somebody who could actually understand and resonate his feelings. He then realizes Savithri to be exactly the kind of person he should have met. Gradually their romantic dreams develop without anyone suspecting them. The priest who is now completely engrossed in his temple rituals does not suspect her in any way until one day when he catches her with him in an amorous act. As a cheated husband (though he does never even think that his marring a girl enough to become his daughter a sin) he thinks it is his dharma (now that the girl (Savithri) sinned), as taught by his guru to send her back to her home. He sends her back. Savithri’s father who was also the priest’s teacher strives really hard after her arrival. He finds it very difficult to feed and take care of his daughters and his senile father. Meanwhile, Amminiyamma decides to reconcile the two and arrives at Savithri’s house to request her father to ask the priest to receive Savithri back. The man is stubborn and makes it clear that he will not request his student (the priest) to do that. However Savithri herself returns promising she will not make the mistake again. Nevertheless, thoughts of Aravindan’s care and love start tormenting her one way or other. During the temple festival when every member of the family is off to the temple she decides to stay in the house, not wanting the people to gossip about her and the family. Holding the music box gifted by Aravindan, memories of the sweet days visit her. Unexpectedly Aravindan arrives there and the two embrace each other on the background of the sound and play of the temple fireworks. The two stare at the fireworks happy but confused and anxious about their future.|$|E

The socioemotional competence (peer social competence, disruptive behavior, anxious/withdrawn behavior, and school adjustment) and behavioral manifestations of self-esteem were evaluated by the kindergarten teacher. The inner representation of self (positiveness of self, perceived competence, and social acceptance) was assessed in a subgroup of 50 children. Results showed that the relative predictive power of <b>child-mother</b> and child-father attachments differed according to the domain of child functioning that was assessed. More specifically, {{it was found that the}} child's positiveness of self was better predicted by the quality of the <b>child-mother</b> attachment representation than by the quality of the child-father attachment representation. In contrast, the child's anxious/withdrawn behavioral problems were better predicted by the quality of the child-father attachment representation than by the quality of the <b>child-mother</b> attachment representation.

40|$|The study {{utilizes}} {{the data}} from the first round of Indonesian Family Life Survey conducted {{in the eastern part of}} the country (IFLS East) during 2012 to identify <b>child-mother</b> pairs which experience the Double Burden of Malnutrition (DBM) - a situation where overnutrition of the mother and undernutrition of the child coexist within the same household. The analyisis is done using several cross tabulations and comparisons to determine outcomes for the two separate Body Mass Index (BMI) measurement classifications; the Global-Cut off and the Asian Cut-off. The study also explores the difference in household characteristic as factors contributing to DBM. The results showed that the prevalence of child undernourishment within the IFLS East is considerably high, especially for the stunting prevalence (44 %). The results also showed that the use of the Asian-Cut off for classification of BMI raises the prevalence of mothers in the categories of overweight and obese from 32 % to 46 %, consequently raising the prevalence of DBM <b>child-mother</b> pairs by 6 percentage points. The study was able to detect a significant risk factor for DBM of maternal short stature, but was not able to detect other significant factors leading to the presence of the DBM <b>child-mother</b> pair. The paper argues that more research is required into the special characteristics of the women in between the two cut-off classifications, as well as their children. Findings of the additional research may lead to a determination of the appropriateness of the Asian Cut-off as more accurately capturing the severity and prevalence of double burden of malnutrition amongst the population.

Marital conflict information was gathered from maternal and paternal reports. Maternal care and attachment security were collected from home and park observations of child and mother behavior. Furthermore, quality of maternal care was explored as a potential mediator between marital conflict and child attachment security. ^ Results showed none significant associations between marital conflict and its three dimensions reported by mother and <b>child-mother</b> attachment security. Nor were there significant relationships between global marital conflict, and father childrearing disagreement reported by father and <b>child-mother</b> attachment security. Findings demonstrated a marginally significant association between mother 2 ̆ 7 s global marital conflict, and quality of maternal care. This study provides evidence of a significant and concurrent association between maternal care and child attachment security during early childhood. The finding gives empirical support to the theoretical assumption that maternal care keeps having a key role in the organization and maintenance of the secure base behavior beyond infancy. In addition, the association between maternal care and preschool children attachment security, in the Mexican-American sample, supports the hypothesis of the link between maternal care and attachment security in other ethnic and socio-economic groups other than white-American and/or middle class populations. Results do not support the mediator role of quality of maternal care between mothers 2 ̆ 7 marital conflict and child attachment security.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{increase}} our understanding {{and knowledge of the}} relation between children's two social worlds, that of parents and that of peers. This dissertation contains a number of articles reporting on the relation between perceived security, self-representation, and dyadic child-parent and child-peer play interactions. Central questions presented in these studies were a) whether child-parent and child-peer interactions are similar or different on several observed characteristics, b) whether children's internal working models of the self and of the relationship with others [i. e., self-representation and perceived security of the relationship with parents] are related, and c) whether children's perceived security of the relationship with parents as well as children's self-representation are reflected in children's interactions with parents and peers. About seventy children and their parents participated at ages seven and nine. Children were visited twice at home to videotape play interaction with mother and father, separately. Furthermore, these children were interviewed at school about self-representation and perceived security of the relationship with parents. Play interaction with a same gender classmate was also videotaped in the school setting. In chapter 1, several theoretical perspectives with respect to the relation between the tow social worlds of children will be reviewed, followed by a discussion of the main concepts and the relations between the main concepts. Thereafter, the project design is presented. In the final section the outline of this thesis is given. In chapter 2, it is studied whether child-parent and child-peer interactions of seven-year-old children are different or similar on shared positive emotions, total control, balance in control, simultaneous play, mutual responsiveness, and discord. Clear differences in mean proportions of <b>child-mother</b> and child-father interactions on the one hand, and child-peer interactions on the other hand were found. Consistency between dyads with the same target child was not found. In chapter 3 it is examined whether perceived security of the relationship with parents is related to global and domain-specific self-representation, cross-sectionally and longitudinally at ages seven and nine. Cross-sectional positive relations were found between perceived security of the relationship with mother and father and aspects of self-representation at ages seven and nine. Moderate stability between ages seven and nine was found for perceived security of the <b>child-mother</b> relationship and for cognitive competence. Individual and joint contribution of perceptions of the <b>child-mother</b> and child-father relationship to global and domain-specific self-representation at ages seven and nine were studied in chapter 4. It was found that perceived security of the relationship with mother and father were both predictive of the positiveness of the self at age seven. Openness at age seven was predicted by the perceived security of the child-father relationship, but not the <b>child-mother</b> relationship. At age nine, some domains of self-representation (i. e, physical appearance and global self-worth) were predicted by perceptions of both parental relationships. In the last empirical study, reported in chapter 5, it is examined whether differences in perceived security of the relationship with parents and self-representation are reflected in child-parent and child-peer interactions. At age nine, children with secure perceptions of the <b>child-mother</b> relationship showed more mutual responsiveness and less total control. With respect to observed characteristics of child-father and child-peer interactions, no differences were found. It was found that shared positive emotions during child-father interaction at age nine were predicted by perceived security of the relationship with father at age seven. Furthermore, shared positive emotions during child-peer interaction at age nine were predicted by perceived security of both parental relationships at age seven, and also by positiveness and openness of self-representation at age seven.

In Study 1, the connection is tested between young children's internal working model of self and their competence, social acceptance, behavioral adjustment, and behavioral manifestations of self-esteem. Ninety-five kindergartners aged between 51 and 76 months (Mage = 5 years, 3 months) participated in the study. An adapted version of the Puppet Interview was used to assess the representation of self. Affective quality (positiveness) of self and openness to admit imperfections were rated independently. Results show significant and positive relations of the positiveness of self with competence and social acceptance, with behavioral adjustment to school, and with behavioral manifestations of self-esteem, all rated by the teacher. In Study 2, Bowlby's assumption was tested that the working model of self is closely intertwined with the working model of attachment to mother. Subjects were 50 children aged between 55 months and 75 months (Mage = 5 years, 5 months). The working model of <b>child-mother</b> attachment was assessed through an Attachment Story Completion Task. The working model of self was measured via the Puppet Interview. Results show a positive and strong connection between the security of the <b>child-mother</b> attachment representation and the positiveness of self.

The {{goal of this}} study was to examine the C. albicans carriage in children with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) and the maternal relatedness. Subjects in this pilot cross-sectional study were recruited based on a convenient sample. DMFT(S) /dmft(s) caries and plaque scores were assessed during a comprehensive oral exam. Social-demographic and related background information was collected through a questionnaire. Saliva and plaque sample from all children and mother subjects were collected. C. albicans were isolated by BBL™ CHROMagar™ and also identified using germ tube test. S. mutans was isolated using Mitis Salivarius with Bacitracin selective medium and identified by colony morphology. Genetic relatedness was examined using restriction endonuclease analysis of the C. albicans genome using BssHII (REAG-B). Multilocus sequence typing was used to examine the clustering information of isolated C. albicans. Spot assay was performed to examine the C. albicans Caspofungin susceptibility between S-ECC children and their mothers. All statistical analyses (power analysis for sample size, Spearman's correlation coefficient and multiple regression analyses) were implemented with SAS 9. 4. A total of 18 S-ECC <b>child-mother</b> pairs and 17 caries free <b>child-mother</b> pairs were enrolled in the study. Results indicated high C. albicans carriage rate in the oral cavity (saliva and plaque) of both S-ECC children and their mothers (> 80 %).

I mention the distress that parents experience when their child enters kindergarten. I also describe children's attachment to the person who, apart from their parents, is usually the most important figure in their lives, namely the kindergarten teacher. The empirical part of my diploma is based on findings from a research that was carried out on a sample of 44 mothers of pre-school children in a Ljubljana kindergarten. I was interested in which fears mothers face when their children enter kindergarten, and whether there are any differences in this respect between breastfeeding mothers and mothers who do not breastfeed their children upon their entering kindergarten. While analyzing the data, I reached the conclusion that a majority of mothers consider different care options already before their child is born. Most mothers do not experience any feelings of guilt in connection with giving their child into care since they believe that they have chosen quality care. Nevertheless, many of them experience distress when their child enters kindergarten. The hypothesis that breastfeeding mothers experience greater distress than those who do not breastfeed at the time was rejected. I reached the conclusion that both groups of mothers face the same fears. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{meanings}} and experiences of early contact and breastfeeding of the postpartum women admitted at a Baby-Friendly Hospital. It is a descriptive, exploratory study, with qualitative approach, that was developed in a teaching hospital in the Northwest of Paran&# 225; state between November 2011 and January 2012, involving the participation of 16 postpartum women. Data were collected by means of non-participant systematic observation of the childbirths and semi-structured interview. The data collected were analyzed using the thematic content analysis. The results revealed that, soon after childbirth, the <b>child-mother</b> binomial provided the woman with a unique experience, triggering various sensations into the bio-psycho-social-cultural context of each one of the mothers, with feelings and meanings that favored the mother-child bond and the outset of breastfeeding...|$|E
40|$|Mothers are an {{important}} part of children’s language environments, and are assumed to play a role in their children’s language development. This exploratory study investigates the maternal responses in groups of children with and without language impairments, especially related to the intelligibility and errors in the child utterances. Analyses of <b>child-mother</b> sequences indicate that the mothers of children with normal language and children with suspected or diagnosed language disorders show the similar patterns of responses. Mothers of children with a suspected or diagnosed language disorder, however, interpret and ask clarifying questions to preceding child utterances more often than what mothers of children with typical language do. The tendencies for group variations are related to unintelligible child utterances. It is argued that facilitating maternal responses naturally occur in all dyads, and that this is interdependent on the different language productions of their children. Keywords: language delay, maternal responses and sequential analyses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Among Maithil {{women there}} is an {{understanding}} of the relation between a mother's milk and the health of her child. Their understanding is supported by the Ayurvedic tradition. Characteristic {{is the way in which}} breast-feeding condenses so many meanings—nutritional, medical and moral—into one act. The mother not only nurses her child but also forms his character, fulfills her own personhood and perpetuates her husband's family. Key words—Ayurveda, breast-feeding, <b>child-mother</b> relation The purpose of this paper is to provide an eth-nographic account of the link between mother and child in breast-feeding. This simple act of human nurture is found throughout the world; we shall describe how it is practised and understood in Mith-ila. The people of Mithila, some 20, 000, 000 in num-ber, live in northern Bihar, India and the eastern Tarai of Nepal. Our material was collected in and around Janakpurdham, a provincial town and mar...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reported}} {{a pilot study}} on issues relevant to the social development of the 2 -year-old child and discussed the results {{within the framework of}} the evolutionary-control-systems theory proposed by Bowlby (1958, 1969) and Ainsworth (1967, 1969). The issues examined were (1) attachment and (2) reciprocity, or the ability of the <b>child-mother</b> unit to work together under a single goal-hierarchy. Hypotheses were proposed that dealt with (a) the stability of attachment, (b) maternal variables which would serve as the optimal setting for the further expression of attachment behaviors, (c) the nature of the child's ability to carry on transactions with his mother which could be labelled reciprocal, (d) maternal variables which would serve as the optimal setting for this development, and (e) the relative nature of attachment and reciprocity. Subjects were three boys and three girls from white, middle class homes. Data were collected by means of naturalisti...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} adrenocortical activity {{in response to}} different challenging and positive affect emotional contexts in <b>child–mother</b> dyads, as function of attachment security (children’s secure base behaviors and mothers’ attachment representations). Fifty-one children {{ranging in age from}} 18 to 26 months and their mothers participated in this study. Secure children showed significant increases in their cortisol levels after fear episodes and significant decreases, after positive affect ones. No significant changes were found for frustration/ anger episodes. Insecure children did not show significant differences in cortisol levels in any of the episodes, which suggests that insecure attachment may be related to hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression in response to challenging and positive contexts. Mothers of insecure children showed significantly higher cortisol concentrations in pre- and post-session samples, than mothers of secure children. Mothers’ personal attachment representations influenced their own cortisol responses, as well as their children’s (in a marginal significant way) ...|$|E
