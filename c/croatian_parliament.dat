5|$|On 29 October 1918 the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> (Sabor) {{declared}} {{independence and}} decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which in turn entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> never ratified a decision to unite with Serbia and Montenegro. The 1921 constitution defining {{the country as a}} unitary state and abolition of <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> and historical administrative divisions effectively ended Croatian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Pursuant to the referendum's outcome, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>parliament</b> {{ratified}} the accession treaty unanimously (with 136 votes in favour) on 9 March 2012.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> {{supported}} King Charles III's Pragmatic Sanction {{and signed}} their own Pragmatic Sanction in 1712. Subsequently, the emperor pledged to respect all privileges {{and political rights}} of Kingdom of Croatia and Queen Maria Theresa {{made significant contributions to}} Croatian matters.|$|E

50|$|The School of Medicine in Zagreb was {{originally}} envisioned {{as one of}} the four founding members of the modern University of Zagreb in the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament's</b> piece of legislation passed on 13 January 1874, at the time when Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia was a constituent part of Austria-Hungary.|$|R
5|$|In November 2010, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> {{decided to}} hold the EU {{accession}} referendum 30 days after the treaty was signed; since the treaty was signed on 9 December 2011, the referendum was consequently (originally) scheduled for 9 January 2012. In November 2010, the Croatian Government proposed to hold the EU accession referendum simultaneously with another referendum aimed at altering general referendum rules.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1991, as the {{independence}} declaration moratorium expired, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. That particular {{session of the}} parliament {{was held in the}} INA building on Pavao Šubić Avenue in Zagreb due to security concerns provoked by the recent air raid; Specifically, it was feared that the Yugoslav Air Force might attack the parliament building.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{are to be}} held no later than 60 days after the expiration of the 4-year parliamentary term, counting from the day that parliament is constituted {{with the election of}} a Speaker.

5|$|The {{parliament}} of Croatia declared Croatia's {{independence and}} dissolved {{its association with}} Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. The <b>Croatian</b> <b>parliament's</b> decision was partially boycotted by left-wing parliament deputies. The European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe urged Croatian authorities to place a three-month moratorium on the decision.|$|R

50|$|On October 5, 1918 Pavelić {{presided over}} the initial session of the National Assembly of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On October 19, he became the vice {{president}} of the National Assembly. Pavelić authored the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament's</b> declaration of October 29, 1918 that formally acknowledged the National Assembly as the superior authority over Croatia.|$|R
5|$|In 1939, Matica {{hrvatska}} {{published his}} book, The Croatian People and Their Lands (Narod i zemlja Hrvata), in which Lorković {{focused on the}} issue of Croatian boundaries. In 1942, he participated in the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> (Sabor). Two of his speeches were independently published: The International Political Position of Croatia (Međunarodni politički položaj Hrvatske; 1942) and The Croatian Struggle Against Bolshevism (Hrvatska u borbi protiv boljševizma; 1944). The latter was published in German in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Government is {{responsible}} to the Croatian Parliament; the parliament may recall the Government as a whole or {{any member of the}} Government in particular by an absolute majority vote (majority of all MPs) following a request for a confidence vote by one fifth of the parliament members or by the prime minister. The prime minister {{and other members of the}} Government are jointly responsible for decisions passed by the Government and individually responsible for their respective portfolios (areas of responsibility). The President of the Republic appoints the prime minister, who must then secure a vote of confidence from the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> (majority of all MPs); the appointment is therefore counter-signed by the speaker of the parliament to signify this. Appointments of members of the Government are done by the prime minister with the approval of the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> (again signified via a counter-signature by the speaker of the parliament). The rules of procedure and regulations enacted by the Government must be published in Narodne Novine—the official gazette of Croatia—to be binding.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the tunnel}} fell into disuse. It became popular with {{homeless}} people and drug users. A police report from around 1950 stated that squatters used the edifice for warmth and shelter from elements, {{as well as}} a hideout and a meeting place. The Yugoslav Government's lack of transparency regarding the tunnel led to the rise of a number of urban legends, including the purported existence of walled-off corridors leading towards the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> palace on St. Mark's Square (in the centre of Gornji Grad), and towards Zagreb Observatory (the northernmost point of the neighbourhood) and on to Gupčeva Zvijezda.|$|E
5000|$|The {{need for}} an academy of drama in Zagreb was first {{mentioned}} in the <b>Croatian</b> <b>parliament's</b> 1861 piece of theatre legislation which stipulated that a [...] "school for theatre personnel should be formed in Zagreb". However, the modern-day academy traces its roots to the Croatian Drama School (...) which was established by Stjepan Miletić in 1896, more than 30 years after the 1861 law. The school was housed in a building at Marshal Tito Square, which it occupies today.|$|R

50|$|Frank {{maintained}} {{an interest in}} financial matters, which earned him a regular place in the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament's</b> finance committee, {{and later in the}} budget committee. He {{was a member of the}} board of financial matters of the Kingdom of Croatia between 1898 and 1906. In 1898, he published a treatise called Nuncij where he harshly accused Hungary for a perceived injustice in the financial terms of the settlement between Croatia and Hungary. In 1904 Frank reiterated his demands for a financial independence of Croatia, and in part due to his efforts, in 1906 a new financial agreement between Croatia and Hungary was formed which was considered the most beneficial to the Croatian side.|$|R
5|$|According to the 2001 census {{there are}} 16,595 Hungarians living in Croatia, {{representing}} 0.37 {{percent of the}} population. In 2000, there were 15,597 Croats living in Hungary, accounting for 0.15 {{percent of the total}} population. The Hungarian minority in Croatia is recognised by the Constitution of Croatia; minority rights (including official use of Hungarian by local governments and education in Hungarian) are safeguarded by legislation enacted by the Sabor. Seven municipalities in Croatia introduced Hungarian for official use (either in part of their territory or the entire municipality), depending on the distribution of the Hungarian population there. There are five Hungarian minority organizations in Croatia, and the Hungarian minority is guaranteed one seat in the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament.</b>|$|E
5|$|Croatia held an {{independence}} {{referendum on}} 19 May 1991, following the Croatian parliamentary elections of 1990 {{and the rise}} of ethnic tensions that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. With 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum, with 93 percent in favor of independence. Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary, and the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost its possessions in the region. In 1918, a short-lived, unrecognised State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was formed out of parts of Austria-Hungary, comprising most of the former monarchy's Adriatic coastline and the entire present-day Croatian Littoral. Later that year, the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs formed the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes—subsequently renamed to Yugoslavia. The new union's proponents {{at the time in}} the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> saw the move as a defence against Italian expansionism such as via provisions of the 1915 Treaty of London. The treaty was largely disregarded by Britain and France because of conflicting promises made to Serbia and a perceived lack of Italian contribution to the war effort outside Italy itself.|$|E
50|$|A running marten {{is shown}} on the coat of arms of Slavonia and {{subsequently}} on the modern design of the coat of arms of Croatia. The official seal of the <b>Croatian</b> Sabor (<b>parliament)</b> from 1497 until the late 18th century had a similar design.|$|R
50|$|In late 2012, {{the party}} made a {{permanent}} coalition with the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union. This coalition won the <b>Croatian</b> European <b>Parliament</b> election in 2013 and party president Ruža Tomašić {{was the highest}} ranking candidate on the winning list by preferential vote. The party joined the European Conservatives and Reformists.|$|R
50|$|On 29 October 1918, the <b>Croatian</b> Sabor (<b>parliament),</b> on {{the basis}} of a {{complete}} right of self-determination which was recognized by all the warring authorities, declared the end of the union and all ties between Hungary and Croatia, and also united all Croatian lands and entered the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.|$|R
5|$|In 1942 he was {{involved}} {{in the formation of the}} 13th Ustaše Assault Company and by 1943 had attained a seat in the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament.</b> Between 1942 and 1943 he {{was involved}} in recruiting students to join Ante Pavelić's personal bodyguard and was promoted to the rank of major. He held the position of head of the Ustaše University Headquarters and Ustaše Youth until January 1945, when he was appointed Commissioner for Physical Education and Sport. Blažeković fled Zagreb from the advancing Yugoslav Partisans in May 1945 and ended up in a refugee camp in Salzburg, Austria. In August, he was arrested by American forces who extradited him to Yugoslavia on 12 February 1946. He was tried in Zagreb on 12 January 1947, sentenced to death, and executed the same day.|$|E
5|$|In case of brief incapacitation {{to execute}} {{the office of the}} President of Croatia due to absence, illness or vacations, the {{president}} may transfer his powers to the Speaker of the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> to act as a deputy. The president decides on the revocation of this authority and his return to the office. If the president is prevented from performing his duties {{for a longer period of}} time due to illness or other form of incapacitation, and especially if the president is unable to decide on a transfer of powers to a deputy, the Speaker of the parliament becomes the acting president, assuming presidential duty pursuant to a decision of the Constitutional Court, made upon request of the Government.|$|E
5|$|In {{the night}} of 27/28 April, a group of Croatian Ministry of the Interior {{officers}} managed to reach Kijevo, and a Croatian police station was formally established in the village on 28 April. The following day, JNA troops, commanded by the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps chief of staff Colonel Ratko Mladić, moved in, cutting all access and preventing delivery of supplies to Kijevo. On 2 May, a Croatian police helicopter made an emergency landing in Kijevo after sustaining damage caused by SAO Krajina troops gunfire. The helicopter was carrying then defence minister Luka Bebić and <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> deputy speaker Vladimir Šeks. The aircraft {{was able to take}} off after repairs the same day. Another skirmish took place on 2 May on Mount Kozjak, where a member of the SAO Krajina paramilitary was killed while on guard duty.|$|E
50|$|The main {{regulatory}} body for broadcasting is the government's Electronic Media Agency through its Electronic Media Council (Vijeće za elektroničke medije or VEM), {{which is in}} charge of reviewing and granting all television and radio broadcast licenses and ensuring that programming is in line within the legal framework set in the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament's</b> Electronic Media Act. This makes it the local equivalent of similar regulatory agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission in the United States.The Council for Electronic Media releases the broadcasting licenses, according to the Electronic Media Law; any change in ownership structure must be reported by publishers to the Council, {{as well as to the}} Agency for the Protection of Market Competition. The Council can issue warnings, file charges, make recommendations, and support self-regulation.Frequency allocation by the Agency has been trasparent for some time; its main challenges still concern the independence of its members from the political arena (particularly in terms of their appointment) and the lack of expertise of its stuff, leading it to underestimate the need for alternative web radios too.|$|R
50|$|At the <b>Croatian</b> National Council's <b>parliament</b> in 1980, Vrančić {{claimed the}} new Croatian nation could {{not rely on}} the {{tradition}} of the Independent State of Croatia, and would have to minimize that tradition as much as possible.|$|R
5000|$|Pucić gave up {{his studies}} and started living from in Dubrovnik from 1838 because of his father's illness. He ran the family's accounts, often {{undertaking}} long journeys. Like his brother Medo, he maintained relations with {{the representatives of the}} political and cultural life in the monarchy, particularly in Croatia. After 1860 Pucić became an active representative of the national movement in Dalmatia. The Dalmatian and <b>Croatian</b> state <b>parliament</b> delegates sent Pucić in 1861, as their representative, to Vienna, where he attempted to convince the Imperial Court of the need to unify the two kingdoms.|$|R
5|$|One {{civilian}} {{was reported}} {{killed by the}} aircraft strafing of the Tuškanac area of Gornji Grad. None of the three leaders was injured, but four people were wounded in the attack. The facade of the Banski dvori and nearly all its rooms were damaged, {{and a part of}} its roof structure was destroyed. The first estimates of the damage inflicted on the building and its contents ranged between 2 and 3million US dollars. Apart from the Banski dvori, other buildings in the area sustained damage. Those included the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> building, the Old City Hall, St. Mark's Church, the Museum of History, the Institute for the protection of cultural monuments as well as residences and offices in the vicinity, including the residence of Swiss consul Werner Mauner.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> publishes all its {{decisions}} in Narodne Novine, the official gazette of the Republic of Croatia. Article 90 {{of the constitution}} requires publication of all acts and other regulations in the gazette before they are legally binding. Narodne Novine is available through a paid subscription as print, or for free online. Parliamentary debates and other proceedings {{are the subject of}} news coverage by media of Croatia, and Saborska televizija was set up in 2007 in addition as an IPTV channel broadcasting all plenary sessions of the parliament. Finally, the Parliament's Public Relations Department publishes a news bulletin available to all institutions and citizens of Croatia through a print paid subscription, and online for free.|$|E
5|$|The Venetians {{gained control}} {{over most of}} Dalmatia by 1428, with {{exception}} of the city-state of Dubrovnik which became independent. Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of Krbava field and 1526 Battle of Mohács, both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. King Louis II died at Mohács, and in 1527, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Parliament</b> met in Cetin and chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as new ruler of Croatia, {{under the condition that}} he provide protection to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights. This period saw the rise of influential nobility such as the Frankopan and Zrinski families to prominence and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families.|$|E
5000|$|Nazor {{began his}} {{political}} career {{as the head of}} the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH), the provisional Croatian World War II deliberative assembly, moving on to head the first post-war <b>Croatian</b> National <b>Parliament</b> (Narodni Sabor). In that post, he was by law concurrently the first (non-monarchical) head of state of Croatia in general, and the first head of state of the current Croatian republic. His position carried little real political power, which was instead invested in the office of the Prime Minister and (informally) with the Secretary of the Communist Party of Croatia.|$|R
50|$|Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski (29 May 1816 - 1 August 1889) was a Croatian historian, {{politician}} and writer, most {{famous for the}} first speech delivered in <b>Croatian</b> before the <b>Parliament.</b> Considered a renowned patriot, Kukuljević was a proponent of Illyrian movement and avid collector of historical documents, primarily those {{for his work in}} Croatian historiography and bibliography.|$|R
50|$|While Croatia-Slavonia was not {{the site}} of any battles, Croatian troops, {{fighting}} under the Croatian Home Guard {{took part in the}} fighting, much of it in neighbouring Serbia. Skerlecz managed to reconvene the <b>Croatian</b> Sabor (<b>parliament)</b> in Zagreb by 1915. The Croats made further demands for local authority, as well as unification of Croatia-Slavonia with Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Stefan Sarkotić, Austria-Hungary's commander in Bosnia and Herzegovina also sought unification of their provinces. However, Austria-Hungary's outdated political system made any shifts between areas under Hungarian or Austrian spheres of influence difficult. Skerlecz could only support the Croatians in acting autonomously. As the war progressed more Croats found the formation of a South Slav state a potentially beneficial possibility.|$|R
