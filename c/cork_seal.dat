50|$|The {{crown cork}} was {{patented}} by William Painter on February 2, 1892 (U.S. Patent 468,258). It had 24 teeth and a <b>cork</b> <b>seal</b> {{with a paper}} backing to prevent contact between the contents and the metal cap. The current version has 21 teeth. To open these bottles, a bottle opener is generally used.|$|E

The darker colour of the right-hand bottle indicates considerably more oxidation in this bottle. Since the fill level of this bottle is also slightly lower, a slightly faulty <b>cork</b> <b>seal</b> is likely the cause.|$|E
50|$|While {{working as}} a {{salesman}} for the Crown Cork and Seal Company in the 1890s, Gillette saw bottle caps, with the <b>cork</b> <b>seal</b> he sold, thrown away after the bottle was opened. This made him recognize the value in basing a business on a product that was used a few times, then discarded. Men shaved with straight razors that needed sharpening every day using a leather strop. As existing, relatively expensive, razor blades dulled quickly and needed continuous sharpening, a razor whose blade could be thrown away when it dulled would meet a real need and likely be profitable.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "diving" [...] {{occurs when}} the {{flexible}} {{part of the larger}} container is pressed inwards, increasing the pressure inside the larger container, causing the [...] "diver" [...] to sink to the bottom until the pressure is released, when it rises back to the surface. If the container is rigid, as with a glass bottle, the <b>cork</b> <b>sealing</b> the bottle would be pressed inwards or drawn outwards.|$|R
5000|$|Bottle {{variation}} {{that increases}} over time typically {{comes from the}} packaging. Exposure to heat or light can cause a wine to mature more quickly or even make it taste [...] "cooked". Bottles aged in the chilly cellars of Sweden's alcohol monopoly are famous for tasting younger than the same wine stored at a more typical 13 °C (55 °F). Finally, not all <b>corks</b> <b>seal</b> equally well, and a faulty cork will allow air into the bottle, oxidizing it prematurely. However, a corked wine would {{be described as a}} simple fault rather than bottle variation, even though the corked bottle would be clearly different from a non-corked example.|$|R
40|$|Cork {{stoppers}} {{became the}} industry standard for wine bottle seals probably going {{as far back as}} the 1600 s. Manufacturers of alternative wine bottle seals have made several attempts to wrest market away from cork manufacturers, particularly over the last thirty years. In spite of these efforts, cork remains the dominant wine bottle seal, with a market share of around 90 per cent. This paper examines the threat to cork manufacturers of one innovative product, the screw or twist top wine seal. Developed in the late 1950 s and thoroughly piloted and tested in the market in Australia in the 1970 s, the screw top seal was largely a failure, despite the commitment of a group of Australian winemakers to what they believed was a technically superior product. While Australian wine makers abandoned the screw top experiment in the early 1980 s, a second attempt by a small number of wine makers from the mid 1990 s has captured the attention of the wine industry internationally due to its initial success. What unfolds in this paper is a fascinating story of a product that on many performance attributes outperforms the <b>cork</b> <b>seal,</b> but has so far failed to gain mainstream market acceptance from retailers and end consumers.

What unfolds in this paper is a fascinating story of a product that on many performance attributes outperforms the <b>cork</b> <b>seal,</b> but has so far failed to gain mainstream market acceptance from retailers and end consumers. Although there have been scores of articles in wine and food magazines that have discussed the merits of cork versus alternative seals, we are not aware of any literature that has evaluated the contest through the lenses of innovation theory. In so doing this paper analyses why the initial product launch of the screw top was unsuccessful and why the recent second attempt may indeed be a turning point for the screw top wine bottle seal. The paper is divided into five sections. Section one provides a brief overview of the nature and history of cork as a wine seal. The growing dissatisfaction with cork as a wine seal is outlined in section two. Section three provides the background to the development of the screw top wine seal and its launch in Australia. In section four we explore with the aid of technology adoption innovation theory why the launch was a failure. We then outline in section five the second recent attempt by Australian wine makers to gain market acceptance for the screw top. We will see in this section there are a number of factors that have changed between the first launch and the second launch. Section six focuses on the question as to whether the second attack on {{the industry standard}} will be successful. We conclude that innovation theory can both explain why the first launch failed and why the second launch may indeed be successful in the long run. In particular, Moore's (2001) adaptation of the technology adoption life cycle model, although originally developed from experience in hi-tech industries, aided in understanding the key reasons for the initial failure of the screw cap and also in predicting the early success of the screw cap's second attack...|$|E

5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown <b>Cork</b> and <b>Seal</b> Co. to <b>cork</b> and <b>seal</b> soda water bottles. Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, {{the neck of}} the moving bottles became stuck in the machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.|$|R

In 1890 he got the state of Kentucky to change its laws {{so that he could}} bottle his own whisky at his distillery. Before the changes in the law, distillers could only sell their whiskey by the barrel, and if their product was bottled it was because whoever purchased the barrel from the distillery did the bottling. He introduced the idea of a strip stamp with his signature on it to go across the <b>cork,</b> <b>sealing</b> the bottle. He then advertised that if this signature was damaged, the consumer should be wary of purchasing the bottle because someone may have tampered with the whiskey, and it may not contain real Pepper whiskey. The strip stamp became popular and the government used the idea when they passed the Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897.|$|R

50|$|Screw caps' {{use as an}} {{alternative}} to <b>cork</b> for <b>sealing</b> wine bottles is gaining increasing support. A screw cap is a metal cap that screws onto threads on the neck of a bottle, generally with a metal skirt down the neck to resemble the traditional wine capsule ("foil"). A layer of plastic (often PVDC), cork, rubber, or other soft material is used as wad to make a seal with the mouth of the bottle.|$|R

50|$|After {{defeating}} a fake Blot (Oswald {{revealed the}} Shadow Blot Mickey fought {{along with all}} the Blotlings he encountered were drippings of the real Blot), Mickey eventually comes to terms with his actions and reveals all to Oswald, who loses his temper. While jumping angrily on the <b>cork</b> <b>sealing</b> the Jug, Oswald accidentally causes the cork to break, allowing the true form of the Shadow Blot- a giant specter constructed from paint thinner- to escape his prison into the world. Oswald soon reveals that he and his wife, Ortensia, attempted to seal the Blot away, but Ortensia was blighted by the Blot in the process and entered an inert state. The Blot takes Oswald and Gus, threatening to kill them if Mickey does not allow the Blot to take his heart. Mickey yields his heart to the Blot, who then proceeds to destroy the Wasteland before moving on to the Disney universe to wreak havoc there, but Mickey, Oswald and Gus successfully manage to destroy the Blot, eliminating his exterior with paint-laden fireworks, and rescue Mickey's heart from the inside. Oswald reunites with Ortensia and befriends Mickey, the two now possibly bonding with each other as brothers. With the Wasteland now slowly regenerating, Mickey escapes back to Yen Sid's workshop and returns home through the mirror, which becomes sealed by Yen Sid to prevent Mickey from entering again and cause any more mischief.|$|R

40|$|Canning as {{a method}} of food {{preservation}} has its origin in the work of Nicolas Appert (1750 - 1841) who was the first to use heat as a means of preserving food in hermetically sealed containers. Although he did not understand the principles of his method, his systematic experimentation (and generous sharing of his discoveries) laid the foundations of thermal food preservation methods. Appert initially processed his food in <b>cork</b> <b>sealed</b> glass jars and bottles in boiling water baths for periods varying from 15 minutes to two and a half hours. Storage trials were the basis of his processing methods, some foods being kept up to ten years. His products ranged from meats, soups and vegetables to fruit and even cream and evaporated milk. He recognized the value of quick clean handling of good quality raw materials. Blanching was used with some products, and he was also aware of the distinction between acid and low-acid foods in regard to their length of processing. Appert's understanding of the process was that heating eliminated the "air" which was believed to be the cause of spoilage. This belief was to persist for nearly 100 years. Appert's work in glass containers led to the development in England about 1815 - 20 of tin containers for preserved foods. Appert himself used cans in some of his later work. Some time before 1830 the autoclave was introduced (apparently by Appert) as a means of cooking canned foods under pressure. By 1870, autoclaves were being used quite widely in industrial canning...|$|R

He founded his own manufacturing business, the Crown <b>Cork</b> and <b>Seal</b> Company, in Baltimore and {{set out on a}} campaign to convince bottlers that his cap was the right one to use on their products. By 1898, he had created a foot-powered crowner device to sell to bottlers and retailers so that they could seal the bottles with his caps quickly and easily. This helped gain acceptance of his bottle caps. By 1906, Crown had opened manufacturing plants in Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.|$|R
