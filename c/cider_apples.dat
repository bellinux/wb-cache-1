500|$|The UK's {{national}} {{fruit collection}} database contains {{a wealth of}} information on the characteristics and origin of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same [...] "genetic" [...] apple cultivar. Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking (cooking apples) or producing cider. <b>Cider</b> <b>apples</b> are typically too tart and astringent to eat fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.|$|E
500|$|Somerset is a {{predominantly}} agricultural county with arable cropping and dairy farming; Cheddar cheese {{is a well-known}} product. The main field crops include wheat, barley, oats and root crops, and extensive orchards produce <b>cider</b> <b>apples.</b> Large numbers of cattle and sheep are kept, and Exmoor ponies and red deer roam on the open moorland in {{the west of the}} county. Coal was at one time mined in the county; the Somerset Coalfield stretched from Cromhall to the Mendips, and from Nailsea to Bath. The last two pits, at Kilmersdon and Writhlington, closed in 1973. Minerals [...] mined here at one time included iron, lead, zinc, slate and fuller's earth.|$|E

Situated in an old cider factory, it opened in 1980 and 1981.

60|$|September 23d.--The vintage {{has been}} going on in our podere for about a week, and I saw a {{part of the process of}} making wine, under one of our back windows. It was on a very small scale, the grapes being thrown into a barrel, and crushed with a sort of pestle; and as each estate seems to make its own wine, there are {{probably}} no very extensive and elaborate appliances in general use for the manufacture. The cider-making of New England is far more picturesque; the great heap of golden or rosy apples under the trees, and the cider-mill worked by a circumgyratory horse, and all agush with sweet juice. Indeed, nothing connected with the grape-culture and the vintage here has been picturesque, except the large inverted pyramids in which the clusters hang; those great bunches, white or purple, really satisfy my idea both as to aspect and taste. We can buy a large basketful for less than a paul; and they are the only things that one can never devour too much of--and there is no enough short of a little too much without subsequent repentance. It is a shame to turn such delicious juice into such sour wine as they make in Tuscany. I tasted a sip or two of a flask which the contadini sent us for trial,-- the rich result of the process I had witnessed in the barrel. It took me altogether by surprise; for I remembered the nectareousness of the new cider which I used to sip through a straw in my boyhood, and I never doubted that this would be as dulcet, but finer and more ethereal; as much more delectable, in short, as these grapes are better than puckery <b>cider</b> <b>apples.</b> Positively, I never tasted anything so detestable, such a sour and bitter juice, still lukewarm with fermentation; it was a wail of woe, squeezed out of the wine-press of tribulation, and the more a man drinks of such, the sorrier he will be.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK the Long Ashton Research Station {{categorised}} <b>cider</b> <b>apples</b> in 1903 {{into four}} main types {{according to the}} nature of their flavour components. [...] For cider production {{it is important that the}} fruit contains high sugar levels which encourage fermentation and raise the final alcohol levels. <b>Cider</b> <b>apples</b> therefore often have higher sugar levels than dessert and cooking apples. It is often also considered important for <b>cider</b> <b>apples</b> to contribute tannins, which add depth to the finished cider's flavour.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Polyphenols have a {{favourable}} antioxidant potential {{on human}} health, suggesting that their high content in apple {{is responsible for}} the beneficial effects of apple consumption. They are also linked to the quality of <b>apple</b> juices and <b>ciders</b> since they are predominantly responsible for astringency, bitterness and colour. Major phenolic compounds were quantified by liquid chromatography in fruits and juices from a <b>cider</b> <b>apple</b> progeny harvested for 3 years. The total content of procyanidins and their average degree of polymerisation (DPn) were also determined in fruits by phloroglucinolysis. Variability and extraction yield of these compounds were determined. RESULTS The variability observed in the progeny was representative of the variability observed in many <b>cider</b> <b>apple</b> varieties. Hydroxycinnamic acids were the most extractable group, with an average extraction yield of 67 %, whereas flavonols and anthocyanins were the least.
