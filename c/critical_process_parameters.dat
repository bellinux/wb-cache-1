Only after process qualification has been completed can the manufacturing process begin production for commercial use. It should be noted that equally important as qualifying processes and equipment is qualifying software and personnel. A well trained staff and accurate, thorough records helps ensure ongoing protection from process faults and quick recovery from otherwise costly process malfunctions.

Input parameters to the model (heat transfer coefficient and mass transfer resistance) were obtained from separate experimental runs. Two lyophilization runs are conducted to verify the model predictions. This confirmation of the model predictions with experimental results added to the confidence in the insilico design space. This simple step-by-step approach allowed us to minimize the number of experimental runs (preliminary runs to calculate heat transfer coefficient and mass transfer resistance plus two additional experimental runs to verify model predictions) required to define the design space.

The development and capabilities of the control system are presented, demonstrating the feasibility of simultaneous multi-cavity pressure control in both the filling and packing stages of the injection molding process.

30|$|Increased {{recoveries}} {{of nickel}} was {{obtained in the}} BCL concentrator Selebi-Phikwe pentlandite–pyrrhotite–chalcopyrite ore flotation up to a maximum copper sulphate dosage, above which depression was observed and recoveries fell below that for the condition without any copper addition. Nickel recovery with increasing copper sulphate dosage therefore shows a maxima. A dosage range about this maxima dosage is the <b>critical</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> for successful activation of the ore with copper sulphate. The depression at higher dosage is explicable based on predominance change of copper with increasing concentration in the pulp. However, this increased recovery is with a compromise that pyrrhotite must be recovered along with pentlandite, due to dissemination constraints. Despite chalcopyrite presence, pyrrhotite recovery still improved, as chalcopyrite recovery also increased marginally. Because response to copper sulphate addition in flotation can vary from possible depression to activation in sulphide ores, it is notable in this ore that despite flotation constraints imposed by the mineralogy, activation with copper sulphate to increase nickel recovery can still be achieved, but within the careful dosage range.|$|R

In-line probes for particle size measurements proved to be a useful tool for determining the end point of melt granulation. The product temperature during melt granulation was found to be the <b>critical</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> for achieving appropriate granulate particle size distribution. The results showed that melt granulation using hydrophilic binders is an effective method to improve the dissolution rate of carvedilol. The method of binder addition to the powders (melt-in or spray-on procedure) was found to strongly influence the dissolution rate of carvedilol. The highest dissolution rates were obtained when the spray-on procedure is used, independently from the type of granulator used. The results also suggest that the most probable explanation for the increase in the dissolution rate of granulated carvedilol is improvement of the wettability through intimate contact between hydrophilic binder and hydrophobic drug...|$|R

A system has been recently described which extends this capability to provide simultaneous control of cavity pressure at multiple locations in the mold through the addition of dynamic valves in the melt delivery system, each of which can be independently controlled to meter flow and pressure to its portion of the mold. This paper describes the ability of the multi-cavity pressure control system to improve process capability and molded part quality. Experimental investigation has shown that the technology enables significant process flexibility to arbitrarily balance flow, move knit-lines, and control multiple part dimensions. In the presence of typical production process disturbances, moreover, closed loop multi-cavity pressure control was shown to increase the process capability index, Cp, from 0. 52 for the conventional injection molding process to 1. 5.

The {{influence of a}} <b>critical</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter,</b> overpolish time on pattern dependent erosion and dishing for a 0. 25 µm W Damascene process, is investigated in detail. Material removal rate and uniformity (WIWNU) were 150 – 250 nm/min. and 3 % (1 sigma), respectively.

Feature size and pattern density effects on the CMP performance are as expected. At proper rpm and pressure settings, the effects are sufficiently small for application in integrated circuit processing. However, surprisingly, with overpolishing erosion and dishing increase rapidly, while at the end point the effects are negligible: 10 % overpolishing gave satisfactory results; 25 % overpolishing was not acceptable. Overpolishing of 10 % was needed to obtain good (electrical) yield (measured on meander-comb structures with pitch down to 0. 8 µm and length up to 3 m).

Commonly, this is done via design of experiments and identification of parameters significantly impacting product quality (rejection of the null hypothesis that the effect equals 0). However, parameters which show a large uncertainty and might result in an undesirable product quality limit critical to the product, may be missed.

In this work, by considering on-chip data caches, we study the effect of access latency variations on performance. We discuss performance losses due to the worst-case design, wherein the entire cache operates with the worstcase process variation delay, followed by process variation aware cache designs which work at set-level granularity. We then propose a technique called block rearrangement to minimize performance loss incurred by a process variation aware cache which works at set-level granularity. Using block rearrangement technique, we rearrange the physical locations of cache blocks such that a cache set can have its ”n ” blocks (assuming a  -way set-associative cache) in multiple rows instead of a single row as in the case of a cache with conventional addressing scheme. By distributing blocks of a cache set over multiple sets, we minimize the number of sets being affected by process variation. We evaluate our technique using SPEC 2000 CPU benchmarks and show that our technique achieves significant performance benefits over caches with conventional addressing scheme. ...|$|E

In this article the impact of a 90 min period of oxygen limitation during the cultivation of the strictly aerobic Bordetella pertussis bacterium is investigated. The cultivation is the most important process step for the manufacturing of a vaccine against whooping cough disease.

The other genes were mainly affected towards the end of cultivation. Of all genes involved in oxygen limitation none were identified to show a significant difference between the oxygen limited and control cultivations at the end of the batch.
