Besides inspecting the internal organisation, the IPSec interoperability is also tested in the so-called [...] "ENX IPSecLab". In addition, the ENX encryption is implemented and the connection is made to providers already certified via private peering points, so-called [...] "ENX Points of Interconnection".

50|$|Investment {{income that}} was {{generated}} abroad also {{falls under the}} Abgeltungsteuer. The Federal Republic of Germany concluded with many countries double taxation agreements so that the regulations differ from each country to country. The aim is to avoid that one taxpayer is charged with similar taxes more than once on the same income for the same period. Though the Abgeltungsteuer is not applicable in foreign countries, the taxpayer has the responsibility to declare the income for taxation at the local tax office. Foreign taxes on capital gains are only <b>chargeable</b> up <b>to</b> a height of 25% according to German Income Tax Act (Art. 43 a Para. 3). Nevertheless, there can be possibility that losses from other securities transactions {{are added to the}} original loss. That leads to a paid tax on capital gains of more than 25% seen over the entire calendar year. Such a negative surplus will not been refunded by the tax authorities and is also not transferable to the following years.|$|R

Currency options contracts are commonly regarded as one of the useful tools of risk management and frequently used to reduce risk associated with the movement in price and currency risk. This article attempts to review the suitability of the Islamic currency options in one of the Islamic banks in Malaysia as a hedging mechanism and highlights Shariah issues pertaining to the structures.

Tawwaruq and wa’ad principles have given Islamic financial institutions the opportunity to structure Shariah compliant financial products and meet the objective of increasing trading volume and liquidity in order to reduce transaction cost and risk...|$|R
