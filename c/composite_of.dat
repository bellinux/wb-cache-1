40|$|In this study, {{biocompatibility}} <b>of</b> nano <b>composites</b> <b>of</b> silica doped in HA/collagen {{was compared}} against those doped in HA/gelatin. For this purpose, hydrothermal samples were synthesized before {{being investigated by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Size and morphology of the samples were further characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to undertake an elemental analysis on the prepared composites. FTIR spectras confirmed chemical structure <b>of</b> the nano <b>composites</b> and EDS patterns showed that, even though the nano <b>composites</b> <b>of</b> silica doped in HA/collagen had equivalent Ca/P ratios to the theoretical value as repeated for HA chemical structure of Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2, corresponding Ca/P ratios to the nano <b>composites</b> <b>of</b> silica doped in HA/gelatin were just close to the theoretical value. A comparison on the obtained XRD patterns showed that, the nano <b>composites</b> <b>of</b> silica doped in HA/collagen had their crystallite size smaller than that <b>of</b> the nano <b>composites</b> <b>of</b> silica doped in HA/gelatin. FESEM images indicated smaller particle sizes for the nano <b>composites</b> <b>of</b> silica doped in HA/collagen, as compared to those doped in HA/gelatin. Reduced crystallite size and decreased particle size {{are known to be}} associated with larger contact surface in chemical reactions, leading to better pharmacological efficacy in terms of bone repair. ...|$|R

5|$|A <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> Perrault's male heroes, however, {{indicates}} {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
5|$|One of Meddings' first tasks was {{to shoot}} stock {{footage of the}} Thunderbird {{machines}} and the series' main locations, Tracy Island and Creighton-Ward Mansion. The finished island model was a <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> {{more than a dozen}} smaller sets that could be detached from the whole and filmed separately. The architecture of the mansion was based on that of Stourhead House, located on the Stourhead Estate in Wiltshire. In the absence of head designer Reg Hill, who was serving as associate producer, Meddings was further tasked with designing the Thunderbird fleet and FAB 1. Scale models for the six main vehicles were built by a contractor, Master Models of Middlesex. Models and puppet sets combined, more than 200 versions of the Thunderbird machines were created for the series.|$|E

5|$|St Denys' Church is {{the parish}} {{church of the}} {{benefice}} of Sleaford (formerly called New Sleaford), which encompasses most of the market town of Sleaford in the English non-metropolitan county of Lincolnshire. The benefice is a vicarage and falls within the deanery of Lafford and the archdeaconry and diocese of Lincoln; as of 2015, the vicar is Rev. Philip Anthony Johnson, who was appointed in 2013. The church is located next to (and faces onto) the market place at the town centre. It is dedicated to St Denys; the Victorian clergyman and local historian Edward Trollope stated {{that this is a}} medieval form of St Dionysius, but does not elaborate on which of the several saints called Dionysius this refers to. According to a pamphlet published by the parochial church council, St Denys is a medieval <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> Dionysius of Paris, Dionysius the Areopagite and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.|$|E

40|$|Readability is a {{major issue}} with all maps. In this study, we {{evaluated}} whether we can predict map readability using analytical measures, both single measures and <b>composites</b> <b>of</b> measures. A user test was conducted regarding the perceived readability {{of a number of}} test map samples. Evaluations were then performed to determine how well single measures and <b>composites</b> <b>of</b> measures could describe the map readability. The evaluation of single measures showed that the amount of information was most important, followed by the spatial distribution of information. The measures of object complexity and graphical resolution were not useful for explaining the map readability of our test data. The evaluations <b>of</b> <b>composites</b> <b>of</b> measures included three methods: threshold evaluation, multiple linear regression and support vector machine. We found that the use <b>of</b> <b>composites</b> <b>of</b> measures was better for describing map readability than single measures, but we could not identify any major differences in the results <b>of</b> the three <b>composite</b> methods. The results of this study can be used to recommend readability measures for triggering and controlling the map generalization process of online maps...|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} of Henry Dion {{appears to be}} a <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> several real life serial killers. His fondness for conversing with his victims' bodies and the gregarious demeanour shown during this seems to be based on Milwaukee-based murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who would also, like Dion, document his victims photographically. The habit of photographing victims, and the notion of killing women to use them as props, stems from killer Henri Nadeau, who murdered several women in order to use them as mannequins for his photography. The use of an overbearing matriarchal figure as a stressor harkens to Edmund Kemper, who was driven to kill young women by his hatred of his mother, who he eventually murdered before turning himself in; both Dion and Kemper cut their mother's vocal folds from their throats after killing them.|$|E

5|$|An {{open and}} spacious ground floor {{respected}} the same traditional layout exemplified in Besakana and other Merina homes, including {{the presence of}} hearth stones in their customary corner. Following traditional construction practices, the roof three stories above was supported by an enormous andry (central pillar) that was given the name Volamihitsy ("Genuine Silver"). According to popular legend, this was made of a single rosewood tree trunk transported from the eastern rain forests. Recent archaeological excavations of the site during reconstruction have since disproved this account as the pillar {{was found to be}} a <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> fitted rosewood pieces rather than a single solid post. According to custom, the north-eastern corner pillar was the first to be erected. Its length necessitated the use of a pulley designed by Jean Laborde, the principal architect, to haul the trunk into place. When an accident occurred during the operation, the queen designated a Malagasy carpenter to manufacture a crane to complete the task. Thousands of the queen's subjects were forced to labour on the building's construction in lieu of paying cash taxes pursuant to a tradition called fanampoana. One historic source claimed that 25,000 subjects participated in the raising of the building's corner posts alone. The harsh working conditions were said to have been the cause of many deaths, although precise figures are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a <b>composite</b> <b>of</b> grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E
