5|$|Interviews with random {{pilots in}} Widerøe {{showed that the}} airline had {{shortcomings}} in its training procedures, {{in part because it}} lacked a Dash 7 simulator. There was a culture in the airline to divert from cockpit procedures and cooperation. The flight plans often made procedures for mutual control of procedures impractical, and they were commonly skipped. The commission was of the impression that Widerøe's transition from an all-Twin Otter airline to also operate the more demanding Dash 7 was not properly carried out, which had resulted shortcomings in the training and operating procedures. All checklists during the flight were followed correctly. However, the pilots did not elect a method of double-control of the descent and approach, such as by using briefings and <b>callouts.</b>|$|E

500|$|Following {{permission}} for takeoff from controllers, {{the flight crew}} initiated the takeoff procedure and the first officer made a <b>callout</b> of 80 knots, and, several seconds later, a V1 <b>callout,</b> followed shortly after by a VR <b>callout.</b> Approximately 2.2 seconds after the VR <b>callout,</b> the nose gear left the ground. The final report read that [...] "the first officer described the takeoff as normal through the rotation. He stated that no problem was evident with vibration, rate of acceleration, ambient noise, [...] directional control".

500|$|The {{commission}} {{found the}} cause of the crash was that the approach was started [...] too early and that the aircraft therefore came below the height of the terrain. No specific reason for the early approach was found, although there were several non-compliances by the crew members to regulations and procedures. Specifically, the commission pointed to the lack of internal control which would have identified operation shortcomings and the lack of proper cockpit procedures, especially regarding <b>callouts.</b> There were no technical faults to the aircraft, and the pilots had full control of the aircraft {{at the time of the}} collision, making it a controlled flight into terrain.|$|E
500|$|... 1,000 actors {{replied to}} the <b>callouts</b> for each role, but only 75 {{were called in}} to read for the casting director. Those who {{received}} a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and their production partner Kevin S. Bright. At the end of March, the potential actors {{had been reduced to}} three or four for each part; they read for Les Moonves, president of Warner Bros. Television. David Schwimmer was first to be cast. He was in Chicago doing a stage adaptation of The Master and Margarita when his agent offered him the audition. He was not interested in doing television after a bad experience appearing in Monty, but changed his mind when he learned that it was an ensemble script. Unknown to him, Crane and Kauffman had remembered him from when he auditioned for an earlier pilot of theirs; they had written the part of Ross with Schwimmer in mind to play him. Eric McCormack also auditioned for the role several times. He later became famous for his lead role in the sitcom Will & Grace.|$|E
500|$|The {{report from}} the Accident Investigation Board for Civil Aviation {{characterized}} the accident as a controlled flight into terrain. The report pointed to several errors, both from the pilots, but also systematic failures from Widerøe and the Norwegian Aviation Authority. In particular, the report commented {{on the lack of}} <b>callouts</b> during descent. The base turn procedure was also criticized, because the crew failed to time it correctly, ending up [...] from the airport. When the flying pilot canceled the instrument landing and changed to visual landing during darkness, he did not have sufficient visual references to the terrain. During this part of the approach, the aircraft's position was not controlled with any available navigational aids. This was in part due to both pilots focusing on extra-cockpit activity after the non-flying pilot had identified the necessary sight to the airport. The crew were not aware of their distance from the terrain; the small margins from 150meters (500ft) to 119meters (392ft) were in part caused by pilots' unawareness. The cooperation between the crew did not follow the regulations of crew resource management and seemed to have stopped after visual identification of the airfield. The airline was criticized for not having standardized an operative concept that the crew fully respected and followed.|$|E

2500|$|For 1961, new 2-door {{sedan and}} hardtop models were released, but no {{changes were made}} to the 4-door sedan and wagon sheet metal. The {{interior}} and exterior trim were changed to provide model year differentiation, a mild form of planned obsolescence. The radiator grille stamping was the same as in 1960, but for 1961 it was painted with a pattern of black squares. The central grille ornament was still pulled from the bottom to release the hood, but it was now faced with an emblem having a white field with the blue-and-red stylized [...] "V" [...] Valiant logo, rather than 1960's red field with gold script [...] "Valiant" [...] callout. The side trim was changed; a [...] stainless spear was placed at the rear of each tailfin crease, a hockey stick-shaped trim was applied to the lower break line, and the front fender/door crease was capped with a long stainless spear. The tailfins were each topped with three transverse chrome strips, and a large horizontal emblem containing a round plastic [...] "V200" [...] callout was centered in the deck lid's spare-tire stamping. Matching round [...] "V200" [...] <b>callouts</b> were placed in round housings at the midpoint of the front fender spears.

50|$|ARCOS, {{an acronym}} for Automated Roster Call Out System, evolved from a company {{launched}} by Mitchell McLeod in 1993 called McLeod & Associates, which designed software for Fortune 1000 companies. In 1997, Alliant Energy Corp. asked McLeod to streamline the utility company’s <b>callout</b> system, which McLeod accomplished. Other U.S. utility companies asked for the same automated <b>callout</b> system, and McLeod focused his business on developing automated <b>callout</b> systems. McLeod spun off this business line in 2006, creating ARCOS. Originally, the software assumed that all utility crews were available, but that wasn't always true. So ARCOS had its scheduling software sync with work management programs. As a human capital management system, it also now keeps track as a status changes.|$|R

2500|$|Another major {{difference}} was {{a conclusion that}} Russian air traffic control {{played a part in}} the accident by passing incorrect information to the crew regarding the plane's position.

2500|$|The NTSB {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} was able to retrieve both the CVR and FDR. The investigators concluded that, based on the retrieved flight data and simulations, the flight crew very likely operated the flight director improperly, inadvertently switching it into a [...] "go around" [...] mode during the final approach, instead of the appropriate approach mode. This caused confusion and additional pressure, and contributed to the unstablized approach and deviation from the glide path. According to the CVR, no altitude <b>callouts</b> were made by the crew during the final approach, as the aircraft descended below the glideslope and decision height, until it struck the seawall and crashed.|$|E

5000|$|Flagnotes or flag notes (FL, F/N) are {{notes that}} apply only where a flagged <b>callout</b> points, such as to {{particular}} surfaces, features, or part numbers. Typically the <b>callout</b> includes a flag icon. Some companies call such notes [...] "delta notes", and the note number is enclosed inside a triangular symbol (similar to capital letter delta, Δ). [...] "FL5" [...] (flagnote 5) and [...] "D5" [...] (delta note 5) are typical ways to abbreviate in ASCII-only contexts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Callout</b> {{is defined}} as an order to report for {{emergency}} or special work at an unusual time or place. Many utilities rely on customers to report a power outage or gas leak by phone or email. Once notified, utility supervisors or dispatchers then call to find available workers and assemble a crew. Utilities direct a crew to the affected area to track {{the cause of a}} disruption in power or gas leak and restore service. The order in which each lineman is called out for work after business hours is often stipulated by workplace rules and union agreements. Electric utility companies as well as gas and nuclear utilities use automated <b>callout</b> systems to reduce {{the time it takes to}} assemble a crew for power restoration work. By using an automated <b>callout</b> system instead of a manual process in which dispatchers dial workers’ phone numbers and ask for help, utilities reduces the time to fill a <b>callout.</b> Assembling and dispatching crews faster can reduce storm CAIDI (customer average interruption duration index) by up to 30 minutes because crews get to the scene of trouble faster.|$|R
2500|$|Early 1960 models, {{particularly}} the V200 high-trim cars, featured extensive brightwork and ornamentation. An [...] chrome spear atop each front fender, an inner reveal {{ring on the}} deck lid's spare tire stamping, a [...] "V200" [...] nameplate on the dashboard, and stainless steel windshield and backlight reveal moldings, which were deleted from production, replaced with less costly flexible mylar-faced plastic locking strips—in approximately January, 1960. Early and late V200s had a continuous stainless steel molding following the tailfin crease as it swept {{down in front of}} the rear wheel, then continuing forward along the lower break line in both doors and the front fender. The radiator grille was brite-dipped stamped aluminum, and a central grille badge doubled as the hood release. Script [...] "Valiant" [...] <b>callouts</b> were placed in the center of the deck lid's spare-tire stamping and on each front fender.|$|E
2500|$|Fender and hood {{stampings}} {{were similar}} to the 1960-'61 items, but neither identical nor interchangeable. At the rear, the cat's-eye tail lamps were deleted. A wraparound stainless trim {{was applied to the}} tailfins, below which were placed round tail lamps set into stamped aluminum bezels. These occupied the space formerly available for optional backup lamps, which for 1962 flanked the license plate below the rear bumper. The spare-tire stamping was eliminated from the deck lid, which was now a smooth stamping with a small central ridge at its trailing edge. On V200 deck lids, a large round emblem surrounded an oblong block-letter [...] "VALIANT" [...] callout on a black field. Similar block-letter/black-field <b>callouts</b> were placed on each front fender. On the Signet, the deck lid was adorned with a smaller round emblem surrounding the red-and-blue stylized-V Valiant logo.|$|E

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{assessment}} of a multivariate heat wave vulnerability index (HVI) developed for London, United Kingdom. The HVI is assessed {{in terms of its}} ability to predict whether mortality and ambulance <b>callout</b> attain above average levels during heat wave events.
