40|$|The {{prevailing}} lack of transportation, {{port and}} intermodal facilities {{is one of}} the major hurdles for the development of the Indian Logistics sector and causes congestion at various points in the supply chain. The UK port industry has also been facing many challenges in the recent past. The congestion challenges in UK ports have eased to a certain extent in recent times due to investment and new government and private sector initiatives. One example of this has been the adoption of a “Port-Centric-Logistics” strategy by some UK ports to attract direct callers in these ports. This strategy will try to replace/reduce the feedering that is going on between the continent and UK, and improve the efficiency and productivity in the whole supply chain up to the end user. Teesport has taken the lead in this exercise and set up a fully-fledged distribution centre which provides facilities such as <b>container</b> <b>stripping,</b> storing, repacking at the port already, in collaboration with ASDA. This model is now being considered by other ports such as Hull and Liverpool in order to improve their competitive edge over European ports...|$|E
50|$|After Sea <b>Containers</b> was <b>stripped</b> of the East Coast {{franchise}} due to poor financial management, Virgin {{was again}} shortlisted for the InterCity East Coast franchise in February 2007, {{but was not}} successful, as the franchise bid was won by National Express. This bid had a 10% shareholding for the incumbent, Sea Containers.|$|R
50|$|Great North Eastern Railway, often {{referred}} to as GNER, was a train operating company in the United Kingdom owned by Sea Containers that operated the InterCity East Coast franchise from April 1996 until December 2007, when Sea <b>Containers</b> was <b>stripped</b> of the franchise due to poor financial management. It operated InterCity train services on the East Coast Main Line.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the biggest}} battles in the {{container}} revolution were waged in Washington, D.C.. Intermodal shipping got a huge boost in the early 1970s, when carriers won permission to quote combined rail-ocean rates. Later, non-vessel-operating common carriers won a long court battle with a US Supreme Court decision against contracts that attempted to require that union labor be used for stuffing and <b>stripping</b> <b>containers</b> at off-pier locations.|$|R
2500|$|Longshoremen {{and related}} unions {{around the world}} {{struggled}} with this revolution in shipping goods. For example, by 1971 a clause in the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) contract stipulated {{that the work of}} [...] "stuffing" [...] (filling) or [...] "stripping" [...] (emptying) a container within 50 miles of a port must be done by ILA workers, or if not done by ILA, that the shipper needed to pay royalties and penalties to the ILA. Unions for truckers and consolidators argued that the ILA rules were not valid work preservation clauses, because the work of stuffing and <b>stripping</b> <b>containers</b> away from the pier had not traditionally been done by ILA members. In 1980 the Supreme Court of the United States heard this case and ruled against the ILA.|$|R
40|$|Bottles, <b>containers</b> {{and packing}} <b>strips</b> etc. is {{increasing}} day by day. As a result amount of waste plastic also increases. This leads to various environmental problems. Many of the wastes produced today {{will remain in}} the environment for many years leading to various environmental concerns. Therefore it is necessary to utilize thewastes effectively with technical development in each field. Many by-products are being produced using the plastic wastes. Our present work is helping to take care of these aspects. Plastic waste, consisting of carry bags, cups and other utilized plastic {{can be used as a}} coating over aggregate and this coated stone can be used for roadconstruction. The mix polymer coated aggregate and tyre modified bitumen have shown higher strength. Use of this mix for road construction helps to use plastics waste. Once the plastic waste is separated from municipal solid waste, the organic matter can be converted into manure and used. Our paper will discuss in detail theprocess and its successful applications...|$|R
40|$|When {{users are}} searching for documents, they must sift through a {{collection}} of potentially relevant documents assessing, categorizing and prioritizing them based on the current task at hand, a process we refer to as document triage. Since users' time is precious, {{as much information as}} possible should be presented to them to aid the process of document triage. This thesis presents a simple visualization and a set of features that can help users in identifying information of interest. As a part of this thesis, the System Layer of the Visual Knowledge Builder (VKB) was developed as a tab <b>strip</b> <b>container.</b> Each of the tabs presents a different type of information about Web Documents. The types of information currently included in VKB are: a summary of the Web Document, keywords based on users' interests provided by the Interest Profile Manager (IPM), popular keywords from a social bookmarking site, metadata about the Web Document, a list of outgoing links of the Web Document, and the history of the Web Document. We performed a heuristic evaluation to assess the usefulness of the new visualization and features. During the evaluation, participants were asked to rate the usefulness of each of the new web document features over a scale of 1 to 7, where a value of 1 indicated strong disagreement, and 7 indicated strong agreement. Our results indicate that the document summary, the keywords from IPM, popular tags, and the history of the Web Document are expected to be most useful during the process of document triage...|$|R
