The information from the literature search is applied on finding potential valley network changes localities based on indicators <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> the river network, which were analysed in the GIS environment. Each potential locality was chosen for a presence of an indicator, which may signify <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> the river network: sudden direction <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> a stream, wind gap, streams which flow through topographic barrier, captured stream. The main criterion for finding potential localities was elevation above the valley-floor interpolated surface, where low values indicate low water divide between valleys.
