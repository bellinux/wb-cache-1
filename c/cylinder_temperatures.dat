2500|$|In {{the event}} of a combat or {{emergency}} situation, the mixture control may be moved to the auto rich position, providing extra fuel to the engine, or in military aircraft, into military position, if the aircraft is so equipped. [...] When in the military position, the Anti-Detonation Injection (ADI) system is activated, injecting the ADI fluid into the engine intake system. [...] The pressure in the ADI system moves the derichment diaphragm in the fuel control to close off the derichment jet, reducing the fuel flow to a leaner mixture which produces higher engine power by raising the mean effective pressure. This causes the cylinder head temperature to increase to a very high level, which dramatically increases the risk of detonation (see: engine knocking). Adding the ADI fluid raises the mean octane level of the charge preventing pre-ignition and also lowers the <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperatures</b> to a more acceptable level. As this operation takes the engine well beyond its normal design limits, this power setting is not suitable for prolonged use.

50|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, {{exhaust gas recirculation}} (EGR) is a nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions reduction technique used in petrol/gasoline and diesel engines. EGR works by recirculating a portion of an engine's exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders. This dilutes the O2 in the incoming air stream and provides gases inert to combustion to act as absorbents of combustion heat to reduce peak in-cylinder temperatures. NOx is produced in a narrow band of high <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperatures</b> and pressures.|$|E
50|$|In diesel engines, a {{mechanical}} injector system vaporizes the fuel {{directly into the}} combustion chamber or a pre-combustion chamber (as opposed to a Venturi jet in a carburetor, or a fuel injector in a fuel injection system vaporising fuel into the intake manifold or intake runners as in a petrol engine). This forced vaporisation means that less-volatile fuels can be used. More crucially, because only air is inducted into the cylinder in a diesel engine, the compression ratio can be much higher {{as there is no}} risk of pre-ignition provided the injection process is accurately timed. This means that <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperatures</b> are much higher in a diesel engine than a petrol engine, allowing less volatile fuels to be used.|$|E
50|$|It {{was common}} before {{the modern era}} of {{computerized}} fuel injection to specify {{at least a couple}} of different heat ranges for plugs for an automobile engine; a hotter plug for cars that were mostly driven slowly around the city, and a colder plug for sustained high-speed highway use. This practice has, however, largely become obsolete now that cars' fuel/air mixtures and <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperatures</b> are maintained within a narrow range, for purposes of limiting emissions. Racing engines, however, still benefit from picking a proper plug heat range. Very old racing engines will sometimes have two sets of plugs, one just for starting and another to be installed for driving once the engine is warmed up.|$|E
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are heat engines, {{and as such}} their theoretical efficiency can be approximated by idealized thermodynamic cycles. The thermal efficiency of a theoretical cycle cannot exceed that of the Carnot cycle, whose efficiency {{is determined by the}} difference between the lower and upper operating temperatures of the engine. The upper operating temperature of an engine is limited by two main factors; the thermal operating limits of the materials, and the auto-ignition resistance of the fuel. All metals and alloys have a thermal operating limit, and there is significant research into ceramic materials that can be made with greater thermal stability and desirable structural properties. Higher thermal stability allows for a greater temperature difference between the lower (ambient) and upper operating temperatures, hence greater thermodynamic efficiency. Also, as the <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperature</b> rises, the engine becomes more prone to auto-ignition. This is caused when the <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperature</b> nears the flash point of the charge. At this point, ignition can spontaneously occur before the spark plug fires, causing excessive cylinder pressures. Auto-ignition can be mitigated by using fuels with high auto-ignition resistance (octane rating), however it still puts an upper bound on the allowable peak <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|R

50|$|Most modern {{consumer}} vehicle {{engines are}} pre-programmed with specific fuel-to-air ratios, so introducing water without re-programming the car's computer or otherwise changing these ratios {{will most likely}} provide no benefit, and may likely reduce performance or damage the engine.

5000|$|When auto enthusiasts want to {{increase}} {{the power of the}} engine, they may add some type of forced induction. By compressing more air and fuel into each intake cycle, the power of the engine can be dramatically increased. This also increases the heat and pressure in the cylinder. The normal temperature of gasoline engine exhaust is approximately [...] This is also approximately the melting point of most aluminum alloys and it is only the constant influx of ambient air that prevents the piston from deforming and failing. Forced induction increases the operating temperatures while [...] "under boost", and if the excess heat is added faster than the engine can shed it, the elevated <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperatures</b> will cause the air and fuel mix to auto-ignite on the compression stroke before the spark event.

50|$|As Tyrrell was {{the only}} {{naturally}} aspirated engine user in 1984 season, they were uniquely placed {{to be able to}} benefit from a similar strategy of the water brake. In Tyrrell's case, the engine was equipped with a water injection system (a common means of lowering <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperatures</b> to increase power), whose supply tank was to be topped up late in the race. In addition, the FIA had already made provision to reduce the fuel allowance for each race during the season to 220 litres and banned the refueling of 1982-83, reducing the power available to turbocharged runners while imposing little restriction on more efficient non-turbo runners. Predictably turbo-powered teams were against this move, leaving only Tyrrell - whose engine did not need the additional fuel - in favour of it. However, F1 rules required unanimity for the change to be scrapped, leaving Tyrrell in the way.It had been observed in races that, after Tyrrell's final pit stop, lead shot could be seen escaping {{from the top of the}} car. It turned out that Tyrrell were running the car underweight during the race then, in the closing stages, topping up water injection supply tanks with an additional 2 gallons of water mixed with 140 lb of lead shot to ensure it made the weight limit.

5000|$|The {{lack of an}} {{electrical}} ignition system also reduces the parasitic load on the engine, as the engine {{does not have to}} produce the necessary electricity to ignite the fuel. A significant amount of electricity is required by a spark ignition system, and as engine speeds and loads increase, the ignition system consumes proportionately more electricity, while simultaneously becoming less efficient. Higher cylinder pressure require a [...] "hotter" [...] spark with more current present to overcome the pressure and jump the gap from electrode to electrode in the spark plug. Increased engine speeds and loads also require the spark to occur more rapidly, resulting in additional electrical system loads and demands and more engine power required to meet them. As diesel engine speeds and loads increase, the higher <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperatures</b> after compression of the intake charge result in increased injection and ignition efficiency due to increased fuel atomization. Regardless of fuel system design, a mechanical diesel fuel injection system and rapid rise of fuel pressure and flow will result in injection nozzle opening pressure being reached more rapidly and also earlier in the 4-stroke cycle with more precise fuel delivery, more precise injection timing and built-in timing advance. Additional power is required to operate the injection system as engine speeds and loads increase, but the increase is more offset than in spark-ignition engines. Modern diesel engines with electronic injection systems use a large amount of electricity for injection, but the ability to precisely time injection and even perform multiple injection events per cycle result in generally increased fuel efficiency compared to mechanically-injected diesel engines of similar size and power.|$|E
