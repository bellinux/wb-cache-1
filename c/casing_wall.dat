40|$|A recent {{research}} program has identified {{the possibility of}} using the analysis of <b>casing</b> <b>wall</b> pressures in the direct measurement of gas turbine rotor blade vibration amplitudes. Currently the dominant method of non-contact measurement of gas turbine blade vibrations employs the use of a number of proximity probes located around the engine periphery measuring the blade tip (arrival) time (BTT).

LES also helps researchers investigate ways to mitigate undesirable effects, such as cavitation, {{which can lead}} to reduced performance, increased noise, and structural vibration and erosion. 1521 - 9615 / 04 /$ 20. 00 © 2004 IEEE Copublished by the IEEE CS and the AIP In hydraulic turbomachines, such as submarine propulsors and liquid fuel pumps, a small radial gap between a rotor-blade tip and <b>casing</b> <b>wall</b> is unavoidable.

40|$|Inception and {{development}} of multiple stall cells of short length scales are numerically investigated in an axial compressor rotor blade row. The method of investigation is based on time accurate three-dimensional full annulus simulations. Time dependent flow structure results revealed {{that there are two}} criteria responsible for inception of a special kind of stall, introduced as spike stall in the literature. These criteria are defined as leading edge spillage and trailing edge backflow, which occur at specific mass flow rates near to stall conditions. The numerical results revealed that once the spike stall cells appear, they cover roughly two blade passages in the circumferential direction and cover about 25 % of the blade height. By further revolution of the blade row, the number of cells tends to increase. For the present case study, the number of stall cells increased to three after 8. 5 rotor revolutions from the moment of the initial spike stall occurrence. Even at this moment, both of the above mentioned criteria for the spike stall inception have been observed within the blades passages. These events caused the inlet relative flow angle to the blade rows, and therefore the flow incidence angle and consequent blockage to the main flow, to increase. The tip leakage flow frequency spectrum has been studied through surveying instantaneous static pressure signals imposed on pressure side of the blades and also on the <b>casing</b> <b>walls.</b> These latter results showed that any further revolving of the rotor blade row, exceeding 8. 5 revolutions, causes the spike stall to disturb the flow structure significantly...|$|R

The number {{that characterizes the}} risk is the Probability of No Penetration (PNP). The PNP is a measure for the statistical time interval between two penetrating impacts on a spacecraft. The software tools calculate the PNP using (a) flux models that provide the number of meteoroid and debris particles that impinge on the spacecraft and (b) empirical equations that describe the penetration resistance of the spacecraft structure wall, so called ballistic limit equations (BLE). This approach is justified for manned modules. For an unmanned spacecraft, the perforation of the external wall is not necessarily critical for the spacecraft mission. The current methodology for assessing the risk to spacecraft can be improved by modeling the limit of damage sustainable by equipment inside the spacecraft. The SRL equation has been developed for calculating the ballistic limit impact parameters of typical satellite equipment placed behind typical satellite structure walls. The considered equipment is fuel pipes, heat pipes, high pressure vessels, liquid filled pressurized tanks, harness, electronics boxes and batteries.
