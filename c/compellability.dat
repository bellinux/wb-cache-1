5000|$|On 20 April 2000 in Abbeylara, John Carthy, who had bipolar affective disorder, barricaded {{himself into}} his {{residence}} with a shotgun {{in a dispute over}} plans to move to a new house. The Garda Emergency Response Unit (ERU) was called to the scene, and after a 25-hour siege, Carthy was shot dead. Carthy's family claimed the Garda had mishandled the situation and that a planned Garda internal inquiry would be inadequate. On 8 March 2001 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights established a [...] "Sub-Committee on the Abbeylara Incident". Although the Carthy family wanted an independent Tribunal of Inquiry, an Oireachtas inquiry was preferred as being cheaper and quicker. It planned to complete its investigation in three weeks and then issue conclusions. The Sub-Committee claimed the right to compel ERU members to give evidence, under the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (<b>Compellability,</b> Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997. The ERU members sought judicial review that the subcommittee would be acting ultra vires in compelling them to attend and then issuing a report that criticised them. On 11 March 2002, the Supreme Court agreed, by six votes to one.|$|E
40|$|For {{many centuries}} a {{lawfully}} married spouse of an accused occupied a privileged position {{in terms of}} giving evidence against his or her spouse in criminal trials. This paper examines the historical origins and rationales for the special spousal rules relating to competence, <b>compellability</b> and privilege. The paper analyses the continued relevance of these rationales to adult relationships in the 21 st century with particular emphasis on the application of these rules to former spouses, de facto spouses, same sex relationships and traditional aboriginal marriages. The approaches taken in the various jurisdictions in Australia are discussed to determine {{the adoption of the}} rationales in the relevant legislation and the extent of application outside lawful marriages. The analysis reveals a divergence across Australia as to both approach and the categories of witnesses given special treatment under the competency and <b>compellability</b> rules...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the practical}} importance of confidentiality and privilege in mediation with {{particular emphasis on}} issues of disclosure of what occurred in a mediation and <b>compellability</b> of mediators in any subsequent litigation. The piece focuses on {{the gap between the}} theory behind confidentiality in mediation – i. e. that it is largely assured in the process – and the reality in which the privacy of mediation, protected by and large by the general without prejudice rules, may be rendered far more porous in practice. The article suggests that mediation would benefit from the statutory development of rules pertaining to confidentiality that undergird the process itself and in this sense analyses two extant provisions that already apply in the UK in relation to cross border mediations, and family mediation in Scotland respectively which could provide a model for more general refor...|$|E
40|$|In 1986 the Australian Law Reform Commission {{found that}} Aboriginal spouses who married {{traditionally}} were compellable witnesses {{against each other}} in criminal trials, despite the privileging of spouses as non‐compellable within the common law. The basis of this was that they were not recognised as husbands and wives according to the laws of evidence. The Commission argued that failure to extend the common law rule of inter‐spousal non‐compellability to traditional spouses gave the impression that the law cared only about the stability of Marriage Act (1961) marriages, despite the continuing importance of traditional marriages. This article traces a debate about the <b>compellability</b> of Aboriginal spouses (wives) back to 1930 s and 40 s Australia. Seeing this as symptomatic of the legal injustices faced by Indigenous people, humanitarians and white women reformers were calling for human rights and legal equality. Now, the Law Reform Commission is arguing that the way to ensure this is to first recognise customary law. Then, reformers came up against a bureaucracy and legal fraternity prepared to recognise neither Indigenous customary law, Indigenous women’s legal equality nor human rights. 16 page(s...|$|E
40|$|From {{the case}} studies on various {{important}} aircraft accident investigation reports both in New Zealand and Hong Kong, {{this study suggests that}} they are deficient and inadequate in a number of ways. As a consequence they may be challenged either on merit or procedure, or both. In this study, various analytical human factors tools are examined and considered in relation to their potential contribution to challenging the merits of investigative reports. In addition, the legal aspects of these reports are also examined to determine how extant legislation and common law could be applied to challenge the reports on the basis of law and procedure. It is demonstrated in the analysis how aircraft accident investigation and the reports that are compiled can be challenged on different fronts. Procedural irregularities, such as inadequate opportunity given to those adversely affected to be heard; acting beyond the terms of reference of a public inquiry; or the lack of independence of the investigation itself, may give rise to a cause of action to have the report quashed completely or partially. Those whose reputation is adversely affected may challenge the findings and conclusions in the Board of Review by calling independent experts to attend the hearing to challenge the opinion given by the Chief Inspector. Parties to Court proceedings may seek discovery or disclosure of the records or information collected in the investigation and ask the Court to rule on the causation of the accident in personal injury cases. Among the different channels or methods of investigation, the Chief Inspector's reports are most vulnerable to challenge given the legal position in Hong Kong and the lack of statutory non-disclosure protection of the records, information and evidence gathered, and the <b>compellability</b> of the Inspectors to give evidence in Court. Aircraft accident investigation reports may, at best, be used or taken as a piece of evidence setting out the factual information of the accident, and as an expert opinion of the probable cause thereof in subsequent civil proceedings in establishing the causation of the accident and liability in common law negligence in personal injury or fatal accident cases. Those reports are by no means conclusive or binding on the parties or the Court in civil proceedings, and issue estoppel does not arise...|$|E
