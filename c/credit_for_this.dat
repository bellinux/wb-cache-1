5|$|The post-flight {{analysis}} {{reported no}} major malfunctions—the only troublesome anomaly being the suit temperature controls— {{and all the}} engineering objectives of the mission were deemed successfully completed. The fuel-conservation measures {{were found to have}} worked particularly well, with even less fuel than anticipated being consumed; despite the technical changes, the official report gave full <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> to the pilot. The medical analysis found no significant physiological effects from nine hours of weightlessness, and noted that Schirra had received no significant radiation exposure. Analysis of the radiation-sensitive plates confirmed {{that there had been a}} very low radioactive flux inside the spacecraft, and the six ablative materials tested were all deemed broadly satisfactory despite some difficulty comparing them to each other.|$|E

25|$|From {{time to time}} in its 'career', the danzón {{acquired}} African {{influences in}} its musical structure. It became more syncopated, especially in its third part. The <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is given to José Urfé, who worked elements of the son into {{the last part of the}} danzón in his composition El bombin de Barreto (1910). Both the danzón and the charanga line-up have been strongly influential in later developments.|$|E
25|$|The {{first public}} piped gas supply was to 13 gas lamps, each with three glass globes {{along the length}} of Pall Mall, London in 1807. The <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> goes to the {{inventor}} and entrepreneur Fredrick Winsor and the plumber Thomas Sugg, who made and laid the pipes. Digging up streets to lay pipes required legislation and this delayed the development of street lighting and gas for domestic use. Meanwhile, William Murdoch and his pupil Samuel Clegg were installing gas lighting in factories and work places, encountering no such impediments.|$|E
25|$|The {{big band}} era arrived in Cuba in the 1940s, {{and became a}} {{dominant}} format that survives. Two great arranger-bandleaders deserve special <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> Armando Romeu Jr. and Damaso Perez Prado. Armando Romeu Jr. led the Tropicana Cabaret orchestra for 25 years, starting in 1941. He had experience playing with visiting American jazz {{groups as well as}} a complete mastery of Cuban forms of music. In his hands the Tropicana presented not only Afrocuban and other popular Cuban music, but also Cuban jazz and American big band compositions. Later he conducted the Orquesta Cubana de Musica Moderna.|$|E

25|$|Strauss {{expertly}} {{managed the}} convention. At the 1972 convention, party infighting had delayed candidate McGovern's acceptance speech until late at night, when the television audience {{had gone to}} sleep. Strauss made sure that Carter's acceptance speech ran in prime time, and the convention ended with a memorable tableau: {{the leaders of the}} party's opposing wings, conservative George Wallace and liberal George McGovern, flanking Carter with clasped hands upraised. The Democrats entered the fall campaign united {{for the first time in}} years. <b>Credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> accomplishment was awarded to Chairman Strauss, and Carter quickly asked Strauss to chair his election campaign as well.|$|E
25|$|Pedro's {{decision}} {{to defy the}} Cortes was met with armed opposition across Brazil by troops loyal to Portugal. The ensuing Brazilian War of Independence spread {{throughout most of the}} country, with battles fought in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions. The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824, and independence was recognized by Portugal on 29 August 1825. In addition to those Brazilians and Portuguese who fought in the war, much of the <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> victory is credited to Bonifácio's cabinet. It created an army and a navy practically out of nothing, greatly improved government finances, and unified the provinces under a single, cohesive leadership.|$|E
25|$|Insurgent {{activity}} was in decline {{by the end}} of 1992, and Fujimori took <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> abatment, claiming that his campaign had largely eliminated the insurgent threat. After the 1992 auto-coup, the intelligence work of the DINCOTE (National Counter-Terrorism Directorate) led to the capture of the leaders from MRTA and the Shining Path, including notorious Shining Path leader Abimael Guzmán. Guzmán's capture was a political coup for Fujimori, who used it to great effect in the press; in an interview with documentarian Ellen Perry, Fujimori even notes that he specially ordered Guzmán's prison jumpsuit to be white with black stripes, to enhance the image of his capture in the media.|$|E

25|$|After the fur trade {{declined}} in the mid-nineteenth century, Prairie du Chien's attention shifted to agriculture and the railroad. Although the city was first connected to the Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad in 1857, {{the width of the}} Mississippi River posed a challenge for further expansion of the railroad into Iowa. This problem was temporarily solved by disassembling the trains at Prairie du Chien and ferrying them across the river to be put back on the tracks on the other side. A better solution was found by Michael Spettel and John Lawler, who designed a permanent pontoon bridge to span the river in 1874. Lawler took most of the <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> invention, and made a small fortune through its operation.|$|E
25|$|Following this, {{the army}} was reassigned back to Bryansk Front. Renewing the offensive, Boldin's forces made two secret re-groupings before {{striking}} the weak left flank of the German position south of Kirov on Sept. 8, unhinging their line and forcing them to abandon Bryansk on the 17th. In Soviet accounts it is Gen. M.M. Popov, the Front commander, who gets most of the <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> success. By Sept. 27, 50th Army had seized a bridgehead across the Sozh River, {{and it was on}} this date that Popov met at the Kremlin with Stalin, Deputy Chief of the General Staff A.I. Antonov, and Gen. K.K. Rokossovsky, commander of Belorussian Front (later renamed 1st Belorussian Front). As a result of this meeting 50th Army was handed over to the latter Front {{in the first week of}} October.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} an anti-tumoral {{response}} {{of the immune system}} in vivo was recognized by the physician William B. Coley. In 1968, Dr. Gale A Granger from the University of California, Irvine, reported a cytotoxic factor produced by lymphocytes and named it lymphotoxin (LT). <b>Credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> discovery is shared by Dr. Nancy H. Ruddle from Yale University, who reported the same activity in a series of back-to-back articles published in the same month. Subsequently, in 1975 Dr. Lloyd J. Old from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, reported another cytotoxic factor produced by macrophages and named it tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Both factors were described based on their ability to kill mouse fibrosarcoma L-929 cells. These concepts were extended to systemic disease in 1981, when Ian A. Clark, from the Australian National University, in collaboration with Elizabeth Carswell in Dr. Old's group, working with pre-sequencing era data, reasoned that excessive production of TNF causes malaria disease and endotoxin poisoning.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his defeat}} at the Battle of Chalons in 451, Attila invaded Italy in 452, sacking {{cities such as}} Aquileia and heading for Rome. He {{allegedly}} demanded that the sister of the reigning Emperor Valentinian III be sent {{to him with a}} dowry. In response, the emperor sent three envoys to negotiate with Attila: Gennadius Avienus, one of the consuls of 450, Memmius Aemilius Trygetius, the former urban prefect, and Leo. Little is known of the specifics of the negotiations, as a result of which Attila withdrew. Most ancient and medieval historians celebrated Leo's actions, giving him all the <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> successful embassy. According to Prosper of Aquitaine who was alive {{at the time of the}} event, Attila was so impressed by Leo that he withdrew. Another near-contemporary was the historian Priscus who records that Attila was dissuaded from attacking Rome by his own men because they feared he would share the fate of the Visigothic king Alaric, who died shortly after sacking the city in 410. Paul the Deacon, in the late 8th century, relates that an enormously huge man dressed in priestly robes and armed with a sword, visible only to Attila, threatened him and his army with death during his discourse with Leo, and this prompted Attila to submit to his request.|$|E

In July 2010, Hemanth Kumar of South Scope called Pathala Bhairavi a film that [...] "took an entire generation by storm" [...] and praised its special effects in particular, which Kumar felt were ahead of their time. In his book One Hundred Indian Feature Films: An Annotated Filmography, Srivastava Banerjee gave a polarised review of the film by calling it [...] "an extraordinarily meaningless modern myth".|$|E

500|$|On 24 May 1788, Bounty {{anchored}} in False Bay, {{east of the}} Cape of Good Hope, where five weeks were spent in repairs and reprovisioning. Bligh's letters home emphasised how fit and well he and his crew were, by comparison with other vessels, and expressed hope that he would receive <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> At one stage during the sojourn, Bligh lent Christian money, a gesture that the historian Greg Dening suggests might have sullied their relationship by becoming a source of anxiety and even resentment to the younger man. In her account of the voyage, Caroline Alexander describes the loan as [...] "a significant act of friendship", but one which Bligh ensured Christian did not forget.|$|E

And three months later, NBC reported that that's exactly what Malvo did. And Muhammed had him train on the game to suppress his inhibition to kill." [...] John Muhammad was a Gulf War veteran and earned an expert marksmanship badge in the U.S. Army.|$|E
