40|$|Recent {{advances}} in digital microfluidics have enabled lab-on-a-chip devices for DNA sequencing, immunoassays, clinical chemistry, and protein crystallization. Basic operations such as droplet dispensing, mixing, dilution, localized heating, and incubation {{can be carried}} out using a two-dimensional array of electrodes and nanoliter volumes of liquid. The number of independent input <b>pins</b> used to <b>control</b> the electrodes in such microfluidic “biochips ” is an important cost-driver, especially for disposable PCB devices that are being developed for clinical and point-of-care diagnostics. However, most prior work on biochip design-automation has assumed independent control of the electrodes using a large number of input pins. Another limitation of prior work is that the mapping of <b>control</b> <b>pins</b> to electrodes is only applicable for a specific bioassay. We present a broadcast-addressing-based design technique for pin-constrained multi-functional biochips. The proposed method provides high throughput for bioassays and it reduces the number of <b>control</b> <b>pins</b> by identifying and connecting <b>control</b> <b>pins</b> with “compatible” actuation sequences. The proposed method is evaluated using a multifunctional chip designed to execute a set of multiplexed bioassays, the polymerase chain reaction, and a protein dilution assay.

40|$|Abstract- Microfluidic biochips are {{replacing}} the conven-tional biochemical analyzers {{and are able}} to integrate the necessary functions for biochemical analysis on-chip. In this paper we are interested in flow-based biochips, in which the fluidic flow manipulated using integrated mi-crovalves, which are controlled from external pressure sources, connected to “control pins”. By combining several microvalves, more complex units, such as micropumps, switches, mixers, and multiplexers, can be built. The cur-rent practice is to design these biochips by hand in draw-ing tools such as AutoCAD, and to program them manual-ly by individually controlling each valve. Recent research has proposed top-down physical synthesis Computer-Aided Design tools, and programming languages and com-pilation techniques to automatically derive the control signals for the valve actuations. However, researchers have so far assumed that the number of ports used to drive the valves (<b>control</b> <b>pins)</b> is unlimited, which has resulted in very expensive, bulky and energy consuming off-chip con-trol and infeasible control routes in the biochip control layer. In this paper, we propose a methodology {{to reduce the number of}} <b>control</b> <b>pins</b> required to run a biochemical application.

40|$|AbstractIn liner cementing, {{the upper}} cement plug and inner {{components}} of a common hanger needs to be drilled out after cementing, which {{will result in a}} poor cementing quality or even gas leakage at the flare opening. Therefore, a new packer-type drilling-free liner hanger has been developed, and a hydraulic setting-control packer, a flexible drilling-free seal box, and an auxiliary bearing back-off mechanism that go with the line hanger have been designed at the same time. Specific operation procedures include: (1) run in the liner string to the designed depth, then fully circulate the drilling fluid, finally drop the ball. When the tripping ball gets into the seat, the pressure will go up to cut off the hanging <b>control</b> <b>pin</b> and set the hanger; (2) continue to hold the pressure and cut off the ball seat pin to form circulation; (3) trip in the drill pipe to exert pressure on the hanger, back off to release the hanger from the running tool; (4) lower the drill pipe plug upon the completion of cement injection, cut off the releasing <b>control</b> <b>pin</b> of hollow casing plug, and run down further to bump with the bumping assembly; (5) remove the cementing head and connect the kelly driver, hold pressure again, then slowly pull up the drill tools, exert hydraulic pressure on the setting hydraulic cylinder of the packer assembly to cut off the setting <b>control</b> <b>pin</b> and set the packer; and (6) pull up the tools to the flare opening and wash out excessive cement slurry by circulating to realize free drilling of the whole hole. The successful application of the liner hanger in 127  mm diameter liner in Well BQ 203 -H 1 indicates that the packer-type liner hanger has such advantages as easy hanging and back-off, accurate bumping, simple setting, and sound sealing performance...|$|E

40|$|Pin tract infections of {{external}} fixators used in orthopacclic reconstructive bone surgery are serious cornplications that can {{eventually lead to}} periostitis and osteomyelitis. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that bacteria adhering to stainless steel in a biotilm mode of growth detach {{under the influence of}} small electric currents, while remaining bacteria become less viable upon current application. Therefore, we have investigated whether a 100 mu A electric current can prevent signs of clinical infection around percutaneous pins, implanted in the tibia of goats. Three pins were inserted into the lateral right tibia of nine goats, of which one served for additional frame support. Two pins were infected with a Staphylococcus epidermidis strain of which one pin was subjected to electric current, while the other pin was used as <b>control.</b> <b>Pin</b> sites were examined daily. The wound electrical resistance decreased with worsening of the infection from a dry condition to a purulent stage. After 21 days, animals were sacrificed and the pins taken out. Infection developed in 89 % of the <b>control</b> <b>pin</b> sites, whereas only 11 % of the pin sites in the current group showed infection. These results show that infection of percutaneous pin sites {{of external}} fixators in reconstructive bone surgery can be prevented by the application of a small DC electric current.

40|$|Abstract — On-line testing {{offers a}} {{promising}} method for detecting defects, fluidic abnormalities, and bioassay malfunctions in microfluidic biochips. To reduce product cost for disposable biochips, testing steps and functional fluidic operations must be implemented on pin-constrained designs. However, previous testing methods for pin-constrained designs do not optimize test schedules {{to reduce the}} number of <b>control</b> <b>pins</b> and test/assay completion time. We propose a pin-count-aware online testing method for pin-constrained designs to support the execution of both fault testing and the target bioassay protocol. The proposed method interleaves fault testing with the target bioassay protocol for online testing. It is aimed at significantly reducing the completion time for testing and for the bioassay, while keeping the number of <b>control</b> <b>pins</b> small. Two practical applications, namely a multiplexed bioassay and an interpolation-based mixing protocol, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Digital Microfluidic Biochip (DMFB) {{has drawn}} lots of {{attention}} today. It offers a promising platform for {{various kinds of}} biochemical experiments. DMFB that uses crossreferencing technology to drive droplets movements scales down the <b>control</b> <b>pin</b> number on chip, which not only brings down manufacturing cost but also allows large-scale chip design. However, the cross-referencing scheme that imposes different voltage on rows and columns to activate the cells, might cause severe electrode interference, and hence greatly decreases the degree of parallelism of droplet routing. Most of the previous papers get a directaddressing result first, and then convert to cross-referencing compatible result. This paper proposes a new method that solves the droplet routing problem on cross-referencing biochip directly.

Both I/O ports are auto−sensing; thus, no direction pin is required. The Output Enable (EN) input, when Low, disables both I/O ports by putting them in 3 −state.
