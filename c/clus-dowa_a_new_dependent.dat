'Clus-DOWA: <b>A</b> <b>New</b> <b>Dependent</b> OWA Operator', In Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, Hong Kong, China, 2008 Aggregation {{operators}} {{are crucial to}} integrating diverse decision makers' opinion. While minimum and maximum can represent optimistic and pessimistic extremes, an Ordered Weighted Aggregation (OWA) operator is able to reflect varied human attitudes lying between the two using distinct weight vectors. Several weight determination techniques ignore characteristics of data being aggregated. In contrary, data-oriented operators like centered OWA and dependent OWA utilize the centralized data structure to generate reliable weights.
