5|$|Barium {{hydroxide}} ("baryta") {{was known}} to alchemists, who produced it by heating barium carbonate.

30|$|In the following, we <b>calibrate</b> the MR-FDPF {{model in}} two cases. The first case is to <b>calibrate</b> the MR-FDPF model {{with all the}} {{available}} measurement data, while the second case is to <b>calibrate</b> it with {{only a part of}} the available measurement data. Intuitively, the prediction performance of the MR-FDPF model <b>calibrated</b> with all the measurement data should be better than that <b>calibrated</b> with only a part of the measurement data since more measurement data are used.|$|R
30|$|A <b>calibrated</b> {{predictive}} model must quantify the relationship existing between {{at least two}} measures.

One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E

5|$|Shen Kuo was {{the first}} to discern {{magnetic}} declination of true north while experimenting with a compass. Shen theorized that geographical climates gradually shifted over time. He created a theory of land formation involving concepts accepted in modern geomorphology. He performed optical experiments with camera obscura just decades after Ibn al-Haytham {{was the first}} to do so. He also improved the designs of astronomical instruments such as the widened astronomical sighting tube, which allowed Shen Kuo to fix the position of the pole star (which had shifted over centuries of time). Shen Kuo was also known for hydraulic clockworks, as he invented a new overflow-tank clepsydra which had more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in <b>calibrating</b> the measure of time.|$|E
40|$|Visual {{surveillance}} using {{a camera}} network has imposed new challenges to camera calibration. An essential {{problem is that}} a large number of cameras may not have a common field of view or even be synchronized well. We propose to use a hybrid camera network that consists of catadioptric and perspective cameras for a visual surveillance task. The relations between multiple views of a scene captured from different cameras can be then <b>calibrated</b> under the catadioptric camera’s coordinate system. This paper addresses the important issue of how to <b>calibrate</b> the hybrid camera network. We <b>calibrate</b> the hybrid camera network in three steps. First, we <b>calibrate</b> the catadioptric camera using only the vanishing points. In order to reduce computational complexity, we <b>calibrate</b> the camera without the mirror first and then <b>calibrate</b> the catadioptric camera system. Second, we determine 3 D positions of some points using as few as two spatial parallel lines and some equidistance points. Finally, we <b>calibrate</b> other perspective cameras based on these known spatial points. 1...|$|R
40|$|Excellent ranking power {{along with}} well <b>calibrated</b> {{probability}} estimates {{are needed in}} many classification tasks. In this paper, we introduce a technique, <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest that captures both. This novel technique is an ensemble of gradient boosting machines that can support both continuous and binary labels. While offering superior ranking power over any individual regression or classification model, <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest is able to preserve well <b>calibrated</b> posterior probabilities. Along with these benefits, we provide {{an alternative to the}} tedious step of tuning gradient boosting machines. We demonstrate that tuning <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest can be reduced to a simple hyper-parameter selection. We further establish that increasing this hyper-parameter improves the ranking performance under a diminishing return. We examine the effectiveness of <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest on ligand-based virtual screening where both continuous and binary labels are available and compare the performance of <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest with logistic regression, gradient boosting machine and deep learning. <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest achieved an approximately 48 % improvement compared to a state-of-art deep learning model. Moreover, it achieved around 95 % improvement on probability quality measurement compared to the best individual gradient boosting machine. <b>Calibrated</b> Boosting-Forest offers a benchmark demonstration that in the field of ligand-based virtual screening, deep learning is not the universally dominant machine learning model and good <b>calibrated</b> probabilities can better facilitate virtual screening process.

5|$|Vega {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed “arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun.” Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86°14'. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed {{and the first to}} have its spectrum recorded.

5|$|Being {{the head}} {{official}} for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo {{was an avid}} scholar of medieval astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments. Shen is credited with making improved designs of the gnomon, armillary sphere, and clepsydra clock. For the clepsydra he designed a new overflow-tank type, and argued for a more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in <b>calibrating</b> the measure of time. Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical sighting tube, Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe the pole star indefinitely. This came about due {{to the position of}} the pole star shifting in position since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of the pole star for three months, plotting the data of its course and coming to the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees. Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time. Even Shen's political rival and contemporary astronomer Su Song featured Shen's corrected position of the pole star (halfway between Tian shu, at −350 degrees, and the current Polaris) in the fourth star map of his celestial atlas.|$|E
