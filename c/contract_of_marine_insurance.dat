5000|$|The {{notion of}} utmost good faith, {{and the view}} that the {{insurance}} contract, or for that matter any other contract, may be a contract of the utmost good faith, was rejected in Mutual and Federal v Oudtshoorn Municipality. Acknowledging that the origin of the phrase “uberrima fides” was doubtful, but noting that it apparently made its appearance in English law in 1850, the court was “unable to find any Roman-Dutch authority in support of the proposition that a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> is a contract uberrima fidei”. The court rejected the expression as “alien, vague and useless and without any particular meaning in law,” explaining ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a comparative analysis of two elements <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> that {{are the source of}} divergence between common and civil law jurisdictions: the duty of utmost good faith and warranties. The thorough analysis will show that the two jurisdictions and, presumably, the common and civil law traditions, diverge in the field <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> in the legal concepts as such, but not so much in the substance <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> The duty <b>of</b> utmost good faith permits the insurer to be fully and properly informed about all circumstances material to the assessment of the risk and to making <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> and its terms. Despite relative coherency of the regulation of the issues of materiality and causality between the breach of the duty of utmost good faith and the loss occurred, the sanctions for the breach vary significantly between the civil and common law jurisdictions. It will be examined how the warranty, a typical common law concept, has been replaced in civil law jurisdictions. Various methods of harmonization will be examined and discussed in the light of possible application in the field <b>of</b> <b>marine</b> <b>insurance.</b> In the conclusion, it will be argued that reconciling fundamental legal concepts inherent to various legal traditions is a demanding task and may not be as advantageous for the respective field of law as it is expected to...|$|R
