A sample of kadosero from a local market was both analyzed for its basic composition and its role on bioactivity of plant extract. Titrimetric, Gravimetric and Atomic Absorption Spectrometric analyses were used to determine contents of the mineral kadosero. Disc Diffusion Assay was used for bioactivity screening in-vitro. Chemical analysis of kadosero revealed the presence of SO 4 − 2 (0. 0038 mg/g), Fe 2 (0. 0027 mg/g), Cl− (232. 683 mg/g) and Na+ (151. 25 mg/g). In-vitro tests revealed that supplementing extract of Balanites aegyptiaca with a mineral kadosero by using untreated well water reduced number of bacterial from 100 colony forming units to nil at a mass of a mineral between 60 – 100 mg. On the other hand, a mineral kadosero did not increase bioactivity of the extract of B. aegyptiaca against the test microbes in agar disc diffusion assay. This was attributed by interaction between the mineral kadosero and nutrient agar medium. The <b>crude</b> <b>mineral</b> kadosero can be supplemented to other plant extracts used locally for treatment of general bacterial infections for increased bioactivity.

However, several conflicts exist, such as the achievement of high yields without the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides and the minimization of nutrient losses.

Tomato yield and quality aspects such as taste and chemical composition were measured. Three greenhouse experiments were performed at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala during 2002 and 2004. Organic fertilizers, based on chicken manure or fresh grass clover mulch, were compared to mineral fertilizer nutrient solutions with ammonium or nitrate as the dominant nitrogen source.
