40|$|Investigation of {{intracellular}} dynamics {{requires a}} detailed description of the molecular topography and ultrastructural morphology of the cell, for example, the position of a protein in relation to a given compartment of the cell and the morphology of the <b>compartment.</b> <b>Standard</b> fluorescence light microscopy (FLM) localizes proteins in living or fixed cells with a resolution of few hundreds of nanometers, but the unlabeled cellular context is partially missing. Electron microscopy (EM) techniques, such as immuno-EM, reveal protein topology with a few tens of nanometer resolution and retain the cellular context. However, EM analysis shows shortcomings compared to FLM, such as, lower statistical output, applicability only to fixed cells, and higher technical difficulties. To bridge the gap between fluorescent cell imaging and EM, several laboratories have developed methods for correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM). In CLEM, a limited number of fluorescently labeled cell compartments are first imaged by light microscopy and then visualized and analyzed by EM. Recently, two different CLEM approaches using the EM cryo-immunogold method have been developed to extend the analysis to a high number of regions of interest and to correlate the topology of specific antigens. In this chapter, we describe one of these methods, the High Data Output CLEM (HDO-CLEM) approach. The major benefits of HDO-CLEM are the possibility to (1) correlate several hundreds of events at the same time, (2) perform three-dimensional (3 D) correlation, (3) immunolabel both endogenous and recombinantly tagged proteins at the same time, and (4) combine the high data analysis capability of FLM with the high precision-accuracy of transmission electron microscopy in a CLEM hybrid morphometric analysis. We have identified and optimized critical steps in sample preparation, defined routines for sample analysis and retracing of regions of interest, developed software for semi/fully automatic 3 D FLM reconstruction and defined preliminary conditions for a hybrid light/electron microscopy morphometry approach...|$|E
40|$|Subject of the {{dissertation}} {{is a new}} {{numerical model}} for geometrical and material non–linear fire analysis of steel–concrete two–layered composite beams accounting for longitudinal and transversal partial interlayer interaction. The numerical procedure consists of three mathematically uncoupled phases. For {{the determination of the}} time–dependent development of temperatures in the fire <b>compartment</b> <b>standard</b> fire curves are used in the first phase. In the following hygro–thermal phase, coupled heat and moisture transfer in the analysed beam is determined. For the steel layer of the beam Fourier law of heat conduction is employed. In the reinforced concrete layer, the distributions of temperatures, pore pressures, and free water contents are defined by a system of mass and energy conservation equations and considering phenomena such as phase transitions (water evaporation and water vapour condensation), release of chemically bound water, capillary pressure and difussion of adsorbed water. For structures endangered by the concrete spalling phenomenon, the stress-strain state in the beam at room temperature is accounted for in the calculations of the time–dependent permeability of the concrete. The final mechanical part of the fire analysis deals with the time–dependent stress–strain state of the composite beam. The most important novelties of this part of the model are: (i) each of the layers of the composite beam is modelled separately by the kinematically exact planar beam theory of Reissner and the contact constitutive law is described in dependence on the longitudinal and the transversal slips between the layers and on the uplift; (ii) contact constitutive laws are described in an average base established from tangential and normal contact basis vectors; (iii) material non–linear and temperature–dependent behaviour of steel and concrete layers is described using the principle of additivity of strains where viscous creep of steel and creep and transient deformations of concrete are explicitly considered. In the zones of cyclic loading and reloading of the structure, hardening of the material is accounted for by the model of kinematic hardening. In {{the second part of the}} dissertation the new proposed model is validated against experimental data and the proposed numerical procedure is proven to be adequate and accurate for the fire analysis of stiffness, ductility, and bearing capacity of an arbitrary beam of this kind. All of the calculations of this as well as of the final part of the dissertation are performed using the computer softwares MoistureHeat 2 and CompositeBeam both computed in the computing environment Matlab. An important finding of the verification chapter of the thesis shows that the impacts of the mechanical loading of the beam and the effects of restrained thermal dilatations are to be considered in the hygro-thermal part of the analysis if not only temperature but also pore pressure development is important (i. e. in an analysi...|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{filtering}} of noisy voltage signals on dendritic trees is a {{key problem}} in computational cellular neuroscience. However, the state variable in this problem — the vector of voltages at every compartment — is very high-dimensional: realistic multicompartmental models often have {{on the order of}} N = 10 4 <b>compartments.</b> <b>Standard</b> implementations of the Kalman filter require O(N 3) time and O(N 2) space, and are therefore impractical. Here we take advantage of three special features of the dendritic filtering problem to construct an efficient filter: (1) dendritic dynamics are governed by a cable equation on a tree, which may be solved using sparse matrix methods in O(N) time; and current methods for observing dendritic voltage (2) provide low SNR observations and (3) only image {{a relatively small number of}} compartments at a time. The idea is to approximate the Kalman equations in terms of a low-rank perturbation of the steady-state (zero-SNR) solution, which may be obtained in O(N) time using methods that exploit the sparse tree structure of dendritic dynamics. The resulting methods give a very good approximation to the exact Kalman solution, but only require O(N) time and space. We illustrate the method with applications to real and simulated dendritic branching structures, and describe how to extend the techniques to incorporate spatially subsampled, temporally filtered, and nonlinearly transformed observations. ...|$|R

40|$|Food webs, {{networks}} of feeding relationships in an ecosystem, provide fundamental insights into mechanisms that determine ecosystem stability and persistence. A standard approach in food-web analysis, and network analysis in general, {{has been to}} identify compartments, or modules, defined by many links within compartments and few links between them. This approach can identify large habitat boundaries in the network but may fail to identify other important structures. Empirical analyses of food webs have been further limited by low-resolution data for primary producers. In this paper, we present a Bayesian computational method for identifying group structure using a flexible definition that can describe both functional trophic roles and <b>standard</b> <b>compartments.</b> We apply this method to a newly compiled plant-mammal food web from the Serengeti ecosystem that includes high taxonomic resolution at the plant level, allowing a simultaneous examination of the signature of both habitat and trophic roles in network structure. We find that groups at the plant level reflect habitat structure, coupled at higher trophic levels by groups of herbivores, which are in turn coupled by carnivore groups. Thus the group structure of the Serengeti web represents a mixture of trophic guild structure and spatial pattern, {{in contrast to the}} <b>standard</b> <b>compartments</b> typically identified.
