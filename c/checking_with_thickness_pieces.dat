60|$|A {{hole was}} also dug {{close to a}} second huge stone, which in falling had broken into two pieces; and this must have {{happened}} long ago, judging from the weathered aspect of the fractured ends. The base was buried {{to a depth of}} 10 inches, as was ascertained by driving an iron skewer horizontally into the ground beneath it. The vegetable mould forming the turf-covered sloping border round the stone, on which many castings had recently been ejected, was 10 inches in thickness; and most of this mould must have been brought up by worms from beneath its base. At a distance of 8 yards from the stone, the mould was only 5.5 inches in <b>thickness</b> (<b>with</b> a <b>piece</b> of tobacco pipe at a depth of 4 inches), and this rested on broken flint and chalk which could not have easily yielded to the pressure or weight of the stone.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{combined}} procedure {{to determine the}} forming limit diagram (Keeler-Goodwin diagram) for thick sheets is proposed. It is defined for cold rolled steel sheet Č 0147 (RSt 13 DIN 17006) <b>with</b> <b>thickness</b> of 5 mm using two different criteria: maximum uniform elongation and the criteria of tearing. For the area of one positive and one negative strain (the left part of the diagram) the curves of limit strain are determined using the method of inline stretch of test tubes with circular lateral clips of sheet <b>with</b> <b>thickness</b> of 5 mm. The curves of limit strain are gained by drawing using rough hemispherical punch of sheet strips with different widths for the same quality of the material, but <b>with</b> <b>thickness</b> of 1 mm. For the area of two positive strains (the right part), the curves of limit strain for sheet <b>with</b> <b>thickness</b> of 5 mm are determined so that, in continuation to the right end side of the limit curves, gained with stretching of the test tubes with circular lateral clips, the for material <b>with</b> <b>thickness</b> of 1 mm are drawn, retaining the same form in the process.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} program <b>checking</b> <b>with</b> certificates {{by extending}} the traditional notion of black-box program checking. Moreover, we establish program <b>checking</b> <b>with</b> certificates as a safety-scalable and practical method {{to ensure the}} correctness of real-scale applications. We motivate our extension of program <b>checking</b> <b>with</b> concepts of computational complexity theory and show its practical implication on the implementation and verification of checkers. Furthermore, we present an iterative method to construct checkers which is {{able to deal with}} the practically relevant problem of incomplete or missing specifications of software. In our case study, we have considered compilers and their generators, in particular code generators based on rewrite systems...|$|R
40|$|Present work {{examines}} {{the effects of}} chemical reactive species and solar radiation on Carreau nanofluid induced by a stretching sheet <b>with</b> variable <b>thickness.</b> Heat generation effects are taken for exothermic reaction. In the boundary layer region, nanoparticles provides enhancement in the heat transfer phenomena. In the literature, most of the researchers used Runge Kutta Fehlberg method, but our main concentration here {{is to find the}} solution by improved form of Fehlberg method (Cash and Carp). The velocity, temperature and concentration profiles are plotted for different governing parameter, namely, wall thickness parameter, magnetic parameter, thermal conductivity parameter, chemical reaction parameter, Schmidt number and Prandtl number. It is found that the velocity profile increases by increasing Weissenberg numberWe, Hartmann number M and wall thickness parameter n. Moreover, temperature profile enhances by increasing heat generation parameter Î³ and radiative heat flux parameter R. The accuracy of the present method is <b>checked</b> <b>with</b> previously published work and excellent agreement is noticed.
