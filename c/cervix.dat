5|$|In {{front of}} {{the upper part of}} the <b>cervix</b> lies the bladder, {{separated}} from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over the sides of the <b>cervix.</b> To the rear, the supravaginal <b>cervix</b> is covered by peritoneum, which runs onto the back of the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and onto the rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch. The <b>cervix</b> is more tightly connected to surrounding structures than the rest of the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Three {{channels}} facilitate lymphatic drainage {{from the}} <b>cervix.</b> The anterior and lateral <b>cervix</b> drains to nodes along the uterine arteries, travelling along the cardinal ligaments {{at the base}} of the broad ligament to the external iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes. The posterior and lateral <b>cervix</b> drains along the uterine arteries to the internal iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes, and the posterior section of the <b>cervix</b> drains to the obturator and presacral lymph nodes. However, there are variations as lymphatic drainage from the <b>cervix</b> travels to different sets of pelvic nodes in some people. This has implications in scanning nodes for involvement in cervical cancer.|$|E
5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the <b>cervix</b> undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the <b>cervix</b> remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the <b>cervix</b> becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E

30|$|An 51 -year-old gravida 6, para 2, woman {{presented}} {{for evaluation of}} vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. It was suspected of uterine didelphys, and MRI was scheduled. MRI of the pelvis showed a double uterus with two separate <b>cervices,</b> and one vagina. Each uterus has a single myomas (Rt: 2.4  cm, Lt: 5.4  cm) at bodies. Each horn linked to the ipsilateral adnexa. And absence of right kidney were also observed. Because of bicervical anomaly, traditional colpotomizer system couldn’t be performed. So, sharp portion of rubber neonate sucker, grasped by placental forcep was inserted through vagina.

30|$|This unique mullerian anomaly {{which does}} not conform to our {{classical}} understanding of mullerian development {{may be due to}} minor mesonephric defects or to an alternative mechanism of mullerian development. Women with two <b>cervices</b> and a vaginal septum may pose difficulties during taking cervical smears and the process may be performed under anaesthesia. Since they are exposed to the same oncogenes, the risk of developing carcinoma exists in both <b>cervices.</b> This is the first reported case of pregnancy and, hence, we can assume that women with this anomaly can be offered normal vaginal delivery.|$|R
5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the <b>cervix</b> is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, <b>cervix</b> and uterus. The <b>cervix</b> grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the <b>cervix</b> over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the <b>cervix</b> is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E
5|$|Blood is {{supplied}} to the <b>cervix</b> by the descending {{branch of the}} uterine artery and drains into the uterine vein. The pelvic splanchnic nerves, emerging as S2S3, transmit the sensation of pain from the <b>cervix</b> to the brain. These nerves travel along the uterosacral ligaments, which pass from the uterus to the anterior sacrum.|$|E

5|$|Cervical {{agenesis}} {{is a rare}} congenital {{condition in}} which the <b>cervix</b> completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of the vagina to develop.

5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the <b>cervix</b> can be {{detected}} by cervical screening, using methods including a Pap smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped {{from the surface of}} the <b>cervix</b> and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the <b>cervix,</b> was invented in 1925. The Pap smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the Pap test has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.|$|E

40|$|We investigated, in {{cervical}} cancer, {{the relation}} between telomerase activity, telomerase RNA (hTR) and mRNA of the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT, with "classic" clinicopathological factors as well as survival. Frozen specimens were obtained from 107 consecutive patients with cervical cancer, treated with surgery or radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Telomerase activity was determined with fluorescence-based TRAP and hTR and hTERT with semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Eight normal cervical specimens served as controls, Analysis of prognostic factors and survival was limited to early-stage patients, treated primarily with radical hysterectomy. Telomerase activity was not detected in normal <b>cervices</b> and was present in 85 of 107 (79 %) cervical cancers (p < 0. 001), hTR was detected in all normal <b>cervices</b> and cervical cancers, while hTERT mRNA was detected in I of 8 (13 %) normal <b>cervices</b> and in 83 of 104 (80 %) cervical cancers (p < 0. 001), In contrast to semi-quantitative hTR expression levels, semi-quantitative hTERT mRNA levels were related to telomerase activity levels (P < 0. 01), In all patients, telomerase activity levels were related to differentiation grade (p < 0. 05) but not to stage and histotype, In early-stage patients, telomerase activity, hTR and hTERT were not related to tumor volume, vascular invasion or presence of metastatic lymph nodes. Tumor volume, vascular invasion and presence of metastatic lymph nodes were related to (progression-free) survival, while telomerase activity and its subunits were not. Frequent up-regulation of telomerase activity and hTERT mRNA is especially observed in cervical cancers, while hTR is also detected in normal <b>cervices.</b> Telomerase is not applicable as a prognostic factor in early-stage cervical cancer patients.

5|$|Female {{marsupials}} have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal {{species have}} a single <b>cervix</b> and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they {{are thought to have}} lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a <b>cervix</b> on more than one lineage.|$|E
40|$|We {{looked for}} human {{herpesvirus}} 6 (HHV- 6) and HHV- 7 genomes in the <b>cervixes</b> {{of pregnant women}} in the late stages of their pregnancies. Of 72 samples collected with cervical swabs and amplified by nested PCR, we found that 14 (19. 4 %) and 2 (2. 7 %) contained detectable HHV- 6 and HHV- 7 genomes, respectively. The two samples in which HHV- 7 DNA was detected also contained HHV- 6 genomes. Hybridization of HHV- 6 DNA amplified by PCR with variant-specific probes revealed {{that all of these}} DNA samples belonged to variant type B. These results indicated that HHV- 6 and/or HHV- 7 exists in the <b>cervixes</b> of infected women in late pregnancy and may cause perinatal infection...|$|R
40|$|The AgNOR {{technique}} {{was used to}} analyse 11 cases of adenocarcinoma in situ of the endocervix and five examples of healthy <b>cervices</b> to assess whether areas of "increased nuclear activity" could be located adjacent to the malignant tissue. Areas of adenocarcinoma in situ had significantly more AgNOR staining dots than apparently normal bordering areas ("transitional areas") and areas of endocervical epithelium remote from adenocarcinoma in situ. There {{were no significant differences}} between AgNOR counts in transitional areas and areas remote from adenocarcinoma in situ, and between these areas and histologically normal <b>cervices.</b> These observations provide no support for the hypothesis that areas of glandular atypia of lesser severity or zones of "increased nuclear activity" exist adjacent to adenocarcinoma in situ...|$|R
30|$|As {{a part of}} {{the routine}} {{cervical}} screening, it becomes necessary to take smears from both <b>cervices</b> at screening, as oncogenic agents like human papillomavirus (HPV), which may be responsible for cellular changes, may affect both <b>cervices.</b> Her smear was reported as moderate dyskaryosis. Colposcopy and taking smears was technically difficult in this patient in view of the anomaly. Hence, she was examined under anaesthesia and a laparoscopy was performed to exclude uterine and other pelvic abnormalities. Loop-cone biopsies were performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Since the biopsy report did not suggest any CIN, further smears would be done at 3 -yearly intervals in the future. In the event of technical difficulties in obtaining cervical smears, the same procedure may need to be carried out under anaesthesia.|$|R
5|$|Inflammation of the <b>cervix</b> is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the <b>cervix</b> are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the <b>cervix</b> using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E

40|$|Methylation of p 16 is an {{important}} mechanism in cervical carcinogenesis. However, the relationship between cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) remains controversial. Here, we explored whether EBV infection and/or p 16 gene inactivation would play any role in cervical carcinogenesis. Eighty-two specimens included 41 invasive SCCs, 30 cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN; CIN 1, 11 cases, CIN II, 3 cases, CIN III 16 cases) and 11 nonneoplastic <b>cervices.</b> EBV was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for EBNA- 1 and in situ hybridization for EBER- 1. The p 16 methylation-status and the expression of p 16 protein were studied by methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The materials were divided into four groups: 1) nonneoplastic <b>cervices,</b> 2) CIN I, 3) CIN II-III and 4) invasive SCCs. p 16 methylation and p 16 immunoexpressions increased in CIN and invasive SCCs than nonneoplastic tissue. p 16 -methylation and p 16 -immunoreactivities {{were higher in the}} EBV-positive group (p= 0. 009, p< 0. 001) than in the EBV-negative group. EBV was detected more frequently in CIN and SCCs than nonneoplastic <b>cervices.</b> In conclusion, a correlation between p 16 methylation, p 16 immunoreactivity and the detection of EBV strongly suggested that the cooperation of EBV and p 16 gene may play a synergic effect on cell cycle deregulation...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} by nested PCR the possible association of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV- 6) and human papillomavirus (HPV) genomes in the <b>cervixes</b> of 109 women with normal and abnormal cytological smears.

HHV- 6 DNA was found in only one patient, who had a cytological pattern of koilocytosis. The HHV- 6 genome was classified by restriction enzyme analysis as variant B. The study indicates that detection of the HHV- 6 genome in the <b>cervixes</b> of women with a wide spectrum of gynecological complaints is a rare event and rules out the possible association between HHV- 6 and HPV genomes in cervical cancer lesions...|$|R

5|$|Higher-staged cancers {{are more}} likely to recur, as are those that have invaded the myometrium or <b>cervix,</b> or that have metastasized into the lymphatic system.

5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the <b>cervix.</b> Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the <b>cervix.</b> Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the <b>cervix</b> by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E
