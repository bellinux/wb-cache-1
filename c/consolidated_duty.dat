50|$|Before {{his inauguration}} Dixon spent an {{extensive}} {{amount of time}} preparing for his term. He met with Bibb Graves, public administration experts and Franklin Roosevelt to get advice and expertise on his plans for changing Alabama’s government. As governor, Dixon strove to streamline the state government. He eliminated twenty-seven government agencies in the state by <b>consolidating</b> <b>duties</b> within the departments. The agencies that originally were {{under the leadership of}} committees were placed under the authority of one individual who reported directly to the governor. He, therefore, also centralized power {{in the office of the}} governor. He terminated the employment of every state employee added to the payroll after the date of his inauguration and ordered every employee that did not have specific duties to be terminated as well. He pushed through a teachers’ retirement system and a teacher tenure law. He also established a state civil service system that required the hiring of state employees to be based on a merit system.|$|R

50|$|The {{position}} of Secretary of Human Resources and Administration {{was established in}} 2003 when Governor Brad Henry issued an executive order merging the former positions of Secretary of Human Resources and Secretary of Administration into a single position. Previously, both positions had existed separately since 1986 when they were established by the Executive Branch Reform Act of 1986. In 2011, the Oklahoma Legislature passed the Government Administrative Process Consolidation and Reorganization Act of 2011. This Act <b>consolidated</b> the <b>duties</b> and responsibilities of the Secretary into those of the Oklahoma Secretary of Finance and Revenue, thereby eliminating the position.|$|R

50|$|Following the Second World War, Canada {{experienced}} a major expansion in ocean commerce, culminating {{with the opening}} of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958. The shipping industry was changing throughout eastern Canada and required an expanded federal government role in the Great Lakes and the Atlantic coast, as well as an increased presence in the Arctic and Pacific coasts for sovereignty purposes. The government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker decided to <b>consolidate</b> the <b>duties</b> of the Marine Service of the Department of Transport and on January 26, 1962, the Canadian Coast Guard was formed as a subsidiary of DOT. One of the more notable inheritances at the time of formation was the icebreaker , transferred from the Royal Canadian Navy.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of Secretary of Finance {{was established in}} 1986 to provide greater oversight and coordination to the financial and revenue activities of the State government. The position was established, along with the Oklahoma State Cabinet, by the Executive Branch Reform Act of 1986. The Act directed the Secretary of Finance and Revenue to advise the Governor on financial policy and advise the state financial agencies on new policy as directed by the governor.In 2011, the Oklahoma Legislature passed the Government Administrative Process Consolidation and Reorganization Act of 2011.

50|$|Each {{ministry}} {{is headed by}} a minister, who is assisted by two to twelve deputy ministers. The number and functions of the ministries are not prescribed in the Constitution, but in 1987 there were twenty-three ministries, {{and a number of}} other specialised commissions and departments. In apparent response to the call by the Sixth National Party Congress in 1986 for a streamlined bureaucracy, several ministries were merged. The former ministries of agriculture, food, and food industry were joined in a newly created Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry. The ministries of power and mines were merged to form the Ministry of Energy, and a newly created Ministry of Labour, War Invalids, and Social Welfare <b>consolidated</b> the <b>duties</b> of three former ministries. The addition of two new ministerial bodies also resulted from the 6th National Party Congress: a Ministry of Information to replace the Vietnam Radio and Television Commission, and a mission for Economic Relations with Foreign Countries to act as a co-ordinating body for foreign aid.|$|R
40|$|Cardiology a ward rounds: {{rationale}} {{of using}} a checklist Editor – I read with great interest Herring et al’s professional issues paper (Clin Med Feb 2011 pp 20 – 2) on ward rounds and using a checklist to improve quality and safety. In the modern NHS, there is often significant pres-sure on consultant staff to <b>consolidate</b> several clinical <b>duties</b> during their clinical sessions. As our {{population is aging and}} people are living longer than ever before, the majority of patients in medical wards are now elderly with multiple medical issues and also social issues. This obviously creates complexity in ward rounds. From our experience, cardiology ward rounds can be divided into many facets. A few examples are as follows: a) consultant-led ward round; b) specialist registrar (SpR) -led ward round; c) senior house officer-led ward round; d) consultant/SpR led board ward round; e) post-take ward rounds led by con-sultants; f) foundation year 1 -led ward round (should not happen ideally). Cardiology is predominantly a procedure driven specialty. Checklists will be very rele-vant in various cardiac patients who get admitted for various cardiac procedures ranging from ablation to percutaneous coro-nary intervention. This checklist could include vascular complications, follow-up planning details and also be individualised for each cardiovascular procedures. Checklists already exist for cardiac proce-dures in various NHS hospitals and they are embedded in procedural pathways. They become relevant in ward rounds as patients requiring overnight stay for their procedures will be reviewed by ward-based teams at some stage. For example, post-pacemaker implantation patients should have a chest X-ray the next day and a checklist-based system will facilitate the ward team to make sure this is reviewed before discharge. Overall, this reduces complications, clinical/nursing errors and facilitates early discharge of patients. It also provides one pathway com-munication between several teams involved in a patient’s care...|$|R

Nepakankamas asmenų naudojimasis minėtomis priemonėmis sąlygoja siekį išsiaiškinti teisines, sistemines bei organizacines sveikatos sistemos kliūtis, įgyvendinant sveikatos priežiūros tikslus. Neaiškus teisės aktų reglamentavimas nustatant atsakingą subjektą už žalą sveikatai, kilusią netaikius profilaktinių priemonių, sąlygojo šio magistrinio darbo temos pasirinkimą. Taigi, šiuo magistriniu darbu siekiama tiksliai apibrėžti subjektus, atsakingus už žalą asmens sveikatai, kilusią dėl profilaktinių priemonių netaikymo, tam, kad žalą patyrusio asmens interesai būti tinkamai apginti. Pirmajame šio darbo skyriuje nustatyta, jog tarptautiniais bei nacionaliniais teisės aktais įtvirtintas valstybės įsipareigojimas rūpintis asmenų sveikata, be kita ko, numato teisę asmeniui būti informuotam apie šalyje įgyvendinamas profilaktines priemones, kurios apmokamos privalomojo sveikatos draudimo lėšomis, bei galimybę jomis pasinaudoti. Antrajame skyriuje išnagrinėtos asmens sveikatos priežiūros specialistų ir visuomenės sveikatos priežiūros specialistų pareigos taikant profilaktines priemones bei nustatyta, jog valstybėje nėra aiškiai reglamentuotas šių sveikatos priežiūros specialistų bendradarbiavimas, todėl informacija apie vykdomas profilaktines priemones ne visada pasiekia konkretų asmenį. Trečiajame skyriuje, panaudojus hipotetinių situacijų analizę, nustatyta, jog atsakomybė dėl profilaktinių priemonių netaikymo konkretaus asmens atveju, gali kilti dviems subjektams – pačiam asmeniui bei pirminės asmens sveikatos priežiūros specialistams (šeimos gydytojui, dirbančiam su bendrosios praktikos slaugytoju), kurių vykdoma veikla nukreipta į asmenį bei sprendžia jo sveikatos problemas, tuo tarpu visuomenės sveikatos priežiūros specialistai pagal dabartinį teisinį reguliavimą nebūtų laikomi atsakingais, kadangi jų vykdomos pareigos taikant profilaktines priemones yra nukreiptos į visuomenę, o ne į konkretų asmenį, taigi, nėra priežastinio ryšio tarp konkretaus asmens sveikatos pablogėjimo ir šių specialistų vykdomos veiklos. Asmuo tampa atsakingu elgdamasis aplaidžiai po to, kai jis buvo informuotas apie riziką sveikatai bei rekomenduotinas profilaktines priemones, tačiau atsisakė jomis pasinaudoti. Asmens sveikatos priežiūros specialistams atsakomybė kyla tada, kai pažeidus pareigą informuoti asmenį apie taikomą profilaktiką bei riziką jo sveikatai, asmuo nepasinaudojo teikiamomis paslaugomis, dėl ko kilo žala sveikatai. Nustačius teisinės atsakomybės pasiskirstymą, pasiektas magistrinio darbo tikslas bei pateiktos rekomendacijos dėl profilaktinių priemonių taikymo reglamentavimo. A {{question}} analysed in this master {{thesis is}} whether {{a person who is}} insured by compulsory health insurance in Lithuania, is responsible for preventive measures for his health preservation. Considering health {{to be one of the}} most important fundamental rights of every human, both national and international laws create an obligation to the country to provide appropriate health care to people. Preventive measures such as vaccinations, preventive health examinations or preventive screening programmes are remedies that aim to prevent diseases and improve health. Moreover, medical expenses are being saved due to preventive health care services if treatment is avoided. The biggest challenge of health care systems is to control chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases which are the leading cause of mortality not only in Lithuania but in all European Union as well. Early diagnosis of these diseases are directly related with participating in preventative check-ups or screening programmes, such as cervical cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and others, which are covered under the compulsary health insurance in Lithuania. However, the lack of engagement in preventive measures indicates the need to ascertain legal, organizational and systemic obstacles of the health care system while organizing and implementing health care. The question of responsibility while executing preventive measures has not been raised before. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is legal uncertainty of subjects who would be held responsible for causing damage to individual’s health by not applying preventive measures. The first chapter of this thesis analyses the country‘s obligation to create a health care system which allows to obtain health care services. Article 53 of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania as well as international documents concerning human rights which are adopted by Lithuanian law, indicates the obligation of the country to take care of health of the individuals. The Charter of fundamental rights of European Union consolidates the right of access to prevention as well as medical treatment. This responsibility implicates the duty to a country not only to guarantee the treatment of illnesses but also measures and diagnostic techniques to prevent illnesses as well. Compulsory health insurance in Lithuania is based on the principle of solidarity and guarantees that health care services, including the sufficient information about prevention and access to the health system‘s facilities would be provided to every person by health care professionals. Furthermore, information to a person has to be presented in a such way that he could understand and evaluate the opportunity to engage in a particular preventive service. Considering the fact, that preventive health care can be provided through public health and health care practicioners (the key role plays primary health care practicioners who coordinate health care process of a person – family doctors working together with general practise nurses), the second part analyses the duties of both public health practicioners and primary health care practicioners in prevention of diseases by analysing whether their functions are oriented towards an individual and whether their functions reaches him. It has also been identified that the cooperation between these two groups of healthcare specialists is not clearly regulated by government, therefore, there is no guarantee that sufficient information about preventive health care reaches a particular person. Collaboration and sharing responsibilities between two foregoing groups of healthcare specialists would promote health care and would allow to avoid medical malpractise. The third chapter aims to define when a person can be liable for his health preservation and when health care practicioners can be liable for the damage caused to person’s health due to unapplied preventive measures. Lithuanian Health System Act determines the duty for resident to take care of his own health and Lithuanian Rights of Patients and Compensation for the Damage to Their Health Act <b>consolidates</b> the <b>duty</b> for patients to take care of their own health. The main finding of this chapter is that person is liable for the consequences to his health if he refuses preventive services after being informed about the risk factors to his health and the need of preventive measures to preserve his health. However, if a person is not aware about preventive measures, therefore does not participate in preventive health care programmes, there is a breach of duty of primary care physicians to provide information to a person. This indicates negligence liability if there is a causality between the damaged caused and primary healthcare physicians‘ actions. The study leads to the conclusion that according to current legislation public health specialists can not be held liable for the damage to individual’s health because their practice is focused on the society as a whole, therefore their activity does not reach an individual. The purpose of this master thesis is achieved by determining the distribution of responsibilities regarding an individual and health care specialists and by suggesting recommendations as regulatory framework in order to establish specific responsibilities of public health practicioners cooperating with primary health care practicioners...|$|R
