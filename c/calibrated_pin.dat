30|$|A {{break-away}} {{guide pin}} is drilled {{in at the}} superior margin of the planned osteotomy site under fluoroscopic guidance. The tibial width can be measured using the <b>calibrated</b> <b>pin.</b> The pin should be directed towards a point at least 1  cm distal to the joint line on the lateral cortex. Ensure that the proposed osteotomy passes superior to the tibial tubercle. If the patellar tendon insertion {{is too close to}} the proposed osteotomy, a proximally directed biplane osteotomy that will allow the level of the tibial osteotomy to be lowered without compromising the extensor mechanism can be made posterior to the tubercle in the tibial tubercle. A biplanar osteotomy should also be performed for corrections greater than 12.5  mm to avoid significantly decreasing the patellar height [9, 65]. The biplane cut has the added advantage of increasing rotational stability of the osteotomy. In the sagittal plane the cut should be parallel to the tibial slope. In the case of an abnormally flat slope, the cut can angle back approximately 10 °, which will provide more proximal bone for subsequent screw fixation. The planned osteotomy plane is marked with cautery. The superficial medial collateral ligament can be released with cautery in line with the proposed osteotomy. Alternatively, the superficial MCL may be elevated distal to the osteotomy and allowed to cover over the osteotomy and plate {{at the end of the}} procedure. If the superficial MCL is not released in some way, a medial tension band is created across the medial compartment, increasing compartment pressures [32].|$|E
40|$|By {{scraping}} {{away the}} beam using the RHIC collimators and measuring the beam current {{as a function}} of collimator position, it is possible to measure the transverse pro le of the beam. This prole can then be used to obtain a rough emittance measurement. The technique is destructive and only provides an estimate of the actual emittance of the beam. Records of the count rates at the PIN diodes, may be used to <b>calibrate</b> the <b>PIN</b> diodes to a loss of beam current measured by the DCCT for low PIN diode count rates. This note presents the available data. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} {{neutron radiation}} field {{can produce a}} harmful effect and eventually a secondary cancer in patients undergoing proton therapy treatment. PIN silicon diodes are investigated at the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP), of the University of Wollongong, to monitor the dosimetric effect of the neutron field associated with proton therapy. In a protontherapy passive scattering beam line, the final target-shaped collimator, a brass layer with thickness varying usually between 2 cm and 8 cm, produces an undesired neutron field, deriving from proton hadronic interactions, and incident on the patient. In order to <b>calibrate</b> <b>PIN</b> diodes as neutron radiation monitoring detectors for proton therapy quality assurance, {{it is necessary to}} characterise the response of the detector in a phantom, varying the thickness of the brass layer. The aim of this thesis is to characterise the response of the PIN diode in a proton field typical of prostate cancer treatment, varying the brass layer thickness. The project has been done by means of Geant 4 simulations. The response has been characterised in-field, for an incident pencil proton beam with energy 190 MeV, along the beam central axis, at different depths along the Bragg Peak, with a brass layer thickness varying between 0 cm and approximately 4 cm. The results of this work show that increasing the brass layer thickness reduces the depth of the Bragg Peak in the phantom as expected. Increasing the brass layer thickness produces a higher number of neutrons incident on the patient. The numbers of neutrons then decreases with depth on the central axis of the proton beam due to elastic and inelastic scattering, and capture reactions. The response of the PIN diode is dominated by the proton beam in-field as expected up to the Bragg Peak...|$|R
40|$|Industrial X-ray CT {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} used as dimensional measuring machines. However, micron level accuracy {{is not always}} achievable yet. The measurement accuracy is influenced by many factors, such as workpiece properties, X-ray voltage, filter, beam hardening, scattering and calibration methods [1 - 4]. Since most of these factors are mutually correlated, it remains challenging to interpret measurement results and to identify the distinct error sources. Since simulations allow isolating the different affecting factors, they form a useful complement to experimental investigations. Dewulf et. al [5] investigated the influence of beam hardening correction parameters on the diameter of a <b>calibrated</b> steel <b>pin</b> in different experimental set-ups. It was clearly shown that inappropriate beam hardening correction can result in significant dimensional errors. This paper confirms these results using simulations of a pin surrounded by a stepped cylinder: a clear discontinuity in the measured diameter of the inner pin is observed where it enters the surrounding material. The results are expanded with {{an investigation of the}} beam hardening effect on the measurement results for both inner and outer diameters of the surrounding stepped cylinder. Accuracy as well as the effect on the uncertainty determination are discussed. The results are compared with simulations using monochromatic beams {{in order to have a}} benchmark which excludes beam-hardening effects and X-ray scattering. Furthermore, based on the above results, the authors propose a case-dependent calibration artefact for beam hardening correction and edge offset determination. In the final part of the paper, the investigations are expanded with experiments of a new set-up that includes non-cylindrical features; the effectiveness of the proposed calibration artefact is also studied. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Applications such as x-ray {{microscopy}} and lithography need x-ray {{sources that}} have well-defined emission spectra. A 533 nm beam from a frequency doubled 1064 nm laser strikes a solid target creates a plasma with {{emissions in the}} soft x-ray range. A von Hamos spectrometer using a cylindrically bent mica crystal and a linear CCD array detector is used to monitor the x-ray emission spectrum. The spectrometer is calibrated for wavelength using a Mg spectrum with known characteristic lines. The intensity scale is <b>calibrated</b> using a <b>pin</b> diode of known calibration. ii Acknowledgements I {{would like to give}} special thanks to Brigham Young University, the Department of Physics and Astronomy, and Dr. Larry Knight for their generous support of this project.
