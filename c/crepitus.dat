5|$|Next, the {{examining}} physician may check for {{weakness of the}} quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and <b>crepitus.</b> The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle. The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, <b>crepitus,</b> and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and <b>crepitus.</b> The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause <b>crepitus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chronic tears occur among {{individuals}} who constantly participate in overhead activities, such as pitching or swimming, {{but can also}} develop from shoulder tendinitis or rotator cuff disease. Symptoms arising from chronic tears include sporadic worsening of pain, debilitation, and atrophy of the muscles, noticeable pain during rest, crackling sensations (<b>crepitus)</b> when moving the shoulder, and inability to move or lift the arm sufficiently, especially during abduction and flexion motions.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} exam includes a systematic {{examination of the}} whole patient to assess general health and to look for signs of associated conditions and metastatic disease. The neck and supraclavicular fossa are palpated to feel for cervical adenopathy, other masses, and laryngeal <b>crepitus.</b> The oral cavity and oropharynx are examined under direct vision. The larynx may be examined by indirect laryngoscopy using a small angled mirror with a long handle (akin to a dentist's mirror) and a strong light. Indirect laryngoscopy can be highly effective, but requires skill and practice for consistent results. For this reason, many specialist clinics now use fibre-optic nasal endoscopy where a thin and flexible endoscope, inserted through the nostril, is used to clearly visualise the entire pharynx and larynx. Nasal endoscopy is a quick and easy procedure performed in clinic. Local anaesthetic spray may be used.|$|E
25|$|Some {{advantages}} of the graft include less trauma to the leg that has undergone the ACL revision. Patients regain their range of motion and leg strength on the newly repaired ACL leg much quicker. The graft also allows for a bone-to-bone fixation which allows for more aggressive rehabilitation. The patient also eliminates the chance of any potential complications such as disease transmission that would be present if an allograph was chosen. The dis{{advantages of}} the graft include infection at this site, anterior knee pain, quadriceps muscle weakness, loss of motion, patella fracture, patellofemoral <b>crepitus,</b> patellar tendonitis, and patellofemoral joint pain. Also, {{it is not uncommon}} in certain patient populations to rupture the contralateral ACL following return to their sport. By harvesting the patellar tendon from the opposite knee, the orthopedic surgeon no longer has the option of using that patellar tendon for the reconstruction. It has been noted that a low percentage of patients have suffered a patellar tendon rupture in the first few weeks after surgery due to the increased stress to the area. In addition to a longer operating time the patient will have two scars instead of one.|$|E
500|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is {{a common}} result of certain types of surgery; for example {{it is not unusual}} in chest surgery. [...] It may also occur from surgery around the esophagus, and is particularly likely in prolonged surgery. Other potential causes are positive pressure ventilation for any reason and by any technique, in which its occurrence is frequently unexpected. It may also occur as a result of oral surgery, laparoscopy, and cricothyrotomy. [...] In a pneumonectomy, in which an entire lung is removed, the remaining bronchial stump may leak air, a rare but very serious condition that leads to progressive subcutaneous emphysema. Air can leak out of the pleural space through an incision made for a thoracotomy to cause subcutaneous emphysema. [...] On infrequent occasions, the condition can result from dental surgery, usually due to use of high-speed tools that are air driven. [...] These cases result in usually painless swelling of the face and neck, with an immediate onset, the <b>crepitus</b> (crunching sound) typical of subcutaneous emphysema, and often with subcutaneous air visible on X-ray.|$|E

2500|$|People usually {{complain}} of intense pain {{that may seem}} excessive given the external appearance of the skin. People initially have signs of inflammation, fever and a fast heart rate. With progression of the disease, often within hours, tissue becomes progressively swollen, the skin becomes discolored and develops blisters. <b>Crepitus</b> may be present {{and there may be}} a discharge of fluid, said to resemble [...] "dish-water". Diarrhea and vomiting are also common symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Crepitus</b> is {{an alleged}} Roman god of flatulence. It is {{unlikely}} that <b>Crepitus</b> was ever actually worshipped. The only ancient source for the claim that such a god was ever worshipped comes from Christian satire. The name <b>Crepitus</b> standing alone would be an inadequate and unlikely name for such a god in Latin [...] The god appears, however, {{in a number of}} important works of French literature.|$|E

50|$|Through these passages, the noun <b>Crepitus</b> {{moves from}} a common noun to a proper noun. Previous {{authorities}} had only claimed that the ancient polytheists, whether Egyptian or Roman, worshipped a god of intestinal noises. Perhaps in Burton's mention, and certainly in Voltaire, <b>Crepitus</b> {{is the name of}} a god of flatulence.|$|E

5000|$|While Flaubert {{learned from}} his friend Fréderic Baudry, who in turn had {{consulted}} Alfred Maury, that [...] "poor little Deus <b>Crepitus</b> does not exist; it's a modern invention," [...] he liked his text {{so much that he}} left him in. [...] While {{it is unlikely that the}} god <b>Crepitus</b> ever existed, the scene from Aristophanes is genuine; in The Clouds Athenians compare thunder to the sound of celestial flatulence.|$|E

5000|$|Burton cites a work called Syntagma de Diis ("A Compendium of the Gods") by Lilius Giraldus as his {{source for}} the {{existence}} of such a god; by this reference, Burton probably meant Giraldus' Historia de diis gentium ("History of the Pagan Gods"); but because Burton wrote in what he called an [...] "extemporean" [...] style, quicquid in buccam venit ("whatever came into his head"), Burton's quotations and references are not always reliable. [...] Because of Burton's mixed Latin and English style, this passage may not say that there was a god named [...] "Crepitus Ventris", (Latin for [...] "intestinal noise"), but only that there was a god of intestinal noise. The Latin word <b>crepitus,</b> moreover, did not exclusively mean the sound generated by intestinal gas; it referred to squeaks, groans, knocks, and any nondescript noise in general. In The City of God, Augustine elsewhere refers to <b>crepitus</b> cymbalorum, the clang of cymbals. [...] Medical jargon gives the name <b>crepitus</b> to the creaking or popping noises made by the joints. The Latin word for [...] "to fart" [...] is pēdere.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms include knee pain, swelling, redness and {{inability}} to flex the knee on the affected side. Rest usually relieves symptoms. Physical exam reveals erythema, tenderness to touch, fluctuant edema over the lower pole of the patella and <b>crepitus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Crepitus</b> ( [...] ; also termed crepitation) is {{a medical}} term to {{describe}} the grating, crackling or popping sounds and sensations experienced under the skin and joints or a crackling sensation due {{to the presence of}} air in the subcutaneous tissue.|$|E
