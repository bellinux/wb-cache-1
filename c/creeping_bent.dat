500|$|Common cord-grass (Spartina anglica) {{was planted}} {{in the area in}} the 1990s. It can now be found on {{surrounding}} marshes where it has invaded the fronting mudflats. The Spartina is generally shorter in the bay than at other sites due to the high tides and the turbidity of the water, reaching around [...] as opposed to [...] elsewhere. On higher ground common saltmarsh-grass (Puccinellia maritima) can be found along with sea aster (Aster tripolium). Where the land is ungrazed, common reed (Phragmites australis) often forms a zone above the sea aster. Where the upper marsh is grazed by cattle red fescue (Festuca rubra) and <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> (Agrostis stolonifera) are found. The area of marsh furthest from the sea supports Sea couch (Agropyron pungens) and sea club-rush (Scirpus maritimus).|$|E

60|$|Frank {{afterward}} {{confessed that}} his first impulse was to run toward the door, and he was never quite certain why {{he did not do}} so, but he stood still holding up the lantern, while his heart throbbed painfully and his flesh seemed to <b>creep.</b> The <b>bent</b> figure was unnaturally still, but when the schooner lurched and the table slanted it fell forward a little farther, all in one piece--which was how he thought of it--and as a heavy sack would have done. That was too much for Frank, and clambering up the steps he ran back to Harry in breathless haste.|$|R
50|$|Grasslees Wood is {{dominated}} by sessile oak (Quercus petraea) with some birch (Betula pubescens). Groundcover indicitive of a dry acid soil includes sweet vernal grass, common <b>bent,</b> <b>creeping</b> soft-grass (Holcus mollis), wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella), tormentil (Potentilla erecta) and bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), together with remote sedge (Carex remota), oak fern (Gymnocarpium dryopteris) and enchanter's nightshade (Circaea lutetiana).|$|R
60|$|Presently {{a figure}} {{emerged from the}} shadows into the faint light thrown by the single lamp that burned above, and though it was wrapped in a dark cloak, Jeekie knew at once {{that it was not}} the Asika. Very stealthily the figure crept towards him, as a leopard might <b>creep,</b> and <b>bent</b> down to examine him. The {{movement}} caused the cloak to slip a little, and for an instant Jeekie caught sight of the wasted, half-crazed face of the Mungana, and of a long, curved knife that glittered in his hand. Paralyzed with fear, he lay quite still, knowing that should he show the slightest sign of consciousness that knife would pierce his heart.|$|R

50|$|Agrostis stolonifera (creeping bentgrass, <b>creeping</b> <b>bent,</b> fiorin, {{spreading}} bent, carpet bentgrass or redtop) is {{a perennial}} grass {{species in the}} Poaceae family.|$|E
50|$|The {{eastern part}} of the {{designated}} area is dominated by wavy hair grass, marsh foxtail and <b>creeping</b> <b>bent.</b> The improved grassland is dominated by perennial rye grass, <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> and Timothy. The northern section is mostly marshy and comprises rush and sedge species. The marshes also support bog pimpernel and ragged robin. The ditches are significant as they are examples of a disappearing habitat. A wide range of wetland plants flourish with a large population of flote grass and several pondweeds. There are rarities including tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa).|$|E
50|$|The {{watercolour}} shows a {{large piece}} of turf and little else. The various plants can be identified as cock's-foot, <b>creeping</b> <b>bent,</b> smooth meadow-grass, daisy, dandelion, germander speedwell, greater plantain, hound's-tongue and yarrow.|$|E
50|$|It forms a {{dense sward}} of fine leaves. The ligule {{is short and}} does not come to a point. This differs from <b>creeping</b> <b>bent,</b> Agrostis stolonifera {{in which it is}} pointed and up to 5mm long.|$|E
5000|$|... (Agrostis stolonifera) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used species of Agrostis. Historically, it was often called Orcheston long grass, after a village on Salisbury Plain, England. It is cultivated almost exclusively on golf courses, especially on putting greens. <b>Creeping</b> <b>bent</b> aggressively produces horizontal stems, called stolons, that run along the soil's surface. These allow <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> to form dense stands under conducive conditions and outcompete bunch-type grass and broadleaf weeds. As such, if infested in a home lawn, it can become a troublesome weed problem. The leaves of the bentgrass are long and slender. It can quickly take over a home lawn if it is not controlled and has very shallow roots.|$|E
50|$|Agrostis (bent or bentgrass) is a {{large and}} very nearly {{cosmopolitan}} genus of plants in the grass family, found in nearly all {{the countries in the}} world. It has been bred as a GMO <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> grass.|$|E
50|$|Sections {{of dense}} growth of Reed Sweet-grass and <b>Creeping</b> <b>Bent</b> are removed {{in the autumn}} to create areas of bare soil {{necessary}} for germination of Adder's tongue Spearwort. Pollarding of the adjacent willows controls light and the water levels.|$|E
50|$|There are medieval {{ridge and}} furrows on this {{unimproved}} meadow on clay. The drier ridge tops have many herbs, while the damp furrows {{are dominated by}} <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> and Yorkshire fog grasses. There are also mature hedges and a small pond.|$|E
50|$|This {{unimproved}} grassland {{site has}} a rich variety of flora. There are grasses such as <b>creeping</b> <b>bent,</b> meadow foxtail, sweet vernal-grass, crested dog's tail, perennial rye-grass and rough-stalked meadow-grass. It {{is one of}} only two sites in the county for ladies mantle Alchemilla filicaulis vestita.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{composed}} of three unimproved meadows which have {{a wide variety of}} herbs. The principal grasses are <b>creeping</b> <b>bent,</b> rye-grass and crested dog's tail. Flowers include the green-winged orchid and yellow rattle, which are rare in Essex. There is also a small pond and scattered scrub.|$|E
50|$|The fen-meadow is {{dominated}} by Hard Rush, <b>Creeping</b> <b>Bent</b> and Brooklime.

50|$|The site is {{a mosaic}} of {{different}} habitats next to the River Alder Bourne, including unimproved pasture and woodland. The meadows have dry and wet grassland, swamp and fen. The eastern fields are grazed by cattle and the eastern ones, which are drier, have a late hay crop. Grasses include red fescue and in drier areas and <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> in wetter ones. Oldhouse Wood has ash and field maple on upper slopes and oak and birch on lower ones. There are several species of dragonfly.|$|E
50|$|Saturated, mud {{dominated}} pannes are occasionally {{found in}} the transition zone next to forested uplands where they are shaded by overhanging tree branches thus inhibiting evaporation. This is the preferred habitat for the uncommon seaside crowfoot (Ranunculus cymbalaria), where prostrate colonies may form small patches over the soil surface. Other graminoids and forbs scattered across the mud, or more often around the panne edge, include Virginia wild rye (Elymus virginicus), chaffy salt sedge (Carex paleacea) seaside goldenrod (Solidago sempervirens), marsh <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> grass, New York aster and smooth cordgrass.|$|E
