Our rustic coverlid is nearer its French original than the diminutive coverlet, into which it has been ignorantly corrupted in politer speech. I obtained from three cultivated Englishmen at different times three diverse pronunciations of a single word,--cowcumber, coocumber, and cucumber. Of these the first, which is Yankee also, comes nearest to the nasality of concombre. Lord Ossory assures us that Voltaire saw the best society in England, and Voltaire tells his countrymen that handkerchief was pronounced hankercher. I find it so spelt in Hakluyt and elsewhere. This enormity the Yankee still persists in, and as there is always a reason for such deviations from the sound as represented by the spelling, may we not suspect two sources of derivation, and find an ancestor for kercher in <b>couverture</b> rather than in couvrechef? And what greater phonetic vagary (which Dryden, by the way, called fegary) in our lingua rustica than this ker for couvre? I copy from the fly-leaves of my books, where I have noted them from time to time, a few examples of pronunciation and phrase which will show that the Yankee often has antiquity and very respectable literary authority on his side.

40|$|Covers with {{capillary}} barrier effects (CCBE) are {{an interesting}} alternative to low hydraulic conductivity covers to limit water infiltration into waste disposal sites, especially for arid and semi-arid climates. This type of cover system typically includes a fine-grained material layer overlying a coarser one. In sloping systems, water can be diverted at the interface between the two materials, hence reducing water infiltration into the underlying wastes. However, at a certain down dip location, the moisture-retaining layer can become wet enough to reduce {{the efficiency of the}} capillary barrier effect at the interface. Infiltration of moisture into the coarse material then becomes possible as suction reaches its water entry value (WEV). This paper presents the main results of a laboratory investigation and a numerical study designed to better understand the diversion capacity of inclined CCBE.

Herbicides currently {{offer the most}} cost-effective means available for achieving this, but research into alternatives is required. Recent experiments have been conducted by the Great Britain Forestry Commission investigating the use of 19 alternative ground cover and silvicultural treatments for newly planted ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) established on fertile lowland ex-agricultural sites. Most ground cover treatments proved difficult to establish and were more competitive to trees than naturally occurring vegetation. White clover (Trifolium repens L.) showed some potential for suppressing weed vegetation without reducing tree growth. Closer initial tree planting densities appeared to offer a practical means of reducing herbicide inputs, whilst still permitting good rates of growth. It is concluded that {{a comprehensive review of}} other alternative methods of weed control is now required to set a framework for future Great Britain Forestry Commission research in this field.

40|$|Various {{types of}} cover {{systems can be}} used to control water {{infiltration}} into waste disposal sites. For instance, when designing a layered cover, different soils can be combined to create a capillary barrier effect in order to limit percolation. Such an effect is created under unsaturated conditions when a fine-grained soil is placed over a coarser material. The difference in hydraulic properties between the two soils can then serve to impede water flux along the interface. The finer soil layer stores moisture from precipitation, which can later be released by evaporation. In sloping areas, the cover may also act as a lateral water diversion system. The behaviour of an inclined cover system is, however, fairly complex, as it is influenced by many factors. In this paper, the authors present some results from a numerical investigation into the response of steeply inclined covers with capillary barrier effects (CCBEs) under a relatively humid climate. After a brief recall of the physical processes involved, the presentation focuses on calculation results that aim at assessing the effect of various influence factors, including layer thickness, material properties and precipitation rate.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Covers with {{capillary}} barrier effects (CCBE) are {{now considered}} by the mining industry as a viable option for oxygen diffusion barriers. Different techniques have been proposed to evaluate the efficiency of an oxygen diffusion barrier used to control the production of acid mine drainage (AMD). One recent development is the Oxygen-Consumption (OC) method. The method consists of measuring the decrease in oxygen concentration over {{a relatively short period}} of time in an air filled chamber above the cover. This decrease in O 2 concentration is then converted into an instantaneous oxygen flux by using fundamental Fick’s laws. However, this approach, developed initially to determine the oxidation rate of sulphide tailings, is not well adapted for a low oxygen flux like that observed through a CCBE. The standard OC method was modified by the authors to increase the precision of gas flux measurements through a cover. The study showed that the measurements with the modified approach give more realistic oxygen flux through a CCBE cover, when compared to the standard method.

This bird, dedicated to a gentlemen, who has rendered so many services to science, has its next allied species in Treron psittacea from Timor and in Treron floris inhabiting the island from which its epithet is taken. Ornithologists will remember that I brought the two latter species in a separate subdivision, distinguished from some other allied species of which Treron aromatica is the most remarkable, by their somewhat more lengthened tail. This subdivision was characterized by me (Muséum des Pays-Bas, tome 4, Columbae, p. 58) in the following terms. “Queue un peu allongée.

40|$|In the Ouled Abdoun {{sedimentary}} basin (Morocco), the phosphatic series {{is composed of}} regular interbedded phosphatic and marly limestone layers. Exploitation of the phosphate in some deposits in this basin collides frequently with problems bound to the existence, in the phosphatic series, of disturbed areas (sterile bodies) qualified as derangements by the mining engineers of the Office Cherifian Phosphate Group (OCP). Their presence in the phosphatic layers causes two kinds of problems: (1) since the whole phosphatic sequence is overlain by a Quaternary cover, {{we do not know}} their volume proportion in the phosphatic layers, and therefore the reserves estimations can be wrong (2) they are generally hard, so they complicate the phosphate extraction. Indeed, in an area containing sterile bodies, boring grid may always be tightened and boreholes filled with dynamite. The required borehole tools and use of explosives are time consuming and therefore increase drastically the cost of phosphate extraction. Their localisation would permit the mining engineers to get around them during the exploitation. &# 13; &# 13; Several geophysical works have carried out in the achieved in Khouribga area to localize and delimit these sterile bodies. Electric resistitivy was established as a suitable geophysical parameter to map them, but the slowness and difficulty of data collection hinders the application of these geophysical methods to the whose phosphatic deposits area (about 25000 ha). Their application in all the Ouled Abdoun basin requires the comprehension of the origin of the sterile bodies, in order to specify their formation process and to predict consequently their spacial distribution in each phosphatic deposit. &# 13; &# 13; Our study concerns to sedimentological and diagenetic analysis of disturbed aereas and their immediate vicinity. It made it possible to identify {{for the first time the}} existence of an evaporitic series intensely karstified at the top of the Senonian, under the phosphatic series. The senonian karsts are undoubtedly at the origin of the derangements, which are defined as the collapsing phenomena at the base of underground cavities. &# 13; &# 13; These bodies have a polyphase structuring and a genesis that is the consequence of on several processes (fracturing, infiltration, dissolution, collapse). Their installation began from the end of Senonian, and continues up to the Quaternary. [fr] Dans le bassin sédimentaire des Ouled Abdoun (Maroc), la série phosphatée est formée d’une intercalation régulière de niveaux phosphatés et marno-calcaires sur environ 50 m de puissance. Localement, cette régularité est perturbée par la présence fréquente de structures communément appelés « dérangements ». Il s’agit de masses non stratifiées, stériles, qui perturbent et alourdissent les travaux d’exploitation des couches phosphatées.

40|$|L'essai dit de leak-offconsiste à {{augmenter}} la pression dans un puits, au droit d'une formation, jusqu'à la limite de rupture de la roche. Cette opération sert principalement à évaluer la pression de boue maximale admissible. Depuis une décennie on essaie d'utiliser la pression en leak-off dans les puits verticaux pour évaluer les deux contraintes horizontales en place. Une variante de l'opération précédente consiste à aller jusqu'à rompre la roche et propager la rupture : c'est la micro fracturation. L'interprétation des pressions obtenues reste basée principalement sur la mécanique linéaire de la rupture : paramètres élastiques et ténacité de la roche sont constants. On montre comment quatre facteurs - rapport des contraintes recherchées, existence ou non de fissure(s) préexistante(s) en paroi, pénétration du fluide dans ces fissures, filtration du fluide - peuvent conduire à des niveaux et des évolutions de pression très variés. Ils sont cependant insuffisants pour expliquer quelques observations courantes : la partie non-linéaire de la courbe pression-temps, la valeur du maximum de pression, sa variation avec le débit injecté en fracture. On montre comment la prise en compte d'effets poroélastiques en bout de fracture et d'un endommagement mécanique en paroi de puits pourrait permettre de faire mieux. Deux grandeurs apparaissent comme essentielles à l'interprétation : la limite supérieure de linéarité en pression, la pression de fermeture de la fracture. L'application à trois cas concrets montre que, dans les <b>couvertures,</b> il faudrait probablement évaluer la pénétration du fluide dans la fracture à l'initiation de celle-ci et modéliser l'initiation de fracture en tenant compte d'un endommagement mécanique de la paroi rocheuse. La deuxième partie de ce programme est en cours. This summary contains formulas (***) {{which can}} not be displayed on this screen. The leak-off test technique is used in wells during drilling and/or completion operations. It consists in increasing the fluid pressure in the well in front of a rock formation up to a limit corresponding to the initiation of a rupture in this rock. The main purpose is to estimate the maximum admissible mud pressure during drilling. However through theoretical analyses laboratory experiments and field work, ways have beeen proposed to extract from the leak-off tests performed in vertical wells the values of the horizontal principal stresses. If fluid injection is carried on up to propagation of a fracture in the rock, the operation is then called micro fracturing. Usually a leak-off test or a micro fracturing operation are performed under a low and constantfluid injection rate. The corresponding pressure increase is first linear, then non-linear above a pressure p index (nl). It reaches a maximum p index (b) (break-down pressure) and then a lower and quasi constant level p index (e) (extension pressure, i. e. pressure needed to extend the fracture). If fluid injection is stopped and if the fluid mobility is low enough, the pressure lowers to p index f, the closure pressure. The problem is to derive relations between these characteristic pressures and in-situ stresses. For fractures of limited extent this problem can be limited to two-dimensional analyses. Most analyses are based on linear fracture mechanics : the elastic parameters and the critical stress intensity factors of the rock are considered as constants. The minimum principal stress is taken horizontal and consequently the mode I fracture is vertical. A basic parameter is the ratio of the fracture radius to the well radius (alpha / a). Explicit solutions are available for very short fractures (alpha/a = 1 + epsilon) and for largefractures (alpha / a > 5). Recent work suggests that the pressure corresponding to a very short fracture, or initiation pressure, coincide with the pressure p index (nl). Given the maximum horizontal stress sigma index h and the minimum horizontal stress sigma index (h), this pressure still depends on four parameters : tensile strength of the rock T, penetration of the fluid into the fracture s, mobility of the fluid towards the fracture faces, pore pressure p index (p). The tensile strength T is essentially unknown. A method in use to bypass this difficulty is to carry out several fluid injection/bleed-off phases : then T can be (as least theoretically) set to zero. When the fluid filtration time is short compared to the fracture propagation time, the initiation pressure can be written (Haimson and Fairhurst) :(***) ß is a poroelastic constant which depends on the Biot coefficient and the Poisson's ratio of the drained rock. When the fluid filtration time is large compared to the fracture propagation time (impermeable rock) the fracture initiation pressure is supposed to be (adapted by Detournay) :(***) Interpretation of fracture initiation pressure in overburden formations can be based on this last formula. Depending on s, which characterizes the access of the fluid to the fracture, this pressure is bounded by a maximum (no fluid penetration) and a minimum (complete fluid penetration) value:(***) For large fractures the best practical data available from micro fracturing operations is the closure pressure p index (f). Indeed under most actual conditions, p index (f) can be considered as equal to sigma index (h). Although a rather large number of parameters is involved in the interpretation of the leak-off pressure the interpretation of the nonlinear part of the pressure-time curve (from p index (nl) to p index (b)) is still matter of controversy. Indeed under the assumptions of linear fracture mechanics there should not be a non linear part in the pressure curve and the breakdown pressure p index (b) should not depend on the injection rate. However, in addition to non-linearity, laboratory experiments and field tests show that p index (b) increases with the injection flow rate up to values which are far over the theoretical prediction. Various ways have been explored to explain this behavior. The first one consists in substituting a non linear fracture mechanics to the linear one : the tensile strength of the rock in the plane of the fracture is not set to zero at the rock rupture but still exists after creation of the fracture. Then it decreases progressively when the fracture thickness increases and, for example, reaches the zero value for a ten microns fracture thickness. Another interpretation of the p index (b) value keeps the linear fracture mechanics assumptions and adds to the problem poroelastic considerations. According to this theory the pore pressure field around the fracture is inhomogeneous and in particular there is a depression zone ahead of the fracture tip. The progression of the fracture is controlled by the progression rate of this depression zone, which itself depends mainly on matrix properties (mobility of the fluid, elastic properties and porcelastic coupling). When this fracture progression rate no more keeps up with the fluid injection rate the pressure exceeds the values predicted by a more classical (non poroelastic) theory. A third way of interpretation has been modeled at Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP). In this model a mechanical damage phase comes before the creation of a single fracture plane. The non linear pressure growth takes place during the damaging phase. The results of three micro fracturing field tests (two tests in overburden layers, the third one in a reservoir) are used to extract from the p index (nl) and p index (f) pressure values the maximum horizontal stress sigma index (h), the interpretation being based on linear fracture mechanics. The exercise is convincing when applied to the reservoir example. It is not satisfactory when applied to the other examples since the fluid penetration parameter needs to be tailored to each case. The measurement of this parameter is recommended in parallel with the development of the above mentioned damage/localization modeling approach...|$|R
40|$|National audienceThe {{very small}} {{underground}} gallery grave of Cabrials {{is a very}} atypical monument, whose execution is the “fulfilment” of a form of minimalism, but which scrupulously follows common funerary practices in the broad megalithic sphere of Western France. This monument, although of very small size, possesses a true elongate chamber with a width-to-length ratio of 1 / 3, as if it represented a downscaled version of the large gallery graves typical of the northern or even southern regions in France. Moreover, the plan appears to be independent of any technical design concerns. The chamber is entirely below ground, forming a configuration that is very rarely observed throughout the southern regions in France. In the case of Cabrials, {{the execution of the}} work is possibly related to constraints imposed by the shape of the slabs, since their median enlargement makes it very complicated to carry out jointing and stabilization. As has been shown, these slabs mostly result from re-use, while outcrops of suitable limestones are located not very far away. In three verifiable cases, the stelae are sublozenge- shaped or trapezoidal, being slightly asymmetrical, while three other slabsexhibit apical rostrums picked out by rough-hewn shoulders. All these types or characteristics are known locally {{at the beginning of the}} Final Neolithic. Although these re-uses could be considered initially as a non-functional option related to a choice of strong symbolic value, this hypothesis is not supported by the divergent orientations of the rostrums in the chamber. Around the area of the door, re-used elements also seem to dominate, even if the origin of the pillars remains problematic. On the other hand, the two indented slabs have clearly been re-used and, moreover, were taken from two different dolmens, since the indentations are very asymmetric. Their position in the monument does not comply with their usual localization, while their repositioning, both in terms of symmetry as well as emplacement, is evocative of their usual assigned place. This search for symmetry is moreover expressed in the whole set of orthostats, showing morphologies that “interact” between the two longitudinal walls. Consequently, and despite the almost systematic recourse to re-used elements, the concern to build a wellorganized structure can be seen everywhere in the arrangement of the slabs and, even if the symbolic aspect is not determinant, it could to some extent restrict their emplacement. Re-use was also preferred for the grave goods. All the objects deposited in this tomb are derived from the domestic sphere. The goods offered were all of little value and show signs of wear, and their small number would not have represented a severe drain on usual domestic resources. Nevertheless, all the common types of items of contemporary collective burial goods are found here in varied proportions, but only one example of each item is represented. Thus, we might go so far as to consider that, after all, the set of artefacts corresponds to a single standardized offering. It is as if parsimony had firmly taken precedence, but in strict respect of the symbolic practices. The concern to respect funerary practices covering a very large area of understanding is expressed in the whole layout of the burial space. Thus, the elongated plan of the tomb is designed to separate, within a very small chamber, two main technical spaces which support the practice of double burial by using a differentiated subdivision of the corpses and bones. In the large monuments of the southern French domain, the area around the door is dedicated to a collective deposit (in this case, the large vase) and an axe-shaped stela is incorporated into the chevetjambstone, reflecting the deposits of axes found elsewhere in the southern regions or the engravings in north-western France. In this way, the male/female dualism of the collective and founder deposits of the Atlantic domain is finally expressed. From the dual perspective of the treatment of Death and the concern for perpetuation of the social fabric, the respect of funerary practices is normal for the period considered. The individual choices remain anecdotal or marginal (materials, symbolic substitutes, particular objects within fixed categories, etc.). At Cabrials, the constantly expressed underlying economy of means evokes rather more the burying community. The small size of the chamber corresponds to the small number of dead and a relatively restricted use over time (undoubtedly also shortened by the general destabilization of the structure). These elements reflect a community of small size or a sub-group of a wider community. The selection of the individuals to be buried clearly depends more on real rather than alleged kinship. The rather modest character of the burial and layout also argues in favour of a very open recruitment within a very small community or, in other words, a non-elitist horizontal recruitment. The strong representation of young children, which is very unusual in this proportion for collective burials, strengthens the hypothesis of a family recruitment. The economy of means employed for the burial also reflects the economic fragility of this human group, representing a parsimony which ultimately affects only the material aspects and does not deplete the semantic content of the tomb. Whether on a regional scale or on the much broader scale of the North-western domain, it is clear that concrete elements of symbolic practices are included, incorporated and reinterpreted within this very small gallery grave at Cabrials, being applied at all levels, not just architectural but material and organizational as well. Traduction M. S. N. Carpenter - mcarpenter@infonie. frLa structure fouillée en novembre 2007 au lieu-dit « Cabrials » est un petit monument de la fin du Néolithique. Il a été installé dans une excavation oblongue d’environ 3 m par 1, 50 m et se compose de 9 orthostates, tous retouchés, soigneusement ajustés et bloqués par de plus petites pierres. Tous les orthostates des parois sont des stèles frustes ou des éléments d’architecture remployés. Les dalles de <b>couvertures</b> ont été arrachées par les labours. Une seule a été retrouvée à proximité. Elle présente la même taille et forme que les autres. Par contre, il ne subsiste aucun indice relatif à une plausible signalisation. La chambre présente un plan rectangulaire de 1, 50 m par 0, 70 m et une hauteur d’environ 0, 90 m. Son grand axe est orienté nord-ouest/sud-est. On entrait dans la chambre par le biais d’une fosse accolée à son petit côté nord-ouest, qui correspond à un couloir embryonnaire court ou, encore, au débouché d’un couloir en partie aérien. Cet accès et la chambre est séparés par une dalle amovible, appuyée sur deux piliers. Cette configuration, chambre longue unique, enterrée, à laquelle on accède par un couloir frontal également excavé, se rapproche typologiquement d’une allée sépulcrale enterrée. Il s’agit en l’occurrence d’un très petit monument, mais son caractère mégalithique est incontestable, de même que son fonctionnement collectif. Cette tombe concerne, en effet, 19 individus au minimum, dont les inhumations ont été échelonnées dans le temps. Les dépôts ont été remaniés de manière importante en au moins deux phases principales. La condamnation de la sépulture pose problème, car il s’agit d’une procédure réalisée longtemps après le dernier dépôt. Les jeunes immatures sont sur-représentés, ce qui est surprenant pour ce type de sépulture. Par ailleurs, la durée d’utilisation semble courte, ce que suggère aussi la forte cohérence typologique du mobilier, dont toutes les composantes se rapportent au Néolithique final 1. Les datations 14 C évoquent de manière concordante une fréquentation située autour de – 3300 BC. Le mobilier se compose d’un grand vase de stockage issu de la sphère domestique, de quelques outils lithiques et de différents éléments dont la distribution est relativement conforme à celle observée pour de plus grandes sépultures collectives, notamment dans le nord de la France. Enfin, la chronologie de ce monument un peu antérieure au plein développement des sépultures collectives mégalithiques en Languedoc, sa taille modeste et son fonctionnement particulier évoquent des traits intermédiaires entre des petits coffres lithiques du Néolithique moyen et de plus grandes sépultures, plus longuement utilisées, du Néolithique final...|$|R
