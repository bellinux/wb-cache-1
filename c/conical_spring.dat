40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} new concept of a threedimensional {{vibration}} power generator made by micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, which can convert electric energy through transverse mode piezoelectric effect. The presented power generator {{is based on a}} long, thick-film, piezoelectric beam configured as a <b>conical</b> helical <b>spring</b> structure. The controlled release metal layer (CRML) MEMS technology has been used to realize the structure from photolithography-defined pattern on a silicon wafer. The advantage of CRML technology is the high repeatability and resolution and its compatibility with back-end of line (BEOL) processes of the integrated circuit (IC) industry. The purpose of the helical structure is also to combine the piezoelectric generator with a conical-helical antenna for RF applications in low-power, autonomous sensors network. The novel construction process of the piezoelectric generator and its structure are presented with finite element method (FEM) simulations to determine its resonant frequencies. This energy-harvesting structure is made enclosing a piezoelectric material between two metal layers. The presented structures operate, as antenna, in the 55 - 85 GHz frequency band and resonate with mechanical vibrations in the kHz region.

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this work is {{the design of a}} docking {{mechanism}} for the STRONG mission. This foresees the transport of a standard space platform carrying payloads from Low Earth Orbit into greater orbits by means of a space tug. The mission periodically also envisions the refueling of the space tug by a dedicated docking mechanism with an orbital tank. On the base of the mission described above, the task of this mechanism is to mechanically couple the space tug with LEO located space vehicles. The docking system has to recover the maximum position and attitude misalignments, due to the GNC performances, between the two spacecraft during the docking maneuver. To do this several concepts have been defined aiming to provide different solutions to the docking problem. Among these concepts the optimal solution may be found by defining some trade-off criteria and applying them to a selection procedure. Draft design tools have been created for each concept in order to evaluate their characteristic parameters involved in the trade off procedure. Four mechanical concepts were individuated: a mechanism based on the Stewart-Gough platform, a passive central mechanism (probe-drogue), a mechanism formed by articulated arms transporting grippers to grasp the mounting ring of the expendable launch system Vega and a central active mechanism. The first mechanism is a 6 SPS parallel manipulator that may operate following two different control approaches for the soft docking phase. The first control logic is characterized by a position control loop with an optical feedback. The second one instead rules the impedance of the platform. The second concept is a "classical" probe-drogue mechanism similar to the one present in the Russian Progress, Soyuz and the European ATV spacecrafts. This mechanism consists of a rod mounted on the chaser that has to be introduced inside a conical seat on the target side. The third mechanism consists of one active degree of freedom group of articulated arms equipped with grippers able to grasp the mounting ring present in all the payloads launched with the Vega rocket. Finally, the last mechanism is a three degrees of freedom central mechanism. This mechanism is at first controlled in position with an optical sensor. This phase ends when the rod of the mechanism is inserted inside a small <b>conical</b> seat. Subsequently, <b>spring</b> loaded elements perform the soft docking followed by an impedance control phase and then the hard docking phase concludes the task. The paper shows the analysis carried out to provide a preliminary design of the mentioned concepts that will be the base of a trade off procedure to select the optimal on...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{an attempt}} {{has been made}} {{to assess the impact of}} {{proposed}} nonlinear <b>conical</b> <b>spring</b> bracing (NCSB) system on seismic response subjected to earthquake. The developed system includes of two telescopic <b>conical</b> <b>spring</b> springs that operate in axial compression. Due to shape of spring, the proposed system can performed as a nonlinear stiffness element that provide more lateral stability to structural frame. The action of NCSB does not control the low and moderate vibration due to earthquake but it acts for severe vibration whereas the frame displacement pass the allowable boundary. This inconstant performance avoids excessive effects of conventional bracing system if they attached as retrofitting components to moment resistant steel frame. by other words, due to the aforementioned characteristics of NCSB system, the inherent ductility of steel frame is not scarified and earthquake energy can be dissipate due to frame ductility, but, NCSB system provided more stability of structures and prevent large story drift. In this study, pushover and time history analyses has been conducted to evaluate the seismic performance of introduced device. The results from pushover disclose a considerable enhancement of structural capacity and ductility. Besides, the application on NCSB device changed the location of plastic hinge formation in structural elements. Furthermore, time history results proved the efficiency of NCSB device on reducing the maximum displacement...|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} at Sheffield in Flavell's Yard, Fargate, on 6 December 1816.He was the second son of Samuel Brown, a slater of that town. He was educated at a local school held in a garret, and was apprenticed {{at the age of}} {{fourteen}} to Earl, Horton, & Co., factors, of Orchard Place, In 1831, his employers engaged in the manufacture of files and table cutlery, taking an establishment in Rockingham Street, which they styled the Hallamshire Works. Nonetheless he did take over the company's factoring business {{with the help of a}} loan for £500 thanks to the backing of his father and uncle and for several years travelled the country selling goods.He started his own company John Brown & company in 1844 manufacturing Steel at a small foundry on a site at what is the now Orchard Square Shopping centre. The business prospered so well that he sold his factoring firm and moved to larger premises on Furnival Street. In 1848 Brown invented the <b>conical</b> steel <b>spring</b> buffer for railway carriages which he sold to the London and North Western Railway as well as other railways throughout the UK. On 1 January 1856, Brown opened his new Atlas Works in Brightside in an effort to centralise his workshops and workforce in one place, the works originally were on a 3 acre site but within three years had grown to 30 acre. By 1859 Brown was producing rails for the quickly expanding railway industry using the Bessemer process. Brown's great achievement was the development of armour plating for war vessels. In 1860, he saw at Toulon the French ship La Gloire. She was a timber-built 90-gun three-decker, cut down and coated with hammered plate armour, four and a half inches thick. This contrivance occasioned the English government so much uneasiness that they ordered ten 90- and 100-gun vessels to be similarly adapted. Brown, from a distant inspection of La Gloire, came to the conclusion that the armoured plates used in protecting her might have been rolled instead of hammered. He was at that time mayor of Sheffield, and he invited the premier, Lord Palmerston, to inspect the process. Palmerston's visit was followed in April 1863 by one from the lords of the admiralty, who saw rolled a plate twelve inches thick and fifteen to twenty feet long. The latter visit was the subject of an article in Punch (18 April 1863). The admiralty were convinced of the merits of Brown's methods, and the royal commission on armour plates ordered from his works nearly all the plates they required. In a few years, he had sheathed fully three-fourths of the British navy. In 1856, he concentrated in Saville Street, Sheffield, the different manufactures in which he had been engaged in various parts of the town. His establishment, styled the Atlas Works, covered nearly thirty acres, and increased until it gave employment to over four thousand artisans. He undertook the manufacture of armour plates, ordnance forgings, railway bars, steel springs, buffers, tires, and axles, supplied Sheffield with iron for steel-making purposes, and was the first successfully to develop the Bessemer process, and to introduce into Sheffield the manufacture of steel rails. He received frequent applications from foreign governments for armour plates, but invariably declined such contracts unless the consent of the home government was obtained. During the civil war in America he refused large orders from the northern states. In 1864, his business was converted into a limited liability company, and he retired to Endfield Hall, Ranmoor, near Sheffield. He was Mayor of Sheffield in 1862 and 1863, and master cutler in 1865 and 1866, and was knighted in 1867.In 1865 he had Endcliffe Hall built as his private residence, this was and still is the largest private house ever built in Sheffield.In 1902, Sheffield steelmakers John Brown & Company exchanged shares and came to a working agreement with neighbouring company Thomas Firth & Sons, the companies continuing under their own management until they finally merged in 1930 Forming Firth Brown Ltd.|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{research}} {{efforts have been}} dedicated {{to the development of}} virtual reality simulators that facilitate medical students in learning anatomy and surgery in the virtual environment and to allow surgeons to rehearse the surgical procedures. The level of realism depends upon the simulation accuracy and the computational efficiency of underlying deformable models. Ideally, the deformable models should be able to simulate accurately mechanical behaviours of soft tissues with real-time visual and force feedback. Modelling soft tissue deformation is not an easy task. Due to the complexity of soft tissue properties, many methods have been proposed to model soft tissue properties. One of the most well-known methods is the Finite Element Method (FEM). In this method, the soft tissue is represented by multiple elements that are derived based on complex mathematical formulations. It has been proven that the method is able to simulate soft tissue properties accurately, but it requires high computational cost to produce real-time interaction. In this regard, the Mass Spring Method (MSM) has been proposed as an alternative. The traditional MSM model simulates soft tissue deformation by discretising the soft tissue into several mass points that are connected to each other by linear springs. The major advantage of MSM is it has an excellent computational performance. However, the MSM application is limited to linear deformation, which does not represent the actual behaviour of the soft tissue deformation. In this thesis, an improved MSM model has been proposed to simulate the complex behaviour of soft tissue deformations. The improved MSM model is called <b>conical</b> <b>spring</b> model which considers the general behaviour of soft tissue deformation that is a combination of linear and nonlinear responses. Piecewise approach is used to discretise each response individually, and the <b>conical</b> <b>spring</b> methodology is used to model the deformation behaviours during all the responses. The piecewise approach gives precision in modelling while the <b>conical</b> <b>spring</b> methodology that was founded on stiffness variation, has improved the accuracy of the simulation due to its ability to model any type of linear and nonlinear responses. Moreover, the generated <b>conical</b> <b>spring</b> model is based on the force propagation approach. The computational performance of the model relies on the number of nodes involved in the propagation of the force. Inherently, computational time can be improved by considering the nodes only in a deformation area, and ignoring the other nodes. Soft tissue deformation commonly occurs only within a local region. As the effect of the deformation outside the local region is very little, it can be ignored in real practice. In this thesis, methods to define the local region were proposed. The methods are based on the linear elastic theory. As reported in Chapter 4 of this thesis, the localised region was generated based on displacement value induced when the simulation model was subjected to an external load. The Boussinesq method, which is widely used in the soil mechanics, was used to estimate the induced displacement value. However, the Boussinesq method is limited to the isotropic material. Therefore, as described in Chapter 5, the study has extended the isotropic localised region to anisotropic localised region by introducing an anisotropic factor which was derived based on cross-anisotropic properties. By using the anisotropic factor, the anisotropic localised region is determined from the corresponding isotropic case. Alternatively, in Chapter 6, we have presented a localised region that was generated based on stress value induced during a loading process. It is shown for point load type of contact, in comparison to ABAQUS analysis, stress based localisation has a better accuracy than the displacement based localisation. However, the stress value that is also determined using the Boussinesq method, has no relation to the material properties. Hence, a combination of the Hertzian and the Boussinesq method was used to generate localised regions with respect to the material properties and loading conditions. In the final chapter, contributions of the study were discussed, and some of the future works to expand the research were listed out...|$|E

This work explores the effect of the use of <b>conical</b> <b>spring</b> in place of conventional cylindrical profiled helical spring design in the handling of a bus at low speeds through full vehicle multi-body simulations. The bus was modelled using standard template available in ADAMSTM software package. The vehicle inertial properties were verified against properties in literature. The conventional spring characteristic (L) from ADAMSTM database was taken as reference and compared it with a non-linear characteristic (NL) based on literature data. The planned maneuover was to execute a right turn based on standard road dimension inputs from IRC 86 : 1983 at a constant speed of 30 km/hour with acceleration controlled by software module. Chassis displacements, displacements of spring were tracked to understand handling and ride quality. The variation of chassis displacements showed a significant improvement in ride characteristic of vehicle with most vibrations being damped in NL at time lower than the L characteristic suspension.

40|$|A {{miniature}} {{latching valve}} has been invented {{to satisfy a}} need for an electrically controllable on/off pneumatic valve that is lightweight and compact and remains in the most recently commanded open or closed state when power is not supplied. The valve includes a poppet that is moved into or out of contact with a seat to effect closure or opening, respectively, of the flow path. Motion of the poppet is initiated by electrical heating of one of two opposing pairs of nickel/titanium shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires above their transition temperature: heated wires contract to their remembered length, applying tension to pull the poppet toward or away from the seat. A latch consisting mainly of a bistable Belleville washer (a <b>conical</b> <b>spring)</b> made of a hardened stainless steel operates between two stable positions corresponding to the fully closed or fully open state, holding the poppet {{in one of these}} positions when power is not applied to either pair of SMA wires. To obtain maximum actuation force and displacement, the SMA wires must be kept in tension. The mounting fixtures at the ends of the wires must support large tensile stresses without creating stress concentrations that would limit the fatigue lives of the wires. An earlier design provided for each wire to be crimped in a conical opening with a conical steel ferrule that was swaged into the opening to produce a large, uniformly distributed holding force. In a subsequent design, the conical ferrule was replaced with a larger crimped cylindrical ferrule depicted in the figure. A major problem in designing the valve was to protect the SMA wires from a bake-out temperature of 300 C. The problem was solved by incorporating the SMA wires into an actuator module that is inserted into a barrel of the valve body and is held in place by miniature clip rings...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Cannulation of {{the left}} {{ventricle}} (LV) apex is a common surgical procedure for aortic valve bypass and ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation. LV cannulation requires coring of the LV apex and attaching a sewing ring via suture. Although effective, suturing is time-consuming and apical coring can lead to bleeding complications or inflow occlusion. The scope of this project was to design a sutureless-anchoring device for an apical left ventricular (ALV) cannula system. Instrumentation, equipment, and procedures: The sutureless-anchoring device {{was designed as a}} <b>conical</b> <b>spring.</b> Five prototypes were fabricated with varying wire diameter (0. 045 ”- 0. 055 ”), maximum cone diameter (0. 85 ”- 0. 975 ”), and spring height (0. 75 ”- 1. 25 ”). The conical springs were attached to PVC cylinders to mimic ALV cannulae. The prototypes were tested through 1) leak test with pressurized porcine hearts, 2) tensile pull test using porcine hearts and an INSTRON, and 3) quantitative assessment of device implantation by cardiothoracic surgeons. Results and Discussion: Leak testing determined that the prototypes created a leak-proof tissue-cannula interface. The prototype with the largest cone and wire diameter combination was able to achieve a tensile failure force similar to that of a clinically-used VAD sewing ring. Other prototypes yielded failure forces below the VAD sewing rings. The quantitative assessment reported that the prototype easily penetrates the tissue and is quicker to implant than sewing rings. Conclusions: This preliminary study demonstrated promise for a sutureless-anchoring device as part of an ALV cannula system. A sutureless implantation method may lead to safer and faster LV cannulation surgeries, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing surgical cost. Recommendations: It is recommended to test springs with larger wire diameter and large end outer diameter combinations than those tested in this study. It is also recommended to create and test multiple prototypes of each variation of spring dimensions...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} and treatment of pathologies of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are performed routinely by gastroenterologists using endoscopes and colonoscopes, however the small intestinal tract is beyond the reach of these conventional systems. Attempts have been made to access the small intestines with wireless capsule endoscopes (WCE). These pill-sized cameras take pictures of the intestinal wall and then relay them back for evaluation. This practice enables the detection and diagnosis of pathologies of the GI tract such as Crohn's disease, small intestinal tumours such as lymphoma and small intestinal cancer. The problems with these systems are that they have limited diagnostic capabilities and they do not offer the ability to perform therapy to the affected areas leaving only the options of administering large quantities of drugs or surgical intervention. To address the issue of administering therapy in the small intestinal tract this thesis presents an active swallowable microrobotic platform which has novel functionality enabling the microrobot to treat pathologies through a targeted drug delivery system. This thesis first reviews the state-of-the-art in WCE through the evaluation of current and past literature. A review of current practises such as flexible sigmoidoscopy, virtual colonoscopy and wireless capsule endoscopy are presented. The following sections review the state-of-the-art in methods of resisting peristalsis, drug targeting systems and drug delivery. A review of actuators is presented, in the context of WCE, with a view to evaluate their acceptability in adding functionality to current WCEs. The thesis presents a novel biologically-inspired holding mechanism which overcomes the issue of resisting natural peristalsis in the GI tract. An analysis of the two components of peristaltic force, circumferential and longitudinal peristaltic contractions, are presented to ensure correct functionality of the holding mechanism. A detailed analysis of the motorised method employed to deploy the expanding mechanism is described and a 5 : 1 scale prototype is presented which characterises the gearbox and validates the holding mechanism. The functionality of WCE is further extended by the inclusion of a novel targeting mechanism capable of delivering a metered dose of medication to a target site of interest in the GI tract. A {{solution to the problem of}} positioning a needle within a 360 degree envelope, operating the needle and safely retracting the needle in the GI tract is discussed. A comprehensive analysis of the mechanism to manoeuvre the needle is presented and validation of the mechanism is demonstrated through the evaluation of scale prototypes. Finally a drug delivery system is presented which can expel a 1 ml dose of medication, stored onboard the capsule, into the subcutaneous tissue of the GI tract wall. An analysis of the force required to expel the medication in a set period of time is presented and the design and analysis of a variable pitch conical compression spring which will be used to deliver the medication is discussed.
