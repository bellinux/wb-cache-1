40|$|A {{binary mixture}} of starch–starch or starch with other biopolymers such as protein and non-starch polysaccharides {{could provide a}} new {{approach}} in producing starch-based food products. In the context of food processing, a specific adjustment in the rheological properties {{plays an important role}} in regulating production processing and optimizing the applicability, stability, and sensory of the final food products. This review examines various biopolymer mixtures based on starch and the influence of their interaction on physicochemical and rheological properties of the starch-based foods. It is evident that the physicochemical and rheological characteristics of the biopolymers mixture are highly dependent on the type of starch and other biopolymers that make them up mixing ratios, mixing procedure and presence of other food ingredients in the mixture. Understanding these properties will lead to improve the formulation of starch–based foods and minimize the need to resort to <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>starch...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Environmentally {{friendly}} cellulose nanofiber green composites were {{newly developed}} by combining two dispersion-type biodegradable resins: polylactic acid (PLA) and <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>starch,</b> and cellulose nanofibers of two kinds. The nanoscale cellulose fibers were prepared by homogenization of wood pulp. The 10 – 100 nm diameter nanoscale cellulose fibers have a web-like network microstructure. The mixture of dispersion-type biodegradable resin and cellulose nanofibers was dried in an air-circulating oven to make composite preform sheets. Cellulose nanofiber composite samples were fabricated by press-forming of the preform sheets. Their mechanical properties were evaluated using room-temperature tensile tests. The composite composed of PLA-based resin and highly homogenized cellulose nanofibers showed higher mechanical properties {{than those of}} starch-based resin and coarse cellulose fibers. It is suggested that coarse cellulose fibers act as a defect, resulting in low mechanical properties. Maximum tensile strength reaches approximately 90 MPa at fiber weight contents of 60 % by weight.

40|$|Starches {{obtained}} from different cultivars of sweet potatoes commonly consumed in Sri Lanka, were chemically modified with hydroxypropyl substitution, {{to analyze the}} changes in the physicochemical properties. Significant changes (P< 0. 05) in the crude digestibility level, thermal properties, and the water separation (syneresis) of starch gels (7. 0 %[*]db) during cold and frozen storage were observed due to the modification. Hydroxypropylation increased the gel stability, water solubility, digestibility, and storage stability of the native starches in the cold storage to a significant level. Lowered gelatinization and retrogradation enthalpies as well as gelatinization temperature were observed for derivatized starches compared to the native starch. Low levels of pasting stability with increased levels of breakdown and reduced cold paste viscosity were observed in the hydroxypropylated starch samples except for the Malaysian cultivar (S 5). <b>Chemically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>starch</b> gels stored under cold storage did not show a syneresis for two weeks in the cycle and the frozen storage showed much improved stability in the starch gels within the four-week cycle.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{and action}} of four starch polymers in talc flocculation has been studied. The polymers include: two <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>starch</b> polymers (carboxymethyl (CM) and phenyl succinate (PS) starch), with similar molecular weight but variation {{in terms of}} added aromatic functionality; and two unmodified starch polymers, Gelose 80 and Gelose 50, which vary in their amylose:amylopectin ratio. The adsorption behaviour of the polymers indicated that the carboxyl groups of the functionalised polymers discouraged adsorption at low ionic strength, with the non-charged Gelose polymers adsorbing to higher densities in spite of having lower molecular weights. AFM imaging and contact angle measurements indicated that the polymers interact similarly with the talc basal plane in terms of coverage and effect on hydrophobicity, with minor differences in adsorbed layer thickness. CM and PS starch had an equal and best effect on the flocculation behaviour of talc suspension. The settling rate of bare talc was 0. 14 m h 1; the two functionalised starch polymers increased the settling rate to 1. 7 and 2 m h 1 for CM and PS starch, respectively (at 8 mg L 1 concentration). Whereas different chemical substitution had no pronounced effect on the settling behaviour, the relative content of amylose to amylopectin did produce differences in settling. Gelose 80 (80 % amylose; 1. 3 m h 1 settling rate at 40 mg L 1 concentration) performed better when compared Gelose 50 (50 % amylose; 0. 65 m h 1 settling rate at 40 mg L 1 concentration).

40|$|Aside {{from being}} used as {{stabilizing}} agents in many processed foods, <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>starches</b> may act as functional dietary ingredients. Therefore, development of <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>starches</b> that are less digestible in the upper intestinal segments and promote fermentation in the hindgut receives considerable attention. This study aimed to investigate the impact of an enzymatically <b>modified</b> <b>starch</b> (EMS) on nutrient flow, passage rate, and bacterial activity at ileal and post-ileal level. Eight ileal-cannulated growing pigs were fed 2 diets containing 72 % purified starch (EMS or waxy cornstarch as control) in a cross-over design for 10 d, followed by a 4 -d collection of feces and 2 -d collection of ileal digesta. On d 17, solid and liquid phase markers {{were added to the}} diet to determine ileal digesta flow for 8 h after feeding. Reduced small intestinal digestion after the consumption of the EMS diet was indicated by a 10 %-increase in ileal flow and fecal excretion of dry matter and energy compared to the control diet (P< 0. 05). Moreover, EMS feeding reduced ileal transit time of both liquid and solid fractions compared to the control diet (P< 0. 05). The greater substrate flow to the large intestine with the EMS diet increased the concentrations of total and individual short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in feces (P< 0. 05). Total bacterial 16 S rRNA gene abundance was not affected by diet, whereas the relative abundance of the Lactobacillus group decreased (P< 0. 01) by 50 % and of Enterobacteriaceae tended (P< 0. 1) to increase by 20 % in ileal digesta with the EMS diet compared to the control diet.

The obtained-microspheres were characterized, including: morphology, particle size distribution, entrapment efficiency and mucoadhesive strength on the stomach and intestinal of rats. In addition, the in vitro drug release from the microspheres was performed in pH 1. 2 and 7. 2. The results showed that the produced microspheres of PCSS and its combination with HPMC and Carbopol 974 P were irregular shape with a rough surface morphology and have particles sizes range of 2. 5 - 28 μm. Propanolol hydrochloride (PH) was incorporated into the microspheres with an efficiency of range between 84 - 100 %. On gastric mucosa, the microspheres of PCSS, HPMC and PCSS-HPMC were more mucoadhesive than the microspheres of Carbopol 974 P and PCSS-Carbopol 974 P. On the other hand, all kinds of the microspheres show good mucoadhesive properties on intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, the drug release from the microspheres produced pH-dependent extended-release in pH 1. 2 HCl and pH 7. 2 phosphate medium. During 8 h in vitro release study, the release of propanolol hydrochloride from the microspheres of PCSS-HPMC and PCSS-Carbopol 974 P in pH 7. 2 was slower than that in pH 1. 2.

40|$|Resistant starch (RS) is not digested in {{the small}} {{intestine}} and is available for fermentation by the colonic microbiota, producing metabolites including short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). We hypothesized that diets containing resistant starch, serving as a prebiotic, will have inhibitory effects, mediated through the products of microbial fermentation, on the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we examined the molecular and morphologic effects of diets containing resistant starches on the early stage of colorectal carcinogenesis in azoxymethane-induced rat and mouse models. The first study {{examined the effects of}} diets containing naturally occurring resistant starch from Latin American corn strains, GUAT (18. 6 %) and AR (5. 4 %), and their hybrid, ARxGUAT (8. 6 %), for effects on the pre-neoplastic stages of azoxymethane-induced colonic epithelial damage in Fisher 344 rats. Genes of the Wnt signaling pathway were selected and analyzed for expression levels by semi-quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis (semi-qRT-PCR). In the second study, the effects of diets including a stearic-acid complexed high-amylose cornstarch (SA-HA 7) (31. 1 %), a high amylose starch (HA 7) (19. 0 %), a <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>starch</b> (OS-HA 7) (4. 7 %), were compared with normal corn starch (CS) (3. 7 %), for the effects on azoxymethane-induced colonic epithelial damage in A/J mice, as tested by mRNA levels of the same genes as the first study. Being able to demonstrate inhibitory effects of resistant starch, on the Wnt pathway will provide a potential means to prevent the initiation and proliferation of colorectal carcinogenesis. In the first study, the GUAT diet did not inhibit development of the putative preneoplastic lesion, aberrant crypt focus (ACF). However, mRNA encoding Ã¢-catenin was significantly decreased in AOM-injected rats fed the GUAT diet compared with the saline-injected rats fed the GUAT diet, while no similar decrease was seen in diets low in resistant starch. In the second study, mice fed a diet containing a high level of resistant starch, SA-HA 7, had lower mRNA expression of several targets, with the exception of Ã¢-catenin mRNA, relative to the mice fed the control diet.

This study investigated the effect of transglycosylated cornstarch (TGS) on blood glucose, insulin, and serum metabolome in the pre- and postprandial phase in growing pigs. Eight jugular vein-catheterized barrows were fed two diets containing 72 % purified starch (waxy cornstarch (CON) or TGS). A meal tolerance test (MTT) was performed with serial blood sampling for glucose, insulin, lipids, and metabolome profiling. TGS-fed pigs had reduced postprandial insulin (p < 0. 05) and glucose (p < 0. 10) peaks compared to CON-fed pigs. The MTT showed increased (p < 0. 05) serum urea with TGS-fed pigs compared to CON, indicative of increased protein catabolism. Metabolome profiling showed reduced (p < 0. 05) amino acids such as alanine and glutamine with TGS, suggesting increased gluconeogenesis compared to CON, probably due {{to a reduction in}} available glucose.

This short-term study evaluated the impact of enzymatically <b>modified</b> <b>starch</b> (EMS) on fasting and postprandial profiles of blood glucose, insulin and lipids, and serum metabolome in growing pigs. Eight jugular-vein catheterized pigs (initial body weight, 37. 4 kg; 4 months of age) were fed 2 diets containing 72 % purified starch (EMS or waxy corn starch (control)) in a cross-over design for 7 days. On day 8, an 8 -hour meal tolerance test (MTT) was performed with serial blood samplings. Besides biochemical analysis, serum was analysed for 201 metabolites through targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomic approaches. Pigs fed the EMS diet showed increased (P< 0. 05) immediate serum insulin and plasma glucose response compared to pigs fed the control diet; however, area-under-the-curves for insulin and glucose were not different among diets. Results from MTT indicated reduced postprandial serum triglycerides with EMS versus control diet (P< 0. 05). Likewise, serum metabolome profiling identified characteristic changes in glycerophospholipid, lysophospholipids, sphingomyelins and amino acid metabolome profiles with EMS diet compared to control diet. Results showed rapid adaptations of blood metabolites to dietary starch shifts within 7 days. In conclusion, EMS ingestion showed potential to attenuate postprandial raise in serum lipids and suggested constant alteration in the synthesis or breakdown of sphingolipids and phospholipids which might be a health benefit of EMS consumption. Because serum insulin was not lowered, more research is warranted to reveal possible underlying mechanisms behind the observed changes in the profile of serum lipid metabolome in response to EMS consumption...|$|R

40|$|Whey is a {{by-product}} of cheese manufacturing {{and can be used}} to make a fermented whey beverage. However, the beverage rapidly separates by sedimentation. The addition of a stabiliser to the beverage can improve the texture of the beverage and prevent sedimentation due to the viscosity increase. <b>Chemically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>starches</b> are used as stabilisers in the food industry. Nevertheless, consumer concerns have demanded for less synthetic <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> ingredients in foods, and instead prefer clean-label ingredients. <b>Starch</b> <b>modified</b> with lipids and xanthan gum can be regarded as clean-label. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of <b>modified</b> <b>starch</b> treated with stearic acid and xanthan gum, on the quality of a fermented whey beverage. Firstly, the properties of maize and high amylose maize <b>starch</b> (HAMS) <b>modified</b> with stearic acid and xanthan gum alone and in combination was determined. Normal maize starch was pasted with and without the modifying agents for two hours at 91 °C under atmospheric pressure. HAMS was pasted with and without modifying agents under pressure (500 kPa) for 10 minutes at 121 °C followed by 91 °C for 110 minutes. The gel strength and thermal properties of the pasted samples were analysed. The flow properties and characteristics of the beverages with the <b>modified</b> <b>starches</b> were evaluated at set intervals over a 15 day period. The IKA® LR 1000 reactor vessel used in upscale-processing could only operate under atmospheric pressure and could thus not fully gelatinise the HAMS. As a result, only maize starch (pasted alone and modified with stearic acid and xanthan gum, alone and in combination) could be used as a stabiliser in the fermented whey beverage. Maize starch pasted with xanthan gum had an increased pasting viscosity relative to maize starch alone. The viscosity of HAMS pasted with xanthan gum was lower relative to the HAMS pasted alone. The high temperature and pressure processing conditions that affect the pasting of HAMS could potentially have degraded the xanthan gum. This could be a reason why an increase in viscosity was not observed as with the maize starch. The presence of amylose-lipid complexes (with and without xanthan gum) in both the maize starch and HAMS that was pasted with stearic acid, resulted in an increased pasting viscosity. Furthermore, the amylose-lipid complexes prevented a gel formation in both starches, possibly by interfering with the retrogradation of amylose chains. The differential scanning calorimetry showed that maize starch pasted with stearic acid had more crystalline amylose-lipid complexes than the maize control. Decreased amounts of Type II amylose-lipid complexes were observed for the maize starch pasted with stearic acid and xanthan gum. It is presumed that the xanthan gum interferes with the formation of the amylose-lipid complexes in normal maize starch. HAMS pasted alone had Type II amylose-lipid complexes. The abundant amylose content and higher pasting temperatures could be a cause for the prevalent formation of the more crystalline Type II amylose-lipid complexes. The viscosity of HAMS was too low to significantly impact the beverage, therefore it was not used in the beverage formulation. The beverages with the <b>modified</b> <b>starch</b> had increased levels of viscosity, decreased levels of sedimentation and increased degrees of shear thinning relative to the whey beverage with no starch. The beverages with the stearic acid <b>modified</b> <b>starch</b> (with and without xanthan gum) had a lower viscosity, increased level of sedimentation and a smaller degree of shear thinning relative to the beverages with <b>modified</b> <b>starch</b> (with and without xanthan gum). The lower viscosity could be due to the lack of the retrograded starch. It is believed that the decrease in shear thinning could be attributed to the compact size of the amylose-lipid complex relative to the long uncomplexed amylose molecules. However, the beverages with stearic acid <b>modified</b> <b>starch</b> (with and without xanthan gum) showed more consistent flow properties throughout the 15 day period in relation to the beverages with <b>modified</b> <b>starch</b> (with and without xanthan gum). Maize <b>starch</b> <b>modified</b> with stearic acid has potential as a thickener and stabiliser in a fermented whey beverage as it shows limited changes during storage and shows higher viscosity. Further research into the rheological and sensory properties of the whey beverage with <b>starch</b> <b>modified</b> lipids is recommended for a marketable product.

5000|$|Papermaking is {{the largest}} non-food {{application}} for starches globally, consuming millions of metric tons annually. In a typical sheet of copy paper for instance, the starch content may {{be as high as}} 8%. Both <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> and unmodified <b>starches</b> are used in papermaking. In the wet part of the papermaking process, generally called the [...] "wet-end", the starches used are cationic and have a positive charge bound to the starch polymer. These starch derivatives associate with the anionic or negatively charged paper fibers / cellulose and inorganic fillers. Cationic starches together with other retention and internal sizing agents help to give the necessary strength properties to the paper web formed in the papermaking process (wet strength), and to provide strength to the final paper sheet (dry strength).|$|R
40|$|Starch {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processed products from agriculture. Two main outlets can be identified; starch is either enzymatically processed for the production of sweeteners and as raw material for fermentation or channelled to various applications as dry <b>starch.</b> Native or <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>starches</b> are utilized in food as well as non-food applications, where the specific physicochemical properties are main determinants for their respective use. Starch consists of two different molecules, amylose and amylopectin. To be able to take the full benefit of the unique properties of either component it is of interest to divide the production of amylose and amylopectin into separate plant genotypes. In the presented work, potatoes producing either amylopectin or high-amylose starch were achieved using genetic modification. For potato transformation a highly efficient protocol was developed for a herbicide selection gene instead of the commonly used nptII antibiotic selection gene. In order to achieve respective starch qualities, the expression of genes important for amylopectin or amylose synthesis was silenced. Antisense technology as well as the expression of dsRNA was investigated where the expression of dsRNA was determined to be at least ten-fold more efficient for gene silencing. An added benefit of dsRNA expression was that a higher fraction of silenced transgenic lines compared to the use antisense were associated with single copy T-DNA integrations. One amylopectin potato line was furthermore characterized regarding genetic and chemical composition. The T-DNA was found integrated as an inverted repeat with the inverted repeat region extending into potato chromosomal DNA. This transgenic locus was found to be more consistent with integration into a double-stranded chromosomal break than insertion by a mechanism nicking one strand of the locus. The high-amylose trait generally resulted in a higher tuber fresh weight yield, much elevated sugar levels and a decreased starch content. Amylose levels were obtained where very limited amounts of material recognizable as amylopectin could be found. The production of amylopectin and amylose was divided into separate genotypes but additional factors are needed to be able to produce amylose at levels comparable to starch contents of cultivated potatoes...|$|R
40|$|Many {{compounds}} {{identified through}} various screening programs are poorly soluble in the water. These molecules {{are difficult to}} formulate using the conventional formulation approaches. An important tool {{in this regard is}} the use of cyclodextrins, especially <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> cyclodextrins. These <b>starch</b> derivatives interact via dynamic complex formation and other mechanisms in a way that camouflages undesirable physicochemical properties, including low aqueous solubility, poor dissolution rate and limited drug stability, which leads to additional benefits such as increased solubility, increased bioavaibility, protection of active molecules from physicochemical degradation and decreased side-eﬀects. This review aims to assess the use of cyclodextrins in newer drug delivery systems such as nanosponges, nanoparticles, nanospheres, nanoassemblies, drug-in cyclodextrin-in deformable liposomes and other drug delivery systems. These approaches are useful for resolving many of the current issues associated with developing and commercializing poorly water soluble drugs...|$|R
40|$|Pie {{fillings}} are {{an excellent}} way to preserve an abundance of fruit. The following fruit fillings are excellent and safe products. Each canned quart makes one 8 -inch to 9 -inch pie. The filling may be used as toppings on dessert or pastries. “Clear Jel® ” is a <b>chemically</b> <b>modified</b> corn <b>starch</b> that produces excellent sauce consistency even after fillings are canned and baked. Other available starches break down when used in these pie fillings, causing a runny sauce consistency. Because the variety of fruit may alter the flavor of the fruit pie, it is suggested that you first make a single quart, make a pie with it, and serve. Then adjust the sugar and spices in the recipe to suit your personal preferences. The amount of lemon juice should not be altered, as it aids in controlling the safety and storage stability of the fillings. When using frozen cherries and blueberries, select unsweetened fruit. If sugar has been added, rinse it off while fruit is frozen. Thaw fruit, then collect, measure, and use the juice from the fruit to partially replace the water specified in the recipe. Use only 1 / 4 cup Clear Jel® per quart or 1 cups for 7 quarts. Use fresh fruit in the apple and peach pie filling recipes...|$|R

Generally, in rats, hamsters, and dogs, there is increased absorption and urinary excretion of calcium, soft stools or diarrhea, and cecal enlargement. In the rat, hamster, and dog, renal lesions accompany the hypercalcemia and elevated excretion of calcium.
