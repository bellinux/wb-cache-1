The practice is costly relative to drawing down ones own savings, and it seems particularly puzzling in poor communities.

In this context, high interest rates on loans can help instill discipline.

They are diverse types {{as they have}} been developed differently in each national context, but normally fall into categories of open, closed, compulsory, and ‘free savings’ schemes. The purpose is to help households build up the financial capacity necessary for home purchase. They typically guarantee a housing loan after a specified period of saving, or link a required savings scheme with home purchase.

40|$|This article empirically {{analyses}} {{the impact}} that tax induced retirement benefits (pension payouts) have on <b>contractual</b> <b>saving</b> and consumption behaviour in South Africa. By using a basic extended Ando-Modigliani life cycle model it is shown that pension payouts accumulated through deductible contributions to retirement schemes contribute towards increased levels of consumption expenditure with the crowding out of discretionary household saving. The results also suggest that the taxing of retirement benefits under the current tax structure may discourage individuals to save through retirement schemes and instead encourages increased levels of current consumption expenditure. The econometric technique used is the Engle-Granger (1987) method of estimation. Estimates {{of the impact of}} retirement benefits on consumption expenditure are robust also when regressed on per capita government deficit ratios and unemployment. Thus, the tax treatment of retirement schemes in South Africa may have adverse effects on saving largely influenced by the discounted value of retirement benefits...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} housing savings (the <b>contractual</b> <b>saving</b> scheme) in Croatia by applying Vector Autoregression (VAR) methodology on monthly data for the period 2000 – 2013.

Moreover, the housing savings system proves to be resilient to economic downturn. On the other hand, the findings are that the system primarily depends on government incentives (GI) (premiums), as confirmed by the intervention analysis. Each of the three interventions in the structure of incentives (reductions in 2005 and 2013 and the decision to freeze the payment of premiums for 2014) resulted in a significant {{decline in the number of}} new housing savings contracts. Since the findings differ from empirical research on determinants of private savings, this article emphasises that housing savings are a specific financial product, very sensitive to institutional changes. Therefore, frequent regulatory modifications, especially regarding government incentives, can easily destabilise the whole system...|$|E

40|$|Germany is an {{interesting}} country to study saving among older households since nearly everyone - whether in the middle income bracket or richer - saves substantial amounts in old age. Only households in the lowest quarter of the income distribution spend more {{between the ages of}} 60 and 75 than they save. Our paper exploits newly collected data, the first wave of the so-called SAVE panel, specifically collected to understand economic, psychological and sociological determinants of saving. Overall, we find extraordinarily stable savings patterns. More than 40 % of German households save regularly a fixed amount. About 25 % of German households plan their savings and have a clearly defined savings target in mind. Most of German household saving {{is in the form of}} <b>contractual</b> <b>saving,</b> such as saving plans, whole life insurance and building society contracts. This makes the flow of saving rather unresponsive to economic fluctuations, such as income shocks. Most households prefer to cut consumption if ends do not meet. In particular the elderly do not like to use credit cards, and they eschew debt. We suspect large cohort differences and will study them once further waves of the SAVE panel will become available. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} the {{composition}} of public debt, broken down by currency, maturity, holder profile and marketability, has responded to major debt accumulation and consolidation episodes during 1900 - 2011. Covering thirteen advanced economies, we focus on debt structure shifts that occurred around the two World Wars and global economic downturns, and the subsequent debt consolidations. Notwithstanding data gaps, {{we are able to}} recover some broad common patterns. Episodes of large debt accumulation—essentially, large increases in debt supply — were typically absorbed by increases in short-term, foreign currency-denominated, and banking-system-held debt. However, this pattern did not hold during the debt build-ups starting in the 1980 s and 1990 s, which were compositionally skewed toward long-term local-currency debt. We attribute this change to higher structural demand for sovereign paper, linked to capital account liberalization in advanced economies, the emergence of a large <b>contractual</b> <b>saving</b> sector, and innovative sovereign debt products. With regard to debt consolidations, we find support for the financial repression-cum-inflation channel for post World War II debt reductions. However, the scope for a repeat of this strategy appears limited unless financial liberalization and globalization were materially rolled back or the current globally agreed monetary policy regime built around price stability abandoned.

40|$|This paper draws a {{link between}} {{self-control}} problems and the contractual mechanisms of microcredit. We use a series of “lab experiments in the field” which were designed to elicit measures of time discounting on a sample of 573 individuals in rural Karnataka, India. Evidence from the experiments were integrated with individual survey data on the economic and financial lives of villagers. One third of participants made choices consistent with hyperbolic preferences (more impatient now than in the future), and would be made better off if they could discipline their time inconsistent preferences. While hyperbolic preferences have been often associated with saving behavior, we describe links to borrowing as well. We find that “hyperbolic” women save a lower share of their savings at home and save less in total levels. Women with hyperbolic preferences {{are also more likely}} to borrow [...] and to do so through microcredit institutions specifically. The finding highlights the role of the fixed and frequent installment schedule ubiquitous in microcredit contracts. While microcredit contracts are celebrated for mitigating informational asymmetries, the evidence suggests that they also offer helpful structure for people with self-discipline problems who seek to accumulate capital but who lack suitable <b>contractual</b> <b>saving</b> devices. banking; : time preference, hyperbolic discounting, loan contracts, microfinance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} data from INSEE’s  2004  household assets survey (Enquête Patrimoine) to {{highlight}} the determinants of holding a contractual financial saving plan to provide supplementary income, distinguishing between working and retired households. Our {{results suggest that the}} profiles of individuals holding certain types of <b>contractual</b> <b>saving</b> plans (retirement saving and life insurance) are determined by factors common to workers and retirees, and tend to confirm behaviour of saving for retirement. Factoring in occupational status reveals specific profiles that suggest that private-sector workers are disadvantaged, particularly with regard to retirement saving. The discrepancy between the public and the private sector in terms of the supplementary retirement saving plans available is a potential source of inequality in terms of household participation in these schemes. The overlap between holding retirement savings and holding alternative savings (life insurance, employee saving plans) in preparation for old age indicates that altruism and a wish to make inter-generational transfers are among the motivations of holders of annuity products, since a significant proportion hold supplementary death insurance. The need to save for retirement via a non-occupational plan is lessened by the availability of a company retirement saving plan, which households with high incomes and financial assets are the most likely to hold. Employee saving plans, which are the only type of saving plan open to younger cohorts of households, are complementary to company retirement saving plans...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} results of a study that examined the impact of psychological variables on household saving and borrowing behaviour. Understanding saving behaviour is important for policy makers and financial institutions, but a comprehensive explanatory model that can explain individual differences in saving does not yet exist. The aim of this research has been to contribute towards the construction of such a model. The study was designed to answer four research questions. The first research question examined psychological explanations for saving in the existing economic and, economic psychological literature on household saving {{in order to determine the}} strength of their empirical support. Though previous reviews have identified several theories, based on psychological ideas, they have not systematically evaluated the theories empirically. This is important because it establishes which theories should be subject to further investigations and which should be ignored. The reviews show that many of the psychological theories have been tested only once. In addition, many studies suffer from serious weaknesses with respect to the measurement of variables. It is therefore appropriate to say that psychological research on household saving is in its infancy and that the fundamental question - which role psychological variables play in household saving - is left unanswered. Consequently, the second research question concerned the contribution of psychological variables in explaining variation in household saving. This question was answered by conducting an empirical study using Dutch data collected for the CentER Saving Survey. The results of the empirical study demonstrate that psychological variables are well worth considering when trying to describe, explain, and predict saving and borrowing behaviour. In particular, time horizon an attitudes towards debt are found to be the most significantly associated with saving and borrow behaviour. The third research question addressed the notion that psychological variables i influence different types of saving. If this is the case, these relationships will not necessarily emerge when total saving is analysed in isolation. Several different measures of saving behaviour were therefore used. More specifically, a distinction was made between discretionary and <b>contractual</b> <b>saving</b> and between flow (saving during a year) and stock (wealth at a particular moment in time) measures of saving. Discretionary saving includes saving that is rely to be a result of discrete saving decisions in the accounting period. <b>Contractual</b> <b>saving,</b> defined here, includes repayment of debt and mortgages, and results from previous borrowing decisions. The data in this thesis suggest that it is useful to distinguish between different types of saving and wealth when investigating the effects of psychological variables. The fourth and final research question concerned the possibility that psychological variables may have more impact on saving behaviour among high-income households in comparison with low-income households. As suggested by Katona (1975), the substantial increase and spread of discretionary income among families in Western economies may increase the importance of variables other than income when explaining saving and spending decisions. This discretionary income means that there is income left to spend after necessities and habitual expenses are paid for, so that a choice between spending and saving can be made. It is reasonable that the increase in discretionary income alters the relative influence of economic, situational and psychological variables on saving in favour of psychological variables. In order to test this assertion, estimates based on data from three different discretionary income groups were compared. The results did not support the hypothesis that the psychological variables were more important predictors for the saving behaviour of the richer than the poorer part of the sample. Rather, the results suggest that psychological variables are im t for explaining saving behaviour at all income levels.

40|$|<b>Contractual</b> <b>savings</b> {{institutions}} - {{pension funds}} and life insurance companies - have long been important institutions in several developing countries. But, with notable exceptions, they have been weak and underdeveloped. Some of this is attributable to low levels of income in developing countries {{and some of it}} to the negative impact of repressive regulations and the existence of pay-as-you-go social security systems. The author briefly reviews the size of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> institutions in selected developed and developing countries and assesses their {{role in the development of}} the financial sector - especially in the development of securities markets. He stresses five points : 1) the structure of a country's financial system depends on the organization of the country's pension system; 2) <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> do not increase the rate of saving but shift the composition of total savings toward long-term financial assets; 3) the role of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> institutions in securities markets reflects historical traditions and differences in regulation; 4) investment regulations mustaim at ensuring the safety and profitability of contractual savings; encouraging investment prudence and developing effective supervision should be basic objectives of public policy; and 5) <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> institutions can have a great impact on securities markets.

40|$|The authors {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the development of insurance, and <b>contractual</b> <b>savings,</b> (the assets and portfolio composition of pension funds, and life and non-life insurance companies) and the development of stock markets (market capitalization and value traded). Their contribution lies in providing cross-country, and time-series on a hypothesis that is very popular - but had not been substantiated - among supporters of funded pension systems, and insurance in which reserves are largely invested in tradable securities (equities and bonds). The authors presenta three-assets model (money, quasi money, and shares) to study the effects of the development of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> (pension funds and life insurance companies) and non-life insurance companies on assets market equilibrium, and on stock market development. They use an unbalanced panel of 21 OECD, and 5 developing countries, and an error components two-stage least squares (EC 2 SLS) estimator, including a test for endogeneity of these institutional investors. The results support the hypothesis that <b>contractual</b> <b>savings,</b> and non-life insurance companies can be treated as exogenous to the development of stock markets; that <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> and non-life insurance companies, as well as their portfolio policies, promote stock market development as measured by stock market capitalization, and value traded as a share of GDP. The results show that stock market capitalization is positively correlated with the return on stocks, the assets of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> and non-life insurance companies, the shares of stocks in the portfolios of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> and non-life insurance companies, and the value traded stocks. Stock market capitalization is negatively correlated with the real interest rate, the real return on money (measured by the inverse of inflation), and stock market volatility. Stock market value traded is positively correlated with the shares of stocks in the portfolios of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> and non-life insurance companies, and the real return on money. It is negatively correlated with the real interest rate. The authors conclude that insurance and <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> are powerful instruments for developing stock markets, providing depth and liquidity.

40|$|Non-bank {{financial}} intermediaries (NBFIs) comprise {{a mixed bag}} of institutions, ranging from leasing, factoring, and venture capital companies to various types of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> and institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds). The common characteristic of these institutions is that they mobilize savings and facilitate the financing of different activities, {{but they do not}} accept deposits from the public. NBFIs play an important dual role in the financial system. They complement the role of commercial banks by filling gaps in their range of services. But they alsocompete with commercial banks and force them to be more efficient and responsive to the needs of their customers. Most NBFIs are also actively involved in the securities markets and in the mobilization and allocation of long-term financial resources. The state of development of NBFIs is usually a good indicator of the state of development of the financial system.

We introduce concepts of stability {{as well as}} strong and weak stability of trajectories generated by CSH programs, and obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee fulfillment of these properties. Experimental calculations indicate that CSH programs ensure stable financing of its members under wide range of variation of parameters which are close to real data. ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the development of <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> (assets of pension funds, and life insurance companies) and non-life insurance, and, the development of stock markets (market capitalization and value traded). Their contribution lies in providing time-series evidence on a hypothesis that is very popular - but had not been substantiated - among supporters of fully funded pension systems in which funds invest large shares of their portfolios in tradable securities (equities, bonds). The literature is not clear on its assumption regarding causality between <b>contractual</b> <b>savings,</b> and capital market development. A one-way or two-way relationship is assumed, usually inter-changeably; the authors address the questions of which leads empirically. They present the evidence, including descriptive statistics, and the results of Granger causality tests, for OECD countries, and such countries as Chile, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, and Thailand. They do not present a theoretical framework, but do explain how the growth of the <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> sector, is thought to promote financial development. The authors find evidence in the data that causality between institutions, and markets either does not exist, or, if it exists, runs predominantly from institutions to markets. To a lesser extent, there is simultaneous causality between institutions, and markets. Furthermore, there is limited evidence that causality runsonly from markets to institutions (the only exception seems to be for non-life insurance in developing countries). Results seem to support the idea that the development of institutional investors, is likely to promote the growth of market capitalization, more than that of value traded. In developing countries, {{there seems to be no}} causality from pension funds to growth in value traded, while there is causality from life, and non-life insurance.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{strategy}} for building mass mortgage financing in Russia based on the transplantation of a modified institution of <b>Contractual</b> <b>Savings</b> for Housing (CSH) and on the control upon its evolution. Rationality of the proposed decision is justified by analysis of mortgage institutions development in advanced economies, comparisons of results achieved by East European countries and Russia, as well as modeling calculations. We show that state premium on savings in CSH is a more efficient way to subsidize the purchase of housing than subsidies of down payments in banks. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{non-bank}} {{financial institution}} (NBFI) is a financial institution {{that does not have}} a full banking license or is not supervised by a national or international banking regulatory agency. NBFIs facilitate bank-related financial services, such as investment, risk pooling, <b>contractual</b> <b>savings,</b> and market brokering. Examples of these include insurance firms, pawn shops, cashier's check issuers, check cashing locations, payday lending, currency exchanges, and microloan organizations. Alan Greenspan has identified the role of NBFIs in strengthening an economy, as they provide [...] "multiple alternatives to transform an economy's savings into capital investment which act as backup facilities should the primary form of intermediation fail." ...|$|R
40|$|Problems of {{developing}} specialized financial services for housing are acute in transition socialist economies (TSE). Some constraints {{derive from the}} incomplete and imperfect privatization {{of the real estate}} sector. Others reflect the fragmented and undeveloped financial system. This paper examines a financial instrument, <b>contractual</b> <b>savings</b> for housing (CSH), that is often advocated as a major solution, but usually without consideration of its impact on the emergence of a competitive housing finance system and on overall financial development. Interest in CSH is high in Central and Eastern European countries. Legislation has already been passed in some of them (Czech Republic and Slovakia) and is under serious discussion in others (such as Poland) ...|$|R

We propose to form systems (lines) of savings and loan tariff plans (SLTP) for bank accounts «linking» these two mortgage institutions. We consider properties of lines of SLTP and develop a model for their design and analysis. Experimental calculations indicate that parameters {{of the line of}} SLTP may be selected so that efficiency of the mortgage system rises for all involved agents – consumers, banks and governments. Finally we analyze the impact of parameters of SLTP on objective functions of the agents. ...|$|R

The article shows that account transfers among pension administrators in Mexico barely respond to price or return considerations and in general has not improved the consumer''s pension balance. Instead of strengthening competition through lower fees and higher returns for the consumer, AFORE switching has so far undermined the system and resulted {{in the destruction of}} value. Moreover, "noisy" evaluations of the product by the consumer tend to undermine the power of competition. Thus, an increased number of pension fund managers has not provided a more competitive environment. The theoretical framework allows for the estimation of "noise" and mark-ups in the AFORE industry. As the number of AFOREs increases, the mark-up diminishes at a very slow rate. This implies that more participants in the industry will hardly affect prices.
