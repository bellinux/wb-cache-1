5|$|De Coventre {{received}} a B. A. under John de Waltirstone from the University of Paris by Lent, 1333. Although he had probably completed a Licentiate in the Arts and a Master of Arts by 1335, because of {{gaps in the}} Paris records it is not <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a Master until April 1345.|$|E
5|$|Even though Thomas is {{the first}} known Bishop of Finland, it is <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was not the first}} bishop overall. An unnamed Bishop of Finland is {{mentioned}} dead in a letter by Pope Innocent III already in 1209. A 15th-century chronicle names bishops Henry, Rodulff and Folquinus before him, but no indisputable records survive of them.|$|E
5|$|Following a Viking raid in 994, a {{peace treaty}} was agreed {{with one of the}} raiders, Olaf Tryggvason. Besides {{receiving}} danegeld, Olaf converted to Christianity and undertook never to raid or fight the English again. Ælfheah may have played a part in the treaty negotiations, and it is <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> confirmed Olaf in his new faith.|$|E

5|$|Debra, who {{is staying}} at Dexter's apartment, is exercising incessantly and {{barely able to}} sleep as she struggles with {{memories}} of Brian, her ex-fiancé, trying to kill her. She returns {{to work at the}} police station; Sgt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez) expresses concern about her emotional stability, but Debra is determined to resume a normal lifestyle. When she takes Rita out to a bar, a man recognizes Debra as the fiancée of the Ice Truck Killer. He touches her on the shoulder and she instinctively punches him in the nose, <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was trying to grab her.|$|E
5|$|Harrison was unpopular {{with the}} party and the country, and many of Blaine’s old {{supporters}} encouraged him to run for the nomination. Blaine had denied any interest in the nomination months before his resignation, but some of his friends, including Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and James S. Clarkson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, took it for false modesty and worked for his nomination anyway. When Blaine resigned from the cabinet, his boosters were <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a candidate, but the majority of the party stood by the incumbent. Harrison was renominated on the first ballot, but die-hard Blaine delegates still gave their champion 182 and 1/6 votes, good enough for second place.|$|E
5|$|Hervey was {{a native}} of Brittany, and some sources state a {{chaplain}} of King William II of England, while others are less <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a chaplain for the king. He was appointed Bishop of Bangor in 1092 by King William. Bangor at the time was in the Kingdom of Gwynedd, which had recently been overrun by the Normans, and following the killing of Robert of Rhuddlan had been taken over by Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester. The appointment of Hervey was probably intended to further consolidate the Norman hold on the area. Bangor was {{under the jurisdiction of the}} diocese of Canterbury, but Hervey was consecrated by Thomas of Bayeux, who was the Archbishop of York, since the see of Canterbury was vacant at the time.|$|E

Well, I shall be quite happy in my opinion of him, from this time. You can't think how it elevates him in my opinion, to know for <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> really conscientious!' ...|$|R
5|$|Tenth-century sources {{describe}} Israel as a bishop; around 950 a {{man with}} this name is identified as Bishop of Aix-en-Provence, {{but it is not}} <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the same person. Between 948 and 950 he may have held a bishopric in Aachen, where he debated Christian ideas about the Trinity with a Jewish intellectual called Salomon, probably the Byzantine ambassador of that name. He retired to become a monk at the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Maximin in Trier, and died on 26 April in an unknown year. Lapidge sets his death in about 970, whereas Wood dates it before 967–68.|$|E
5|$|The second plotline {{revolves}} around a Father Coughlin-esque Methodist preacher, Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown), {{who lives with}} his sister Iris in California. He shares Ben's prophetic dreams and slowly discovers {{the extent of his}} own unearthly powers, which include bending human beings to his will and making their sins and greatest evils manifest as terrifying visions. <b>Certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is doing God's work, Brother Justin fully devotes himself to his religious duties, not realizing that his ultimate nemesis Ben Hawkins and the carnival are inexorably drawing closer.|$|E
5|$|This {{was to be}} {{the last}} {{military}} engagement of Nansouty's long career. On 8 March, {{on the eve of the}} Battle of Laon, Nansouty was at Chavignon, nine kilometres from Laon, where the Emperor was also present and, although the circumstances of Nansouty's departure are unclear, it is <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> left this village, and his command, that very day. Two days later, Napoleon wrote to his War Minister to inform him that General Nansouty's health did not allow him to exercise his military duties and that he was authorised to take sick leave in Paris. General Belliard had taken interim command of the Guard cavalry during the battle of Laon, with General Sébastiani subsequently given permanent command.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{surviving}} evidence, {{it is likely that}} Halton Hill was a settlement in prehistoric times. Following the Norman conquest, the Barony of Halton was established by Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester. The first baron to be appointed was Nigel of Cotentin and it is almost <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have built a motte and bailey castle on the site, constructing it from wood, although the excavations in 1986–87 showed no evidence of a motte and bailey structure or of a timber tower or palisade. It is most probable that during the 12thcentury the wooden structure was replaced by a castle built from the local sandstone although no documentary evidence of this remains. Details of the building works are obscure but {{it has been suggested that}} John of Gaunt, the 14thbaron, made alterations to the castle but this again has not been confirmed by documentary evidence. When the 15thbaron, Henry Bolingbroke, ascended the throne as KingHenryIV, the castle became the property of the Duchy of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|He spreads poison {{and kills}} much {{livestock}} and many Frenchmen {{to prepare for}} an uprising, but is forced into exile as the French become aware of his actions and begin to search for him. He returns after four years, but is captured and tied to a post to be lashed and burned {{in front of a}} massive black audience. While tied to the post, he metamorphoses into an insect and flies overhead before landing in the crowds. During the ensuing pandemonium he is again captured by ten men and burned in the fire. The slaves are <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been saved and remain in defiant and jubilant spirits. The memory of Macandal is not extinguished in the flames. Ti Noel tells his children the stories he was told by Macandal, and they await his return many years later.|$|E
5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
60|$|If {{you wish}} to find Jean Lemaitre, search in the upper rooms of the Hotel de Flandres. I have <b>certain</b> {{information}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is to be found}} there.|$|R
60|$|I have, indeed,' said he, {{simply and}} gravely; {{and there was}} a silence, while she was <b>certain</b> <b>that,</b> {{whatever}} <b>he</b> might have endured, he did not feel it to have been in vain.|$|R
50|$|It {{is unknown}} {{when he was}} born, or died, or where. All O'Neill could say for <b>certain</b> was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was alive {{in the third quarter}} of the 1800s.|$|R
5|$|In 733, Bede {{travelled}} to York {{to visit}} Ecgbert, {{who was then}} bishop of York. The See of York was elevated to an archbishopric in 735, {{and it is likely}} that Bede and Ecgbert discussed the proposal for the elevation during his visit. Bede hoped to visit Ecgbert again in 734, but was too ill to make the journey. Bede also travelled to the monastery of Lindisfarne, and at some point visited the otherwise-unknown monastery of a monk named , a visit that is mentioned in a letter to that monk. Because of his widespread correspondence with others throughout the British Isles, and {{due to the fact that}} many of the letters imply that Bede had met his correspondents, it is likely that Bede travelled to some other places, although nothing further about timing or locations can be guessed. It seems <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not visit Rome, however, as he would have mentioned it in the autobiographical chapter of his Historia Ecclesiastica. Nothhelm, a correspondent of Bede's who assisted him by finding documents for him in Rome, is known to have visited Bede, though the date cannot be determined beyond the fact that it was after Nothhelm's visit to Rome.|$|E
5|$|It was {{now that}} Philip applied {{the coup de}} grace. He had persuaded the Athenians and other Greeks {{that he and his}} army was heading for Halos, but it seems <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also sent other units {{straight}} to Thermopylae. All of central and southern Greece was now at Philip's mercy, and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace. Philip could be certain of dictating the terms {{of the end of the}} Sacred War, since he could now use force against any state that did not accept his arbitration. He began by making a truce with Phalaikos on 19 July; Phalaikos surrendered Phocis to him, in return for being allowed him to leave, with his mercenaries, and go wherever he wished. Philip then declared that the fate of Phocis would not be decided by him, but by the Amphictyonic Council. However, it is clear that Philip was dictating the terms behind the scenes; allowing the Amphictyons the formal responsibility allowed him to dissociate himself from the terms in the future.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel {{recalls the}} tales that a fellow slave, Macandal, would regale on the {{plantation}} of their master, Lenormand de Mezy. Macandal would tell tales of magical characters and mythical kingdoms with rivers {{rising in the}} sky. He is said to not only have irresistible qualities that appeal to black women, but also the ability to captivate men. He suffers an accident in which his left hand is caught in machinery, and his arm is dragged in up to the shoulder. Being useless to his owner, he departs for the mountains and discovers many secret herbs, plants, and fungi that appear to have magical qualities. Ti Noel joins Macandal and both learn about the magical attributes of these natural elements. Macandal suggests {{that the time has}} come, and no longer goes to the plantation. After the rain season has passed, Ti Noel meets with him in a cave populated with strange items. Macandal has established contact with surrounding plantations, and gives instructions to ensure the death of cows using secret herbs. The poison spreads, killing livestock by the hundreds as well as Frenchmen, wiping out adults and children. Madame Lenormand de Mezy dies as a result, and the deaths continue with entire families suffering the same fate. At gunpoint, a slave eventually explains that Macandal has superhuman powers and is the Lord of Poison. Death within the plantations returns to normal rates as a result and the Frenchmen return to playing cards and drinking, as months pass with no word of Macandal. Macandal, now with the ability to transform into animal forms, like bird, fish, or insect, visits the plantation to affirm faith in his return. The slaves decide to wait four years for Macandal to complete his metamorphoses and once again become a human. After four years, he returns during a celebration and all present are delighted. The chanting alerts the white men, and preparations are made to capture Macandal. He is captured and tied to a post in order to be lashed and burned in front of massive black crowds, but he escapes, flying overhead, and lands among the crowd. He is again captured and burned, but the slaves are <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been saved by African Gods and return to their plantations, laughing.|$|E

25|$|The first European {{explorer}} {{to enter}} the valley may have been John Work, who headed a Hudson's Bay Company trapping expedition that explored the area in 1831.
