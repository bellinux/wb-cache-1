50|$|The Photothermoelectric (PTE) {{effect is}} based on the Seebeck effect but here the heating is {{achieved}} by absorbing light {{on the top of a}} thermoelectric (TE) material. Synonymous to PPE technique for thermal <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> PTE sensors can also be utilized for finding the thermal transport properties of materials.The particular advantage of such sensors stems from their wide temperature range of applicability since pyro materials are limited to its curie temperature. On the other hand, in order to obtain a useful signal from TE material, depends on its Seebeck coefficient, sufficiently large amount of heat has to be applied to the material. As far as now, Frequency domain PTE technique is in its preliminary stage for the thermal <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E

In this thesis, two improvements to the process <b>of</b> core loss <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> ferrimagnetic <b>materials</b> are made. First, the characterization is made based on the anhysteretic rather than hysteretic (actual) flux density. This makes design predictions of losses more accurate, as such predictions are based on the anhysteretic fields. Second, the effects of test sample flux density nonuniformity on the characterization process are accounted for. ...|$|R
