40|$|Nitella flexilis {{cells are}} not stimulated to "shock stoppage" of <b>cyclosis</b> by {{suddenly}} evacuating {{the air over}} the water or on sudden readmission of air, or on suddenly striking a piston in the water-filled chamber {{in which they are}} kept with a ball whose energy is 7. 6 joules, provided the Nitella cell is not moved by currents {{against the side of the}} chamber. Sudden increases in hydrostatic pressure from zero to 1000 lbs. or 0 to 5000 lbs. per square inch or 5000 to 9000 lbs. per square inch usually do not stimulate to "shock stoppage" of <b>cyclosis,</b> but some cells are stimulated. Sudden decreases of pressure are more likely to stimulate, again with variation depending on the cell. In the absence of stimulation, the <b>cyclosis</b> velocity at 23 °C. slows as the pressure is increased in steps of 1000 lbs. per square inch. In some cells a regular slowing is observed, in others there is little slowing until 4000 to 6000 lbs. per square inch, when a rapid slowing appears, with only 50 per cent to 30 per cent of the original velocity at 9000 lbs. per square inch. The <b>cyclosis</b> does not completely stop at 10000 lbs. per square inch. The pressure effect is reversible unless the cells have been kept too long at the high pressure. At low temperatures (10 °C.) and at temperatures near and above (32 °– 38 °C.) the optimum temperature for maximum <b>cyclosis</b> (35 – 36 °C.) pressures of 3000 to 6000 lbs. per square inch cause only further slowing of <b>cyclosis,</b> with no reversal of the temperature effect, such as has been observed in pressure-temperature studies on the luminescence of luminous bacteria.

40|$|Both {{parts of}} the actin–myosin complex {{involved}} in cytoplasmic streaming could be regulated by mineral ions. The main goal {{of this study was}} to find a relation-ship between <b>cyclosis</b> and ion transport across the cell wall and plasma membrane. The transport of K 1 and Ca 21 along pH bands in Chara branchlet internodal cells was characterized by using the MIFE system for non-invasivemicroelectrodemeasurementof ionfluxes. Branchlets formed acidic and alkaline bands with the pH ranging from 5 to 8. Different pH patterns were observed for different sides of the branchlets. Sides with <b>cyclosis</b> streaming acropetally generally showed greater variation in the profiles of pH and H 1 fluxes. Although a high correlation was not found between pH bands and Ca 21 or K 1 fluxes, there was a positive cor-relationbetweenCa 21 andK 1 fluxes themselves for both sides of the branchlets. Application of cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of <b>cyclosis,</b> had no immediate effect on pH and ion fluxes, however, the time of <b>cyclosis</b> cessation corresponded with a dramatic change in Ca 21 and K 1 fluxes; pH profiles and H 1 fluxes were affected within 2 h. The evidence suggests that, inChara branchlets, pH band formation and Gd 31 -insensitive Ca 21 transport systems are linked to the <b>cyclosis</b> machinery: (i) the pH band amplitude for the acropetally streaming side was larger than that for the basipetally streaming side; (ii) cessation of cytoplasmic streaming after cytochalasin D application resulted in changed pH banding profiles and H 1, Ca 21 and K 1 fluxes; and (iii) the application of GdCl 3 or incubation in GdCl 3 solutions did not lead to the cessation of cytoplasmic streaming, although external Ca 21 fluxes changed...|$|E

Among polykrikoids, Polykrikos kofoidii is a common species that {{plays an important role}} as a grazer of toxic planktonic algae but whose life cycle is poorly known. In this study, the main life cycle stages of P. kofoidii were examined and documented for the first time. The formation of gametes, 2 -zooid- 1 -nucleus stages very different from vegetative cells, was observed and the process of gamete fusion, isogamy, was recorded. Karyogamy followed shortly after completed plasmogamy. A complex reorganization of furrows (cinguli and sulci) and flagella followed zygote formation, resulting in a 4 -zooid zygote with one nucleus. The fate of zygotes under different nutritional conditions was also investigated; well-fed zygotes were able to reenter the vegetative cycle via meiotic divisions as indicated by nuclear <b>cyclosis.</b> However, nuclear <b>cyclosis</b> was preceded by a presumably mitotic division of the primary zygote nucleus which by definition would imply that P. kofoidii has a diplohaplontic life cycle.

40|$|Abstract Recent {{studies of}} aquatic and land plants show that similar {{phenomena}} determine intracellular transport of organelles and vesicles.

Research has shown that myosin XI functions in organelle movement driving cytoplasmic streaming in aquatic and land plants. Despite the conserved cytoskeletal machinery propelling organelle movement among aquatic and land plants, the velocities of <b>cyclosis</b> in plant cells varies according to cell types, developmental stage of the cell, and plant species.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the effect of sudden intense flashes of {{ultraviolet}} light, acting {{on a wide variety of}} cells and tissues, with special reference to stimulation. The flashes are obtained by a high voltage condenser discharge through a quartz mercury vapor sterilamp, using the method of Rentschler. The lethal effect of a single such discharge is widespread among unicellular organisms. Medullated nerves and whole muscles are not visibly stimulated, because of absorption by connective tissue. Single muscle fibers undergo immediate contracture in 50 per cent of the experiments. Nitella cells are stimulated, the effect depending on the dosage. Weak ultraviolet flashes slow or stop <b>cyclosis</b> reversibly. Strong flashes stop <b>cyclosis</b> reversibly with the appearance of a local or a propagated action potential.

40|$|When {{exposed to}} light, Characean cells develop {{a pattern of}} {{alternating}} alkaline and acid bands along the cell length. The bands were identi"ed with a tip-sensitive antimony pH microelectrode positioned near one end of Chara internode {{at a distance of}} 50 } 100 lm from the cell wall. The stage with Chara cell was moved along its longitudinal axis at a computer-controlled speed (100 or 200 lm s~ 1) relative to the pH probe over a distance of 50 mm. Under su$cient uniform illumination of the cell (from 100 to 2. 5 Wm~ 2), the homogeneous pH distribution becomes unstable and a banding pattern is formed, the spatial scale of which decreases with the light intensity. If the cell is locally illuminated, bands are formed only in the region of illumination. It is shown that the inhibition of <b>cyclosis</b> by cytochalasin B leads to the disappearance of the banding pattern. The addition of ammonium (weak base) inhibited the banding pattern, whereas acetate (weak acid) alleviated the inhibitory e!ect of ammonium and restored the pH banding.

It contains two di!usion equations for the corresponding ions with nonlinear boundary condi-tions determined by ion transport processes across the cell membrane.

In this work, we exploits the underlying station-ary motion in biological systems, e. g. the movement of crowds, bacteria swarming and <b>cyclosis</b> in plant cells, and then propose a multi-frame optical flow based tracker. We obtain the stationary motion by adapting a recent optical flow algorithm that re-lates one image to another locally using an all-pass filter. We perform this operation over all the image frames simultaneously and estimate a single, stationary optical flow.

40|$|Treating carrot (Daucus carota L.) discs with ice-cold NaCl {{solutions}} for 30 minutes caused three effects {{that appear to}} be functionally related: the exchange of tissue Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + for Na+, the release of protein, and the suppression of active uptake of glucose and orthophosphate. <b>Cyclosis</b> continued apparently unabated after treatment with NaCl at concentrations of up to 0. 25 m, so the cells remained viable and energetically competent. The correlation between the release of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and release of protein, and between these effects and the suppression of glucose and orthophosphate uptake, supports the hypothesis that divalent cations maintain, and monovalent cations disrupt, linkages between the outer cell surface and proteins required for active solute uptake. Calcium preserved uptake activity only when it was added in time to prevent the release of protein. Cells gradually recovered some glucose uptake activity after it had been completely inactivated by treatment with 0. 25 m NaCl. This recovery occurred in the absence of added Ca 2 +.

40|$|The sudden {{cessation}} or sudden {{decrease in}} {{velocity of the}} protoplasmic streaming of Nitdla flexilis is observed whenever an action potential is elicited. The action potential can be generated by an electric stimulus after its refractory period, whether the flow is at a complete standstill or {{on the way to}} recovery. The membrane potential is generally decreased more or less when the rate of flow is decreased on application of salts or other agents. There is, however, no parallelism between these two. The membrane potential decreases proportionally with applied voltage of subthreshold intensity, while the rate of flow does not change appreciably. 0 nly on application of a superthreshold voltage does the flow stop suddenly. In one case the rate of flow decreased to half without appreciable decrease in membrane potential. In another case it continued flowing at about one-half rate, although the membrane potential was almost zero. The Q 10 of the rate of flow is about 2, while it is 1. 1 to 1. 5 for the membrane potential. The sudden cessation of the protoplasmic streaming is supposed to be caused by the temporary formation of certain interlinkages among contractile protein networks in the endoplasm during excitation at the cathodal half of Nitella. The protoplasmic streaming of Characeae cells is a typical <b>cyclosis</b> with a constant, uniform speed (i. e., 50 to 100 microns per second normally).

40|$|In Nitella the {{protoplasm}} forms a layer about 15 microns thick {{surrounding a}} large central vacuole. The outer {{part of the}} protoplasm is a gel, the inner layer is a sol which is in continual motion travelling {{the entire length of}} the cell in opposite directions on opposite sides and thus making a complete circuit (<b>cyclosis).</b> If we have a cell devoid of motion and if we regard the protoplasm in any region as made up of successive portions, A, B, C, D, etc., as we pass from left to right) we may suppose that a reaction starts in B which results in a temporary loss of volume by electrostriction, so that liquid moves from A to B to fill the void thus created. The same reaction then occurs at C causing liquid to flow from B to C and so on. The protoplasmic movement can be controlled by agents which affect the viscosity of the protoplasm or the reactions which cause the flow. Certain reagents such as lead acetate stop the flow temporarily. When the motion is stopped in any region by killing or by applying lead acetate, the motion goes on for a time in adjoining regions. When motion stops in all of the cell or in certain parts, it resumes in the same direction as it had before stoppage occurred. Under normal conditions each of the two sides of the cell (on opposite sides of the white line) has its own characteristic direction of motion which remains unchanged after a temporary stoppage of motion in all parts of the cell. Hence the two sides differ and we have what may be called lateral polarity. There is also longitudinal polarity as the opposite ends of the cell are unlike since shoots grow out at one end and roots at the opposite end. The explanation suggested to account for motion in Nitella may apply to other kinds of motion including the motion of cilia and of flagella...|$|E
40|$|Marine thecate {{heterotrophic}} dinoflagellates likely play {{an important}} role in the consumption of primary productivity and in the trophic structure of the plankton, yet we know little about these species. This thesis expanded our understanding of the autecology and evolutionary history of the Protoperidinium and diplopsalids. The distributions of Protoperidinium species off the southwestern coast of Ireland were influenced by physical oceanographic conditions coupled with the availability of preferred prey. The distributions of individual Protoperidinium species varied widely from the distribution of total Protoperidinium, indicating differences in ecologies among species. Certain species of Protoperidinium co-occurred with known preferred phytoplankton prey species. Concentrations of other Protoperidinium species were not related to those of any particular phytoplankton species, indicating that these Protoperidinium may rely on phytoplankton or other food sources beyond those already known, may not be species specific selective feeders, or may have become uncoupled from their preferred prey. The description of the sexual and asexual life history of Protoperidinium steidingerae provided the first account of the life history of any Protoperidinium species. (cont.) Asexual division occurred by eleutheroschisis within a temporary, immotile cyst, yielding two daughter cells. Daughter cells were initially round and half to two-thirds the size of parent cells, then rapidly increased in size, forming horns before separating. Sexual reproduction was constitutive in clonal cultures, indicating that the species may be homothallic. Fusing gametes were isogamous, and resulted in a planozygote with two longitudinal flagella. Hypnozygotes had a mandatory dormancy period of ca. 70 days. Germination resulted in planomeiocytes with two longitudinal flagella. Nuclear <b>cyclosis</b> may occur in the planomeiocyte stage. A high level of morphological diversity among life history stages of P. steidingerae has led to mis-classification and taxonomic inaccuracy of Protoperidinium species identified from field samples. The large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) molecular phylogeny of the heterotrophic dinoflagellates revealed that the genus Protoperidinium appeared to be recently diverged within the dinoflagellates. In maximum parsimony and neighbor joining analysis, Protoperidinium formed a monophyletic group, evolving from diplopsalid dinoflagellates. (cont.) In maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses, however, Protoperidinium was polyphyletic, as the lenticular, diplopsalid heterotroph, Diplopsalis lenticula Bergh, was inserted within the Protoperidinium clade basal to Protoperidinium excentricum (Paulsen) Balech, and Preperidinium meunieri (Pavillard) Elbrichter fell within a separate clade as a sister to the Oceanica section and Protoperidinium steidingerae Balech. In all analyses, the Protoperidinium were divided into two major clades, with members in the Oceanica group and subgenus Testeria in one clade, and the Excentrica, Conica, Pellucida, Pyriforme, and Divergens sections in another clade. The LSU rDNA molecular phylogeny supported the historical morphologically determined sections, but not a simple morphology-based model of evolution based on thecal plate shape. LSU rDNA gene sequences are frequently used to infer the phylogeny of organisms. The many copies of the LSU rDNA found in the genome are thought to be kept homogenous by concerted evolution. In Protoperidinium species, however, there was high intragenomic diversity in the D 1 -D 6 region of the LSU rDNA. For each species, the clone library was usually comprised of one highly represented copy and many unique sequences. (cont.) Sequence differences were primarily characterized by single base pair substitutions, single base pair insertion/deletions (indels), and/or large indels. Phylogenetic analysis of all clones gave strong support for monophyly of the polymorphic copies of each species, and recovered the same species tree as an analysis using just one sequence per species. Analysis of LSU rDNA gene expression in three species by RT-PCR indicated that copies with fewer substitutions and fewer and smaller indels are expressed, and that 50 % or more of the copies are pseudogenes. High intraspecific and intraindividual LSU rDNA sequence variability could lead to inaccurate species phylogenies and over-estimation of species diversity in environmental sequencing studies. This thesis has explored the ecology, life history, molecular phylogeny, and intraspecific DNA sequence variability of marine thecate heterotrohic dinoflagellates using a wide range of methodologies, including field sampling, culturing, microscopy, morphological analyses, histological staining, and molecular biology. The work here has broadened our understanding of the Protoperidinium and diplopsalids, providing new insights into the ecological and evolutionary relationships of these heterotrophs with other plankton species. by Kristin Elizabeth Gribble.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was about the}} asymmetric competition between free-floating and submerged macrophytes in shallow freshwater ecosystems. I studied the effect of climate change on the dominance of free-floating macrophytes in temperate regions. The research approach {{was a combination of}} outdoor mesocosm experiments, a laboratory experiment, a database analysis and a literature review. In Chapter 2 a I explored the possibility to use inexpensive open-top chambers (OTCs) as passive artificial warming devices in experimental aquatic studies. Existing experimental set-ups for artificial warming are very expensive and do usually not maintain a natural vertical temperature profile in the water column, which is generally observed in small-sized water bodies. Effects of different sizes of OTCs on the daily water temperature course in outdoor mesocosms were evaluated. Results showed that OTCs cause a significant temperature increase corresponding with predicted climatic warming whereas the vertical temperature profile in the water column was maintained. Therefore, OTCs are well suited for studying the effects of climate change in small-sized aquatic mesocosm experiments. These OTCs were subsequently used in an outdoor mesocosm experiment where I studied the effect of temperature and nutrient concentration on the competition between free-floating and submerged macrophytes (Chapter 2 b). Free-floating macrophytes benefited from increased temperature and increased nutrient loading and limited the chances for the submerged macrophyte to benefit from these conditions. Only with high initial cover (90 %) and a low nutrient concentration submerged macrophytes were able to limit free-floating macrophyte growth (with 10 % initial cover). Only in this situation submerged macrophytes could benefit from increased temperatures. At a higher initial cover of free-floating macrophytes (50 % or 90 %) submerged macrophytes did not grow better with the increased temperatures. I further showed that 30 % cover of free-floating macrophytes resulted in 74 % light reduction below the mat. In mesocosms with OTCs and fully covered with free-floating macrophytes, the temperature increased only above and within the floating mat, while below the mat the temperature remained unchanged. Under a dense mat of free-floating macrophytes oxygen is often scarce and nitrification may be hampered, leading to higher reduced nitrogen (NHx) concentrations. In a laboratory experiment the interactive effects of a high concentration of NHx with temperature, pH and light on submerged macrophytes were examined (Chapter 3). Results demonstrated that a high NHx concentration and higher temperature together with a low pH and low light conditions caused the strongest toxic effects on relative growth rate and leaf tissue fitness of Elodea canadensis. The negative effect of low pH seemed counterintuitive. However, the specialized bicarbonate-concentrating pathway at high pH of the this plant species resulted in higher carbon availability for detoxification. This is because this pathway lacks photorespiration and minimizes carbon loss at high temperatures. At low pH, higher temperatures also lead to increased photorespiration rates and thus lower detoxification capacity. Also the process of <b>cyclosis</b> may optimize detoxification under pH 8, while this process is not very active under lower pH (as it is HCO 3 dependent). In general rising temperatures and increased reduced nitrogen levels will decrease the fitness of submerged aquatic macrophytes. The results described in the previous chapters suggested that in freshwater ecosystems a shift in dominance from submerged to free-floating macrophytes may occur with climate change due to warming and eutrophication. Analysis of an existing database provided field evidence on the impact of climate change on macrophyte cover in Dutch drainage ditches (Chapter 4). Ditches are often overlooked ecosystems with potential dominance for both free-floating and submerged macrophytes. In this study 26 years of field data on macrophyte cover were related to local weather variables and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) winter index. Mild winters (positive NAO winter index) were positively related to coverage of free-floating macrophytes and evergreen overwintering submerged macrophytes. Cold winters (negative NAO winter index) were positively related to cover of submerged macrophytes that die back in winter. The effect of climate seemed to depend on the over-wintering strategy of the macrophyte species present. It also appeared that ditches on organic soils enhanced the positive relation of free-floating macrophytes with the NAO winter index. In these ditches an increased decomposition of organic matter and increased run-off resulted in increased nutrient loading, promoting free-floating macrophyte growth (as seen in previous chapters). Previous chapters gave insight in the competition between free-floating and submerged macrophytes in shallow freshwater ecosystem and how climate change might affect this. In Chapter 5 an ecosystem management approach was applied on the illustrative example of socio-economic and ecological problems caused by free-floating macrophytes. Adequate ecosystem management must be based on a dynamic balance of scientific knowledge development, societal acceptance and feedback, and practical implementation. In the synthesis (Chapter 6) the findings from this research on the competition with and without climate change have been integrated. Also a model is presented that describes the local warming effect that free-floating macrophytes can have. The synthesis provides insight into the competition between free-floating and submerged macrophytes and how one could deal with expected problems.  ...|$|E
