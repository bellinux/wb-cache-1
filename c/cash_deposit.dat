25|$|The {{concert was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} held at San Jose State University's practice field, as there had recently been a three-day outdoor free festival there with 52 bands and 80,000 attendees. Dirt Cheap Productions was asked to help secure the property again for the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to play a free concert. The Stones and the Dead were told the city of San Jose was not in the mood for another large concert and the grounds were out of bounds. Golden Gate Park in San Francisco was next on the list. However, a previously scheduled Chicago Bears–San Francisco 49ers football game at Kezar Stadium, located in Golden Gate Park, made that venue impractical, and permits were never issued for the concert. The venue was then changed to the Sears Point Raceway. However, a dispute with Sears Point's owner, Filmways, Inc., arose over a $300,000 up-front <b>cash</b> <b>deposit</b> from the Rolling Stones and film distribution rights, so the festival was moved once again. The Altamont Raceway was chosen at the suggestion of its then-owner, local businessman Dick Carter. The concert was to take place on Saturday, December 6; the location was switched on the night of Thursday, December 4.|$|E

2500|$|Insurance {{is just a}} risk {{transfer}} mechanism wherein the financial burden which may arise due to some fortuitous event is transferred to a bigger entity called an Insurance Company by way of paying premiums.

[...] The insurance company understands the risk involved and will perform a risk assessment when writing the policy. [...] As a result, the premiums may go up if they determine that the policyholder will file a claim.

5000|$|The {{government}} can seize money {{directly from a}} bank account. One way this happens is when there are large numbers of <b>cash</b> <b>deposits</b> which government investigators suspect are done {{as a way to}} avoid deposits which exceed $10,000, since deposits greater than that amount must be reported to the federal government.
