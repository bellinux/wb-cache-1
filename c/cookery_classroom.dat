50|$|The school's present {{site has}} {{expanded}} continuously since its establishment. It began in 1889 as a building {{known as the}} 'Schoolhouse', a Dining Hall (now the School's Library), the Headmaster's Office (part of the present-day Reception) and the School Hall. The large present-day complex was not established until 1930, as can be determined by a close inspection at the top (or bottom) of the complex's drains. In the late 1980s the local building company Hunting Gate built a new building onto the main School complex that held a new I.T. suite for graphics lessons, a small <b>cookery</b> <b>classroom</b> (for the Food Technology GCSE) and a large Music classroom, {{as well as several}} smaller practice rooms for individual student lessons.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the course}} of summer 2013, further {{development}} included a new multi-purpose activity hall, refurbished conference hall, new <b>cookery</b> <b>classrooms</b> and refurbished changing rooms. During the summer of 2012, an outdoor classroom was built {{as part of the}} art department on land previously occupied by music rooms. The landscaped area is used by the department for observational work and the displaying of 3-d pieces. It came into use in September 2012.|$|R
50|$|The {{new school}} {{was built on}} land which was {{formerly}} part of the northern common in Subiaco. The land was set aside for education purposes. The site, of over 4 hectares (10 acres) in area, was located between Roberts and Mueller Roads, west of Thomas Street in Subiaco. On 30 July 1909, S B Alexander was awarded the building contract for £11,637. The contract for the west building and main hall specified eight classrooms, art room, library, chemistry and physics laboratories, lecture rooms, as well as <b>cookery</b> and laundry <b>classrooms.</b> These facilities were grouped around the 27.4m by 14.3m (90 ft by 47 ft) central hall. The building was designed by Hillson Beasley, Principal Architect of the Public Works Department, Western Australia. By 1911 the building was completed for the sum of £18,974.|$|R
