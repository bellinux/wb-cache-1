5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>status</b> is requested by the town council. A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town status, or the minister is of the opinion that the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili {{says that}} the Security Council manifestly lacks the {{competence}} to validate agreements imposed through coercion, not least because the peremptory prohibition {{of the use of}} force is a limitation on the Council’s powers and the voidness of coercively imposed treaties is the clear consequence of jus cogens and the conventional law as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. A recent South African study concluded that the ultimate status and boundaries will require negotiation between the parties, according to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The same study also found that the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention which govern ‘special agreements’ that can adversely affect the rights of protected persons precludes any <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>status</b> of the territory obtained through an agreement concluded during a state of belligerent occupation.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a hearing}} on 7 and 8 September 2016, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) panel found that Sharapova had a reduced {{perception}} of the risk that she took while using Mildronate, because (a) she had used Mildronate for around ten years without any anti-doping issue, (b) she had consulted the Russian doctor who prescribed the Mildronate for medical reasons, not to enhance her performance, and (c) she had received no specific warning about the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>status</b> of meldonium from WADA, the ITF, or the WTA. However, the CAS panel also noted Sharapova’s failure to disclose her use of meldonium on her doping control forms {{and that she was}} at fault for (a) failing to give her agent adequate instructions as to how to carry out the important task of checking the Prohibited List, and (b) failing to supervise and control the actions of her agent in carrying out that task (specifically the lack of any procedure for reporting or follow-up verification to make sure that her agent had actually discharged his duty).|$|E
25|$|Having been annexed from Spain in 1898, the unincorporated {{territory}} of Puerto Rico represented a paradox during the Cold War, politically {{belonging to the}} United States but culturally to Latin America. Its location in the Caribbean converted it in the American response to Cuba, directly affecting the development of its political status. Puerto Rico was allowed to enact a heavily revised local Constitution, but its attempts to employ its sovereignty {{and use it to}} remove the application of the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution ended in failure. The United States military {{played a key role in}} perpetuating the status quo, not wanting to risk the possibility that a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>status</b> could affect their presence in the Caribbean. A situation further complicated by the emergence of Marxist guerrillas, including the notorious Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña and Boricua Popular Army, within the pre-existing independence movement in Puerto Rico.

500|$|Before the CITES {{conference at}} which a vote would be taken on the proposal, support for the {{proposed}} <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>status</b> appeared to be limited {{because of the small}} amount of reported legal trade.

From early to mid-June, the 14th CITES Conference of the Parties (CITES COP-14) was held in The Hague, Netherlands. On 8June, Cambodia presented the proposal along with their rationale. Indonesia followed by announcing their support, along with Japan, India, Laos, Thailand, the United States, the European Union, Qatar, and many non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Although the proposal was adopted by consensus, some conservation groups objected on the grounds that rational analysis was being usurped by sentiment.|$|E
