40|$|In recent years, many {{countries}} have undertaken reforms of their governmental accounting and financial reporting systems, at central level {{as well as}} at local level, in order to meet transparency, accountability and comparison needs. Furthermore, the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board issued the first set of accounting standards specifically dedicated to the public sector; but the adoption of these standards is not compulsory, so not all public sector reforms are based on them.
