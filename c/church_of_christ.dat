50|$|The Restoration Movement {{has since}} divided into {{multiple}} separate groups. There are three main branches in the US: the <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> the Christian <b>churches</b> and <b>churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> and the Christian <b>Church</b> (Disciples <b>of</b> <b>Christ).</b> Other U.S. based groups {{affiliated with the}} movement are the International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and the International Christian Churches. Non-U.S. groups include the <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in Australia, the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada, the <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> in Europe.

5000|$|With the {{resignation}} of McKean, some efforts are being made at reconciliation between the International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and the mainstream <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> In March 2004, Abilene Christian University held the [...] "Faithful Conversations" [...] dialog between members <b>of</b> the <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> Those involved were able to apologize and initiate an environment conducive to building bridges.

Despite improvements in relations, there are still fundamental differences within the fellowship. Early 2005 saw a second set of dialogs with greater promise for both sides helping one another.

Both churches were built as memorial churches for Ripon's brother-in-law, Frederick Grantham Vyner, who was murdered by Greek bandits in 1870. Vyner's mother commissioned the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> the Consoler and his sister St Mary's. Both begun in 1870, Skelton was consecrated in 1876 and Studley Royal in 1878.|$|E

5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure.

They believe that the New Testament demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ)</b> and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E

This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E

His architectural output was small but varied. Working with a long-standing team of craftsmen, he built churches, a cathedral, a warehouse, a university, a school, houses and castles. Burges's most notable works are Cardiff Castle, constructed between 1866 and 1928, and Castell Coch (1872–91), both of which were built for John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. Other significant buildings include Gayhurst House, Buckinghamshire (1858–65), Knightshayes Court (1867–74), the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> the Consoler (1870–76), St Mary's, Studley Royal (1870–78), in Yorkshire, and Park House, Cardiff (1871–80).|$|E

5|$|Justinian's Chalke was a {{rectangular}} building, with four engaged piers supporting a central dome on pendentives, {{which in turn}} rested on four barrel arches in the typical Byzantine fashion.

The central structure was adjoined by two smaller chambers on either side to the south and north, each again featuring a vaulted roof. The relation of the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> Chalkites with the gate is unclear; Cyril Mango suggested that it was located to its left, but it has also been proposed that it was actually built atop the gatehouse itself.
