50|$|Cultural transmission, {{also known}} as {{cultural}} learning, is the process and method of passing on socially learned information. Within a species, cultural transmission is greatly influenced by how adults socialize {{with each other and}} with their young. Differences in cultural transmission across species have been thought to be largely affected by external factors, such as the physical environment, that may lead an individual to interpret a traditional concept in a novel way. The environmental stimuli that contribute to this variance can include <b>climate,</b> <b>migration</b> patterns, conflict, suitability for survival, and endemic pathogens. Cultural transmission is hypothesized to be a critical process for maintaining behavioral characteristics in both humans and nonhuman animals over time, and its existence relies on innovation, imitation, and communication to create and propagate various aspects of animal behavior seen today.|$|E

We review the existing literature surrounding this issue and break the problem into two components: the links between <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration,</b> and those between migration and conflict. We found a large range of views regarding the importance of climate change as a driver for increasing rates of migration and subsequently of conflict.

In the past decade, there has been growing attention to the populations displaced by floods, storm surges, droughts, and other environmental hazards which will be exacerbated by climate change. Increased concerns about the impacts of global climate and environmental change on human mobility have fueled strong media and academic interest in <b>climate</b> induced <b>migration.</b> <b>Climate</b> Refugees stands out among the many publications on <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration</b> in recent years. 1 With vivid photographs and well-written narratives, it presents a striking picture of human displacement and migration resulting from climate-related disasters.

Although such an impasse relates to the unprecedented socioecological processes involved, we argue that many of the challenges posed by climate-induced migration are not unique in the history of global environmental governance. Proceeding from this, we compare <b>climate</b> <b>migration</b> with the issue of desertification. Drawing upon the concept of environmental myth developed in Political Ecology, we identify common themes such as scientism, vagueness, and ambiguities in the definitions, and a tendency to envision one-fits-all solutions that overlook the multiscalar phenomena involved. We discuss how these traits have contributed to the failure of the desertification regime. Consequently, we propose that <b>climate</b> <b>migration</b> debates should move beyond such deficiencies, to avoid the consolidation of policy responses reproducing the same problems that have characterized the regime on desertification...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} article covers the broader issues of climate-related migration {{and provides a}} legal analysis of <b>climate</b> <b>migration.</b> Although much of the discussion around climate change has focused on how its effects can be reduced, it is now generally accepted that climate change will have widespread impacts and that people {{must be ready to}} adapt to those impacts. One of the ways people are likely to adapt is by migrating, and {{in spite of the fact}} that this has become one of the most widely discussed areas of adaptation, there is, as yet, no solid grasp of its potential scope. Predictions range from 200 or 250 million to possibly a billion people moving by the middle of the 21 st century to escape climate change impacts such as sea level rise, drought and desertification, and greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Regions expected to produce the most climate migrants include Africa, heavily populated Asian mega delta areas, and small island nations. People may also move from Mexico to the United States as a result of climate change (Feng). Climate change is expected to cause widespread displacement among human populations, and several proposals have been put forward as possible responses to this problem.

40|$|This study {{engages with}} the Republic of Kiribati {{placed in the}} Pacific Ocean, which is said to {{disappear}} due to rising sea levels and climate change within 30 years. The starting point of the study contemplates the terminology of a person displaced as diffuse. Thus, we ask how <b>climate</b> <b>migration</b> is discursively constructed by the three actors Anote Tong, Pelenise Alofa and John Key, and further how this relates to power relations, and the way meaning is ascribed to climate change, responsibility and national identity. To examine this, a discursive multiperspectival approach is chosen, including non-discursive theoretical perspectives on the topic, in which the discourses will be analyzed and discussed. The empirical data to be {{examined in this study}} exemplifies different power positions and aligning articulations. Through the themes it is highlighted how the chosen actors ascribe meaning to the notion of <b>climate</b> <b>migration.</b> Approaching climate change from a field of study in humanities, are enables to account for cultural, social and political consequences of the discourses on <b>climate</b> <b>migration.</b> The study concludes that there is an antagonistic battle between the discourses, which ascribe meaning to climate change either as a present or a future issue, which contemplates how climate change is a fluid concept. It is suggested that climate change is a human rights issue, {{at the same time as}} it problematizes how the existing categories and legal frameworks are insufficient. Identity is constructed through the signifiers of cultural rootedness and Christian belief, which ascribe meaning to the I-Kiribatian national identity. Migration as a solution is problematized, as it entails a loss of identity and therefore when planning migration as an adaptation strategy it is important to account for the many appertaining complexities. The international community is constructed as a failed myth and the responsibility towards Kiribati’s challenges due to climate change is placed upon industries and nation-state leaders. It is argued that more than a legal framework is needed to encounter the urgency of Kiribati’s disappearance, thus the idea of Nation-Ex Situ is applied. Furthermore, it is suggested that we should look beyond borders and that nation-states should look beyond national interests to pursue a more meaningful and rational global system, as the division of nation-states and borders fixates the lack of action towards <b>climate</b> <b>migration</b> and enforces the unequal power relations...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{recent reports}} by {{non-governmental}} organisations (NGOs), academics and international organisations {{have focused on}} so-called ‘climate refugees'. This article examines the turn from a discourse of ‘climate refugees', in which organisations perceive migration as a failure of both mitigation and adaptation to climate change, to one of ‘climate migration', in which organisations promote migration as a strategy of adaptation. Its focus is the promotion of <b>climate</b> <b>migration</b> management, and it explores the trend of these discourses through two sections. First, it provides an empirical account of the two discourses, emphasising the differentiation between them. It then focuses on the discourse of <b>climate</b> <b>migration,</b> its origins, extent and content, and the associated practices of ‘migration management'. The second part argues that the turn to the promotion of ‘climate migration' should {{be understood as a}} way to manage the insecurity created by climate change. However, international organisations enacts this management within the forms of neoliberal capitalism, including the framework of governance.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{makes the}} case for the concept of {{territorial}} networks as a heuristic tool for the analysis of the complex dynamics of the <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration</b> nexus in the South Pacific. In 2005, The UN designated inhabitants of the Carteret Islands (Papua New Guinea) and Tegua (Vanuatu) as the world's first climate refugees. Both the IOM (2008) and the ADB (2011) acknowledged that this announcement illustrates the worldwide search for "Climate canaries" that began after the IPCC's first report listed forced migration {{as one of the most}} significant potential consequences of climate change. In this context, the South Pacific is considered a "hotspot" for such population flows. Widespread characterisations of the <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration</b> nexus in the region picture current or imminent linear flows of refugees collectively fleeing isolated islands and crossing oceanic boundaries in search for higher lands and more developed countries to relocate as the single possible response to land submersion. However, my literature reviews on and field research conducted in the Pacific since 2007 (About 120 qualitative interviews and archive research in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tuvalu and French Polynesia) show the need for a critical analysis of such a simplistic depiction of the relationship between climate changes and human mobility. Defining the <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration</b> nexus as a paradigm embedded in the dynamics of territorial networks - i. e. interactions between places and people - can help achieving this goal by allowing a systemic and multi-scalar approach. First, analysing territorial networks provides an understanding of the regional context in which the climate and mobility nexus develops. One the one hand, field investigations in Funafuti (Tuvalu) and among Tuvaluan migrants in Fiji and New Zealand show that environmental constraints integrate into a broader set of pre-existing factors of mobility. Thus, <b>climate</b> <b>migrations</b> need to be assessed through a multi-scalar analysis of current networks structuring mobilities. On the other hand, the specificity of climate-induced migrations lies in the anticipated nature of environmental changes that requires people to factor prospective information from various global, regional and local sources. Hence, studying <b>climate</b> <b>migrations</b> also requires an analysis of the dynamics of information circulation in the South Pacific. Second, discourses on <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration</b> reveal and may influence the dynamics of continuities and ruptures that structure territorial networks in the South Pacific. The case of the relations between Australia, Kiribati and Tuvalu concerning <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration</b> illustrates the complex dynamics of the North / South divide in the region. But beyond this highly publicised case, examples involving the atoll of Napuka and the Marquesas archipelago (French Polynesia) and the island of Kioa (Tuvalu / Fiji) show that local mobilities within islands, archipelagos or between island states as alternative solutions to relocating populations to capital cities, Australia or New Zealand can be analysed either as forms of inter-island continuities and complementarities and or as sources of conflict due to the crossing of cultural, social, political, administrative or economic boundaries. Finally, studying the <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration</b> nexus in the context of territorial networks in the South Pacific allows an analysis of hierarchies and inequalities between actors and places. The degree of international visibility of any particular space or group with regard to the "climate exodus issue" tends to alter the dynamics of resource allocation within the network and creates new forms of inequality as it is the case with the emphasis on low-lying coastal areas over highlands or with migrants over non-migrants in the Pacific...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to present}} a {{critical}} review of some literature on <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration</b> through conceptualizing and contextualizing the linkages between the two topics. Much literature on links between <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration</b> tends to downplay ambiguities in the terms and the limited empirical evidence. Conceptualizing refers to the knowledge gaps {{and the need to}} understand and detail (even if not agreeing on) conceptual issues such as terminology, definitions, linkages, drivers, thresholds, implications, data requirements and methodologies. Contextualizing refers to understanding the <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration</b> debate within wider topical and geographical contexts. Results identify major qualitative and quantitative gaps. Qualitatively, limited material exists on why people react differently to similar environmental stressors and why certain outcomes may arise. Quantitatively, credible and verifiable measures are not always available for assessing the climate change impacts on migration. This paper recommends a stratified, multi-disciplinary approach to facilitate policies regarding <b>climate</b> change and <b>migration</b> connections. Design/methodology/approach – Illustrative literature review, clustering important themes found in published research and policy documents. First, qualitative aspects are covered, particularly in terms of definitions and terminology. Second, quantitative aspects are detailed, particularly in terms of data available and estimates made.

40|$|Urban land {{dynamics}} {{has always}} been influenced by rural-urban migration. Such internal migration processes have been induced by economic pull, social push or environmental degradation. For {{the last few decades}} a variety of climatic hazards have introduced a new form of migration called <b>climate</b> <b>migration</b> or displacement. Displaced communities have been forced to migrate and it has a direct impact the livelihood of those migrants and the land-use dynamics of destination. The low-lying delta region of Bangladesh is highly prone to natural disasters and such climatic actions change the population dynamics and its distribution. In the last few decades frequent floods, cyclones, drought and river erosion have exerted dramatic impacts on coastal settlements and livelihood. In 1991, 137, 000 people were killed when cyclone and storm surge swept over the coastal zones. Most recently cyclone SIDR hit the south coastal region leaving 4234 people dead and destroyed 564, 000 homes that resulted in 885, 280 people homeless. Every year low-lying coastal areas are affected by, on average, six tropical cyclones accompanied by 5 to 6 m high tidal surge killing thousands of people and causing extensive damage to houses and infrastructures and millions become homeless and displaced from their land. Those displaced communities are forced to migrate to other places and in most cases to the nearest urban areas for alternative livelihood. They often settle at the urban fringe, on vacant lands beside rail lines and highways and squat around the city, thus changing the land dynamics of the city.

Site C threatens to flood traditional fishing spots and traplines of Indigenous peoples {{in the name of}} the ‘green energy’ economy. We consider how people displaced by renewable energy projects justified as climate mitigation policies might constitute a different kind of ‘climate refugee’ in that they are ‘displaced without moving’ – the connections between the land and the people are severed to the extent that what is lost is the ability of the people to sustain themselves in a place. We demonstrate that the focus on ‘security’ and ‘risk’ in dominant approaches to the phenomenon of <b>climate</b> <b>migration</b> within the international regimes of human rights and climate governance produces contemporary commitments to ‘migration management’ and a prescription for ‘planned relocations’ that employ an abstract conception of the ‘climate migrant’.

Its abstract, universalist conceptions of land, labour and livelihoods deny the possibility of people 2 ̆ 7 s meaningful relations with specific places and obscure the actual ‘loss and damage’ that transpires when real, material and ecological relations that ground people 2 ̆ 7 s connections with land are severed.
