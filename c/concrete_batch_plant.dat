5000|$|In 2001, {{the zoning}} {{commission}} and the town's trustees approved {{the construction of}} a <b>concrete</b> <b>batch</b> <b>plant.</b> Heemeyer appealed the decisions unsuccessfully. For many years, Heemeyer had used the adjacent property {{as a way to get}} to his muffler shop. The plan for the concrete plant blocked that access. In addition to the frustration engendered by this dispute over access, Heemeyer was fined $2,500 by the Granby government for various violations, including [...] "junk cars on the property and not being hooked up to the sewer line".|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Heemeyer bought 2 acre of {{land from}} the Resolution Trust Corporation, the federal agency {{organized}} to handle the assets of failed savings and loan institutions. He bought the land for $42,000 to build a muffler shop and subsequently agreed to sell the land to Mountain Park Concrete to build a <b>concrete</b> <b>batch</b> <b>plant.</b> The agreed price was $250,000 but, according to Susan Docheff, Heemeyer {{changed his mind and}} increased the price to $375,000 and later demanded a deal worth approximately $1 million.

In March 2012, Salini awarded the Italian firm Tratos Cavi SPA a contract to supply low- and high-voltage cable for the dam. Alstom will provide the eight 375 MW Francis turbines for the project's first phase, {{at a cost of}} €250 million. As of April 2013, nearly 32 percent of the project is complete. Site excavation and some concrete placement is underway. One <b>concrete</b> <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> has been completed with another under construction. Diversion of the Blue Nile was completed on 28 May 2013 and marked by a ceremony the same day.

50|$|Modern <b>concrete</b> <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> (both Wet mix and Dry mix) employ {{computer}} aided {{control to}} assist in fast and accurate measurement of input constituents or ingredients. With concrete performance so dependent on accurate water measurement, systems often use digital scales for cementitious materials and aggregates, and moisture probes to measure aggregate water content as it enters the aggregate batcher to automatically compensate for the mix design water/cement ratio target. Many producers find moisture probes work well only in sand, and with marginal results on larger sized aggregate.|$|R
5000|$|Defenders of Heemeyer {{contended that}} he made a point of not hurting anybody during his {{bulldozer}} rampage; Ian Daugherty, a bakery owner, said Heemeyer [...] "went out of his way" [...] not to harm anyone. Others offered different views. The sheriff's department argues that the fact that no one was injured was not due to good intent as much as it must have been due to luck. Heemeyer had installed two rifles in firing ports {{on the inside of the}} bulldozer, and fired 15 bullets from his rifle at power transformers and propane tanks. [...] "Had these tanks ruptured and exploded, anyone within one-half mile (800 m) of the explosion could have been endangered", the sheriff's department said; within such a range were 12 police officers and residents of a senior citizens complex. The sheriff's department also asserted Heemeyer fired many bullets from his semi-automatic rifle at Cody Docheff when Docheff tried to stop the assault on his <b>concrete</b> <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> by using a loader, which was pushed aside by Heemeyer's bulldozer. Later, Heemeyer fired on two state patrol officers before they had fired at him. The sheriff's department also notes that 11 of the 13 buildings Heemeyer bulldozed were occupied until moments before their destruction. At the town library, for example, a children's program was in progress when the incident began. There might have been casualties if local emergency response had not worked effectively.|$|E
40|$|Current {{research}} {{focuses on}} assessing productivity, cost, and delays for <b>concrete</b> <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> (CBP) operations using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology. Data were collected to assess cycle time, delays, cost of delays, cost of delivery, productivity, and price/m 3 for the CBP. Two ANN models were designated to represent the CBP process considering many CBP variables. Input variables include delivery distance, concrete type, and truck mixer's load. Output variables include the assessment of cycle time, cost of delays, delivery cost, productivity, and price/m 3. The ANN outputs have been validated to show the ANN's robustness in assessing the CBP output variables. The average validity percent for the ANN outputs is 96. 25 %. A Time-Quantity (TQ) chart is developed to assess the time required for both truck mixers and the CBP to produce a specified quantity of concrete.

The survey was conducted in order to evaluate potential impacts of the overall project. This project includes the construction of a haul road, <b>concrete</b> <b>batch</b> <b>plant,</b> wet soil storage area and dry soil storage area. The environmental surveys were conducted by natural resource experts at ORNL who routinely assess the significance of various project activities on the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR). Natural resource staff assistance on this project included the collection of environmental information that can aid in project location decisions that minimize impacts to sensitive resource such as significant wildlife populations, rare plants and wetlands. Natural resources work was conducted in various habitats, corresponding to the proposed areas of impact. Thc credentials/qualifications of the researchers are contained in Appendix A. The proposed haul road traverses a number of different habitats including a power-line right-of-way. wetlands, streams, forest and mowed areas. It extends from {{what is known as the}} New Salvage Yard on the west to the Polaris Parking Lot on the east. This haul road is meant to connect the proposed <b>concrete</b> <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> to the UPF building site.

5000|$|A {{concrete}} plant, {{also known}} as a <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> or <b>batching</b> <b>plant</b> or a <b>concrete</b> <b>batching</b> <b>plant,</b> is equipment that combines various ingredients to form concrete. Some of these inputs include water, air, admixtures, sand, aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.), fly ash, silica fume, slag, and cement. There are two main types of concrete plants: Dry mix plants and Wet mix plants, and also plants that contain both a transit mix side and a central mix side while utilizing common material storage points. A concrete plant can have a variety of parts and accessories, including: mixers (either tilt drum or horizontal or in some cases both), cement batchers, aggregate batchers, conveyors, radial stackers, aggregate bins, cement bins, heaters, chillers, cement silos, <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> controls, and dust collectors.|$|R

40|$|The {{decision-making}} {{process is a}} very essential part of any construction operation. Simulation {{can be used as}} a tool to assist construction managers in making informed decisions. IN this paper, simulation is applied to a <b>Concrete</b> <b>Batch</b> <b>Plant</b> to analyze alternative solutions and resource management.

Based on sensitivity analysis, management tools are constructed to help the decision-maker. These tools are a Time-Cost-Quantity chart, a feasible region analysis and a contour lines chart. Time-Cost-Quantity and contour lines charts are used for deciding production time, production cost and required resources for a required distance from the plant. The feasible region chart is used for deciding the range of alternative solutions that can be taken to minimize production time and cost of the available plant resources according to the required transportation distance...|$|E
