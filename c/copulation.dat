5|$|Females in estrus are {{followed}} by males, with <b>copulation</b> initiated by the female. The female will hang from a branch and may vocalise. The male will hold the female and the branch and copulate with her. Urine-marking and vocalising are also used by the female to solicit mating. The male may create a mating plug following <b>copulation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. <b>Copulation</b> is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During <b>copulation,</b> sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E
5|$|Ditrysian: The {{remaining}} {{groups have}} an internal duct that carry sperm and form the Ditrysia, with separate openings for <b>copulation</b> and egg-laying.|$|E
40|$|Females of {{many species}} mate {{multiply}} to obtain material or genetic benefits. However, because of {{problems associated with}} estimating number of <b>copulations,</b> our understanding of female mating patterns in natural populations is very limited. We studied correlates of multiple mating over three years in populations of the viviparous common lizard, Lacerta vivipara, a species in which the number of <b>copulations</b> can be reliably inferred {{from the number of}} mating scars. Our results show that females with a high number of <b>copulations</b> had lower clutch size, but heavier offspring (controlled for a potential relationship between the two), than females with fewer <b>copulations.</b> This pattern could be driven by sexual selection, ecological, and environmental factors. More promiscuous females had lower proportion of infertile eggs, controlling for clutch size. Thus, one of the primary reasons for multiple <b>copulations</b> in natural populations of L. vivipara could be sperm limitation, or to avoid infertile males. © Koninklijke Brill NV, 2005...|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{system of}} the bronze-winged jacana leads to intense sperm competition, as female jacanas copulate with multiple males prior to laying their clutch. Before laying the clutch, the female would {{spend more time with}} the specific male that would receive the clutch (called the “receiver”). Studies have also shown that receivers gain more <b>copulations</b> than non-receivers. Since the receivers provide all of the parental care, females should, in theory, comply with male demands for <b>copulations</b> to convince them of their paternity, so they will care for the clutch. Receivers have been observed to destroy clutches in which they only had a low share of the paternity. Although females offer <b>copulations</b> to non-receiver males in order to maintain their presence in her harem, these <b>copulations</b> are less important than <b>copulations</b> to assure the receivers of their paternity. The cost of clutches being destroyed by receivers is much higher than losing males from her harem.|$|R
50|$|A {{strategy}} {{common among}} insects is for males {{to participate in}} prolonged <b>copulations.</b> By engaging in prolonged <b>copulations</b> a male has an increased opportunity to place more sperm within the female's reproductive tract and prevent the female from copulating with other males.|$|R
5|$|Female {{birds have}} sperm storage {{mechanisms}} that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after <b>copulation,</b> a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair <b>copulation</b> include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against {{the possibility of}} infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual {{behaviour}} {{has been}} observed in males or females in numerous species of birds, including <b>copulation,</b> pair-bonding, and joint parenting of chicks.|$|E
5|$|Males {{initiate}} <b>copulation</b> by mounting {{the female}} and tilting her hear back 90 degrees. The male then secures his position by biting and pulling {{back on the}} hairs {{at the base of}} the female’s skull. The male then uses his thumbs to further stabilize his position and enters the female under her interfemoral membrane. Both individuals have been noted to be very quiet during the <b>copulation</b> process. Once the process is over the male dismounts the female and flies away to find another mate.|$|E
40|$|In a fallow deer, Cervus dama, lek {{in central}} Italy, most <b>copulations</b> {{occurred}} in a few male territories {{on one side of}} the lek. Individual territories were fixed in space between years, and most maintained their relative rank in terms of numbers of <b>copulations</b> in successive years. High-ranked territories were peripheral, near paths used by females to enter the lek area. Successful territories were defended more often than territories where few or no <b>copulations</b> were seen, but their defence did not involve a greater frequency of fighting. The turnover of males on territories was unrelated to the number of <b>copulations</b> seen there. Females apper to choose mates partly on the basis of location, and thus males should compete for ownership of territories preferred by females...|$|R
25|$|Unlike in males, extra-pair <b>copulations</b> are {{advantageous}} {{for females}} because they present females with more mate choice {{as well as}} increase the genetic diversity of the community. Extra-pair <b>copulations</b> exemplify sexual conflict, {{a situation in which}} one behavior is advantageous for one sex, but disadvantageous for the other.|$|R
2500|$|The highest known {{frequency}} of reproductively successful extra-pair <b>copulations</b> are found among fairywrens ...|$|R
5|$|Ninety-five {{per cent}} of bird species are {{socially}} monogamous. These species pair {{for at least}} the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair <b>copulation</b> (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced <b>copulation</b> in ducks and other anatids.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{typically}} breed from December to April. <b>Copulation</b> lasts from 16–73 {{minutes and}} may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female {{by the neck}} with his teeth. <b>Copulation</b> is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female estrus lasts about a month per year, and true gestation lasts 61–63 days. Because the otters delay implantation for at least eight months, the interval between <b>copulation</b> and parturition can reach 10–12 months. Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the European otter, which lacks this feature. Young are born between February and April, and parturition lasts three to eight hours.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: lekking. An {{aggregation}} of male birds {{gathered to}} engage in competitive displays (known as lekking) that may entice visiting females that are assessing prospective partners for <b>copulation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, Drosophila melanogaster males release toxic seminal fluids, {{known as}} ACPs ({{accessory}} gland proteins), from their accessory glands to impede the female {{from participating in}} future <b>copulations.</b> [...] These substances act as an anti-aphrodisiac causing a dejection of subsequent <b>copulations,</b> and also stimulate ovulation and oogenesis. Seminal proteins can have a strong influence on reproduction, sufficient to manipulate female behavior and physiology.|$|R
50|$|Monandrous female D. pseudoobscura do {{not obtain}} {{sufficient}} sperm or a plenty of suitable sperm for the fertilization. Even though monandrous female experiencing multiple <b>copulations</b> can produce more eggs than polyandrous female experiencing multiple <b>copulations,</b> monandrous females produce less offspring that survive into adulthood than polyandrous females do. This means that polyandrous females have higher egg-to-adult survival ratio than monandrous females, making the polyandrous females more fit.|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} birds appear to combine sexual {{intercourse}} with apparent violent assault; these include ducks, and geese. Female white-fronted bee-eaters are subjected to forced <b>copulations.</b> When females emerge from their nest burrows, males sometimes force them {{to the ground and}} mate with them. Such forced <b>copulations</b> are made preferentially on females who are laying and who may therefore lay eggs fertilised by the male.|$|R
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old; {{production}} of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, one to three days long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. Females in oestrus show a spike in urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; limited number of observations suggest that <b>copulation,</b> that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, who rolls on the ground. Following this he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separate after <b>copulation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Butterflies of the Parnassinae (family Papilionidae) {{and some}} Acraeini (family Nymphalidae) add a post-copulatory plug, called the sphragis, to the abdomen {{of the female}} after <b>copulation</b> {{preventing}} her from mating again.|$|E
5|$|Males {{without them}} {{are known as}} unflanged males in {{contrast}} to the more developed flanged males. The transformation from unflanged to flanged can occur very quickly. Unflanged and flanged males have two different mating strategies. Flanged males attract oestrous females with their characteristic long calls. Those calls may also suppress development in younger males. Unflanged males wander widely in search of oestrous females and upon finding one, will force <b>copulation</b> on her. While both strategies are successful, females prefer to mate with flanged males and seek their company for protection against unflanged males. Resident males may form consortships with females that can last days, weeks or months after <b>copulation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many species {{once thought}} monogamous, {{including}} such birds as swans, are now known {{to engage in}} extra-pair <b>copulations.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{about four}} days {{immediately}} prior to egg-laying, when <b>copulations</b> lead to fertilizations, the male bank swallow is very busy, attentively guarding his female. Before this time, as well as after—that is, when her eggs are not ripe, and again after his genes are safely tucked away inside the shells—he goes seeking extra-pair <b>copulations</b> with the mates of other males…who, of course, are busy with defensive mate-guarding of their own.|$|R
50|$|The mating {{behavior}} of male A. manicatum {{can be determined}} by relative body size to other conspecific males. Territory owners are larger in size than wanderers, and copulate with females more frequently as well. The number of <b>copulations</b> a male territory owner can achieve varies based {{on the size of}} the territory - males with larger territories generally achieve more <b>copulations</b> than those with smaller territories. This difference may be due to the energy expenditure of smaller bees to defend their territory from larger males, the inability of small males to mate on their territory, or female choice of larger males (regardless of territory size). Hence the number of <b>copulations</b> a male obtains is positively correlated with territory quality as well as male size.|$|R
5|$|Mating {{begins with}} a courting ritual. For example, in land snails of the genus Helix, {{including}} the escargot Helix pomatia, and the common garden snail Helix aspersa (also known as Cornu aspersum and Cantareus aspersus), <b>copulation</b> is preceded by an elaborate tactile courtship.|$|E
5|$|Monotrysian: Primitive {{groups have}} a single genital {{aperture}} {{near the end of}} the abdomen through which both <b>copulation</b> and egg laying occur. This character is used to designate the Monotrysia.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of D.sayi begins with <b>copulation,</b> which {{normally}} takes place shortly after the female has moulted, while her exoskeleton is still soft. Spawning occurs within hours or days of <b>copulation,</b> and the eggs are brooded on the female's pleopods (swimmerets) until {{they are ready to}} hatch. Females have been found carrying eggs from April to October; in a study of crabs caught at Gloucester Point, Virginia in 1978, females were observed to carry between 686 and 14,735 eggs. The number of eggs increases with carapace width according to a power law; extrapolation of the power law suggests that the largest D.sayi females are capable of carrying over 32,000 eggs each.|$|E
40|$|The massive {{numbers of}} sperm males {{transfer}} during a single mating are physiologically costly {{and the amount}} of sperm that can be stored is limited. Therefore, males can perform only a finite number of successive <b>copulations</b> without loss of fertility, and males should allocate sperm prudently. We investigated sperm availability and depletion in male black scavenger flies, Sepsis cynipsea (Diptera: Sepsidae), asking whether males adjust copula duration according to nutrition, their sperm stores, their own and their partner's body size, as predicted by theory. We created a gradient of sperm limitation by restricting dung (their protein resource as adults) and subjecting males to a varying number of <b>copulations.</b> While male fertility did not depend on access to fresh dung (contrary to females), it did decline after three <b>copulations,</b> and more so when males were small. Larger females tended to lay more unfertilized eggs after copulating with previously mated males. However, copula duration was not influenced by a male's number of previous <b>copulations,</b> and therefore apparently not by his current sperm stores. Nevertheless, copula duration varied with male size, with small males copulating longer, and with female size, as <b>copulations</b> lasted longer with larger females, suggesting that males are investing more sperm in larger, more fecund females. While male copula adjustments to their own nutrition and body size may be simple (proximate) physiological responses, responses to female size indicate more strategic and sophisticated sperm-allocation strategies than previously thought...|$|R

5000|$|Cuckoldry: {{this occurs}} in many colonially {{breeding}} bird species where extra-pair <b>copulations</b> may take {{place and the}} males end up caring for unrelated offspring.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{documented}} {{cases in which}} male sea otters have forcibly copulated with juvenile harbor seals, sometimes resulting in death. Similarly, forced <b>copulation</b> by Sea Otters involving animals other than Pacific Harbor Seals has occasionally been reported.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches use pheromones {{to attract}} mates, and the males {{practice}} courtship rituals, such as posturing and stridulation. Like many insects, cockroaches mate {{facing away from}} each other with their genitalia in contact, and <b>copulation</b> can be prolonged. A few species are known to be parthenogenetic, reproducing without the need for males.|$|E
5|$|Details {{of giant}} otter {{reproduction}} and life cycle are scarce, and captive animals have provided {{much of the}} information. Females appear to give birth year round, although in the wild, births may peak during the dry season. The estrous cycle is 21 days, with females receptive to sexual advances between three and 10 days. Study of captive specimens has found only males initiate <b>copulation.</b> At Tierpark Hagenbeck in Germany, long-term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen, with <b>copulation</b> most frequently taking place in water. Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days, giving birth to one to five pups, {{with an average of}} two. Research over five years on a breeding pair at the Cali Zoo in Colombia found the average interval between litters was six to seven months, but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive. Other sources have found greater intervals, with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in the wild.|$|E
50|$|Continuous female sexual {{receptivity}} suggests {{human sexuality}} is not solely defined by reproduction; {{a large part}} of it revolves around conjugal love and communication between partners. <b>Copulations</b> between partners while the woman is pregnant or in the infertile period of her menstrual cycle do not achieve the original purpose of sex, that is, conception, but do strengthen the bond between these partners. Therefore, the increased <b>copulations</b> because of concealed ovulation are thought to {{have played a role in}} fostering pair bonds in humans.|$|R
40|$|We {{present data}} on {{patterns}} of mate-sharing collected during a seven-year study of Tasmanian Native Hens Gallinula mortierii at Maria Island, off {{the east coast}} of Tasmania, Australia. At this site, Tasmanian Native Hens lived in groups of two to 13 birds that defended all-purpose territories. Monogamy, polyandry, polygyny and polygynandry all occurred in this population each year, with polygynous and polygynandrous females laying joint clutches. When mate-sharing occurred, whether by males or females, co-breeders were usually related. Data on the numbers of <b>copulations,</b> mounts and attempted mounts exhibited by co-breeders of the same sex showed that there was a high level of variation in the degree of sharing of <b>copulations</b> among co-breeders in this population, with males generally sharing <b>copulations</b> more evenly than females. In addition, many groups contained reproductively mature one- or two-year old individuals that were not involved in sexual behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of keeping three couples in the same cage, {{and the size of}} adults emerged from small, medium-sized and large pupae (278. 67 mg; 333. 20 mg and 381. 58 mg, respectively), on the reproductive potential of S. eridania (Stoll, 1782) adults, under controlled conditions (25 ± 1 °C, 70 % RH and 14 hour photophase). We evaluated the survival, number of <b>copulations,</b> fecundity and fertility of the adult females. The survival of females from these different pupal sizes did not differ statistically, but the survival of males from large pupae was statistically shorter than from small pupae. Fecundity differed significantly and correlated positively with size. The number of effective <b>copulations</b> (espematophores) and fertility did not vary significantly with pupal size. Our results emphasize the importance of indicating the number of <b>copulations</b> {{and the size of the}} insects when reproductive parameters are compared...|$|R
