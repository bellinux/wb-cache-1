The magnitude of wall deflection is induced by the cutting force generated during the material removal process which is governed mainly from the selection of <b>cutter</b> <b>path</b> strategies. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} judge the machining performance of a different <b>cutter</b> <b>path</b> prior to actual machining. In this paper, the machining accuracy of three <b>cutter</b> <b>path</b> strategies namely waterline-step, overlapping-step and tree wise-steps for machining thin-wall component were investigated.

40|$|Five-axis milling {{machines}} {{have been used}} mostly to cut special mechanical parts, such as aircraft parts, impellers, propellers, and so on. Recently, it has started to use them in more general applications, such as the machining of sculptured surfaces in dies and molds. This is because 5 -axis machines offer better cutting efficiency and improved surface finish {{as well as the}} machinability of vertically hidden surfaces over the conventional 3 -axis machines. However, problems still exist in the 5 -axis machining of sculptured surfaces. While the additional two rotational axes offer more flexibility, {{it is not easy to}} control them properly in practice. In this research, practical methods to generate <b>cutter</b> <b>paths</b> for the 5 -axis machining of compound surfaces are developed. A compound surface is a part surface model that consists of multiple elements. Free-form objects are often designed by compound surfaces. The research is focused on the following three major issues: (1) Setup-orientation determination in 5 -axis machining, (2) Cutter-path generation for 5 -axis side milling, and (3) Cutter-path generation for 5 -axis face milling. A compound surface is first checked if it can be cut by the target 5 -axis machine. The feasible setup orientation of the surface is also determined. <b>Cutter</b> <b>paths</b> are then generated. The cutter-surface interference is avoided during the cutter-path generation. By developing methods for cutting both the vertical and horizontal compound surfaces, most of the applications of 5 -axis sculptured surface machining are covered.

40|$|High speed high {{accuracy}} machining holds the dominant position in modern manufacturing industry. Seeking a direct approach {{to increase the}} productivity and speedup the operation {{becomes more and more}} stringent. In this thesis, research is focused on real-time parametric curve interpolator in the motion control systems. A common requirement of all motion control systems is to generate coordinated movement of the separately driven axes of motion in order to achieve the desired path of the tool. This involves the generation of signals prescribing the shape of the produced part by interpolators. In the conventional interpolation method, the part geometric data is decomposed by the CAD/CAM system into a sequence of straight lines and circular arcs that approximate the desired geometric path with a given tolerance. However, the requirements of high speed {{high accuracy}} machining of dies, molds, and aerospace parts with sculptured surfaces cannot be fulfilled by the traditional interpolator. Parametric interpolator fills the gap between the well-developed CAD/CAM softwares and conventional CNC systems in terms of the methods available for defining geometry. In contrast to the traditional method, parametric interpolators can deal with the parametric curves transferred substantially from CAD/CAM system. Therefore, the drawbacks mentioned above could be subsequently eliminated. Before the trajectory generation part in the interpolator, we first establish a <b>cutter</b> <b>path</b> planning module which can approximate the original successive fine line segments to piecewise parametric curve within the pre-defined tolerance requirement. The second order continuity is fulfilled to guarantee the smoothness of the generated <b>cutter</b> <b>path.</b> In the trajectory generation we focus on {{the development and implementation of}} the speed-controlled parametric interpolator, especially the NURBS curve parametric interpolator, with the scheduling of jerk, acceleration/deceleration, and vector feed speed control along the tool paths incorporated. The integration of machining dynamics and the computational simplicity is taken into consideration.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient algorithm for generating <b>cutter</b> <b>paths</b> for the NC milling of arbitrary pockets with multiple islands. In this algorithm, the pocket border and island profiles {{are made up}} of concave or convex segments comprising linear and circular arc elements. For the generation of NC tool paths, the algorithm is divided into four stages, namely, profile pre-processing stage, offset calculation, determination of the termination condition, and determination of the path sequence. Compared with the other pocketing algorithms, the main aspect of this work is that the pocket border and island profiles are pre-processed in the first stage of the algorithm. Making use of contour bridges in the profile pre-processing stage, the island profiles are connected to the pocket border profile to form a closed path. This then simplifies the calculations in cutter offsets and eliminates the problem of nesting which occurs in some other pocketing algorithms. © 1996 Springer-Verlag London Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and validation of interactive computer software that aids the design procedures for cam mechanism design, thereby facilitating the optimised design of the mechanism. Attention is focussed on the disc cam-translating roller follower mechanism with respect to which a series of analytical programs have been developed which addresses the design of the complete mechanism. This broad view of the mechanism design as opposed to concentrating on specific features thereof as has hitherto been the case, has been a major objective of the work reported in this thesis. Each analytical program shows the means adopted to satisfy the limiting conditions imposed by kinematic constraints and strength limitations encountered in cam design. The software enables the establishment of the design specification for the manufacture of the cam itself along with as much data on the other features of the mechanism (i. e. the spring, follower, and roller on follower) as project time could permit. A typical run of the software is shown, with the results presented in graphical as well as tabular format. This includes a graphical layout of the cam profile, the roller profile on the cam, and the roller and <b>cutter</b> <b>paths</b> around the cam profile.

40|$|Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) {{refers to}} a class of rapid {{manufacturing}} process that builds parts by incremental material deposition and fusion of thin 2 - 1 / 2 dimensional layers. Over this past decade, SFF has taken the manufacturing industry to new heights. However, parts produced by SFF processes exhibit a stair-step surface texture due {{to the presence of}} 2 - 1 / 2 dimensional layers and exhibit limited material properties. These issues are addressed by a modified SFF process called Shape Deposition Manufacturing. Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) is a novel layered manufacturing process in which multi-material structures with embedded components can be fabricated. In SDM, the layers are truly three dimensional in nature and are built using a combination of material addition and material removal processes. The need for an automated and robust process planner is more in the case of SDM as it attempts to build fully functional parts directly from CAD models. This thesis focuses on the process planning issues in Shape Deposition Manufacturing. The major issues in process planning for SDM involves the generation of 3 -D layers and generation of deposition and CNC <b>cutter</b> <b>paths</b> for these 3 -D layers. In SDM, the CAD model is decomposed into 3 -D layers of varying thickness based upon both geometric and material criteria. The layers are further decomposed into manufacturable volumes called compacts. Silhouette edges and silhouette loops are identified to help the decomposition of models into 3 -D layers and compacts. Unlike techniques used in existing SFF methods which divide models into equally spaced slices, the present algorithm decomposes models into compacts which are iv not necessarily planar and equally spaced.

For a cylindrical cam, the roller follower operates in a groove cut {{on the periphery of}} an end mill with the diameter same as the roller.

The manufacture of cylindrical cams is complicate and precise work that depends on the generating method and types of machine tools employed.
