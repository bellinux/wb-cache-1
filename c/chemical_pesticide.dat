25|$|The hairy rove beetle is {{considered}} beneficial {{in the environment}} {{because it is a}} successful scavenger and predator. However, infestation of houses has been reported by this beetle. A reason why C. maxillosus infests houses is not known for certain, but a study of rearing this beetle in the laboratory has shown that adults like to lay eggs in fresh sand and not sand that is old or contaminated. To solve the problem of infestation certain pesticides have been found to affect the adults and larvae of this beetle and can be used to control their numbers. Atroban, a <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticide</b> composed of permethrin (0.05%), decreases the number of adults and larvae of the family Staphylinidae. Short term reductions of this family were caused by a chemical named demethoate (0.05%). Both of these pesticides were tested on moist spots on poultry dung.|$|E
25|$|Farmers have widely adopted GM technology. Between 1996 and 2015, {{the total}} surface area of land {{cultivated}} with GM crops increased {{by a factor of}} 100, from 17,000km2 (4.2 million acres) to 1,797,000km2 (444 million acres). 10% of the world's arable land was planted with GM crops in 2010. In the US, by 2014, 94% of the planted area of soybeans, 96% of cotton and 93% of corn were genetically modified varieties. Use of GM crops expanded rapidly in developing countries, with about 18 million farmers growing 54% of worldwide GM crops by 2013. A 2014 meta-analysis concluded that GM technology adoption had reduced <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticide</b> use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%. This reduction in pesticide use has been ecologically beneficial, but benefits may be reduced by overuse. Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for insect-resistant crops than for herbicide-tolerant crops. Yield and profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries.|$|E

40|$|As {{reflected}} in sales reports, {{millions of people}} are using <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticides</b> to solve a number of problems. Estimated total cost of <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticides</b> to all United States users in 1965 was more than a billion dollars. Farmers used pesticides costing an estimated $ 590 million- 58 percent of the total. Residential (home, lawn, and garden) purchases amounted to about $ 220 million or about 22 percent of the total. The remaining purchases were made by industrial, institutional, and governmental sources. The use of <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticides</b> is expected to increase in the following year. The use of <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticides</b> has not, however, been accepted by everyone. Concern has been voiced about possible consequences of improper use of these chemicals to the user as well as to wildlife, pets and agricultural commodities. This concern has been expressed in proposals to limit or abolish the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticides.</b> The subject is controversial, but there have been few valid data on which to base rational discussion.

50|$|In 1987 {{the main}} method of weed and insect control {{continued}} to be labor-intensive cultivation.

Production and use of chemical herbicides and pesticides increased rapidly from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s, but output fell subsequently by more than half (to about 200,000 tons) because the products were relatively ineffective, expensive, and highly toxic. <b>Chemical</b> <b>pesticide</b> use, therefore, was low compared with use in other countries.|$|E

50|$|Pesticides destroy, repel or {{mitigate}} pests (an organism that attacks or {{competes with}} a crop). A 2014 meta-analysis covering 147 original studies of farm surveys and field trials, and 15 studies from the researchers conducting the study, concluded that adoption of GM technology had reduced <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticide</b> use by 37%, with the effect larger for insect-tolerant crops than herbicide-tolerant crops. In August 2015, protests occurred in Hawaii over {{the possibility that}} birth defects were being caused by the heavy use of pesticides on new strains of GM crops being developed there.

Realizing such serious problems the Indonesian government waived subsidy for <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticides</b> in 1989 {{and at the same time}} Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program was introduced. To see the superiority of IPM technology it is important to evaluate the program in two ways: (l) evaluating whether the IPM technology has successfully reduced the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticides,</b> and (2) what incentives the IPM technology provides to the farmers in coping with the risk of crop loss due to the pest damage. The study found the IPM technology successfully reduced the application of <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticides</b> in Yogyakarta province without sacrificing the level of rice output for the farmers.

50|$|Only {{with the}} {{modernization}} of agriculture in the 20th century and the invention of <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticides</b> did it become possible to effectively combat the cockchafer.

Since then, agriculture has generally reduced its use of pesticides. Because of environmental and public health concerns (pesticides may enter the food chain and thus also the human body) many <b>chemical</b> <b>pesticides</b> have been phased out in the European Union and worldwide. In recent years, the cockchafer's numbers have been increasing again, causing damage to over 1,000 km² of land all over Europe.
