5|$|Alan Kotok {{was born}} in 1941 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was raised as an only child in Vineland, New Jersey. During his childhood, he played with tools in his father's {{hardware}} store and learned model railroading. He was a precocious child, skipping two grades at high school, and he matriculated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) aged 16. Although his interest in computers began at Vineland High School, his first practical experience of computing came at MIT; there he developed a habit of working late at night when more <b>computer</b> <b>time</b> was available.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1962 and {{continuing}} over the next few years, members of the PDP-1 programming community at MIT, including Russell and the other Hingham Institute members, began to spread out to other schools and employers such as Stanford University and DEC, and as they did they spread the game to other universities and institutions with a PDP-1 computer. As a result, Spacewar was perhaps the first video game to be available outside a single research institute. Over the next decade, programmers at these other institutions began coding their own variants, including features such as allowing more ships and players at once, replacing the hyperspace feature with a cloaking device, space mines, and even a first-person perspective version played on two screens that simulates each pilot's view out of the cockpit. Some of these Spacewar installations also replicated Kotok and Saunders' gamepad. According to a second-hand account heard by Russell while working at DEC, Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping {{because it was the only}} available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, most without a monitor and many of the remainder to secure military locations or research labs with no free <b>computer</b> <b>time,</b> which prevented the original Spacewar from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Though some later DEC models, such as the PDP-6, came with Spacewar pre-loaded, the audience for the game remained very limited; the PDP-6, for example, sold only 23 units.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before having {{to make all the}} choices in their ruleset, leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they settle into a repeating pattern that does not return to the origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of <b>computer</b> <b>time,</b> nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E

25|$|In {{the decade}} {{preceding}} Unix, computers had grown enormously in {{power to the}} point where computer operators were looking for new ways to get people to use their spare time on their machines. One of the major developments during this era was time-sharing, whereby a number of users would get small slices of <b>computer</b> <b>time,</b> at a rate at which it appeared they were each connected to their own, slower, machine.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft's {{software}} development {{was done on}} a DEC PDP-10 mainframe computer system. Paul Allen had developed a program that could completely simulate a new microprocessor system. This allowed them to write and debug software before the new computer hardware was complete. They were charged by the hour and {{by the amount of}} resources used (storage, printing, etc.) The 6800 BASIC was complete before the Altair 680 was finished.

25|$|The polar hydrogens {{are usually}} {{retained}} in the model, because proper treatment of hydrogen bonds requires a reasonably accurate description of the directionality and the electrostatic interactions between the donor and acceptor groups. A hydroxyl group, for example, can be both a hydrogen bond donor, and a hydrogen bond acceptor, {{and it would be}} impossible to treat this with one OH pseudo-atom. About half the atoms in a protein or nucleic acid are non-polar hydrogens, so the use of united atoms can provide a substantial savings in <b>computer</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{the bond}} angles, bond lengths and torsion angles of the {{components}} are not modified at any stage of complex generation, it is known as rigid body docking. A subject of speculation {{is whether or not}} rigid-body docking is sufficiently good for most docking. When substantial conformational change occurs within the components at the time of complex formation, rigid-body docking is inadequate. However, scoring all possible conformational changes is prohibitively expensive in <b>computer</b> <b>time.</b> Docking procedures which permit conformational change, or flexible docking procedures, must intelligently select small subset of possible conformational changes for consideration.|$|E
25|$|Liverpool was {{the first}} among UK {{universities}} to develop their desktop computer power management solution, which has been widely adopted by other institutions. The university has subsequently piloted other advanced software approaches further increasing savings. The university has also {{been at the forefront}} of using the Condor HTC computing platform in a power saving environment. This software, which makes use of unused <b>computer</b> <b>time</b> for computationally intensive tasks usually results in computers being left turned on. The university has demonstrated an effective solution for this problem using a mixture of Wake-on-LAN and commercial power management software.|$|E
25|$|Multitasking {{refers to}} the running of {{multiple}} independent computer programs on the same computer; giving the appearance that it is performing the tasks at the same <b>time.</b> Since most <b>computers</b> can do at most one or two things at one time, this is generally done via time-sharing, which means that each program uses {{a share of the}} <b>computer's</b> <b>time</b> to execute.|$|R

25|$|The {{abstract}} {{properties of}} covering {{have been studied}} by mathematicians for over a century. However, direct application of these results has not generally been possible. Closed-form mathematical solutions, especially for probability distributions, often cannot be readily evaluated. That is, they involve inordinately large amounts of <b>computer</b> <b>time</b> for parameters characteristic of DNA sequencing. Stevens' configuration is one such example. Results obtained {{from the perspective of}} pure mathematics also do not account for factors that are actually important in sequencing, for instance detectable overlap in sequencing fragments, double-stranding, edge-effects, and target multiplicity. Consequently, development of sequencing theory has proceeded more according to the philosophy of applied mathematics. In particular, it has been problem-focused and makes expedient use of approximations, simulations, etc.|$|E
500|$|At 13, he {{enrolled}} in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school. [...] When {{he was in the}} eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of <b>computer</b> <b>time</b> on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students. [...] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, [...] "There was just something neat about the machine." [...] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free <b>computer</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the ban, {{the four}} {{students}} offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra <b>computer</b> <b>time.</b> Rather than use the system via Teletype. Subsequently, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them <b>computer</b> <b>time</b> and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with [...] "a disproportionate number of interesting girls." [...] He later stated that [...] "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success." [...] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor. [...] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
500|$|Two {{additional}} developments around 1980 {{once again}} accelerated {{the ability to}} compute [...] First, the discovery of new iterative algorithms for computing , which were much faster than the infinite series; and second, the invention of fast multiplication algorithms that could multiply large numbers very rapidly. Such algorithms are particularly important in modern [...] computations, {{because most of the}} <b>computer's</b> <b>time</b> is devoted to multiplication. They include the Karatsuba algorithm, Toom–Cook multiplication, and Fourier transform-based methods.|$|R

The results show that when using DataFlow computers, instead od ControlFlow <b>computers,</b> <b>time,</b> energy, and/or space can be saved.|$|R
500|$|Intractability and the {{combinatorial}} explosion.

The record, always relying on an arctan series, was broken repeatedly (7,480 digits in 1957; 10,000 digits in 1958; 100,000 digits in 1961) until 1 million digits were reached in 1973.|$|E

[...] They used a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics based on solving the barotropic vorticity equation over a single layer of the atmosphere, by computing the geopotential height of the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface. [...] This simplification greatly reduced demands on <b>computer</b> <b>time</b> and memory, so the computations could be performed on the relatively primitive computers of the day. [...] When news of the first weather forecast by ENIAC was received by Richardson in 1950, he remarked that the results were an [...] "enormous scientific advance."
