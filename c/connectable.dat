2500|$|Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse {{was built}} by four main programmers, using Virtual Theatre 7, Revolution's own {{in-house}} developed game engine based on the company's original Virtual Theatre, used to create their 2D titles in the 1990s. Tony Warriner, co-founder and technical director of Revolution, programmed the game's engine, in particular its user interface (UI) and game scripting system, wanting to warrant the UI was [...] "as smooth, simple and intuitive as possible." [...] As an engine developer, Joost Peters, who previously co-programmed the two Broken Sword remakes with Warriner, had to ensure the engine was portable and ran optimally {{on a wide range}} of platforms. Coder Peter Brooks had to implement features between various platforms and application programming interfaces <b>connectable</b> to the game. Andrew Boskett, who previously worked on The Sleeping Dragon, returned to program The Serpent's Curse. Warriner and Brooks both usually used OS X, Peters used Linux and Boskett Windows, to ensure that all the game would remain in sync on all platforms.|$|E

50|$|Researchers at Columbia University {{have grown}} an anatomically correct human jawbone from stem cells, {{though it was}} solid bone without the normal {{accessory}} tissues such as bone marrow, cartilage, or a <b>connectable</b> blood supply.

50|$|Depending on the {{particular}} implementation, e-voting may use standalone electronic machines (also called EVM) or computers connected to the internet. It encompasses a range of Internet services, from basic data transmission to full-function online voting through common <b>connectable</b> household devices. Similarly, the degree of automation may vary from simple chores to a complete solution that includes voter registration & authentication, vote input, local or precinct tallying, vote data encryption and transmission to servers, vote consolidation and tabulation, and election administration. A worthy e-voting system must perform most of these tasks while complying {{with a set of}} standards established by regulatory bodies, and must also be capable to deal successfully with strong requirements associated with security, accuracy, integrity, swiftness, privacy, auditability, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, scalability and ecological sustainability.|$|E
5000|$|By this time, {{most of the}} {{combinatorial}} logic {{which was}} formerly performed by PALs had been incorporated into a new LSI chip for greater flexibility, increased reliability and lower cost. This LSI, or a version of it, {{found its way into}} subsequent LaserWriters, and possibly even some competitive products, the first of which competitors may have been Hewlett-Packard's ISA board which behaved as a parallel-attached PostScript interpreter, and which was connected outboard to a CX-based marking engine, such as a LaserJet, or, through an adapter board, to an SX-based marking engine, such as a LaserJet II. The emergence of ISA boards which supported LocalTalk made LaserWriters immediately <b>connectable</b> to PCs, and most probably undermined the success of H-P's inboard PostScript interpreter.|$|E

50|$|In 1969, Don {{wanted to}} create {{products}} to teach unskilled gymnasts in a safer manner. By removing fear associated with injury, the gymnasts were able to develop more quickly. These items were created with shaped foam with a vinyl cover and included items such as the incline mat, the <b>connectable</b> vault cylinders, jousting units and floor mats, to name a few. Don called El Monte High School {{where he used to}} teach and asked if he could try them out with some of the gymnasts at the school. The school suggested he also try them with some of their special needs students and the results were phenomenal. With special needs children, the process is focused on success, the more success they have, the better the children advance. With Don's inventions, kids with braces on their legs and other serious issues, were able to do front rolls, back rolls, climb, fall and have fun safely. More importantly, they succeeded. The school said the improvement in their attitude and success was incredible. Over 160 products were designed that are in use throughout the world today.|$|E
50|$|MG 3 {{machine guns}} are belt-fed, using non-disintegrating metal DM1 belts, which have links that wrap around the {{cartridge}} case and are linked by a coiling wire on each side. DM1 belts are preloaded at ammunition factories in 50-round <b>connectable</b> belt lengths {{and can be}} linked to any length necessary.Alternatively the MG3 can also be fed by disintegrating metal M13 link belts (designated DM60 by Germany) used by many NATO member states. M13 links are also used on the Dillon M134D Minigun, M60, FN MAG, AA-52 and HK21 machine guns among others.Both belt types use a metal lip that is arrested in the rim of the cartridges to correctly position and fix the cartridges in place.For field use there are several ammunition containers available. The Beltdrum contains a 50-round DM1 or DM60 belt. The steel DM2 ammunition box contains a 250-round DM1 belt and the smaller plastic DM40004 ammunition box contains a 100-round DM1 belt or a 120-round DM60 belt.The German military tends to use non-disintegrating DM1 belts for general use and disintegrating DM60/M13 belts in vehicle or aircraft fixed MG3 mountings that allow for collecting the ejected link pieces for reuse.|$|E
