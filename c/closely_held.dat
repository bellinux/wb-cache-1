5|$|The {{identity}} of Mr. X. was a <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> secret for 40 years. In {{the process of}} reopening the case, Mitchell, Bradford and the three students discovered the {{identity of}} Mr. X. The informant was revealed to be Maynard King, a highway patrolman who revealed {{the location of the}} civil rights workers' bodies to FBI Agent Joseph Sullivan. In 2005, one perpetrator, Edgar Ray Killen, was charged for his part in the crimes. He was convicted of three counts of manslaughter, and is currently serving a 60-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|Two {{centuries before}} Mau and the Hōkūle‘a, Captain James Cook, {{with the help}} of Tupaia, gained {{knowledge}} that otherwise would have been <b>closely</b> <b>held.</b> Before his death in 1779, Cook hypothesized that Polynesians shared common ancestry; he even pinned their origin to Asia. However, Cook's theory did not prevent debate among scholars. Before the Hōkūle‘a voyage in 1976, academic debate about the settlement of Polynesia was divided between several schools of thought.|$|E

5|$|Barrel Roll {{was one of}} {{the most}} <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> secrets and one of the most unknown {{components}} of the American military commitment in Southeast Asia. Due to the ostensible neutrality of Laos, guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954 and 1962, both the U.S. and North Vietnam strove to maintain the secrecy of their operations and only slowly escalated military actions there. As much as both parties would have liked to have publicized their enemy's own alleged violation of the accords, both had more to gain by keeping their own roles quiet. Regardless, by the end of the conflict in 1975, Laos emerged from nine years of war just as devastated as any of the other Asian participants in the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, , is a {{landmark}} decision in United States corporate law by the United States Supreme Court allowing <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> for-profit corporations to {{be exempt from}} a regulation its owners religiously object to, {{if there is a}} less restrictive means of furthering the law's interest, according to the provisions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). It {{is the first time that}} the court has recognized a for-profit corporation's claim of religious belief, but it is limited to <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> corporations. The decision does not address whether such corporations are protected by the free-exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution.|$|E

25|$|The {{chief of}} SIS, Stewart Menzies insisted on wartime control of codebreaking, and this gave him immense power and influence, {{which he used}} judiciously. By distributing the Ultra {{material}} collected by the Government Code & Cypher School, for the first time, MI6 became an important branch of the government. Extensive breaches of Nazi Enigma signals gave Menzies and his team enormous insight into Adolf Hitler's strategy, and this was kept a <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> secret.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor to}} be {{considered}} in valuing <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> companies is the marketability of an interest in such businesses. Marketability is defined as the ability to convert the business interest into cash quickly, with minimum transaction and administrative costs, and {{with a high degree of}} certainty as to the amount of net proceeds. There is usually a cost and a time lag associated with locating interested and capable buyers of interests in privately held companies, because there is no established market of readily available buyers and sellers.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to understand why this capitalization rate for small, privately held companies is significantly higher than the return that an investor might expect to receive from other common types of investments, such as money market accounts, mutual funds, or even real estate. Those investments involve substantially lower levels of risk than an investment in a <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> company. Depository accounts are insured by the federal government (up to certain limits); mutual funds are composed of publicly traded stocks, for which risk can be substantially minimized through portfolio diversification.|$|E

25|$|The C-3 {{expedition}} drew public interest, {{first from}} a photo essay published by Robert Halmi in the July 1954 issue of True Magazine and later from {{the publication of}} a double first-person account of the expedition, The Caves Beyond: The Story of the Collins Crystal Cave Expedition by Joe Lawrence, Jr. (then president of the National Speleological Society) and Roger Brucker. The expedition proved conclusively that passages in Crystal Cave extended toward Mammoth Cave proper, at least exceeding the Crystal Cave property boundaries. However, this information was <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> by the explorers: it was feared that the National Park Service might forbid exploration were this known.|$|E
25|$|Actor Ed Kemmer {{attended}} many of {{the important}} film festivals during the late 90s and early 2000s and discovered a renewed Space Patrol popularity that continued up until {{the time of his}} death in 2004. The emergence of electronic media during the 1990s permitted a greater interchange of Space Patrol merchandise that heretofore had been <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> by collectors. This stimulated new interest and in turn, production of new publications and merchandise for Space Patrol fans. A rather extensive book written by Jean Noel Bassior furthered interest in the series as did the production of a new set of Space Patrol trading cards, replicas of the program's space craft, clocks, jackets, and other period paraphernalia.|$|E
25|$|The resounding {{victory of}} Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy in 2015 general {{elections}} has raised {{hope for a}} successful transition of Myanmar from a <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> military rule to a free democratic system. However, internal political turmoil, crumbling economy and ethnic strife continue {{to make the transition}} to democracy a painful one. The recent murder of Ko Ni, a prominent Muslim lawyer and a key member of Myanmar’s governing National League for Democracy party is seen as a serious blow to the country’s fragile democracy. Mr. Ko Ni’s murder is feared to be depriving Aung San Suu Kyi of trusted adviser, particularly on reforming Myanmar’s military-drafted Constitution and ushering the country to democracy.|$|E

25|$|For such companies, the Court's {{majority}} directly {{struck down}} the contraceptive mandate, a regulation adopted by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requiring employers to cover certain contraceptives for their female employees, by a 5-4 vote. The court said that the mandate was not the least restrictive way to ensure access to contraceptive care, noting that a less restrictive alternative was being provided for religious non-profits, until the Court issued an injunction 3 days later, effectively ending said alternative, {{replacing it with a}} government-sponsored alternative for any female employees of <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> corporations that do not wish to provide birth control. The ruling is considered {{to be part of the}} political controversy regarding Obamacare and freedoms in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Famed French cave {{explorer}} Édouard-Alfred Martel {{visited the}} cave {{for three days}} in October 1912. Without access to the <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> survey data, Martel was permitted to make barometric observations in the cave {{for the purpose of}} determining the relative elevation of different locations in the cave. He identified different levels of the cave, and correctly noted that the level of Echo River within the cave was controlled by that of the Green River on the surface. Martel lamented the 1906 construction of the dam at Brownsville, pointing out that this made a full hydrologic study of the cave impossible. Among his precise descriptions of the hydrogeologic setting of Mammoth Cave, Martel offered the speculative conclusion that Mammoth Cave was connected to Salts and Colossal Caves: this would not be proven correct until 60 years after Martel's visit.|$|E
500|$|The {{practice}} of intercepting and decrypting diplomatic messages of friend and foe alike was a <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> secret in the 1950s. In mid-March 1951, Truman learned through such intercepts that MacArthur had conversations with diplomats in Spain's and Portugal's Tokyo embassies. In these talks, MacArthur had expressed confidence {{that he would}} succeed in expanding the Korean War into a major conflict resulting in the permanent disposal of the [...] "Chinese Communist question" [...] and MacArthur did not want either country to be alarmed if this happened. The content of this particular intercept was known by only a very few of Truman's closest advisers, two being Paul Nitze, Director of the Policy Planning Staff of the State Department and his associate, Charles Burton Marshall. Truman considered MacArthur's conversations to be outright treachery and concluded that MacArthur had to be relieved, {{but was unable to}} act immediately because of MacArthur's political support and to avoid wider knowledge of the existence of the electronic intercepts of diplomatic messages.|$|E

500|$|Identifying deaths {{specifically}} {{attributable to}} the Berlin Wall is not straightforward. Although East Germans were aware of deaths on the Wall from West German media broadcasts which {{they were able to}} receive, reliable information was <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> by the East German authorities. A number of different West German institutions kept their own records. These included the West Berlin police, the Central Registry of State Judicial Administration in Salzgitter (which tracked all border fatalities) and the Arbeitsgruppe 13 August (Working Group 13 August), a West Berlin association. Within the jurisdiction of the West-Berlin police, the State Security Department was responsible for the registration of known incidents. The records distinguish between individuals who died at the outer border of West-Berlin (80 incidents), unclear incidents (with 5 possible wall victims) and border guards who were shot. The Central Registry of State Judicial Administrations in Salzgitter, was also given a mandate to collect evidence of actual or attempted murder in the GDR. In 1991, it published the [...] "Salzgitter-Report" [...] with the names of 78 victims. However, since the Registration Agency had no access to the GDR archives, the data was regarded as incomplete. Both agencies mainly listed incidents that could have been observed from West-Berlin or had been reported by fugitives or border patrols who left the GDR.|$|E
