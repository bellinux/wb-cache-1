40|$|Mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are {{endangered}} {{across their}} range. The {{leading cause of}} their decline is increased apparent competition with other ungulates, mainly moose (Alces alces), because of increase in densities of predators such as wolves (<b>Canis</b> <b>lupus).</b> <b>I</b> tested some assumptions of, and evidence for, moose management as an approach to caribou recovery through the indirect reduction in wolf numbers. Increased hunting quotas drastically reduced moose densities in the Parsnip River Study Area of northern British Columbia, and I monitored 31 collared wolves during this decline. Despite wolf selection for vegetation types associated with moose and avoidance of areas selected by caribou, wolves occasionally forayed during snow-free months to elevations where caribou were more common. Wolf diets were comprised of > 80 % moose, with little caribou and other prey items. Annual dispersal rates of wolves increased compared to rates before moose reduction, and compared to a control study area. In systems where moose comprise the majority of wolf diets and caribou are at low densities, reductions in moose numbers may help to facilitate caribou recovery. [...] P. ii.

40|$|Nowadays, {{hybridization}} {{is recognized}} as a powerful evolutionary force promoting speciation and shaping adaptation, {{but also as a}} serious threat to the conservation of biodiversity. This thesis is focused on two cases of hybridization between wild and domestic conspecifics, whose effects are mostly unexplored. In Sus scrofa, I sought to expand knowledge about hybridization between wild boar and domestic pig. I investigated the main sources of domestic genes introgression, and assessed hybridization at neutral markers and functional genes at both local and European scale. I also developed a set of new uniparental markers for studying male-specific gene flow, and studied the reproductive phenology of wild populations. In <b>Canis</b> <b>lupus,</b> <b>I</b> investigated patterns of hybridization between wolf and domestic dog in an Italian mountain area, focusing on the assessment of introgression and the food habits of hybrids. As regards wild boar, I detected introgression all over Europe, also highlighting the role of breeding stations in spreading domestic genes across wild populations. With respect to wolf, a new approach was used to provide complementary (genetic and phenotypic) data on specific individuals and to support hybrid identification. A trophic niche overlap between wolves and hybrids was also proved. These studies can have relevant management implications, offering new elements of knowledge on different aspects of the hybridization in two worrisome species of the Italian fauna. ...|$|R

Podstawowym celem było zastosowanie nieinwazyjnej metody pozwalającej monitorować duże drapieżniki, przede wszystkim wilka <b>Canis</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>i</b> rysia Lynx lynx. W ciągu roku zamontowano 25 fotopułapek, z użyciem których nagrano 26 różnych gatunków ptaków i ssaków. Nagrania pozwoliły zidentyfikować poszczególne osobniki rysia – łącznie 8 dorosłych i 6 młodych, w tym 2 samice z potomstwem. Ponadto wielokrotnie zarejestrowano wilki, zarówno pojedyncze osobniki, jak i watahy składające się z 4 osobników. Planuje się kontynuowanie badań z użyciem fotopułapek w celu uzyskania materiału niezbędnego do bardziej zaawansowanych analiz. In November 2013, a {{pilot study}} {{with the use of}} camera-trapping, a {{non-invasive}} technique, was applied in Gorce National Park. The main aim {{of the study was to}} detect large carnivores, such as grey wolf <b>Canis</b> <b>lupus</b> and Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx. During one year, a total of 25 camera-traps were regularly mounted within the park area i. e. ca 70 km 2. This technique appeared to be highly effective and successful. During 12 months, about 26 different species of birds and mammals were recorded including lynxes and wolves. Some photographs allowed identification of individuals of lynxes. The population of this species was estimated at 8 adult individuals and 6 juveniles. One female was recorded with an unusually high number of four kittens in the litter. The other female was recorded with two kittens in the same season. In the case of wolves, both solitary individuals and packs consisting of 4 individuals were recorded by camera-traps. The studies are to be continued in order to acquire more records of wildlife in GNP that allow application of more sophisticated statistical analysis...|$|R

40|$|Many bioacoustic {{studies have}} been able to {{identify}} individual mammals from variations in the fundamental frequency (F 0) of their vocalizations. Other characteristics of vocalization which encode individuality, such as amplitude, are less frequently used because of problems with background noise and recording fidelity over distance. In this thesis, I investigate whether the inclusion of amplitude variables improves the accuracy of individual howl identification in captive Eastern grey wolves (<b>Canis</b> <b>lupus</b> lycaon). <b>I</b> also explore whether the use of a bespoke code to extract the howl features, combined with histogram-derived principal component analysis (PCA) values, can improve current individual wolf howl identification accuracies. From a total of 89 solo howls from six captive individuals, where distances between wolf and observer were short, I achieved 95. 5 % (+ 9. 0 % improvement) individual identification accuracy of captive wolves using discriminant function analysis (DFA) to classify simple scalar variables of F 0 and normalized amplitudes. Moreover, this accuracy was increased to 100 % when using histogram-derived PCA values of F 0 and amplitudes of the first harmonic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Large migratory catibou {Rangifer tarandus) herds in the Arct ic {{tend to be}} cyclic, and {{population}} trends ate mainly driven by changes in forage or weather events, not by predation. W e estimated daily k i l l rate by wolves on adult caribou in winter, then constructed a time and space dependent model to estimate annual wolf (<b>Canis</b> <b>lupus)</b> predation rate (P annual) on adult Porcupine catibou. O u r model adjusts predation seasonally depending on caribou dis tr ibut ion: Pannual = IKdaUy * W *Ap(2) *Dp. In our model we assumed that wolves k i l led adult caribou at a constant rate (Kda,iy, 0. 08 caribou w o l f day 1) based on our studies and elsewhere; that wolf density (W) doubled to 6 wolves 1000 k m 2 1 on all seasonal ranges; and that the average area occupied by the Porcupine caribou herd (P C H) in eight seasonal life cycle periods (Dp) was two times gteater than the area described by the outer boundaries of telemetry data (Ap / 1000 k m 2). Results from our model pro-jected that wolves k i l l about 7600 adult caribou each year, regardless of herd size. The model estimated that wolves removed 5. 8 to 7. 4 % of adult caribou as the herd declined i n the 1990 s. O u r predation rate model supports the hypothesis of Bergerud that spacing away by caribou is an effective anti-predatory strategy that greatly reduces wolf predation on adult caribou {{in the spring and}} summer.
