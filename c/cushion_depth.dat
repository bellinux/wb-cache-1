40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a laboratory set of experiments made to investigate the pressure fluctuation field on beneath of a plunge pool subjected to jet impingement. As an example this phenomenon takes commonly place {{in the case of the}} drop structure, where the elevation reduces with a take off and impinging portion. When the downstream bottom is nearly horizontal and made of concrete or rock, there is no significant scour, and the drop is followed by a stilling basin where the hydraulic jump takes place. The relevance of the topic is related to the structural design of the linings of the dissipation basin downstream barrages or check dams. Nevertheless the knowledge of the stresses at the basis of plunge pool dissipation basins can be useful to predict a localized erosion process. With reference to the specific case of the prototype of a dam spillway and downstream energy dissipation basin, we discuss the effect of a variable water <b>cushion</b> <b>depth</b> on the reduction of the severe pressure fluctuations that take place at the bottom of the stilling basin. The experiments are made on a 1 : 40 laboratory model, recording the dynamic behavior of pressure fluctuations in a set of different positions on beneath the plunge pool. The experimental results presented in dimensionless form, give a better understanding of the fluctuating pressure reduction that can be obtained increasing the <b>cushion</b> <b>depth...</b>|$|E
40|$|Musculoskeletal pain is {{commonly}} reported by police officers. A potential cause of officer discomfort is a mismatch between vehicle seats and {{the method used}} for carrying appointments. Twenty-five police officers rated their discomfort while seated in: (1) a standard police vehicle seat, and (2) a vehicle seat custom-designed for police use. Discomfort was recorded in both seats while wearing police appointments on: (1) a traditional appointments belt, and (2) a load-bearing vest / belt combination (LBV). Sitting in the standard vehicle seat and carrying appointments on a traditional appointments belt were both associated with significantly elevated discomfort. Four vehicle seat features were most implicated as contributing to discomfort: back rest bolster prominence; lumbar region support; seat cushion width; and seat <b>cushion</b> bolster <b>depth.</b> Authorising the carriage of appointments using a LBV is a lower cost solution with potential to reduce officer discomfort. Furthermore, the introduction of custom-designed vehicle seats should be considered...|$|R
5000|$|Recommendations {{were based}} on a system created by EOU {{officers}} taking into account such factors as depth, target system, and <b>cushion.</b> For <b>depth</b> the EOU considered whether the attack would go [...] "deep" [...] enough and how many different effects it would have. Target system determined whether the attack would create a chain reaction that would knock out many processes at once. Cushion related to the ability of the target to recover quickly from the attack. Conventional target factories, such those that produced weapons, tanks, and aircraft had developed methods of rapid recovery after being bombed and were considered to be less cost-effective for this reason. These three considerations helped the EOU to identify those targets where air attack would be most effective. The work of this group is often used as a case study in applied economics, in particular their suggestion to Allied commanders to destroy ball bearing factories, as their models showed them to be the most vital to Nazi industry. This particular recommendation turned out to be incorrect, as the Nazis re-engineered many machines to use other methods of friction reduction, and for other reasons.|$|R
