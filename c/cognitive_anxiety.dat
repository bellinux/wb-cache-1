40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of an interdisciplinary program of Greek traditional dance with issues from music and sociology on high school students’ anxiety. 131 students (68 males & 63 females), between the ages from 12 to 13 yrs., participated. The experimental group (n= 62) followed the new eight-week program (two lessons/week) while the control group (n= 69) followed the typical physical education program. To evaluate students’ anxiety during lessons, the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory- 2 (Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump, & Smith, 1990) was used with its 3 dimensions (somatic, <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxieties,</b> & self-confidence). Students completed it before the initiation of the intervention and after its completion. The following statistical analyses were performed: a) Factor Analysis, b) Cronbach's alpha test, and c) Anova with Repeated Measures. Results showed that a. “Somatic anxiety”, “cognitive anxiety” and “self confidence” accounted for 83 % and 73 %, respectively, of the total variance b) Cronbach's alpha was satisfactory (ranging from. 66,. 78 and. 71 for the initial and from. 87,. 94 and. 89 for the final measure), c) the experimental group decreased the levels of somatic and <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxieties</b> and enhanced their self-confidence. Also, male students increased their self-confidence more than female students. These findings support the view that an interdisciplinary program of traditional Greek dance and topics from music and sociology reduces the rates of somatic and <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxieties</b> while simultaneously increases students’ self-confidence's levels, and especially those of males...|$|R

However, the mediation role of goal orientation between the Big Five personality traits and <b>cognitive</b> test <b>anxiety</b> (CTA) needs further exploration. Based on data from 458 university students, regression and mediation analyses were conducted to test associations between five personality factors (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism), two types of goal orientations (extrinsic and intrinsic), and CTA. Direct negative relationships were found between two personality factors (Openness and Conscientiousness) and CTA. Direct positive associations were found between Neuroticism and Extrinsic Goal Orientation (EGO) and CTA. Examination of model fit indices revealed a partially mediated model examining the relationships among personality variables, goal orientation, and <b>cognitive</b> test <b>anxiety</b> was the only model with acceptable fit indices.

Thirty-nine adults between the ages of 30 and 87 years of age with and without hearing impairments participated in several interviews. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> was measured using the <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Anxiety</b> Scale (CAS) by Viney & Westbrook (1976), which is a content analysis, grounded in personal construct psychology. The following research questions have been addressed: 1 a) Do <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> levels change in individuals with hearing impairment as they go through the consultation process? 1 b) Is there any difference in <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> levels between male and female participants with hearing impairment as they go through the consultation process? 2 a) Do <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> levels change in normal hearing significant others of individuals with hearing impairment as they go through the consultation process? 2 b) Is there any difference in <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> levels between male and female significant others as they go through the consultation process? 3 a) Do <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> levels differ between participants with hearing impairment who adopt amplification and those who do not? 3 b) Do <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> levels of significant others differ between participants with hearing impairment who adopt amplification and those who do not? Results revealed reduced <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> levels for hearing impaired adults between the first interview and third interview, between the second interview and third interview, but no significant difference was found between the first interview and second interview.

40|$|Hearing {{impairment}} (HI) is {{a growing}} health issue in today’s ageing society. Research has suggested that individuals with HI may experience increased levels of anxiety. Previous research has mainly focused on anxiety as a trait; recent research, however, has looked at state anxiety in the hearing impaired population. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> is a state anxiety that occurs when people encounter a situation which does not lie within their construct system. As a result, they may experience anxiety as they are unable, or only partially able, to interpret the event meaningfully and are therefore unable to judge {{the implications of this}} event. The following study aimed to use the <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Anxiety</b> Scale to investigate relationships between <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> and client variables in hearing impaired individuals, adding to the small amount of research currently available in this area. The following research questions were investigated: (1) Is there a relationship between <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> level and (a) age, (b) gender, (c) audiometric variables, and (d) quality of life? (2) Is there {{a significant difference between the}} level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> for the participants who purchased and kept hearing aids and those who did not? Twenty-five hearing impaired individuals who were consulting an audiologist for the first time participated in this study, with the <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> interview conducted prior to the audiological assessment. The results indicated that <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> was significantly related to an ability to understand speech in noise and quality of life, and that hearing aid adopters exhibited greater levels of <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> than non-adopters. These results confirm that <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> is indeed experienced by adults with HI, and suggest that it may be a factor which motivates people to adopt hearing aids. Further research is needed to confirm and further investigate the relationships with client variables. By listening for signs of <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety,</b> an audiologist may be able to gauge if a client is ready for rehabilitation, and encourage the process by exploring the effects of HI on communication situations, employing speech in noise testing, and including the significant other in the process...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} {{stress and}} anxiety in sport {{from a number}} of different perspectives. It is written as a series of research papers (chapters). Before the research papers, a critical review chapter is presented on the research and theory relevant to stress and anxiety in sport. One of the issues to arise from the review chapter was the relative merit of multidimensional anxiety theory and catastrophe models. In multidimensional anxiety theory, it is unclear whether <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> and selfconfidence are viewed as being conceptually independent or conceptually codependent. In higher-order catastrophe models, self-confidence is viewed as being conceptually independent of <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> and is expected to moderate the interactive effects of <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> and physiological arousal upon performance. One of the aims of Chapter 3 was to clarify whether <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> and selfconfidence were conceptually independent. This was done by means of a metaanalysis that explored the relationships between <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> and performance, and self-confidence and performance. The magnitude of the (positive) self-confidence mean effect size was significantly larger than the magnitude of the (negative) <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> mean effect size. This offers evidence for the relatively strong influence of self-confidence upon performance. It also provides support for the conceptual independence of <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> and self-confidence. In Chapter 4, the role of self-confidence was explored within a higher-order catastrophe model framework. This involved an exploratory segmental analysis designed specifically for exploring bias factors in higher-order catastrophe models. This analysis supported the moderating role of self-confidence within this framework. More specifically, the maximum <b>cognitive</b> <b>anxiety</b> x somatic anxiety interaction effect size was at a higher level of somatic anxiety for the high self-confidence condition, when compared to the low self-confidence condition. Another of the findings from the meta-analysis was the dearth of studies conducted with elite performers. The final research paper was an investigation of organizational stress within an elite environment. In view of its exploratory nature, this study was conducted within a qualitative framework. The major sources of organizational stress to emerge from the interviews with elite athletes were: selection, training environment, finances, nutrition, goals and expectations, coaches and coaching styles, team atmosphere, roles, support network, 111 and communication. A general discussion chapter follows the research papers. In this chapter, implications for future research and applied practice are discussed in relation to the project as a whole...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examined}} the effects of distance priming on test anxiety and judgment.

There is a significant correlation between ACT score and <b>cognitive</b> test <b>anxiety,</b> supporting past literature that as one’s intellectual ability increases, their <b>cognitive</b> test <b>anxiety</b> decreases.
