At a depth of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image).

5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its <b>critical</b> <b>point.</b> Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the <b>critical</b> <b>point,</b> this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

The <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> detection step detects the major <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> on the contour of the binary vehicle mask. The <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> clustering step selects the best <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> among the detected <b>critical</b> <b>points</b> as the reference points for the model partition.

To evaluate the accuracy, the dimensions of each individual vehicle are estimated based on the partitioned model.
