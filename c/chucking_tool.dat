5000|$|RÖHM [...] is a German <b>chucking</b> <b>tool</b> manufacturer. It {{was founded}} in 1909 by Heinrich Röhm. Its {{headquarters}} is in Sontheim/Brenz Germany. RÖHM’s range of products includes drill chucks, live centers, face drivers, lathe chucks and independent chucks as well as vices, gripping technology, power chuck technology, mandrels and tool clamping systems. RÖHM currently counts approximately 1500 employees. The company’s products offer solutions especially for the automobile industry, engineering, the energy sector, rail vehicles and aerospace. From the 1950s until 2010, they also manufactured a line of inexpensive firearms under the Röhm Gesellschaft (RG) division. In 2010, RG was sold to Umarex.|$|E

A demand for highest precision motor spindles, <b>tool</b> <b>chucks</b> and cutting <b>tools</b> arises for advanced cutting processes, free from tool deflection and vibrations. This paper targets a new {{design of a}} non-typical Adaptive Spindle System (AS) with an additional electromagnetic bearing based on mechatronics and adaptive control methods for advanced cutting technologies and proposals drafting on AIS development. The static and dynamic performance determination of the AS at speeds of up to 15, 000 rpm has been performed on a test bench with actuator stimulated forces and displacement sensors.

This paper presents a patented design method of a non-typical Adaptive Spindle System {{with an additional}} electromagnetic bearing based on mechatronics and adaptive control methods for advanced cutting technologies. In comparison to known active magnetic bearing systems for rotor orientation, a rotor damping is investigated between roller bearings.

25|$|R8 collets were {{developed}} by Bridgeport Machines, Inc. for use in milling machines. Unusually, R8 collets fit into the machine taper itself (i.e. there is no separate <b>chuck)</b> and <b>tools</b> with integral R8 taper can also be directly fitted. R8 was developed to allow rapid tool changes and requires an exact match between collet and tool shank diameter.|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} {{part is the}} seamer setup. This process is usually performed by an experienced technician. Amongst the parts that need setup are seamer rolls and chucks which have to be set in their exact position (using a feeler gauge or a clearance gauge). The lifter pressure and position, roll and <b>chuck</b> designs, <b>tooling</b> wear, and bearing wear all contribute to a good double seam.|$|R
50|$|To <b>chuck</b> a <b>tool</b> or {{workpiece}} {{is to hold}} it with a chuck, {{in which}} case it has been chucked. Lathe work whose workholding involves chucking individual slugs or blanks is often called chucking work, in contrast to bar work or bar feed work. In bar work the bar protrudes from the chuck, is worked upon, then cut off by a lathe tool (parted off) rather than being sawn off. Automatic lathes that specialize in chucking work are often called chuckers.|$|R

2500|$|Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just {{thread cutting}} when the context is implicit), is an {{operation}} that uses a single-point tool to produce a thread form on a cylinder or cone. The tool moves [...] while the precise rotation of the workpiece determines {{the lead of the}} thread. The process can be done to create external or internal threads (male or female). In external thread cutting, the piece can either be held in a chuck or mounted between two centers. With internal thread cutting, the piece is held in a <b>chuck.</b> The <b>tool</b> moves across the piece linearly, taking chips off the workpiece with each pass. Usually 5 to 7 light cuts create the correct depth of the thread.|$|R

50|$|Commercial CNC {{metalworking}} machines use {{closed loop}} feedback controls for axis movement. In a closed loop system, the control {{is aware of the}} actual position of the axis at all times. With proper control programming, this will reduce the possibility of a crash, but it is still up to the operator and programmer to ensure that the machine is operated in a safe manner. However, during the 2000s and 2010s, the software for machining simulation has been maturing rapidly, and it is no longer uncommon for the entire machine tool envelope (including all axes, spindles, <b>chucks,</b> turrets, <b>tool</b> holders, tailstocks, fixtures, clamps, and stock) to be modeled accurately with 3D solid models, which allows the simulation software to predict fairly accurately whether a cycle will involve a crash. Although such simulation is not new, its accuracy and market penetration are changing considerably because of computing advancements.|$|R
2500|$|Rotary hammers, {{also called}} [...] "combi drills," [...] {{are similar in}} that they also pound the drill bit in and out while it is spinning. However, they use a piston {{mechanism}} instead of a special clutch. This causes them to deliver a much more powerful hammer blow, {{making it possible to}} drill bigger holes much faster. Rotary hammers have such force, in fact, that the usual masonry bits are no longer adequate. Their smooth shanks would be pounded loose from the <b>tool's</b> <b>chuck</b> in a few seconds. Rotary hammers require special bits which lock into the rotary hammer and continue spinning while smashing away.|$|R
40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this paper}} is to give some methodical approach in process planning. Within this it covers the problem of defining the sequence of operations. Quality of the product, production time and production cost determine sequence of operations. The purpose is to analyze their influences and how to apply them in making decisions. Our developed web application can give within closed interval of tolerance, surface roughness and geometric tolerances, fast and precise, sequence operations for observed dimensions. Next steps of develoment web application would be use additional criterions (influence of the primary process, miminal change of machine <b>tools,</b> <b>chucking,</b> connections between dimensions, etc) to make intersection of the solutions [...] Keywords: sequence operations, shape, surface roughness, conversion tolerance-surface roughness...|$|R

The rotary force is supplied through wedges that fit into two or three open grooves. The hammer action actually moves the bit up and down within the chuck since the bit is free to move a short distance. Two sprung balls fit into closed grooves, allowing movement whilst retaining the bit. SDS relies on a tool having the same shank diameter as the chuck; there are three standard sizes: ...|$|R
40|$|The DDP (Demand-driven/Pruning) {{analysis}} algorithm {{allows us}} to perform data-flow analyses of programming languages that are dynamically typed and have higher-order control flow, such as Smalltalk or Scheme. Because it is demand-driven and employs search pruning, it scales to large code bases. However, versions of the algorithm previously described [19] do not handle data polymorphism well, conservatively merging separate data flows that go through distinct instantiations of a collection type. In this paper, we describe a new extension to DDP that helps to disentangle these flows, permitting more precise results. The extension is based on source-tagging classes so that each reference to a class in the source code yields a subdivision of the type associated with that class. An initial implementation of this polyvariant analysis {{has been added to}} the DDP-based <b>tool</b> <b>Chuck,</b> a part of the integrated Squeak program-development environment; we show examples of the tool in action...|$|R
