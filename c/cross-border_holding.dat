40|$|The {{purpose of}} the future {{instrument}} is to promote legal certainty and economic efficiency {{with respect to the}} <b>cross-border</b> <b>holding</b> and disposition of securities held with an intermediary, by harmonising certain legal aspects in this regard. This has become a necessary venture due to the considerable change in market practices within the last 50 years, combined with an everincreasing volume of cross-border activities in the capital markets. It has been widely recognised in recent years that these developments in the practice of holding and disposition of securities have, in a number of respects, outrun the traditional legal framework. The basic rules on the legal nature, transfer and collateral provision of securities were formulated in the days when securities were transferred individually by physical delivery of certificates representing them. Under these rules, there was always a direct relationship between issuers and holders. In the case of registered securities, the investor’s name was always registered in the issuer’s books. In the case of bearer securities, the mere possession of a securities certificate represented or evidenced the direct property interest. The tokens were either physically held by the investors or under their names by an agent, for example a bank or a broker. Any type of transfer of the securities involved a direct or indirect possessory transfer and sometimes entailed the physical transfer of the tokens from one vault to another...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the role of {{offshore}} financial havens in international capital flows. We examine the effects of being a tax haven, a money laundering centre or an offshore financial centre (OFC), which often overlap. We want to see whether these places are used as entrepots (which means temporary storage for funds) or as investment places or both. We mainly use two complementary data sets: bilateral <b>cross-border</b> asset <b>holding</b> and financial intermediation. One is a stock variable and the other one is a flow variable. We apply the gravity model to bilateral <b>cross-border</b> asset <b>holding</b> between 223 host countries and 67 source countries from Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS). We find that tax havens and OFCs attract more asset investment while money laundering centers scare potential investors away. We then use the flow variable of financial intermediation from UNdatabase and find value of financial intermediation is higher in OFCs and lower in money laundering centers. There is no significant relationship between tax haven and financial intermediation. Our results show that the role of offshore havens in facilitating illegal activities like tax evasion and money laundering is overstated i...|$|R

By allowing parameter shifting in the model, we also find the competitive advantages of offshore finance in facilitating tax avoidance or evasion and money laundering have been eroded due to recent years 2 ̆ 7 global action against tax evasion and money laundering...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-country {{model with a}} financial accelerator and endogenous portfolio choice to study how the international transmission of asymmetric shocks is affected when levered investors <b>hold</b> <b>cross-border</b> assets. Foreign exposure in interconnected balance sheets of levered investors {{can act as a}} powerful propagation mechanism across countries. However, in the model financial and real interdependence can be very strong even with minimal balance sheet exposure to foreign illiquid assets, if financial markets are integrated across the board, reflecting a strong pressure towards the cross-border equalization of external finance premia faced by levered investors. In turn, the resulting global “flight to quality ” may bring about tight international linkages in (de-) leveraging and macroeconomic dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} foreign firms are <b>holding</b> <b>cross-border</b> IPOs in {{attempts}} to raise capital in markets outside of their home nation. Within the United States cross-border IPOs consistently experience greater amounts of underpricing than domestic IPOs. This paper examines the effects of SIC industry classifications on cross-border and domestic IPO underpricing from 2004 - 2010. Analysis demonstrates that in various industries, SIC classification has a significant impact upon underpricing in comparison to other industries. While in other industries, significance is solely exhibited through the differing impacts of domestic and cross-border IPOs, within the industry itself, upon underpricing. The most significant industry effect is seen in high-technology industries which display {{a significant impact on}} underpricing on both the inter-industry and intra-industry level...|$|R
40|$|This policy brief is {{intended}} {{to serve as the}} basis for the discussion of the Ministers of Finance on action needed to promote physical infrastructure and reduce intra-regional trade costs, in the context of the Third Meeting of the Finance Ministers of the Americas and the Caribbean held in Lima (Perú), on May 28, 2010. It is argued that the Latin American and Caribbean region must bridge three interrelated policy gaps in order to advance its integration agenda. First, despite advances in trade liberalization, significant progress still must be made to perfect, harmonize, and bridge existing trade agreements. Second, the logistical costs related to the coverage and quality of physical infrastructure and lack of regulatory harmonization pose a serious constraint to regional integration and global competitiveness. Third, although <b>cross-border</b> strategic investments <b>hold</b> the potential to further advance the region¿s integration, their execution would be accelerated by overcoming certain institutional and operational obstacles.

40|$|A {{cross-border}} listing {{occurs when}} an individual company establishes a secondary listing on a stock exchange abroad. In this paper, we analyze and compare the arbitrage proportions (through violation of put-call parity) of publicly traded cross-listed Canadian stocks, and those of industry and performance matched US domestically-listed shares. The cross-listed Canadian stocks are listed on both of the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and either the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). Arbitrage opportunities exist when put-call parity is violated. Our empirical results show that in most circumstances, both domestic put-call parity and <b>cross-border</b> put-call parity <b>hold</b> well in the two countries. However, in Canadian market, {{a high proportion of}} arbitrage op-portunities could be detected in closing prices on the particular date of March 14, 2007. On March 14 th 2007, many of the observations in the Canadian market contained arbi-trage opportunities. Both domestic and cross-border put-call parity was violated. However, we fail to find the same phenomenon in the US market. In the US market, opportunities for arbitrage occur rarely and sporadically. We also find that the option trading volume in the Canadian market is lower than that in the US market, and during dramatic market price drops, the option trading volume remains at a low level...|$|R
40|$|Without any tax {{sovereignty}} {{of its own}} and faced with a substantial decline in the volume of "traditional own resources" (customs duties, agricultural levies, sugar levies), the European Union is left with a very low level of revenue autonomy. The EU budget is financed primarily from national contributions by the member states. Hence, controversies {{are more and more}} likely to arise over the EU budget and, in the long run, the Union is at risk of being underfinanced. Moreover, there is a growing contradiction between the absence of EU {{tax sovereignty}}, on the one hand, and the intensified pace of European integration, on the other hand. Despite the associated increase of cross-border externalities (mainly environmental damage), no recourse is being taken to taxation at the European level as a steering instrument. Another point worth noting in this context is that EU funds are used to finance a range of "European public goods" and activities with positive <b>cross-border</b> externalities. This <b>holds,</b> in particular, for expenditure for research, education and the transport infrastructure, which is subject to decisions taken at the European level. With a view to fiscal equivalence, it would be appropriate also to collect the taxes required to finance such expenditure at the European level. Apart from that, any attempt to reform the EU's system of own resources should also be aimed at its simplification. EU Finanzrahmen 2006 - 2013 Finanzierung...|$|R
