5000|$|The Marxist labor {{theory of}} value has been criticised on several counts. Some {{argue that it}} predicts that profits will be higher in labor-intensive {{industries}} than in capital-intensive industries, which would be contradicted by empirical data, even if Marx has never 'mechanically' simplified the matter in these terms, as capital itself is product of past labour, thus, the 'general tendency of falling profit' does not concern or invalidate the labour origin of value, present in both live and dead labour (capital)(cf chapter 1 and 24 of Das Kapital). This is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Great Contradiction". In volume 3 of Capital, Marx explains why profits are not distributed according to which industries are the most labor-intensive and why this is consistent with his theory. Whether or not {{this is consistent with the}} labor theory of value as presented in volume 1 has been a topic of debate. According to Marx, surplus value is extracted by the capitalist class as a whole and then distributed according to the amount of total capital, not the just variable component. In the example given earlier, of making a cup of coffee, the constant capital involved in production is the coffee beans themselves, and the variable capital is the value added by the coffee maker. The value added by the coffee maker is dependent on its technological capabilities, and the coffee maker can only add so much total value to cups of coffee over its lifespan. The amount of value added to the product is thus the amortization of the value of the coffeemaker. We can also note that not all products have equal proportions of value added by amortized capital. Capital intensive industries such as finance may have a large <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> while labor-intensive industries like traditional agriculture would have a relatively small one.|$|E

Evidence on TFP determinants suggests that,besides cyclical factors, TFP growth reflects the impact of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms. The interaction of both factors in TFP behavior is worth noting. Evidence suggests also that, under conditions of high macroeconomic instability, the effects of a structural reform on TFP are smaller, and vice versa.

40|$|Should we use ex post or ex ante {{measures}} of user costs {{to calculate the}} <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> in a growth accounting exercise? The answer, based on a simple model of temporary equilibrium, is that ex post is better in theory. In practice researchers usually calculate ex post user costs by assuming {{that the rate of}} return is equalized across assets. But this is only true if expectations are correct. In general, the ex post rate of return differs between assets, even though ex ante it is the same. I propose a hybrid method. The index of capital services is estimated using ex ante weights; the <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> is the growth of this index multiplied by the ex post income share of capital.
