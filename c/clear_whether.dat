5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s old {{ammunition}} stocks for the D-1 {{were removed from}} the Soviet inventory. The only shells retained were the OF-530, O-530, G-530/G-530Sh, and possibly chemical shells. The Soviet Army also possessed a 152mm nuclear shell, but it is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> that shell could be used with the D-1.|$|E
5|$|It is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> {{the members}} of the Ministerium {{intended}} for this to be a permanent break, or a temporary protest. Regardless, it became permanent when the officials at the next Gathering of the General Synod refused to admit the delegates from the Ministerium. Thus, the Ministerium found themselves on their own.|$|E
5|$|It is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> the {{recipients}} of Hsu's campaign contributions will be added as defendants {{to any of the}} lawsuits as the various funds seek solvent entities from which to recover their initial investments.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} repeated, random <b>clearing</b> (<b>whether</b> by natural disturbance or human activity) is that contiguous cover can break down into isolated patches. This {{happens when the}} area cleared exceed a critical level, which means that landscapes exhibit two phases: connected and disconnected.|$|R

5|$|Out {{of three}} species {{that have been}} extirpated in Canada in written history, two have since been reintroduced. It is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> a fourth species, the {{aforementioned}} sea mink, was ever a resident of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E
5|$|Oslac is said by the Historia Eliensis to {{have had}} a son named Thorth, that is, Thored. His {{successor}} was indeed a man named Thored, but it is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> this was Thored Oslac's son or Thored son of Gunner; historians tend to favour the idea that Thored the successor was son of Gunner.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{not quite}} <b>clear</b> though <b>whether</b> Werner's {{apprenticeship}} years are really {{a thing of the}} past as stories involving occasional working for Röhrich remain a mainstay within the Werner comics.|$|R
5|$|Studies of {{children}} who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received. In one investigation, some institution-reared boys were reported to be inattentive, overactive, and markedly unselective in their social relationships, while girls, foster-reared children, and some institution-reared children were not. It is not yet <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> these behaviors {{should be considered as}} part of disordered attachment.|$|E
5|$|When {{the system}} was first being {{proposed}} it was not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> the phased-array systems could provide the accuracy needed to guide the missiles to a successful interception at very long ranges. Early concepts retained Zeus Missile Tracking Radars and Target Tracking Radars (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and these additional radars were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Chanel {{bought the}} five acre plot on which La Pausa {{was built for}} 1.8 million French francs in February 1929. The plot had {{formerly}} {{been part of the}} hunting grounds of the ruling family of Monaco, the Grimaldis, and contained wild olive and orange groves. The villa was built less than a year later. The final cost of the villa was 6 million francs, a large sum for the time. It is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> Chanel or her lover, Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster financed the building and furnishing of La Pausa. La Pausa was built by architect Robert Streitz, who sought to build 'the ideal Mediterranean villa'.|$|E
2500|$|Moroccan {{linguist}} Mohamed Chafik {{claims that}} 80 percent of Moroccans are Berbers. It is not <b>clear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> he means [...] "speakers of Berber languages" [...] or [...] "people of Berber descent".|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{developmental}} biology {{have shown that}} monozygous twins {{may not be as}} phenotypically identical as once believed, and the mechanisms responsible for such differences are now becoming <b>clearer.</b> <b>Whether</b> such phenotypic differences are capable of triggering graft rejection of an organ transplanted between identical twins remains unknown but the risks seem low, and long-term transplant outcome is excellent. Available evidence to guide immunosuppressive therapy in this setting is limited but a prudent approach would include the use of steroids together with a calcineurin inhibitor after transplantation. However, once the inevitable inflammatory response associated with transplant surgery has resolved, cautious reduction and eventually withdrawal of immunosuppression should be possible...|$|R
5|$|Chesney died in 1174, {{having had}} three daughters {{with his wife}} Gilla. Her ancestry is unknown, and it is {{possible}} that William married another time, to Aubrey de Poynings, because a Lewes Priory charter dated to around 1165 names a William de Chesney and Aubrey his wife, but it is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> this charter is referring to William de Chesney the sheriff or to another William. William and Gilla's daughters were Margaret, Clemence, and Sara, all of whom were unmarried {{at the time of their}} father's death. Margaret married twice– first to Hugh de Cressy and second to Robert fitzRoger. Clemence married Jordan de Sackville, and Sara married Richard Engaine. Margaret inherited the majority of her father's estates.|$|E
5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|In her car, {{she packed}} clothing, toiletries, college textbooks, and birth-control pills. When her room was searched later, campus police {{discovered}} {{most of her}} belongings packed in boxes and the art removed from the walls. It's not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> Murray packed them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd packed between Sunday night and Monday morning. On top of the boxes was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating trouble in their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in her black 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E

50|$|A toxicologic {{examination}} of his {{remains in the}} mid-20th century confirmed centuries-old rumors that the Pope had been poisoned with lead sugar. It is not <b>clear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> he was murdered or whether the lead sugar was used as medicine.|$|R
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and it is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
5|$|M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of {{the total}} population; their spectra {{resemble}} that of iron-nickel. Some {{are believed to have}} formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope {{does not appear to be}} primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7AU. It is not yet <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.|$|E
5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, fetal {{immune cells}} {{have also been}} {{frequently}} found in breast cancer stroma as compared to samples taken from healthy women. It is not <b>clear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> fetal cell lines promote the development of tumors or, contrarily, protect women from developing breast carcinoma.|$|R
50|$|It is not <b>clear,</b> however, <b>whether</b> the Eva {{presented}} by Cozans {{is the same}} Eva introduced in Stowe's novel or a different character altogether, although {{the similarities between the}} two would suggest that this is the same Eva introduced in Uncle Tom's Cabin.|$|R
50|$|There is no <b>clear</b> {{indication}} <b>whether</b> agriculture {{or animal}} breeding predominated within Bronze Age communities, with research revealing that both were being practiced together {{within the same}} area. But as populations stabilized, they tended towards a pastoral East and a farm-dominated West.|$|R
5|$|Precise modern {{models of}} the Big Bang appeal to various exotic {{physical}} phenomena {{that have not been}} observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the Standard Model of particle physics. Of these features, dark matter is currently subjected to the most active laboratory investigations. Remaining issues include the cuspy halo problem and the dwarf galaxy problem of cold dark matter. Dark energy is also an area of intense interest for scientists, but it is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> direct detection of dark energy will be possible. Inflation and baryogenesis remain more speculative features of current Big Bang models. Viable, quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being sought. These are currently unsolved problems in physics.|$|E
5|$|Relatively speaking, bites {{from this}} species are not highly dangerous. In Britain {{there have been}} only 14 known {{fatalities}} since 1876—the last a 5-year-old child in 1975—and one near fatal bite of a 39-year-old woman in Essex in 1998. An 82-year-old woman died following a bite in Germany in 2004, although it is not <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> her death was due to the effect of the venom. Even so, professional medical help should always be sought as soon as possible after any bite. Very occasionally bites can be life-threatening, particularly in small children, while adults may experience discomfort and disability long after the bite. The length of recovery varies, but may take up to a year.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians seem to {{have offered}} Philip Pydna in {{exchange}} for Amphipolis, perhaps during the later stages of the siege, {{but it is not}} <b>clear</b> <b>whether</b> Philip agreed to this. By this stage, the Social War of 357–355 BC had broken out between Athens and their erstwhile allies, and they would now have been unable to intervene to help Amphipolis. Philip eventually succeeded in breaching the walls of Amphipolis, through the use of siege engines and battering rams; his forces then stormed and captured the city. Philip expelled those who were hostile to him but, according to Diodorus, treated {{the rest of the population}} considerately.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Gladiator was {{approached}} by Lilandra for information and Marvel Girl read his mind while Lilandra tried to seduce him.
