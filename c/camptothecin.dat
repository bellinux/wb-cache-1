5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like <b>camptothecin</b> (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and taxol (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E

In 1986, RTI was awarded a $4 million contract with the National Cancer Institute to conduct an eight-year clinical trial on the effects of an anti-smoking campaign.

25|$|Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, {{irinotecan}} and topotecan, are semi-synthetically {{derived from}} <b>camptothecin,</b> which is {{obtained from the}} Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata.

The second group, catalytic inhibitors, are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase II, and therefore prevent DNA synthesis and translation because the DNA cannot unwind properly. This group includes novobiocin, merbarone, and aclarubicin, which also have other significant mechanisms of action.|$|E

25|$|Another drug class {{originating}} from the NCI was the camptothecins. <b>Camptothecin,</b> {{derived from a}} Chinese ornamental tree, inhibits topoisomerase I, an enzyme that allows DNA unwinding. Despite showing promise in preclinical studies, the agent had little antitumour activity in early clinical trials, and dosing was limited by kidney toxicity: its lactone ring is unstable at neutral pH, so while in the acidic environment of the kidneys it becomes active, damaging the renal tubules. In 1996 a more stable analogue, irinotecan, won Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval {{for the treatment of}} colon cancer.

50|$|Human DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) is an {{essential}} enzyme that relaxes DNA supercoiling during replication and transcription. Top1 generates DNA single-strand breaks that allow rotation of the cleaved strand around the double helix axis. Top1 also religates the cleaved strand to reestablish intact duplex DNA.The Top1-DNA intermediates, known as cleavage complexes, are transient and at low levels under normal circumstances. However, treatment with Top1 inhibitors, such as the <b>camptothecins,</b> stabilize the cleavable complexes, prevent DNA religation and induce lethal DNA strand breaks. Cancer cells are selectively sensitive to the generation of these DNA lesions.|$|R

30|$|Our {{results show}} no {{immediate}} hypoxia reduction, {{both in terms}} of %ID/g of FAZA tumor uptake and tumor hypoxic fraction, on days 2 to 4 after treatment with free irinotecan or nal-IRI. This is consistent with the mechanism of action of <b>camptothecins,</b> which requires a prolonged exposure time to SN- 38 for maximum cytotoxic effects [33]. Free irinotecan is rapidly cleared from plasma and tumor tissue, thereby not allowing sufficient time for tumor cells to be exposed to SN- 38. Only with the nal-IRI treatment at 10  mg/kg did the tumors maintain their pre-treatment hypoxia level on day 7 and beyond following treatment initiation, despite significant initial increases in their tumor volumes, thus suggesting changes in the tumor microenvironment. Previous experiments in an HT- 29 tumor model grown in NOD-SCID mice have shown that the 10  mg/kg nal-IRI dose achieves a prolonged SN- 38 tumor duration of ~ 96  h, while the exposure with 50  mg/kg free irinotecan is ~ 36  h [24]. Similar to the published report on another liposomal irinotecan formulation, irinophore C [28], data from this study showed that tumors presented a less hypoxic profile following the 10  mg/kg nal-IRI treatment, and the prolonged SN- 38 exposure resulted in decreased cellular density thus potentially alleviating solid stress and reducing blood vessel compression during tumor growth [34]. It has been shown that irinotecan and other <b>camptothecins</b> can inhibit the hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α) protein accumulation in vivo. This can interfere with the capacity of tumor cells to adapt to a hypoxic environment [10] and may increase their treatment sensitivity [1]. Furthermore, the modulation of HIF- 1 α protein levels has been reported to occur independently of significant changes in intratumoral hypoxia [10]. However, this study was aimed at quantifying longitudinal tumor hypoxia changes and could not address these mechanistic questions.|$|R

Here we investigated the influence of pH and HSA on the lactone-carboxy equilibrium, HSA binding, and cytotoxicity of 9 ACG. Methods Microfiltration and HPLC were {{used to measure the}} influence of pH on lactone to carboxy conversion and HSA binding of 9 ACG as compared to other <b>camptothecins.</b> In vitro cytotoxicity of drugs was determined against EJ human bladder carcinoma cells and CL 1 - 5 human lung cancer cells. Results The rate of lactone to carboxy conversion was similar for 9 ACG and 9 AC. Decreasing the pH from 7. 6 to 6. 0 increased the equilibrium levels of the lactone forms of the drugs from 20 to almost 95 % of total drug. HSA moderately diminished the amount of free 9 ACG lactone but did not change the ratio of 9 ACG lactone to 9 ACG carboxy. Consistent with the effect of pH on lactone levels, lowering the pH of EJ human bladder carcinoma cells from 7. 6 to 6. 8 decreased the IC 50 of 9 ACG from 480 to 98 nM and 9 AC from 33 to 12 nM. Activation of 9 ACG by human b-glucuronidase anchored on the surface of EJ cells further decreased its IC 50 value to 26 nM. Although HSA significantly decreased the cytotoxicity of 9 AC and 9 ACG, activation of 9 ACG at cancer cells with an antibody-b-glucuronidase immunoconjugate produced greater cytotoxicity than 9 AC.

The enzyme is {{the main}} target of antitumor agents, such as <b>camptothecins</b> (CPT), that transform top 1 into a DNA-damaging agent. Results: By directed evolution of a C-terminal portion, we selected human top 1 mutants that were 22 – 28 -fold more CPT-sensitive than wild-type top 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The evolved enzymes showed unique mutation patterns and were more processive in plasmid relaxation assays. A top 1 mutant had only two amino acid changes in the linker domain, one of which may change a linker/core domain contact surface. The mutant stimulated DNA cleavage to higher levels than the wild-type enzyme and was more sensitive to CPT in a cleavage assay. Moreover, the mutant was more CPT-sensitive than wild-type top 1 in a repair-deficient yeast strain. Conclusions: Mutations in the linker domain can affect DNA binding and CPT sensitivity of human top 1.
