25|$|According to {{researchers}} John F. Morton and T. Roberts, disproportionate vulnerability to climate disasters is socially determined. For example, socioeconomic and policy trends affecting smallholder and subsistence farmers limit {{their capacity to}} adapt to change. According to W. Baethgen who studied the vulnerability of Latin American agriculture to <b>climate</b> <b>change,</b> <b>a</b> history of policies and economic dynamics has negatively impacted rural farmers. During the 1950s and through the 1980s, high inflation and appreciated real exchange rates reduced the value of agricultural exports. As a result, farmers in Latin America received lower prices for their products compared to world market prices. Following these outcomes, Latin American policies and national crop programs aimed to stimulate agricultural intensification. These national crop programs benefitted larger commercial farmers more. In the 1980s and 1990s low world market prices for cereals and livestock resulted in decreased agricultural growth and increased rural poverty.|$|E
25|$|The Sierra Nevada {{still faces}} {{a number of}} issues that {{threaten}} its conservation. Logging occurs on both private and public lands, including controversial clearcut methods and thinning logging on private and public lands. Grazing occurs on private lands as well as on National Forest lands, which include Wilderness areas. Overgrazing can alter hydrologic processes and vegetation composition, remove vegetation that serves as food and habitat for native species, and contribute to sedimentation and pollution in waterways. A recent increase in large wildfires like the Rim Fire in Yosemite National Park and the Stanislaus National Forest and the King Fire on the Eldorado National Forest, has prompted concerns. A 2015 study indicated that the increase in fire risk in California may be attributable to human-induced <b>climate</b> <b>change.</b> <b>A</b> study looking back over 8,000 years found that warmer climate periods experienced severe droughts and more stand-replacing fires and concluded that as climate is such a powerful influence on wildfires, trying to recreate presettlement forest structure is likely impossible in a warmer future.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{purposes}} {{to analyze}} economic aspects of defined climate policies applying the AIM/CGE[Global] model {{to understand the}} economic consequences of abating {{a large amount of}} greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dangerous <b>climate</b> <b>change.</b> <b>As</b> a result, higher carbon prices and larger decreases in GDP are observed when emissions are abated more deeply. However, such GDP losses are rather small and insignificant compared to the GDP growth throughout this century.

[...] Tyler Hamilton, in his review of the book for The Toronto Star, wrote: [...] "Whereas the first third of Romm's book presents overwhelming and disturbing evidence that human-caused greenhouse gases are the primary ingredients behind global warming, the pages that follow offer alarming detail on how the U.S. public is being misled by a federal government (backed by conservative political forces) that is intent on inaction, and that's also on a mission to derail international efforts to curb emissions."

500|$|A General Circulation Model (GCM) is a {{mathematical}} model {{that can be used}} in computer simulations of the global circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean. [...] An atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) is essentially the same as a global numerical weather prediction model, and some (such as the one used in the UK Unified Model) can be configured for both short-term weather forecasts and longer-term climate predictions. [...] Along with sea ice and land-surface components, AGCMs and oceanic GCMs (OGCM) are key components of global climate models, and are widely applied for understanding the climate and projecting climate change. [...] For aspects of <b>climate</b> <b>change,</b> <b>a</b> range of man-made chemical emission scenarios can be fed into the climate models to see how an enhanced greenhouse effect would modify the Earth's climate. [...] Versions designed for climate applications with time scales of decades to centuries were originally created in 1969 by Syukuro Manabe and Kirk Bryan at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. [...] When run for multiple decades, computational limitations mean that the models must use a coarse grid that leaves smaller-scale interactions unresolved.|$|E
