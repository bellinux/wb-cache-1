40|$|The LR- 56 <b>cask</b> is an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), type B (U) {{certified}} Medium to High Level Radioactive Liquid Waste Transport <b>Cask.</b> The LR- 56 {{consists of}} a trailer equipped with the following component and systems: cubic meter lead shielded cask; Self-contained ventilation system including an air pressure/vacuum pump for <b>cask</b> loading and unloading; Waste temperature, level, leak detection, and other surveillance equipment; Control room for control of loading and unloading operations and waste surveillance; Hoist system for removing well caps on the cask; Power connection and control connections for operating the <b>cask</b> from a remote facility; The <b>cask</b> may be unloaded or loaded using either the onboard pressure/vacuum pump or by an external waste transfer pump. Rinse heads and connections allow the <b>cask</b> to be rinsed using supplied rinse water. The <b>cask</b> {{was designed to be}} vented using the LR- 56 onboard ventilation system, which is connected to the <b>cask</b> via a hose through a penetration in the <b>cask.</b> Three wells located {{on the top of the}} <b>cask,</b> offer valved penetrations into the <b>cask</b> for venting, waste pumping, and rinsing. Other penetrations in the <b>cask</b> enable surveillance instrumentation to be used to monitor inside the <b>cask.</b> To date, the LR- 56 <b>cask</b> system at the Hanford facility has not been used. Since the vessel has never received radioactive waste, the LR- 56 is not yet a regulated system. It is desired to use the LR- 56 <b>cask</b> to transport waste in calendar year 2000...|$|R
25|$|Single <b>cask</b> (also {{known as}} single barrel) whiskies are bottled from an {{individual}} <b>cask,</b> and often the bottles are labelled with specific barrel and bottle numbers. The taste of these whiskies may vary substantially from <b>cask</b> to <b>cask</b> within a brand.|$|R
40|$|Membrane-associated {{guanylate}} kinase (MAGUK) proteins {{interact with}} several synaptogenesis-triggering adhesion molecules. However, direct {{evidence for the}} involvement of MAGUK proteins in synapse formation is lacking. In this study, we investigate the function of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (<b>CASK),</b> a MAGUK protein, in dendritic spine formation by RNA interference. Knockdown of <b>CASK</b> in cultured hippocampal neurons reduces spine density and shrinks dendritic spines. Our analysis of {{the time course of}} RNA interference and <b>CASK</b> overexpression experiments further suggests that <b>CASK</b> stabilizes or maintains spine morphology. Experiments using only the <b>CASK</b> PDZ domain or a mutant lacking the protein 4. 1 –binding site indicate an involvement of <b>CASK</b> in linking transmembrane adhesion molecules and the actin cytoskeleton. We also find that <b>CASK</b> is SUMOylated. Conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO 1) to <b>CASK</b> reduces the interaction between <b>CASK</b> and protein 4. 1. Overexpression of a CASK–SUMO 1 fusion construct, which mimicks <b>CASK</b> SUMOylation, impairs spine formation. Our study suggests that <b>CASK</b> contributes to spinogenesis and that this is controlled by SUMOylation...|$|R
5|$|Expenditures {{were also}} subject to {{documentation}} in the Pipe rolls. Among the recorded expenditures are payments for carts and cart horses, wages for royal servants, payments for improvements to royal manors and houses, royal gifts to persons, hunting expenses, payments {{to acquire a}} governmental office, payments to mercenaries, {{and the costs of}} bags and <b>casks</b> to transport silver pennies about the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Fermentation is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into <b>casks</b> for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|E
5|$|The {{nuclear waste}} was {{planned to be}} shipped to the site by rail and/or truck in robust {{containers}} known as spent nuclear fuel shipping <b>casks,</b> approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

40|$|The {{decommissioning}} of the 324 Facility B Cell {{includes the}} onsite transport of grouted remote-handled radioactive waste from the 324 Facility to the 200 Areas for disposal. The grouted waste has been transported in the leased ATG Nuclear Services 3 - 82 B Radioactive Waste Shipping <b>Cask</b> (3 - 82 B <b>cask).</b> Because the 3 - 82 B <b>cask</b> is a U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) -certified Type B shipping <b>cask,</b> the lease cost is high, and the <b>cask</b> {{operations in the}} onsite environment may not be optimal. An alternatives study has been performed to develop cost and schedule information on alternative waste transportation systems to assist in determining which system {{should be used in}} the future. Five alternatives were identified for evaluation. These included continued lease of the 3 - 82 B <b>cask,</b> fabrication of a new 3 - 82 B <b>cask,</b> development and fabrication of an onsite <b>cask,</b> modification of the existing U. S.

40|$|A crush pad {{has been}} {{designed}} and analyzed to absorb the kinetic energy of an accidentally dropped spent nuclear fuel shipping <b>cask</b> into a 44 ft. deep <b>cask</b> unloading pool. Conventional analysis techniques available for evaluating a <b>cask</b> for tipping due to lateral seismic forces assume that the <b>cask</b> rests on a rigid surface. In this analysis, the <b>cask</b> (110 tons) sits on a stainless steel encased (0. 25 in. top plate), polyurethane foam (4 ft. thick) crush pad. As the <b>cask</b> tends to rock due to horizontal seismic forces, the contact area between the <b>cask</b> and the crush pad is reduced, increasing the bearing stress, and causing the pivoting corner of the <b>cask</b> to depress into the crush pad. As the crush pad depresses under the <b>cask</b> corner, the pivot point shifts from the corner toward the <b>cask</b> center, which facilitates rocking and potential tipping of the <b>cask.</b> Subsequent rocking of the <b>cask</b> may deepen the depression, further contributing to the likelihood of <b>cask</b> tip over. However, as the depression is created, the crush pad is absorbing energy from the rocking <b>cask.</b> Potential tip over of the <b>cask</b> was evaluated by performing a non-linear, dynamic, finite element analysis with acceleration time history input. This time history analysis captured {{the effect of a}} deforming crush pad, and also eliminated conservatisms of the conventional approaches. For comparison purposes, this analysis was also performed with the <b>cask</b> sitting on a solid stainless steel crush pad. Results indicate that the conventional methods are quite conservative relative to the more exacting time history analysis. They also indicate that the rocking motion is less on the foam crush pad than on the solid stainless steel pad...|$|R
40|$|Calcium (Ca 2 +) /calmodulin (CaM) -dependent kinase II (CaMKII) {{activity}} plays {{a fundamental}} role in learning and memory. A key feature of CaMKII in memory formation {{is its ability}} to be regulated by autophosphorylation, which switches its activity on and off during synaptic plasticity. The synaptic scaffolding protein <b>CASK</b> (calcium (Ca 2 +) /calmodulin (CaM) associated serine kinase) is also important for learning and memory, as mutations in <b>CASK</b> result in intellectual disability and neurological defects in humans. We show that in Drosophila larvae, <b>CASK</b> interacts with CaMKII to control neuronal growth and calcium signalling. Furthermore, deletion of the CaMK-like and L 27 domains of <b>CASK</b> (<b>CASK</b> β null) or expression of overactive CaMKII (T 287 D) produced similar effects on synaptic growth and Ca 2 + signalling. <b>CASK</b> overexpression rescues the effects of CaMKII overactivity, consistent with the notion that <b>CASK</b> and CaMKII act in a common pathway that controls these neuronal processes. The reduction in Ca 2 + signalling observed in the <b>CASK</b> β null mutant caused a decrease in vesicle trafficking at synapses. In addition, the decrease in Ca 2 + signalling in <b>CASK</b> mutants was associated with an increase in Ether-&# 224;-go-go (EAG) potassium (K+) channel localisation to synapses. Reducing EAG restored the decrease in Ca 2 + signalling observed in <b>CASK</b> mutants to the level of wildtype, suggesting that <b>CASK</b> regulates Ca 2 + signalling via EAG. <b>CASK</b> knockdown reduced both appetitive associative learning and odour evoked Ca 2 + responses in Drosophila mushroom bodies, which are the learning centres of Drosophila. Expression of human <b>CASK</b> in Drosophila rescued the effect of <b>CASK</b> deletion on the activity state of CaMKII, suggesting that human <b>CASK</b> may also regulate CaMKII autophosphorylation...|$|R
5|$|The small fleet {{continued}} for six more days in fine weather, followed by four stormy days. By this time water {{was once again}} dangerously short. The ships spotted an inlet close to another city, Champotón, and a landing party discovered fresh water. Armed Maya warriors approached from the city while the water <b>casks</b> were being filled. Communication was once again attempted with signs. Night fell {{by the time the}} water <b>casks</b> had been filled and the attempts at communication concluded. In the darkness the Spaniards could hear the movements of large numbers of Maya warriors. They decided that a night-time retreat would be too risky; instead, they posted guards and waited for dawn. At sunrise, the Spanish saw that they had been surrounded by a sizeable army. The massed Maya warriors launched an assault with missiles, including arrows, darts and stones; they then charged into hand-to-hand combat with spears and clubs. Eighty of the defenders were wounded in the initial barrage of missiles, and two Spaniards were captured in the frantic mêlée that followed. All of the Spanish party received wounds, including Hernández de Córdoba. The Spanish regrouped in a defensive formation and forced passage to the shore, where their discipline collapsed and a frantic scramble for the boats ensued, leaving the Spanish vulnerable to the pursuing Maya warriors who waded into the sea behind them. Most of the precious water <b>casks</b> were abandoned on the beach. When the surviving Spanish reached the safety of the ships, they realised that they had lost over fifty men, more than half their number. Five men died from their wounds in the following days. The battle had lasted only an hour, and the Spanish named the locale as the Coast of the Disastrous Battle. They were now far from help and low on supplies; too many men had been lost and injured to sail all three ships back to Cuba. They decided to abandon their smallest ship, the brigantine, although it was purchased on credit from Governor Velásquez of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Word of the {{incident}} spread quickly upon Chesapeakes return to Norfolk, where the British squadron that included Leopard was provisioning. Mobs of angry citizens destroyed twohundred water <b>casks</b> destined for the squadron and nearly killed a British lieutenant before local authorities intervened. President Jefferson recalled all USwarships from the Mediterranean and issued a proclamation: all British warships were banned from entering USports and those already in port were to depart. The incident {{eventually led to the}} Embargo Act of 1807.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet slowly {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The <b>casks</b> brought from Cuba were leaking and the expedition was now running dangerously low on fresh water; {{the hunt for}} more became an overriding priority as the expedition advanced, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the day of Saint Lazarus, another city was spotted and named San Lázaro by the Spanish – it is now known by its original Maya name, Campeche. A large contingent put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats to fill their water <b>casks</b> in a freshwater pool. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. They were led amongst large buildings until they stood before a blood-caked altar, {{where many of the}} city's inhabitants crowded around. The Indians piled reeds before the visitors; this act was followed by a procession of armed Maya warriors in full war paint, followed by ten Maya priests. The Maya set fire to the reeds and indicated that the Spanish would be killed if they were not gone by the time the reeds had been consumed. The Spanish party withdrew in defensive formation to the shore and rapidly boarded their boats to retreat to the safety of the ships.|$|E

40|$|<b>CASK</b> is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved multidomain protein {{composed of}} an N-terminal Ca 2 _/calmodulin-kinase domain, central PDZ and SH 3 domains, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase domain. Many potential activities for <b>CASK</b> have been suggested, including functions in scaffolding the synapse, in organizing ion channels, and in regulating neuronal gene transcription. To better define the physiological importance of <b>CASK,</b> {{we have now}} analyzed <b>CASK</b> ‘‘knockdown’’ mice in which <b>CASK</b> expression was suppressed by _ 70 %, and <b>CASK</b> knockout (KO) mice, in which <b>CASK</b> expression was abolished. <b>CASK</b> knockdown mice are viable but smaller than WT mice, whereas <b>CASK</b> KO mice die at first day after birth. <b>CASK</b> KO mice exhibit no major developmental abnormalities apart from a partially penetrant cleft palate syndrome. In CASK-deficient neurons, the levels of the CASK-interacting proteins Mints, Veli/ Mals, and neurexins are decreased, whereas the level of neuroligin 1 (which binds to neurexins that in turn bind to <b>CASK)</b> is increased. Neurons lacking <b>CASK</b> display overall normal electrical properties and form ultrastructurally normal synapses. However, glutamatergic spontaneous synaptic release events are increased, and GABAergic synaptic release events are decreased in CASK-deficient neurons. In contrast to spontaneous neurotransmitter release, evoked release exhibited no major changes. Our data suggest that <b>CASK,</b> {{the only member of}} the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family that contains a Ca 2 _/calmodulin-dependent kinase domain, is required for mouse survival and performs a selectively essential function without being in itself required for core activities of neurons, such as membrane excitability, Ca 2 _- triggered presynaptic release, or postsynaptic receptor functions...|$|R
5|$|Since the 16th century, the English word keep has {{commonly}} referred to large towers in castles.

5|$|As {{the ship}} was {{intended}} {{to function as a}} floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with victuals (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The <b>casks</b> used for storage on the Mary Rose have been compared with those from a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the Tudor navy were given high priority, and their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time. As a miniature society at sea, the wreck of the Mary Rose held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be {{lightened}} forward. Water <b>casks</b> used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into the cabins, Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to admit that the situation had become desperate.|$|E

40|$|In 2003, {{representatives from}} the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) {{requested}} development of a project {{with the objective of}} determining the performance of a concrete spent nuclear fuel storage <b>cask.</b> Radiation and environmental effects may cause chemical alteration of the concrete that could result in excessive cracking, spalling, and loss of compressive strength. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) project team and CRIEPI representatives identified the Ventilated Storage <b>Cask</b> (VSC- 17) spent nuclear fuel storage <b>cask</b> as a candidate to study <b>cask</b> performance, because it had been used to store fuel as part of a dry <b>cask</b> storage demonstration project for more than 15 years. The project involved investigating the properties of the concrete shield. INL performed a survey of the <b>cask</b> in the summers of 2003 and 2004.
