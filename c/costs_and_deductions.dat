40|$|Although the {{existence}} of the corporate tax itself is a subject of controversy, it has been currently implemented in all EU countries except of Estonia where only distributed profits are taxed. The statutory (nominal) rate of the corporate tax itself does not say very much {{about the size of the}} corporate tax burden. This rate currently (on 31 / 10 / 2011) differs by 25 % in the EU countries (10 % in Bulgaria, Cyprus vs. 35 % in Malta). For at least approximate determination of the effective (real) corporate tax burden, effective rates of corporate taxes are being used. The differences between the statutory and effective rates are affected by many factors. It can be assumed that a significant deviation of the nominal rate from the effective (real) one can be caused mainly by {{the existence}} of different methods and time of depreciation, possibility of group taxation, investment incentives or losses compensation, amount of property taxes and property transfer taxes, application of VAT on input, possibilities of <b>costs</b> <b>deduction</b> <b>and</b> other various tax exemptions and credits.

40|$|A {{theme that}} emerges from the {{empirical}} literature into the impact of road traffic congestion on supply chains is the compounding effect of consignee behaviour on distribution costs: even as congestion levels rise, customers of manufacturers/distributors replenish product on a just-in-time (JIT) basis, which further drives up distribution costs. The reluctance of customers to receive shipments outside business hours exacerbates the distribution task. Since {{the isolation of the}} impact of congestion on logistics costs is not always easy, organisations may be tempted to unjustifiably impute rising logistics costs to congestion. Through continuous approximation models, the present research aims to clarify the relative impact of relevant dimensions of consignee behaviour, particularly, JIT replenishment and the length of the workday, and traffic congestion on distribution costs. A critical element of such modelling is the estimation of the required number of vehicles, which in turn depends on the average daily number of commercial trip chains per vehicle. We identify two polar cases. In one case, the estimation of this number is trivial and therefore enables further analysis, including the quantification of the relative impact of congestion on distribution <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> the <b>deduction</b> of empirically testable hypotheses. The other case is considerably less tractable; we consider a specific instance of this case that was broadly relevant to one of the companies that participated in the research. A simulation experiment using real-world data from a NZ manufacturer-distributor serves to validate our analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|Since 1994 the {{majority}} of Russian agricultural enterprises have been unprofitable, and have accumulated large liabilities. Their reorganization and liability restructuring is necessary. However, {{the differences in the}} financial standing of enterprises should be identified and taken into consideration. Here arises an important methodological task: to choose relevant studies, i. e. criteria for enterprise selection and classification by qualitatively different groups depending upon their financial and economic standing. This is a complex and still unsolved task. This article offers to evaluate the financial standing of an unprofitable enterprise by means of the ratio of the sufficiency coefficient to cover factor costs (K 1). Factor costs are determined as a sum of labour <b>costs,</b> depreciation <b>deductions</b> <b>and</b> land <b>costs.</b> K 1 enables one to evaluate the ability to preserve basic factors of production. K 2 and K 3 ratios, which make it possible to account for enterprise ability to survive by means of minimization of depreciation <b>deductions</b> <b>and</b> accumulation of accounts payable, are composed similarly. The ratios between enterprise liability levels and different asset components are also offered, and these make it possible to classify the enterprises by their liability level. Experimental confirmation of the developed scheme were performed with the figures of agricultural enterprises of the Leningrad Region (Oblast) for 1998. These enterprises were classified into five groups. Different approaches to their reorganization were offered. ...|$|R
