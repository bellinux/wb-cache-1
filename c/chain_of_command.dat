5|$|The Home Army's {{commander}} was subordinate in {{the military}} <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> to the Polish Commander-in-Chief (General Inspector of the Armed Forces) of the Polish Government in Exile and answered in the civilian <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> to the Government Delegation for Poland.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government {{established}} the armed services as separate organisations. Each service had an independent <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command.</b> In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.|$|E
5|$|In both East and West, the scholae, the emperors' {{personal}} cavalry escort, lay {{outside the}} normal military <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command.</b> According to the Notitia, the tribuni (commanders) of the scholae {{reported to the}} magister officiorum, a senior civilian official. However, this was probably for administrative purposes only. On campaign, a tribunus scholae probably reported direct to the emperor himself.|$|E

5|$|It {{should be}} made clear also that Joseph Kabila does not trust the military; the Republican Guard is the only {{component}} he trusts. Major General John Numbi, former Air Force chief, now inspector general of police, ran a parallel <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> in the east to direct the 2009 Eastern Congo offensive, Operation Umoja Wetu; the regular <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> was by-passed. Previously Numbi negotiated the agreement {{to carry out the}} mixage process with Laurent Nkunda. Commenting on a proposed vote of no confidence in the Minister of Defence in September 2012, Baoudin Amba Wetshi of lecongolais.cd described Ntolo as a 'scapegoat'. Wetshi said that all key military and security questions were handled in total secrecy by the President and other civil and military personalities trusted by him, such as John Numbi, Gabriel Amisi Kumba ('Tango Four'), Delphin Kahimbi, and others such as Kalev Mutond and Pierre Lumbi Okongo.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} did {{not appear}} to have any significant impact on German plans and was not reported high up the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command.</b> It was executed some time before D-Day, {{and in the midst of}} several other Allied deceptions. German intelligence might have suspected a trick, or not attributed much importance to the visit.|$|E
5|$|A death {{sentence}} {{had to be}} passed unanimously, and confirmed in writing by various officers as the verdict passed up the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command.</b> A man's battalion and brigade commander tended to comment on his own record, but senior generals {{tended to be more}} concerned with the type of offence and the state of discipline in that unit. The Judge Advocate General at GHQ also checked the records for irregularities, before final confirmation (or otherwise) by the Commander-in-Chief of the relevant theatre.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} this compartmentalization, Andrews bypassed the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> on 8 January 1938, in a memorandum of his own regarding a minor joint air exercise held in November 1937 off the Virginia Capes. There four B-17s had found and successfully bombed Navy target vessels. Andrews sent a memo directly to Roosevelt's military aide, Col. Edwin M. Watson, that included confidential Navy memoranda confirming {{the accuracy of the}} Army's bombing.|$|E
5|$|On 5 November 2009, {{a gunman}} opened {{fire in the}} Soldier Readiness Center of Fort Hood, killing 13 people and {{wounding}} 30 others. Nidal Malik Hasan, a Muslim U.S. Army major and psychiatrist, was alleged to be the gunman. He was felled and then arrested by civilian police officers Sergeant Mark Todd & Sergeant Kimberly Munley. Much of the subsequent investigation was handled by III Corps, as the soldiers killed were under the corps' <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command.</b>|$|E
5|$|Powerful vested {{interests}} and corrupt commanders were, as of February 2011, the largest obstacle to reforming the army. Some newly delivered weaponry was sold by officers. The International Crisis Group {{also said that}} AMISOM's efforts at assisting in formalizing the military's structure and providing training to the estimated 8,000 SNA soldiers were problematic. Resistance continued {{to the establishment of}} an effective <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command,</b> logical military formations and a credible troop roster. Although General Mohamed Gelle Kahiye, the respected former army chief, attempted to instill reforms, he was marginalized and eventually dismissed.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Flying Corps (AFC) was {{established}} {{as part of}} the Commonwealth Military Forces in 1912, prior to the formation of the Australian Military Forces in 1916 and was later separated in 1921 to form the Royal Australian Air Force, making it the second oldest air force in the world. Regardless, the service branches were not linked by a single <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> however, and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments.|$|E
5|$|The Axis command {{structure}} in the Mediterranean was centralised {{at the top and}} fragmented at the lower levels. Mussolini had monopolised authority over Italian armed forces in 1933, by taking the offices of Minister of War, Minister of the Navy and Minister of the Air Force. Feldmarschall Albert Kesselring of the Luftwaffe commanded the German ground forces in the theatre as Oberbefehlshaber Süd (OB Süd) but had no authority over Axis operations in North Africa or the organisation of convoys to Libya. Fliegerkorps II and Fliegerkorps X were subordinate to the normal <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> of the Luftwaffe. Since November 1941, Kesselring had some influence over the conduct of the German naval operations in the Mediterranean, as nominal commander of Naval Command Italy (Marinekommando Italien) but this was subordinate to the Kriegsmarine <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command.</b> German service rivalries obstructed co-operation and there was little unity of effort between German and the Italian forces in the Mediterranean. Kesselring had the authority only to co-ordinate plans for combined operations by German and Italian forces and some influence {{on the use of the}} Regia Aeronautica for the protection of convoys to North Africa. The Italian Navy resisted all German attempts to integrate its operations, ships in different squadrons never trained together and Supermarina constantly over-ruled lower-level commanders.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} Copperhead is unclear. The visit was {{reported}} up the German <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command,</b> and some double agents later received {{requests for information}} about Montgomery's movements. There {{is no indication that}} Montgomery's appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this {{to the fact that the}} deception was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing that there would be no reason for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude an imminent invasion.|$|E

Such organizational independence is intended to ensure unbiased investigations.|$|R
5000|$|A {{teleprinter}} message dated 3 May 1945 {{was sent}} to the Commanders-in-Chief of those units still engaged in combat, empowering them to make autonomous presentations of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross themselves. The following decision making <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> were possible at this time: ...|$|R
5|$|Voss disregarded {{military}} {{procedure and}} went outside the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> to petition higher headquarters for Walz's removal. Faced with such a case of insubordination, all three men were transferred out of the jagdstaffel. Lersner was packed off to a bomber unit. Discovering the betrayal, Walz requested reassignment {{on the grounds that}} his honor had been impugned. On 20 May 1917, Flight Commander Voss was sent to Jagdstaffel 5 to assume temporary command.|$|E
5|$|When Kentucky's {{neutrality}} was breached in September 1861, Hawes fled to Virginia {{to escape}} imprisonment by Federal authorities. While there, he enlisted as a brigade commissary under Confederate general Humphrey Marshall {{and was given}} the rank of major. Though his ability to obtain supplies for Marshall's brigade was commendable given the difficult conditions, his age (64) and lack of military experience lessened his value to Marshall's unit, and his predilection for jumping the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> and communicating directly with Confederate Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin put him at odds with Marshall personally.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} {{came in for}} criticism of {{his handling of the}} defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports on the battle. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this criticism was misplaced and {{there were a number of}} crucial failures higher up in the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command.</b> In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion.|$|E

50|$|The {{main reason}} behind the small crew {{complement}} and high automation {{was not just}} to allow {{a reduction in the}} size of the submarine, but rather to provide an advantage in reaction speed by replacing long <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> with instant electronics, speeding up any action.|$|R
5000|$|An enlisted Army Reserve {{recruiter}} {{received an}} adverse efficiency report in reprisal for compliaining to the command IG about his <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command's</b> interference with his retirement training. The service member ultimately completed the retirement training and petitioned the Army Board for Correction of Military Records for relief.|$|R
5|$|At Quantico, someone slips a {{newspaper}} article under Scully's door enabling her to identify the original body as a crew member on a Russian ship. Mulder and Scully meet at the processing plant and {{they look at the}} strange, fluke-like man. Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation, which Mulder thinks would be difficult. Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that this would have been an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Australia has {{maintained}} military forces since federation {{as a nation}} in January 1901. Shortly after Federation, the Australian Government established the Australian Army and Commonwealth Naval Force by amalgamating the forces each of the states had maintained. In 1911, the Government established the Royal Australian Navy, which absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force. The Army established the Australian Flying Corps in 1912 although this separated to form the Royal Australian Air Force in 1921. The services were not linked by a single <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>command,</b> as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during World War I and World War II, and took part in conflicts in Asia during the Cold War.|$|E
5000|$|Decalo writes that:... using classic 'divide and rule' tactics, he Obote {{appointed}} different {{foreign military}} missions to each battalion, scrambled operational <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>command,</b> played the police off against the army, encouraged personal infighting between his main military 'proteges' and removed from operational <b>command</b> <b>of</b> troops officers who appeared unreliable or too authoritative." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1983 the {{department}} conducted {{an experiment in}} deployment of personnel. District I used a quad system and District II used a sector system. The object was to provide better supervision, establish clear <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> and promote the neighborhood policing concept. By 1984, both districts adopted the sector system.|$|R
5000|$|Submarine flotillas were {{unique in}} that they were {{considered}} operationally deployed commands and answered directly to the Commander of Submarines, oftentimes bypassing other <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>command,</b> including the Fleet commander of the Kriegsmarine. Intermediary regional commands also existed for most U-boat flotillas. [...] Miniature submarines were under the <b>command</b> <b>of</b> the German Navy's special operations branch.|$|R
