40|$|A {{comparative}} study of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> options for secondary school students in formal and non-formal industries of Zimbabwe's employment sectors. This study sought to compare two major sources of <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> formal and non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance.</b> The researcher carried out a causa! comparative s/udv on 93 participants (currently employees in four different employing institutions). These participants were purposively selected from a population of four research sites in Harare; (ministry’ of education, ministry of health, business office and industry’). Each participant completed a 45 -item, closed form questionnaire indicating their perceptions about the most influential source of the <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> they received during secondary> school. The results were analyzed using SPSS. A Chi-square test was carried out to compare the expected and observed frequencies. A Chi-square value of 0. 025 was obtained and therefore the hypothesis was rejected. There is {{a significant difference in}} the obsen’ed and expected numbers of individuals influenced by formal and non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance.</b> Almost twenty one percent (20. 9 %) of the participants indicated that they were influenced by formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> whilst 44 % reported to have been influenced by non-formal sources of <b>career</b> <b>guidance.</b> However 35. 2 % of the participants reported to have been influenced by both formal and non-formal sources of <b>career</b> <b>guidance.</b> Among these non-formal sources, parents emerged as the most influential sources of influence in the choice of a career by most secondary> school students. Schools, (through <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> programs) were reported to be the second most influential sources of influence in career decisions by secondary school students. Since parents seem to be among the most trusted sources of <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> yet they do not have a formal channel of implementing their <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> it is therefore recommended that a collaborative approach to providing <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> to secondary school students be adopted. A collaboration of the two major sources of <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> formal and non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> might most probably result in optimal career satisfaction levels for the student since he/she might get the best from both sources of <b>career</b> <b>guidance...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{sets out}} to examine the {{premises}} of differential validity, {{or the use of}} score differences and patterns as predictors. This presupposes a view of ability or intellect as multidimensional, and therefore regards multidimensional patterns or profiles of scores, in addition to or irrespective of the actual levels of single test scores or weighted composites, as having predictive or classificatory uses. The advantages of taking a multidimensional view of intellect as assessed by differential testing are contrasted with the advantages of a unitary approach to intelligent performance, which assumes that a test or weighted test composite must be used to create a single index of performance. The study also considers the possibility that psychometric testing, as it is commonly used in selection and development, over stresses levels of performance and under-utilises the amount of information that can be gained from studying patterns of test scores. The differential test battery which is examined, the Morrisby Profile, is standardised and validated as part of this study by the author while working for the Morrisby Organisation, except where the assistance of others is specifically acknowledged. Methods for validating it both as a traditional and as a differential battery are examined, and various possible indices of differential efficiency are discussed, using multiple regression, discriminant function analysis and MANOVA. A further method is devised and presented for displaying the differential performance of a battery, using deviation scores. As deviation scores have the effect of making the measure at least partly ipsative, some issues of ipsativity are addressed, and arguments presented to justify the use of statistical techniques with partially ipsative data. Data is presented to show the relative effectiveness of different indices of validity, employing multiple regression, discriminant function analysis, MANOVA and the use of deviation scores. Although coefficients based on differentials alone rarely equal those based on score levels, combined coefficients are more effective than either, and their use is advocated. It is also argued that there may be real, if less easily quantifiable, advantages to the differential manner of presentation, with particular reference to groups commonly disadvantaged by traditional tests, especially in the field of development and guidance. The data sets examined included occupational groups, (engineers, technicians, managers, <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>officers</b> and teachers), school students with academic criteria, applicants for engineering technician posts, insurance salespeople and managers whose promotional ratings had been assessed. Both categorical and noncategorical criteria are used. The battery is found to be an effective measure in both a traditional and a differential sense, although against the criteria available {{it is not possible to}} establish the absolute superiority of the differential approach in terms of predictive validity in the absence of all information relating to level of scores. It is shown that, when scalar and differential methods are combined, more of the variance is explained than when either method is used alone. In view of the possible disadvantages of traditional validation methods, it is suggested that there would be social advantages in utilising a differential method of testing. The implications of differential testing in the context of current perceptions of human abilities are discussed, and possible developments for a differential approach are indicated...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} problem was that despite the Government efforts to support the provision of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counselling in public secondary schools, there was no readily available documented data of what is currently {{going on in the}} schools. Further more, during her literature review this researcher did not come across any study that had been carried out on the status of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counselling services in public secondary schools in Nairobi Province. The {{purpose of the study was}} therefore to assess the status of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counselling programmes for students in public secondary schools in Nairobi province. The specific objectives of the study were to: establish the status of <b>Career</b> <b>Guidance</b> and Counseling in public secondary schools; establish the availability and competence of Career Teacher Counsellors in public secondary schools; establish the availability and use of <b>Career</b> <b>Guidance</b> and Counselling resources in public secondary schools; find out the challenges in the effective implementation of Career and Counseling programmes in public secondary schools in Nairobi province and make recommendations on the ways of improving the status of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counseling in secondary schools. The population for the study were 65 public secondary schools in Nairobi Province. The target population were the 65 principals, 65 <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counseling teachers and 5940 Form Three and Four students. Descriptive survey design was used for the study. Stratified and Purposive sampling methods were used. The primary data was collected by the use of questionnaires and an interview schedule. The study found that schools had different programmes for the implementation of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counseling. The study also found that the <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counseling teachers were available but not adequately empowered with <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> skills, knowledge and facilities to carry out effective <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> services. The study further found that <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counseling resources were available in schools but inadequate. The challenges facing the implementation of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counseling in public secondary schools were found to be the inadequacy of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counseling resources, overloading of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counseling teachers with academic class work and inadequate information on different careers. Based on these findings, the researcher recommended that secondary schools in Nairobi Province should be assisted to come up with varied programmes on <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counseling which should be coordinated by a department in the ministry of education. It was also recommended that teachers should be trained on <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counselling to improve their competences by organizing in-service trainings, seminars and workshops.

40|$|This {{case study}} aimed {{to gain a}} {{holistic}} understanding of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> as implemented in a university in Guangdong province. The purpose of the research was to investigate (a) the identifiable content and approaches used in <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> (b) contextual factors {{inside and outside the}} university that influence <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> (c) how the people involved perceive the effect of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> on enhancing students' career competencies, (d) problems in delivering and receiving <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> and (e) how <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> can be strengthened and improved. Qualitative data were collected between 2010 and 2012, using multiple methods including individual interviews, focus groups, observations, and documentary study. A total of 13 individual interviews and 5 focus group sessions were completed. The researcher collected information related to perceptions of university students, graduates, administrators, career practitioners, student tutors and teachers involved in the <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> service. Evidence was also obtained from curriculum designs, reports, surveys, web pages, and documents produced by the school, faculties and student association. The researcher also conducted 17 participant and non-participant observations during relevant career activities. The data analysis involved coding, categorization, concept mapping, and theme generation. The themes that emerged were triangulated using data from the various sources. The findings reveal that a system has been built to provide <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> through three separate channels. The Career Center is formally in charge of all career affairs; but currently ‘employment management’ is its main duty. Various career activities (conducted by students) are provided by the Students' Career Development Association (SCDA), which is supported by the Career Center. Also, in each faculty, <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> related to specific majors is implemented. Contextual factors that influence <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> can be summarized under four aspects: national policies and university support; management systems; political tradition of a centralization system; and various resources. The findings suggest that <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> does enhance students’ career competencies, particularly in areas of self-understanding, career-related knowledge and skills, and in career-relevant networking. A variety of problems have existed in the university in relation to <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> including the lack of a comprehensive service, insufficient resources, a lack of credibility, uneven quality of <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> and a lack of professional training for the personnel involved. Many suggestions have been put forward by students and teachers for strategies to improve <b>career</b> <b>guidance.</b> In particular, it is believed that the Career Center, the faculties, and SCDA have to increase their coordination and cooperation at all levels, by a better integration of resources. The data analyzed in this study provide a unique picture of the implementation and content of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> with Chinese characteristics. In addition, factors influencing <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and its service delivery are identified and discussed within a Chinese context, taking socio-political factors into account. While the results provide evidence for an operational model of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> in a university, they also expand current theories of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> in China as a whole. Implications for practical solution of problems and for improvement of existing services are discussed in detail. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to inspire {{practitioners}} and professionals to leave their offices to bring <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> into communities that might not identify with <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> in the first instance. By making the effort to engage with communities, practitioners may bring about a critical change in <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> practices as well as in the lives of the people in the communities. This paper falls into two parts: The first part considers the collective as the starting point for the development of meaningful <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> activities. Based on previous research on <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> in communities from a critical psychological standpoint the paper introduces a social practice theory of <b>career</b> <b>guidance.</b> The social practice theory of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> argues that <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> can be seen as a collective practice in which people can join forces with <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> practitioners to analyse their situation and based on these insights create new opportunities in relation to their future educational or vocational participation in society (Thomsen 2012).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare two {{approaches}} to <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> formal and non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance,</b> so as to improve guidance programmes and raise career satisfaction and career realisation level of employees. A causal comparative survey was conducted in Harare. The researcher purposefully selected 93 participants, then employees in four different employing institutions at the time the research was conducted. The basis for the selection of the research participants is that they had gone through Ordinary level education at a secondary school in Zimbabwe where they were influenced by either of the two or both types of <b>career</b> <b>guidance.</b> Each participant completed a 45 -item, closed form questionnaire indicating his/her perceptions about the <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> he/she had received and how satisfied they felt about their careers. The results were analysed using SPSS, 20. 0. A Chi-square Test was carried out to compare the relative strengths of the two major sources of influence, formal and non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance.</b> The focus of the Chi-square test was on comparing the observed and expected numbers of participants influenced by each of the sources of <b>career</b> <b>guidance.</b> The Chi-square test results indicated that there is a significant difference in the strengths of the influences of the two groups. A One- Way Analysis of Variance was carried out to compare the means of career realisation levels of the groups under study. The ANOVA results indicated that there was no significant difference between the career realisation levels of employees influenced by formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and those influenced by non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance.</b> Although formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> seemed less convincing to attract many students, it seems to be associated with relatively higher career realisation levels because it provides relevant career information to the students before they make the career decisions. On the other hand, non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> attracted almost half of the participants mainly because it provides sustainable financial and social support to the student during this transition period between school and employment. However, non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> was associated with the limitation of lack of relevant information on career awareness and other career preparatory information. The participants influenced by non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> reported relatively lower career realisation levels. About one third of the participants reported to have been influenced by both formal and non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and they indicated that they experience moderately high career realisation levels. This research study has shed more light as to why some employees seem not satisfied with their careers. Either they did not directly participate in choosing the career (as in the case of formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance)</b> or they selected the career before they had adequate information about the career (as in non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance).</b> The study indicated that there are strengths and weaknesses associated with each of the two approaches of providing <b>career</b> <b>guidance.</b> Adopting the strengths of each of these approaches is likely to maximize the career realisation levels of more students. From the findings of this study the researcher recommends that a collaboration of the two (formal and non-formal <b>career</b> <b>guidance)</b> be implemented in order for most students to achieve optimal career realisation levels when they enter their careers...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003 The {{single most}} common {{decision}} that people {{between the ages}} of 16 years and 22 years need to make is that of their career choice. Research in the field of <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> has shown that the world of work is changing. It is generally accepted that an individual will be presented with many opportunities in the world of work and these give rise to the notion of multiple careers. To predict accurately what these opportunities might be is impractical and naive, if not impossible. <b>Career</b> <b>guidance</b> counsellors are now expected to understand the interrelationships between occupations and occupational groups; an understanding that is vital when providing a comprehensive and realistic <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> service. The <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> processes or programs that counsellors use, need to allow for the identification of base or entry level careers that will provide opportunity for both horizontal and vertical career movement. While the schooling system has traditionally been the primary role player in preparing learners for the world of work, recent budgetary cuts have forced schools to focus on academic subjects, and, as a result, <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> as a subject has become ancillary to the school syllabus. This situation is unlikely to be remedied unless <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> becomes an examinable subject as are mathematics, physical science, biology and so on. A literature study surrounding <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> practices in South Africa and career choice and development theories from around the world, suggest that existing <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> programs in South Africa need to be restructured to allow for a more comprehensive solution for learners, that need to make a career choice. The "PACE" <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> program was designed to enhance the career knowledge of learners, increase their self awareness in relation to careers, and ultimately to accelerate the career maturity process. Learners from schools in East London were exposed to the program, with the intention of determining the effect of the program on their career maturity levels. Whilst certain elements which constitute career maturity were not influenced by the program, results obtained from the research indicated {{a significant increase in the}} overall career maturity level of these learners. Resulting from this dissertation, recommendations have been made relating to the length of a <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> program, the point of departure and the point of exit, the importance of balancing realism with circumstances, and the necessity for <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> practitioners to possess a thorough understanding of careers and the various paths that careers may follow.
