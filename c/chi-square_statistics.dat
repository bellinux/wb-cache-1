40|$|Various <b>chi-square</b> <b>statistics</b> {{are used}} for testing {{structural}} equation models. A commonly used chi-square is the Satorra-Bentler (SB) statistic. This is a normal-theory chi-square cor-rected for non-normality in the observed variables. The relationship between the SB statistic and kurtosis is developed and it is shown that the SB statistic tends to decrease with increasing kurtosis if the model does not hold. It is shown that the population value of the correction factor for the SB statistic decreases toward zero with increasing kurtosis. Various <b>chi-square</b> <b>statistics</b> {{are used for}} testing structural equation models. If the model is fitted by the maximum likelihood (ML) method, one such chi-square statistic is obtained as n times the minimum of the ML fit function, where n is the sample size. An asymptotically equivalent chi-square statistic is n times the minimum value of a quadratic form using a weight matrix evaluated under multivariate normality of the observed variables. Following the notation in Jöreskog, Sörbom, Du Toit, & Du Toit (2003), these <b>chi-square</b> <b>statistics</b> are denoted c 1 and c 2, respectively. They are valid under multivariate normality of the observed variables and if the model holds...|$|E
