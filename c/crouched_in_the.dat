2500|$|In Chapter 16, [...] "What Happened to Butch," [...] {{the authors}} write, [...] "Butch {{fell to his}} old {{familiar}} adversary, a Betty. Most likely he died from, or was immediately disabled by, a lucky shot from the forward observer <b>crouched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rikko's [...] forward glassed-in nose...the nose gunner's 7.7mm slugs very likely penetrated Butch's cockpit from above {{on the port side}} and ahead of the F6F's armor plate." [...] In the Index, Ewing and Lundstrom flatly state that Kernan is [...] "wrongly accused of shooting down Butch." ...|$|E

The women have a brief but happy reunion.|$|R

50|$|Immediately after Crouch {{scored the}} touchdown, the jubilant Nebraska crowd {{watched as the}} video board {{displayed}} a computerized image of <b>Crouch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Heisman pose {{and a picture of}} the Heisman trophy itself. After Nebraska won 20-10, Crouch led the Cornhuskers to two more victories before the Colorado Buffaloes stunned Nebraska 62-36 the day after Thanksgiving. Nevertheless, Crouch became the first true option quarterback to win the Heisman trophy, edging out Florida’s Rex Grossman and Miami’s Ken Dorsey.|$|R

30|$|The {{aspect ratio}} of an imaged object is only {{maintained}} when considering planar rigid objects that move without rotating. But {{even in this}} hypothetical case, errors in object annotations will generally result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bounding box aspect ratio not being maintained. When annotating non-rigid objects, the problem gets worse. For instance, consider a person standing up in one key frame, and <b>the</b> same person <b>crouching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next key frame. <b>In</b> that situation, <b>the</b> bounding box height will halve, whereas the width will be the same, or even increase.|$|R
50|$|Nanjing {{is at the}} {{intersection}} of the Yangtze River, an east-west water transport artery, and the Nanjing-Beijing railway, a north-south land transport artery, hence the name “door of the east and west, throat of the south and north”. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is <b>in</b> Nanjing; <b>the</b> Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round {{the east side of the}} city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain <b>crouches</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west of the city, hence the name “the Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching”.|$|R

50|$|Kirk and First Officer Spock soon {{notice a}} group of villagers <b>crouching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby rocks, {{apparently}} preparing for an ambush.

Since the landing party aren't supposed to use phasers, Kirk tosses a rock to make a distraction, but this causes one of the natives' guns to go off and a chase ensues. Spock is shot by one of the natives.|$|R

60|$|Maud’s {{condition}} was pitiable. She sat <b>crouched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of the}} boat, her lips blue, her face grey and plainly showing the pain she suffered. But ever her eyes looked bravely at me, and ever her lips uttered brave words.|$|E
