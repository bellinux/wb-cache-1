5|$|The {{game was}} {{considered}} for development by WayForward Technologies {{as far back}} as 1997. An archived version of the company's official website showcases a very different approach to the game, which was at the time considered for development on PC or PlayStation, in full 3D with traditionally animated characters moving before a 3D background. Shantae was presented as a troubled genie born without magic powers, who had to save the world from the Jins, powerful beings once sealed who escaped {{at the beginning of the}} game and planned to drain all magic from the world. Back then, her magic was capable, as envisioned by Erin Bozon, the original creator of the character, to summon animals, but transformation was already planned as Shantae <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a harpy. Her dances could also launch attacks and she had different outfits with different characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea about}} the men with the inborn ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E
5|$|Scholar-officials and gentry also {{distinguished}} {{themselves through}} their intellectual pursuits. While {{some such as}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and Su Song (1020–1101) dabbled in every known field of science, study, and statecraft, Song elites were generally most interested in the leisurely pursuits of composing and reciting poetry, art collecting and antiquarianism. Yet even this pursuit <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a scholarly one. It was the official, historian, poet, and essayist Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) who compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early epigraphy and archeology. Shen Kuo even took an interdisciplinary approach to archeological study, in order to aid his work in astronomy, mathematics, and recording ancient musical measures. The scholar-official and historian Zeng Gong (1019–1083) reclaimed last chapters of the ancient Zhan Guo Ce, proofreading and editing the version that would become the accepted modern version. The ideal official and gentry scholars were also expected to employ these intellectual pursuits {{for the good of}} the community, such as writing local histories or gazetteers. In the case of Shen Kuo and Su Song, their pursuits in academic fields such as classifying pharmaceuticals and improving calendrical science through court work in astronomy fit this ideal.|$|E

5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E
25|$|In some traditions, {{humans who}} became {{overpowered}} by greed <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> wendigos; the myth thus {{served as a}} method of encouraging cooperation and moderation. Also humans <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> wendigos by being in contact with them for too long.|$|E

25|$|The 16th century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus {{says that}} the Livonian werewolves were {{initiated}} by draining a cup of specially prepared beer and repeating a set formula. Ralston in his Songs of the Russian People gives the form of incantation still familiar in Russia. In Italy, France and Germany, {{it was said that}} a man or woman <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a werewolf if he or she, on a certain Wednesday or Friday, slept outside on a summer night with the full moon shining directly on his or her face.|$|E
25|$|The {{black market}} also {{attracted}} an export drain into the Gambia. The Senegalese government began {{to institute a}} delayed payment system with its groundnut (peanut) farms. When farmers sold their harvest to the Senegalese government, they would get a voucher, known as a chit, which they <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> cash after a three-month waiting period. Not wanting {{to wait for the}} Senegalese marketing system to pay them, more farmers began to smuggle their goods to Banjul, where the Gambian government paid in cash; by 1990, estimates show that 20% of the Gambian groundnut market was from smuggled Senegalese crops.|$|E

500|$|The {{absence of}} an {{effective}} government prompted two influential politicians, Franz von Papen and Alfred Hugenberg, along with several other industrialists and businessmen, {{to write a letter}} to Hindenburg.

500|$|The game's {{plot was}} met {{positively}} by most reviewers, with GameSpy calling it [...] "epic". IGN praised {{the clarity of}} the quests and ease of moving from one goal to the next. RPGamer's reviewer, on the other hand, felt the plot was lackluster, but approved of the side quests, which he said <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> [...] "minor epics" [...] of their own.|$|E
500|$|... "Homer Loves Flanders" [...] was {{the last}} episode to be pitched by Conan O'Brien before he left The Simpsons. David Richardson was {{assigned}} to write it, and Wesley Archer to direct it. Richardson wrote the episode at a Motel 6 in Hemet, California while he was dating an actress who was shooting a film there. In this season, the staff {{wanted to take a}} deeper look at the relationships of the characters. One of the things they wanted to explore in particular was what Homer and Flanders have in common and how they <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> friends. Former show runner David Mirkin enjoyed making Homer and Flanders get along because they do not normally act that way.|$|E

500|$|Producer Tonino Cervi, {{head of the}} {{production}} company Italy Film, {{was the first person}} to propose a film adaptation of the Diabolik comic strip. During this period, Andre Hunebelle's film Fantomas was popular. Cervi was ambiguous when describing his production, stating once that [...] "I think that with a few retouches [...] <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> an extraordinary character for the silver screen." [...] In another interview, he acknowledged that [...] "nowadays a good film based on Flash Gordon would be a sensational success [...] but it would cost as much as Cleopatra. I have to settle for something more modest, so I'm doing Diabolik." [...] Cervi's initial intention was that Diabolik would allow him to finance an anthology film directed by Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman, and Akira Kurosawa.|$|E
500|$|Gabriel's use of Xhosa lyrics {{have been}} read by {{scholars}} {{as evidence of}} the [...] "authenticity" [...] of Gabriel's effort to highlight Biko. By using a language that many South Africans, and the majority of outsiders, did not know, the words trigger curiosity; in the words of Byerly, [...] "compelling ...to become, like Gabriel, insiders to the struggle". In contrast, scholar Derek Hook has written that the song highlighted the artist, rather than Biko himself, and [...] " [...] for the singer and his audience a kind of anti-racist social capital". Hook questioned whether the [...] "consciousness raising" [...] efforts of the song <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> [...] "anti-racist narcissism". Drewett stated that the use of a simplistic and generic [...] "African" [...] beat was an indication of an [...] "imperial imagination" [...] in the song's composition.|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Anthony {{takes an}} {{interest}} to Amira Masood (Preeya Kalidas), Amira states in EastEnders to Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia) that Anthony 'brightens up her life by treating {{her like a}} princess'. Speaking {{of his relationship with}} Amira, Lapinskas told Digital Spy, [...] "From the very first time Anthony saw Amira at the pub, he said she was a goddess. Since then, he's been helping her out a bit, and she's warming to him. You never know what could happen– watch this space. It <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> something beautiful! He added, [...] "I think at first she might have wanted to use him to make Syed (Marc Elliot) jealous, but over a period of time, she might start warming to him. He is genuinely a nice guy and quite charming, so she could fall for him".|$|E

500|$|On July 30, 2011, Davis {{was traded}} with pitcher Tommy Hunter to the Baltimore Orioles for {{reliever}} Koji Uehara. Davis became expendable because the Rangers felt Moreland {{was a better}} option at first base; Rangers' general manager Jon Daniels said {{the day of the}} trade that he knew there was a possibility Davis <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a high-impact offensive player and [...] "If he does, we'll live with it." [...] Opinions differ as to Davis's inability to hold a consistent starting role with the Rangers; while one popular theory is that it was because of his many strikeouts and low batting average, Orioles' manager Buck Showalter believes it was due to the presence of Moreland and Adrián Beltré in Texas. Davis said, [...] "I'm glad to get the opportunity to come here", citing his desire to play every day.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of the war, {{political}} opposition within the Royalist senior leadership against Rupert continued to grow. Rupert's personality during the war had made him both friends and enemies. He enjoyed a [...] "frank and generous disposition", showed a [...] "quickness of... intellect", was prepared to face grave dangers, and could be thorough and patient when necessary. However, he lacked the social gifts of a courtier, and his humour <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a [...] "sardonic wit and a contemptuous manner": with a hasty temper, he was too quick to say who he respected, and who he disliked. The result was that, while Rupert could inspire great loyalty in some, especially his men, he also made many enemies at the Royal court. When he took Bristol, he also slighted the Marquess of Hertford, the lethargic but politically significant Royalist leader of the South-West. Most critically, Rupert fell out with George Digby, a favourite of both the King and the Queen. Digby was a classic courtier and Rupert fell to arguing with him repeatedly in meetings. The result was that towards the end of the war Rupert's position at court was increasingly undermined by his enemies.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was highly}} rated by most reviewers, though the combat system had detractors. Dillard of Nintendo Life {{felt that the}} gameplay {{was as good as}} that of Secret of Mana and it had [...] "a much more strategic feel to it". The 1UP.com and Cubed3 reviews also brought up the day and time system as interesting additions, though the 1UP.com reviewer felt that the combat was not [...] "quite as tight" [...] as in Secret of Mana. The Next Generation preview, while acknowledging that several flaws in the Secret of Mana combat system had been corrected and praising the boss battles, felt that the computer-controlled characters showed no sense of tactics, resulting in a free-for-all. A review by JeuxVideo.com also noted several improvements in the combat system over the prior game, but felt that battles <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> a chaotic mass of attacks and numbers. Parsons of RPGamer also called out the Ring system as being flawed, as he found it frustrating that the menu could not be brought up while a character was performing an action, making boss battles hectic and difficult. The JeuxVideo.com reviewer also took issue with this restriction.|$|E
