50|$|As to Aucamp's {{claim for}} damages, {{the court held}} that the correct basis for {{calculation}} of them would not be the hypothesis that he had entirely lost the profit which he would have made out of particular contracts which he had lost; it was that his making of profits from cutting and selling timber had been deferred for about 22 months owing to his operations in the forest having been stopped. As Aucap had failed to prove the facts necessary for the court to make a <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> on this basis, it was ruled that there should be judgment of absolution from the instance on this prayer.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{difficulty}} in the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> {{is the question}} of causation. Remoteness will defeat a claim if it depends on very hypothetical possibilities. In McRae v. Commonwealth Disposals Commission (1951) 84 CLR 377 relying on rumours, the Commission sold to McRae the right to salvage an oil tanker thought to be marooned at the specified location. Unfortunately, the tanker did not exist. The Commission argued the contract was void because of a common mistake as to the existence of the subject matter, but the court noted that the Commission [...] "took no steps to verify what they were asserting and any 'mistake' that existed was induced by their own culpable conduct." [...] McRae wasted money searching for the non-existent wreck. His claim for the loss of profits expected from a successful salvage was dismissed as too speculative, but reliance damages were awarded for wasted expenses. Nevertheless, the courts have been prepared to speculate. In Chaplin v Hicks (1911) 2 KB 786 the defendant in breach of contract prevented the claimant from taking part in the final stage of a beauty contest where twelve of the final fifty (out of 6,000 original entrants) would be rewarded with places in a chorus line. The claimant was awarded damages for the loss of a chance, assessed at 25% of winning the competition. The court seemed to proceed on the claimant's statistical chance of winning (as if she were a lottery player) without any actual assessment of her physical attributes against any particular criteria of beauty.|$|E

40|$|The Proposal for a Common European Sales Law (CESL) and the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (SGA) {{have adopted}} {{different}} approaches toward the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages.</b> Under the SGA, the ‘market price’ rule is preferred over the rule governing ‘making a substitute transaction’. Where {{there is a}} market price for the contract goods, a higher or lower price at which the buyer has made a cover purchase for the similar goods is generally irrelevant to the assessment of damages. Conversely, under the CESL, the ‘market price’ rule for <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> is subsidiary, even if the ‘market price’ rule {{would have been more}} advantageous for the buyer. This paper will compare these different mechanisms for calculating damages within the context of international sales of manufactured goods. This comparison is based on a novel normative framework. This normative framework consists of four criteria: 1) legal certainty, an essential requirement of international sales transactions; 2) performance interest, reflecting the specific needs of a buyer entering a commercial transaction; 3) efficiency, concerning whether the remedy can minimize transaction costs facing the disputants; and 4) satisfying the norms of relational theory, as international sales of manufactured goods requires a continuing relationship between the parties in different stages of contract. This comparison aims to identify which legal regime has adopted the more appropriate approach in accordance with the normative framework. Finally, proposals for improving the rules of monetary damages under the CESL, which seems to have some defects, are suggested...|$|E
