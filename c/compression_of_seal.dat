5000|$|Since {{the carrier}} ring used in {{constant}} seating stress gaskets take this deflection {{into account when}} creating the carrier ring for a given flange size, pressure class, and material, the carrier ring profile can be adjusted to enable the gasket seating stress to be radially uniform across the entire sealing area. Further, because the sealing elements are fully confined by the flange faces in opposing channels on the carrier ring, any in-service compressive forces acting on the gasket are transmitted through the carrier ring and avoid any further <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sealing</b> elements, thus maintaining a 'constant' gasket seating stress while in-service. Thus, the gasket is immune to common gasket failure modes that include creep relaxation, high system vibration, or system thermal cycles.|$|R

In this thesis, a hyperelastic spherical dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) was fabricated out of BJB TC- 5005 and tested to determine its feasibility as an actuator. The mechanics of the actuator were modelled analytically using an Ogden material model for large deformations. The electrical actuation mechanism was also derived. A seamless spherical DEA with an external radius of 30. 65 mm was inflated, recording the expansion with and without actuation potentials. The hysteresis upon inflation and deflation of the spherical DEA was also investigated, and a pressure difference of 65 Pa was recorded.

40|$|The {{buckling}} of {{spiral wound}} gaskets (SWGs) causes turbulence of the fluid flow inside flanges and {{may result in}} leakage failure over time due to the unwinding of the spirals. A few limited studies on the lateral forces generated by axial <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> the gasket <b>sealing</b> element which cause this phenomenon {{are available in the}} literature. The lateral forces are generated during initial tightening and are not distributed uniformly in the circumferential direction. Hence there is an introduction of concentrated forces in small areas. The non-uniform gasket contact stress caused by the tightening sequence makes the problem more complex. It is suggested to study experimentally the buckling of spiral wound gaskets by developing a special test bench designed for this purpose. This test bench is able to measure the lateral loads and winding inward displacement during the tightening process. The experimental results are to be compared to those obtained by numerical FE simulation for the purpose of extrapolating for other size gaskets...|$|R
5000|$|The Preliminary Systems Review (PSR) {{was planned}} to be a [...] "formal {{configuration}} review...initiated {{near the end of}} the conceptual phase, but prior to the start of detail design" [...] work on the docking mechanism. As part of their presentation to the Preliminary Systems Review Board (the Board being the Technical Directors), Don Wade and Syromyatnikov included all the test data, specifications, and drawings for the docking system, as well as a design evaluation for the mechanism. After hearing their report, Lunney and Bushuyev felt three problem areas needed further study. First, the requirement for a spring thruster designed to help separate the two spacecraft had caught their attention, since the failure of this thruster to compress properly could prevent completion of docking. Second, Lunney and Bushuyev emphasized the importance of an indicator that would verify that the structural latches were properly in place. The American system provided information on the functioning of each latch but did not indicate that the interface seals were compressed, while the Soviet system gave data on <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seals</b> but none for the latches. To assure the structural integrity of the transfer tunnel, it was important to know that all eight latches were closed. The third problem area was whether it was possible for the structural latches be inadvertently released. Bushuyev and Lunney called for a thorough re-evaluation of all these issues and advised the group to present their specific recommendations to them in December and January.|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{consists}} of {{a study of the}} behaviour of concrete under uniaxial tension with regard to both strain development under external loading and short- and long-term failure. A method was first developed for the accurae short- and long-term uniaxial tensile testing of concrete and has been applied throughout the investigation. As a result of this work, a mechanism has been proposed within a framework of a seepage-plastic the tensile creep and failure of concrete. A rheological model has also been suggested to describe this mechanism. The tensile creep of air drying concrete was larger than that expected in compression but smaller when the concrete is stored sealed or under water. The creep <b>of</b> <b>sealed</b> and immersed concrete reached limiting values within two months while that of air drying concrete continued for a much longer tie. in other respects tensile creep behaviour was similar to that in <b>compression.</b> The creep <b>of</b> <b>sealed</b> concrete was about half that of immersed concrete and as low as 0. 1 of that of air drying concrete. A relationship has been obtained between ultimate strength and the period of sustained loading. This relationship is similar to that previously obtained for concrete in compression but the reduction of strength due to long-term loading is greater than than for compression and can be up to 50 per cent of the short-term strength. This relationship is considerably influenced by the storage conditions of the specimen and the type of aggregate employed. The long-term strength <b>of</b> <b>sealed</b> concrete {{has been found to be}} up to 50 per cent higher than that of water-immersed concrete made with gravel aggregate while the short-term strength was about 15 to 20 per cent higher. This was not found to be so for concrete made with crushed granite aggregate. A limiting positive ultimate strain of 70 to 90 microstrain due to external loading was observed for all gravel concrete tests, short- or long-term but higher values were measured on granite concrete...|$|R

Forty-eight of 50 (96 %) saline flushes passed through devices that had been activated up {{to a maximum of}} 70 times remained sterile. A further 25 Q-Syte CLADs that had undergone multiple activations were challenged with prefilled 0. 9 % (w/v) sterile saline syringes, the external luer tips of which had been inoculated with S. epidermidis NCTC 9865 prior to accessing the devices. None of the devices that had been accessed up to 70 times allowed passage of micro-organisms, despite challenge micro-organisms being detected on both the syringe tip after activation and the compression seals before decontamination. These findings suggest that the Q-Syte CLAD may be activated up to 70 times with no increased risk of microbial contamination within the fluid pathway. The device may also offer protection from the external surface of syringe tips contaminated with micro-organisms. © 2005 Hospital Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
