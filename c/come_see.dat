5|$|In 1892, Stone was {{convinced}} {{to sit for}} a portrait in sculpture, rendered by Anne Whitney, sculptor and poet. Stone had previously protested the proposed portrait {{for more than a}} year, saying that the funds to engage an artist would be better spent on suffrage work. Stone finally yielded to pressure from Frances Willard, the New England Women's Club and some of her friends and neighbors in the Boston area, and sat while Whitney produced a bust. In February 1893, Stone invited her brother Frank and his wife Sarah to <b>come</b> <b>see</b> the bust, before it was shipped to Chicago for display at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition.|$|E
5|$|Dave Finnegan {{was cast}} as Mickah Wallace, a belligerent and hot-tempered bouncer {{who becomes a}} drummer for the band. Parker's first meeting with Finnegan began civilly before their exchanges grew more and more heated. They soon became {{verbally}} abusive, threatening each other with disturbing acts of violence. Parker cast Finnegan immediately, explaining that he simply wanted to test the limits of Finnegan's aggression, as he wanted the truculence of the character to be convincing. Colm Meaney first learned of the film adaptation while working with Parker on <b>Come</b> <b>See</b> the Paradise. After Parker held auditions for the younger cast members, Meaney secured the role of Jimmy's father Jimmy Rabbitte, Sr. The audition scene in the film, in which various musicians audition at Jimmy Rabbitte's home, required more than 100 band members. Peter Rowen, brother of Irish artist Guggi, appears as a young skateboarding boy who asks to audition for the band. At {{the time of the}} film's production, Rowen had appeared on the cover art of U2's albums Boy (1980) and War (1983), and was a national skating champion.|$|E

500|$|Polizzotti, in {{his study}} of Highway 61 Revisited, writes that the opening track of Side Two, [...] "Queen Jane Approximately" [...] is in a similar vein to [...] "Like a Rolling Stone", but the song offers [...] "a touch of sympathy and even comfort in place of {{relentless}} mockery". The song is structured as a series of ABAB quatrain verses, with each verse followed by a chorus that is simply a repeat of the last line of each verse: [...] "Won't you <b>come</b> <b>see</b> me Queen Jane?". Gill calls this song [...] "the least interesting track" [...] on Highway 61, but praises the piano ascending the scale during the harmonica break as an evocation of [...] "the stifling nature of an upper class existence". Others have speculated that the song is directed at Joan Baez and the folk movement, which Dylan had largely left behind. [...] "Queen Jane Approximately" [...] was released as the B-side of Dylan's [...] "One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)" [...] single in early 1966.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Myles {{took the}} project to Beacon Communications, an {{independent}} film company established that year by Tom Rosenberg, a former real estate developer, and Armyan Bernstein, a former television journalist turned screenwriter and producer. Clement and La Frenais traveled to Los Angeles to discuss the project with Alan Parker, {{and gave him a}} copy of the novel. Upon reading the novel, Parker was intrigued by its dialogue and humor, stating, [...] "The book was all dialogue with very little description, but by the use of this wonderful language, and almost nothing but language, in a few lines [...] was able to make his characters as vivid and strong as a dozen pages of purple Joycian prose." [...] He signed on to direct the project after concluding work on his previous film <b>Come</b> <b>See</b> the Paradise (1990). After Beacon agreed to finance the film, 20th Century Fox acquired the North American distribution rights, and Parker was given creative control. The film was an international co-production between companies in the United Kingdom and the United States. Randall-Cutler's The First Film Company and Parker's Dirty Hands Productions, both based in England, were enlisted as production companies. Parker and the producers later attended the 1990 Cannes Film Festival to secure worldwide pre-sales.|$|E
