Located to the north of South Bend in Notre Dame, Indiana, the University of Notre Dame was founded in 1842 by Father Edward Sorin, a French priest, before South Bend was incorporated as a city in 1865. It has been an intrinsic part of the South Bend area and <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a great effect on South Bend's culture and economy.

In 2012, it produced about 70% of Estonia's ordinary waste, 82% of its hazardous waste, and more than 70% of its greenhouse gas emissions. Its activities lower groundwater levels, alter water circulation, and spoil water quality. Water pumped from the mines and used by oil shale-fired power stations exceeds 90% of all water used in Estonia. Leachates from waste heaps pollute surface and groundwater. Former and current oil shale mines cover about one percent of Estonia's territory.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of {{less than six months}} to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E

Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s. 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium. In 1974, with the addition of the fountain {{at the tip of the}} Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed. Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> on the social fabric of Pittsburgh.

5|$|The {{history of}} Judaism in Turkey {{goes back to}} the Romaniote Jews of Anatolia who have been present since at least the 5th century BC. They built ancient places of worship such as the Sardis Synagogue in Lydia and the Priene Synagogue in Ionia. The Sephardi Jews who were {{expelled}} from the Iberian peninsula and southern Italy {{under the control of the}} Spanish Empire were welcomed into the Ottoman Empire between the late-15th and mid-16th centuries. Despite emigration during the 20th century, modern-day Turkey <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a small Jewish population. At present, there are around 26,000 Jews in Turkey, the vast majority of whom are Sephardi.|$|E
5|$|The {{arboreal}} {{hypothesis was}} popular in Heilmann's day, even {{prior to his}} research, {{as it had been}} advanced by Marsh. It fell out of favor following Ostrom's research in the 1960s and 1970s, which suggested that the ancestors of birds were fast–running bipedal animals, lending credence to the cursorial model. The focus shifted back to the arboreal model when several Chinese non–avian theropods from the Early Cretaceous were found in the early 2000s. These new finds, represented chiefly by Epidendrosaurus and Microraptor, have been described as possessing features that indicate an arboreal lifestyle; Microraptor even has flight feathers on its legs, which suggest it was a glider. While the arboreal hypothesis is still popular in modern times, there are several proponents of the cursorial model and no consensus has been established. Adherence to the arboreal model is shared both by paleontologists who accept the dinosaurian ancestry of birds, and by the minority who still believe birds to have evolved from a non-dinosaurian group of reptiles. Although the arboreal model was somewhat popular before Heilmann's research, his writings helped to advance and popularize it and the idea <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a hold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the prevalence of}} women who <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> vaginal intercourse (VIC) despite pain, avoid telling the partner, and feign enjoyment. It also considers {{the reasons for this}} behavior. A sample of 1566 female senior high school students (aged 18 - 22 years) completed a questionnaire concerning their experiences and attitudes toward their body and sexuality. Forty-seven percent (270 / 576) of those women who reported pain during VIC <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> VIC despite the pain. The most common reasons were that {{they did not want to}} spoil sex for or hurt the partner by interrupting VIC. Feigning enjoyment and not telling the partner about their pain were reported by 22 % and 33 % respectively. <b>Continuing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> VIC despite pain was associated with feelings of being inferior to the partner during sex, dissatisfaction with their own sex lives, and feigning enjoyment while having pain. Pain during VIC is reported by every third young Swedish woman, and almost half of those still <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> VIC. The major reason given is noteworthy [...] - prioritizing the partner’s enjoyment before their own [...] - and indicates that young women who <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> VIC despite pain take a subordinate position in sexual interactions...|$|R
