40|$|Research {{questions}} and used data The aim of my thesis is simple but extensive. In addition to exact research aims I have analysed how the Finnish {{juvenile justice system}} differs from systems {{in which there is}} a juvenile court institution. A detailed comparison is made between Finland, England and Wales, and Germany. Research questions are as follows: Which typical questions arise when we are discussing juvenile crime? What are the special characteristics of juvenile criminal justice especially when compared with adult criminal justice? What are the main principles on which special arrangements concerning juvenile crime are based? How does offender s young age and his characteristics influence the types of punishments and other form of sanctions? What is the division of labour between criminal law and child welfare? What role does diversion play in each system and what does it concretely mean? What is the distribution of punishment types given to juveniles? The used data is extensive. It consists of legislation, official documents, and jurisprudential, criminological and comparative criminal policy literature. In empirical parts of the study statistics, enforcement documents, criminal records and court decisions (as well as empirical data from my previous research) are used. On comparative parts of the study I have been forced to settle for secondary sources. Findings At the beginning of the 21 st century a heated parliament debate concerning the age of criminal responsibility took place in Finland. The claim was to lower it. The results of this study suggest (as has been claimed several times before by specialists) that there are practically no reasonable grounds to reform. Finnish juvenile criminal justice has little to offer to minor s dysfunction and social problems on which childrens´ crime are mainly due to also since the child welfare authorities deal with these cases. Changes to age categories would only be reasonable if the orientation of juvenile criminal justice would be changed in favour of child welfare aspect. This would mean that a part of the tasks nowadays handled by the child welfare authorities would be reassigned to the juvenile criminal justice system. However, criminological research and experiences in other countries do not support this view either. The vast majority of penalties imposed by courts for all age-groups consist of fines in Finland. The younger the offender the higher the share of fines (75 % in age-group 15 17, 60 % in 18 20 and 55 % for offenders over 20 years). This is a quite exceptional characteristic in international comparison. In Germany the corresponding percentage of fines for juveniles is 11 and in England and Wales 20. Among the use of different community sanctions (fines not included) are huge differences between compared countries. In Finland the share of community sanctions is 24 %, in Germany 78 % (leisure-time arrest and short-term arrest included) and in England and Wales 74 %. Respectively the share of imprisonment is in Finland 1 %, in Germany 11 % (prison and long-term detention) and 7 % in England and Wales. However, the number of juveniles getting some kind of criminal sanction (diversion included) is somewhat higher in Finland than in England and Wales or in Germany. In England and Wales the relative figure (per 100 000, relevant population) of sanctioned juveniles is 7087 (2004), in Germany 8495 (2004) and in Finland 9311 (2004). This analysis tried to figure out the number of children 10 17 years who are placed in child welfare institution against their own will and with a background of delinquent history in Finland. It was estimated that there are about 100 (10 14 -years) and 150 (15 17 -years) delinquents minor in <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>institutions.</b> At the same time there are only few (typically 2 7) juvenile prisoners. In England and Wales and in Germany number of juvenile prisoner (aged 15 17, per 100 000 relevant population) is much higher than in Finland. In England and Wales the relative figure (per 100 000 relevant population, including remand) of juvenile prisoner is 124 (2006), in Germany 64 (2005) and in Finland 4 (2006). In Finland, overall prison rate is about 70 prisoner per 100 000 inhabitants. Difference between juvenile prison rate and overall prison rate is huge. In England and Wales and Germany there are no great differences on this matter. However, these figures are misleading because of the differences between systems. There are much more (about 150) delinquent juveniles placed in <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>institutions</b> in Finland than there are juvenile prisoners. The <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>institutions</b> in Finland are very small and home-like in contrast to juvenile prisons in Finland but especially in England and Wales, or in Germany. When child welfare figures are added to juvenile prisoners figures, we find that there are about 77 juveniles (per 100 000, relevant population) placed outside their home because of their delinquent behaviour in Finland. The corresponding figures are about 150 in England and Wales, and 73 in Germany. The German figure would double if we took into account the juveniles placed in youth detention centres. The conclusion follows; taking into account child welfare side of Finnish system the differences are reasonable and comparable. In Finnish juvenile justice system the child welfare measures are far more commonly used way of control juveniles than utilising punishments. One could characterize Finnish juvenile justice system compared to England and Wales and Germany as follows: there are no juvenile courts, the use of monetary penalties is high, the significance of prior sanction in sentencing is quite low, community penalties are not very intensive, sanctions concerning violation of the conditions of community sentences are quite lenient and the parents are not held responsible for their child s crimes. Maybe the most important feature is to react on juvenile crimes more in the context of child welfare instead of criminal justice. The comparison of juvenile justice systems without taking into consideration both criminal justice and child welfare systems is misleading. Väitöskirjassa tarkastellaan nuorten rikosten käsittelyä ja seuraamuksia Suomessa, Saksassa ja Englannissa. Teoksessa käsitellään nuorisorikosoikeudellisen sääntelyn kehityskaaria (luku II) sekä eritellään nuoriin sovellettavan rangaistusjärjestelmän perusteita ja tavoitteita (luku III). Luvussa IV esitetään vertailumaiden nuorten rikosten käsittelyjärjestelmien perusteiden kuvaukset, arvioidaan Suomen 15 vuoden rangaistusvastuuikärajan tarkoituksenmukaisuutta sekä tarkastellaan eri maiden nuorisorikollisuuden tasoja ja rangaistusten jakaumia. Teoksen laajimmassa luvussa V kartoitetaan nuoriin sovellettavien seuraamusten sääntelyratkaisut ja soveltamiskäytännöt vertailumaissa, sekä arvioidaan eri järjestelmien soveltamisesta saatuja kokemuksia pääosin tilastollisen materiaalin valossa. Luvussa VI pohditaan lastensuojelun ja rikosoikeuden rajapintaa. Aineistona on käytetty kotimaisia ja ulkomaisia virallisasiakirjoja ja oikeuskirjallisuutta, kriminologista, vertailevaa ja kriminaalipoliittista kirjallisuutta, tilastoja sekä useita empiirisiä aineistoja. Vertailun osalta on tyydytty sekundaarilähteisiin. Suomessa voimassa oleva 15 vuoden rangaistusvastuuikäraja on perusteltu. Sen muuttamiseen ei ole ilmennyt pitäviä perusteita. Sakkorangaistuksella on Suomessa poikkeuksellisen suuri asema nuorten rikosseuraamuksena. Nuorten avoseuraamuksia on Suomessa vähän ja niitä myös käytetään vähän. Ehdollisen vankeuden valvonnan ja nuorisorangaistuksen väljä sisältö paikkaavat osittain avoseuraamusten vähäistä määrää. Suomen avoseuraamukset eivät ole kansainvälisessä katsannossa kovin intensiivisiä. Vankilan käyttö nuorten rangaistuksena on Suomessa kriminaalipoliittisesti tarkoituksenmukaisella tavalla harvinaista. Jos alaikäiseen on välttämättä kohdistettava vapaudenrajoitustoimia, hänet tulee sijoittaa lastensuojeluun erikoistuneeseen laitokseen, ei vankilaan. Käytännössä Suomessa tapahtuu juuri näin. Alaikäisten lainrikkojien paikka ei ole vankilassa vaan lastensuojelun huollollisten toimien piirissä. Väitöskirjan keskeinen tulos on se, ettei pelkkien rikosoikeudellisten käytäntöjen vertailu ole mielekästä. Jotta Suomessa omaksuttu nuorisorikosoikeudellinen järjestelmä tulee oikein ymmärretyksi, rikosoikeuden ohella tulee huomioida lastensuojelun toimet, jotka ovat viime vuosina yleistyneet melko paljon. Suomessa on alaikäisiä vankeja vain muutamia, mutta ainakin osaksi rikosperusteella laitoksiin sijoitettuja nuoria on tutkimuksessa esitetyn arvion mukaan moninkertainen määrä, noin 150. Lastensuojelulain mukaiset toimet ovat rangaistusjärjestelmää merkittävästi laajemmin käytetty nuorisorikollisuuden tuki- ja kontrollimuoto. Tämä on väittelijän käsityksen mukaan linjassa pohjoismaisen hyvinvointivaltion arvojen varaan rakentuvan kriminaalipolitiikan kanssa...|$|E
40|$|When the {{municipal}} {{child welfare services}} in Norway receive notifications of concern regarding a child {{they are responsible for}} reviewing the general situation and assistance requirements of the relevant child and determining whether the case should be dismissed or not. In this dissertation we will consider a study carried out by three municipal <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>institutions</b> on notifications of concern and requests for assistance that involve nine families with altogether 19 children aged between 2 and 12. I will focus on discursive forms of practice and perspectives of children that relate to the studies carried out by the child welfare authorities and also have {{a closer look at the}} consequences these may have for the relevant children. I have collected data on the notifications of concern and requests for assistance which formed the basis of the study of 9 cases by the child welfare authorities, including the child welfare workers’ analytical procedures, the questions and thematic focus of the study, who had been invited to contribute information, their narratives of the child’s situation and assistance requirements and the child welfare workers’ own conclusions and decisions in these cases. I have also carried out interviews with child welfare workers, parents and children who have been involved in the above mentioned inquiry. The analysis of the empirical material has been inspired by Michel Foucault and Norman Fairclough. They are both concerned with the role of language and discourse in the development of practises. With the help of a micro-analytical focus I have attempted to make some interpretations with regard to the tendencies and practises I have discussed in the analysis. The notifications of concern, on which the study of the child welfare authorities were based, centred on children’s behaviour/manners, delays in children’s evolution, violence between parents in the presence of children, the mental health of parents, suspicions of sexual abuse and allegations about gross neglect. Parents who themselves have been in touch with the child welfare authorities and requested assistance emphasized the challenges of their daily workload and asked for relief. The three municipal <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>institutions</b> in part relied on different approaches (different research models and research categories) in order to examine the children’s situation and requirements, regardless of the uniqueness of each case. Most of the informants used by the child welfare authorities were adult persons (parents and various representatives from the professions). In two out of nine cases, children got the opportunity to provide the premises for the decisions reached in the cases. The attitude of the child welfare workers and their inclination to involve children in the research process differed from study to study. However, there was a general tendency to exclude the perspectives and narratives of the children, who were not treated as meaningful subjects in the process of inquiry. There was hardly any emphasis on their rights (the right to information and the right to express opinions). Other discourses were given priority over the discourse of rights. In the process of inquiry, the child welfare workers primarily sought to obtain individual descriptions of children and parents, narratives about the childhood of parents and accounts of interplay within the family. This indicates that child welfare workers rely on psychological knowledge. They also tended to study family networks and to some extent searched for information regarding the everyday life and its structure within the families. There was little focus on living conditions or how the family members handled various challenges in their daily lives. For the most part, deviant children (the children were described in terms of delayed development, lack of social skills, lack of empathy, ADHD, and similar things) and parents who failed in their parenting duties or parents who had requested assistance were highlighted in the narratives by the various professionals and in the conclusions drawn by the child welfare authorities. The conclusions made by child welfare authorities were marked by a lack of specific and contextual information. In eight of the cases it was decided to offer the parents advice and guidance, whereas relief measures were recommended in two of the cases. One of the cases was dismissed. A decision to offer concrete assistance to the children was not reached in any of the cases, in spite of specific measures to assist the children having been mentioned in a number of the cases. The children are constituted as something different than the adults. This difference is not only linguistically generated through the way we talk about them, but also through the fact that child welfare workers largely ignore them in the process of inquiry. This reflects the hegemony of knowledge that prevails within the current child welfare services, how knowledge becomes productive with regard to the positioning of children and parents. Both the notifications of concern and the studies of the child welfare authorities demonstrate that the language we use is not neutral. The use of language (academic terms) and the thematic focus evident in the notifications of concern and studies were closely related to the specific task and institutional connections of the various participants. In relation to the inquiries and decisions carried out by the child welfare authorities, several discourses together form a certain order of discourse. I have attempted to show that the research practise of the child welfare authorities is not only marked by legal and economic power structures, but also that the power of knowledge strongly affects how the child welfare services are ru...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} master {{thesis is}} twofold. The first article is meant to give a review of goal setting theory and the High Performance Cycle (HPC), {{highlighting}} the connections between the five theories of motivation that HPC integrates focusing the torch on goal setting theory, social cognitive theory and reinforcement theory. The second article describes an effort to test the empirical adequacy of HPC assessed among employees in public <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>institution</b> {{in the north of}} Norway. The goal has been to validate HPC and to find out if it is possible to generalize findings to the Norwegian culture in public sector. The goal have also been to find possible connections between the elements of HPC and job engagement. Analyzing if job engagement can have better effect on commitment to the organization and willingness to accept further challenge than job satisfaction and {{to find out if the}} concept can be integrated in HPC. By using Structural Equation Modelling (MPLUS) it is found satisfactory empirical support for the key hypothesized relationships, both the HPC model as a hole and the models connections to the concept of job engagement. However, Job engagement do not increase the fit between the HPC model and the data, indicating it does not play any important role in HPC. Master i læring i komplekse systeme...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how a group of twenty teachers who work in an intervention program for institutionalized children in the Guangzhou <b>Children</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Institution</b> adapt Western educational concepts and approaches to transform their Chinese teaching practice. The intervention curriculum integrates the Italian Reggio Emilia approach and the American approach to teacher education with the practice that underlies Chinese national guidelines for early childhood education. This mixed methods design uses both qualitative and quantitative data to explore the adaptation process in order to study how their teaching beliefs and perceptions of teaching and learning are transformed after one year working in the intervention program. This study also examines how the teacher preparation and professional development impact the adaptation and transformation process. The qualitative data involves pre- and post-measures of self-drawings of the teachers, interviews at the sixth month mark of working in the program, and field notes from different timeframes. The quantitative data includes pre- and post-measures of Teacher Efficacy, Tolerance of Ambiguity, and Constructivist Beliefs. The findings indicate that all the teachers described changes in their communication skills, relationships with children and others, and confidence in themselves as well as their reflection competence. However, the findings also reveal differences between teachers hired from inside the institution and those hired from outside the institution in terms of the levels of changes in Teacher Efficacy, Tolerance of Ambiguity, and Constructivist Beliefs. Finally, the findings of this study suggest implications for developing an effective intervention program for children at high risk in an institutional setting. Children at high risk may benefit greatly both emotionally and cognitively from a relationship-based progressive intervention curriculum. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSummaryBackgroundBesides diseases, {{the concept}} of {{quality of life is}} {{increasingly}} used to account for the consequences of other vulnerability situations that may be encountered by individuals, including young children. However, very few studies have examined children's perception of their quality of life in the context of <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> and protection, and they yielded mixed results. ObjectivesThe objectives of this study were (1) to compare the subjective quality of life of children placed in institution with that of children living in their families, by controlling for child sex, age, socioeconomic and familial status, and (2) to examine its relations with their placement course in the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> system. MethodThe sample of this study was composed of 56 children aged 6 to 11, 28 of which were placed in a <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>institution.</b> Information about the placement course of institutionalized children was given by their social workers and {{the quality of life of}} all participants was assessed with the AUQUEI questionnaire. This self-report, which is based on children's conception of their quality of life, allows assessment of four distinct dimensions in addition to the overall score: leisure, performances, relations and family life, and separation. ResultsAccording to the results, the quality of life of children placed in institutions did not differ from that of children living in their families. However, its perception was closely related to the placement course of institutionalized children in the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> system. Whereas maltreated children obtained lower overall and performance scores than their neglected peers, children placed in foster families before institution had a poorer perception of their quality of life in the domains of family life and separations. DiscussionThese results are interpreted in light of attachment research and theory. Indeed, the relations between children's quality of life and their placement course could be explained by their high level of attachment disorganization. Finally, the results of this study suggested that children were well aware of their difficulties and that they can easily be identified by directly assessing the children's quality of life. Mots clésKeywords Quality of life; Children; Placement course; <b>Child</b> <b>welfare</b> institutionRésuméEn dehors des maladies, la notion de qualité de vie est de plus en plus utilisée pour rendre compte des conséquences psychologiques et sociales d’autres situations de vulnérabilité rencontrées par les individus, y compris de jeunes enfants. L’objectif de cette étude est de comparer la qualité de vie d’enfants placés en institution suite à une mesure de protection de l’enfance et d’enfants vivant dans leur famille, ainsi que d’examiner ses relations avec leur parcours de placement. La population est composée de 56 enfants de 6 à 11 ans dont 28 étaient placés dans une institution relevant de la protection de l’enfance au moment du recueil de données. Les éducateurs référents des enfants placés ont rempli un questionnaire permettant de retracer leur parcours de placement et l’ensemble des enfants ayant participé à l’étude ont évalué la perception qu’ils avaient de leur qualité de vie. Les résultats montrent que si la qualité de vie des enfants placés ne se distingue pas de celle des autres enfants, en revanche, elle apparaît étroitement liée aux causes et à la multiplicité des lieux de placement. Ces résultats sont interprétés à la lumière des travaux issus de la théorie de l’attachement.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} was {{on the question of}} who provides the most accurate information with regard to the behavior of a child under which circumstances. In clinical practice, information on the functioning of a particular child is commonly provided by such different types of informants as the parents, teachers, other professionals, and the children themselves. The agreement between the child behavior judgments provided by different types of informants has been reported to be quite low, however. This may be due to situational factors, such as the variation in child behaviors across different situations, but also to characteristics of the informants themselves. The different factors that appear to influence the accuracy of child behavior judgments are subsumed within a more general model of social perception for further examination and analysis. Three experiments were conducted to test the validity of judgments of child behavior problems in connection with the personalities of the informants. Subjects were 55 6 - to 12 -year old children admitted to a <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>institution,</b> and their parents, teachers and group-care workers. Results showed that mothers with higher levels of anxiety, depression, or hostility, {{were more likely to report}} internalizing problem behaviors for their children than mothers with lower levels of these symptoms ? but only when mothers rated their children's behaviors at home. When mothers rated videotaped behavior samples of their children recorded in the clinic, no relations were found between maternal personality traits ? including neuroticism ? and maternal child reports. In the case of the teachers and group-care workers, however, higher levels of neuroticism were found to be related to higher ratings of child behaviors by the professionals. The results of this study thus suggest that professionals working with children are not immune to biased perception...|$|R
