[...] "The whole point of that song is, the temptation is there, but I'm not going to give in to it." [...] When asked if the lyrics were regarding a drinking problem, Clarkson responded, [...] "I'm not an alcoholic; that's not what it's about. It's just a metaphor.

500|$|The fifth, and last, of David's volumes {{consisting}} {{primarily of}} recipes {{is by far}} the longest of them. The 1970 paperback edition published by Penguin Books runs to 584 pages. David's biographer Artemis Cooper describes it as [...] "a book that only needed assembling", because it was based on previously published articles and her own collection of notes and recipes from the previous two decades. David researched her recipes thoroughly, and whenever several supposedly classic and mutually contradictory recipes existed she [...] "knew how to reduce a recipe to its bare essentials, and then reconstruct it". By the 1960s, she was described in the British press as [...] "the most revered goddess of cooking", and The Observer said, [...] "It is difficult to think of any home that <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> [...] Elizabeth David's [...] French Provincial Cooking.|$|E
500|$|Walt Whitman {{has been}} claimed as America's first [...] "poet of democracy", a title meant to reflect {{his ability to}} write in a {{singularly}} American character. A British friend of Walt Whitman, Mary Smith Whitall Costelloe, wrote: [...] "You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without Leaves of Grass... He has expressed that civilization, 'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> him." [...] Modernist poet Ezra Pound called Whitman [...] "America's poet... He is America." [...] Andrew Carnegie called him [...] "the great poet of America so far". Whitman considered himself a messiah-like figure in poetry. Others agreed: one of his admirers, William Sloane Kennedy, speculated that [...] "people will be celebrating the birth of Walt Whitman {{as they are now}} the birth of Christ".|$|E
500|$|The Norwegian Nobel Committee {{confirmed}} that Mahatma Gandhi {{was nominated for}} the Peace Prize in 1937–39, 1947, {{and a few days}} before he was assassinated in January 1948. Later, members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed regret that he was not given the prize. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006, said, [...] "The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize. Whether Nobel committee <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> Gandhi is the question". In 1948, the year of Gandhi's death, the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the grounds that [...] "there was no suitable living candidate" [...] that year. Later, when the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was [...] "in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi." [...] Other high-profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been missed out. Foreign Policy lists Eleanor Roosevelt, Václav Havel, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Sari Nusseibeh, and Corazon Aquino as people who [...] "never won the prize, but should have." ...|$|E

500|$|Gandhi did {{not receive}} the Nobel Peace Prize, {{although}} he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including the first-ever nomination by the American Friends Service Committee, though he made the short list only twice, in 1937 and 1947. Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission, and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award. Gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before nominations closed. That year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that [...] "there was no suitable living candidate" [...] and later {{research shows that the}} possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to Gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to Gandhi. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, [...] "The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> Gandhi is the question".

500|$|Gibson's {{writing was}} {{positively}} received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers, Candas Jane Dorsey, and Rudy Rucker. Rucker has written: [...] "ith a poet's touch, he tiles words into wonderful mosaics" [...] and Danvers wrote that [...] "no sentence has a subject if it <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> one". One critic found the prose {{to be as}} [...] "hard and compact as glacier ice" [...] and another that it [...] "gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity". Gibson's descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo, Russia and London were singled out as impressive, and The Village Voices review remarked that [...] "Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board: the coffee-shop intimacy, the fishbowl paranoia, the splintering factions, the inevitable flame war". Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated: As usual, Gibson's prose is ... corpuscular, crenelated. His sentences slide from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal e-mail styles. Without any metafictional grandstanding, Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture: {{how it feels to}} be close to someone you know only as a voice in a chat room, or to fret about someone spying on your browser's list of sites visited. Filled with name-dropping of businesses and products, such as MUJI, Hotmail, iBook, Netscape, and G4, the language of the novel was judged by one critic to be [...] "awkward in its effort to appear [...] "cool"" [...] while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date the novel. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette review commented that the [...] "constant, unadulterated [...] "hipster-technocrat, cyber-MTV" [...] lingo [...] overdone and inappropriate" [...] On the technology, Cory Doctorow found Gibson's use of watermarks and keystroke logging to be hollow and has noted that [...] "Gibson is no technologist, he's an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor. But ... Gibson's metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book".|$|E

2500|$|Both {{before and}} during the Second World War, Borges {{regularly}} published essays attacking the Nazi police state and its racist ideology. His outrage was fueled by his deep love for German literature. In an essay published in 1937, Borges attacked the Nazi Party's use of children's books to inflame antisemitism. He wrote, [...] "I don't know if the world <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> German civilization, but I do know that its corruption by the teachings of hatred is a crime." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lambda {{calculus}} may be untyped or typed. In typed lambda calculus, functions can {{be applied}} {{only if they are}} capable of accepting the given input's [...] "type" [...] of data. Typed lambda calculi are weaker than the untyped lambda calculus that is the primary subject of this article, in the sense that typed lambda calculi can express less than the untyped calculus can, {{but on the other hand}} typed lambda calculi allow more things to be proved; in the simply typed lambda calculus it is for example a theorem that every evaluation strategy terminates for every simply typed lambda-term, whereas evaluation of untyped lambda-terms need not terminate. One reason there are many different typed lambda calculi has been the desire to do more (of what the untyped calculus <b>can</b> <b>do)</b> <b>without</b> giving up on being able to prove strong theorems about the calculus.|$|E

2500|$|The new context again {{cemented}} the Ententists' reputation: the country, {{now joined}} with Bessarabia, became Greater Romania when the Romanian Transylvanians voted {{for their own}} union act, and Bukovina too was incorporated. The developments perplexed Carp, leaving him to comment: [...] "Romania is so lucky, that she <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> her statesmen." [...] By early 1919, {{he was living in}} seclusion at his Țibănești manor. During May, the King's Commissioner began an investigation into Germanophile activities, questioning Carp about his wartime activities, and, more insistently, about those of his disciples. This action sparked protests in the media. Even the formerly Ententist Adevărul daily noted, through Constantin Costa-Foru, that the effort to make Carp incriminate himself was [...] "a despicable calumny." [...] Similarly, the Bucovina gazette of Iancu Flondor and Pamfil Șeicaru expressed concern that [...] "a moribund" [...] was being hassled while [...] "so many common delinquents roam free".|$|E

Game Tunnel's reviewers were divided; Prince said [...] "In Chocolate Castle we've got a slickly presented puzzle game polished to a sparkling shine", but John Bardinelli disagreed and stated the game [...] "doesn't {{look like much}} at first glance". William Usher described the graphics as [...] "simplistic", and the chip tune music as [...] "nothing but 80's-gaming incarnate". Tim W. praised the graphics as [...] "sharp", but stated that the game's lack of music during play was his only complaint; [...] "some people <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> it, but it doesn't feel right to me without background music." [...] Yu said [...] "Joseph White’s games are always brimming with charm and atmosphere, and Chocolate Castle is no exception!"

2500|$|In Lévy's 1988 paper [...] "", {{he defines}} {{a notion of}} optimal sharing, such that no work is duplicated. For example, {{performing}} a beta reduction in normal order on (λx.xx) (II) reduces it to II (II). The argument II is duplicated by the application to the first lambda term. If the reduction was done in an applicative order first, we save work because work is not duplicated: (λx.xx) (II) reduces to (λx.xx) I. On the other hand, using applicative order can result in redundant reductions or even possibly never reduce to normal form. For example, performing a beta reduction in normal order on (λf.f I) (λy.(λx.xx) (y I)) yields (λy.(λx.xx) (y I)) I, (λx.xx) (II) which we know we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> duplicating work. Doing the same but in applicative order yields (λf.f I) (λy.y I (y I)), (λy.y I (y I)) I, I I (I I), and now work is duplicated.|$|E
