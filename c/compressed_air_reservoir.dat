40|$|Farm {{tractors}} {{are provided}} with pneumatic systems to control and operate air braking systems as well as pneumatic suspension systems, the latter being increasingly often applied to high-capacity trailers. The excessive consumption of compressed air may adversely affect the braking effectiveness of a tractor-trailer unit; therefore, the impact of performance of the air supply equipment of the tractor on the transient processes {{taking place in the}} air braking system of the trailer should be taken into consideration as early as at the design stage. A mathematical model of the air supply equipment, consisting of functional and structural models of individual equipment components such as compressor, pressure regulator, and <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>reservoir,</b> has been presented in this paper. An example has been included, where the computer model of the supply system, prepared in the Matlab-Simulink program, was used to assess the correctness of compressor selection to the pneumatic system of the Pronar 5110 tractor. The adequacy of the implemented computer model of the air supply equipment, experimentally confirmed, was evaluated with statistical methods, {{with the use of the}} Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of the generation}} of detonation waves moving periodically across high speed channel flow is experimentally demonstrated. Such waves {{are essential to the}} concept of compressing requirements and increasing the engine pressure compressor with the objective of reducing conventional compressor requirements and increasing the engine thermodynamic efficiency through isochoric energy addition. By generating transient transverse waves, rather than standing waves, shock wave losses are reduced by an order of magnitude. The ultimate objective is to use such detonation ducts downstream of a low pressure gas turbine compressor to produce a high overall pressure ratio thermodynamic cycle. A 4 foot long, 1 inch x 12 inch cross-section, detonation duct was operated in a blow-down mode using <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Liquid or vapor propane was injected through injectors or solenoid valves located in the plenum or the duct itself. Detonation waves were generated when the mixture was ignited by a row of spark plugs in the duct wall. Problems with fuel injection and mixing limited the air speeds to about Mach 0. 5, frequencies to below 10 Hz, and measured pressure ratios of about 5 to 6.

5000|$|The rifle was 4 ft {{long and}} weighed 10 lb, {{about the same}} basic size and weight as other muskets of the time. It fired a [...]46 caliber ball [...] (caliber is contested, {{original}} sources such as Dolleczek [...] describe the caliber as 13mm (.51cal)) {{and it had a}} tubular, gravity-fed magazine with a capacity of 20 balls. This gravity operated design was such that the rifle had to be pointed upwards in order to drop each ball into the breech block. Unlike its contemporary, muzzle-loading muskets, which required the rifleman to stand up to reload with powder and ball, the shooter could reload a ball from the magazine by holding the rifle vertically while lying on his back and operating the ball delivery mechanism.

50|$|The Westinghouse {{system uses}} <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on each vehicle and <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> is {{released}} from these reservoirs to the brake cylinders as {{the pressure in}} the train pipe is reduced by the driver operating the brake valve.

5000|$|The shells {{fired from}} the guns were steel or brass casings 7 feet (2 meters) long with the {{explosive}} contained in the conical forward part of the casing and spiral vanes on the after part to rotate the projectile. The explosive used in the shells themselves was actually a [...] "desensitized blasting gelatin" [...] composed of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. It was less sensitive to shock than regular dynamite but still sensitive enough that <b>compressed</b> <b>air,</b> rather than powder, had to be utilized as the propellant. Shells containing 550 pounds (250 kg) of explosive had a maximum range of 1 mile (1.6 km), but range could be extended to 4000 yards (3.7 km) by reducing projectile weight to 200 pounds (100 kg). Maximum muzzle velocity was 800 feet (250 meters) per second. Range could be reduced by releasing less <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> from the <b>reservoir.</b> Ten shells per gun were carried on board, and 15 shells were fired in 16 minutes 50 seconds during an 1889 test.

5000|$|The Westinghouse {{air brake}} system.

The Westinghouse system uses smaller <b>air</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and brake cylinders than the corresponding vacuum equipment, because a moderately high air pressure can be used.

A model of a hybrid power plant consisting of CAES coupled with a wind farm is presented. The model employs neural network-based wind speed forecasting. By storing surplus energy some of the major limitations of wind source (low power density, unpredictable nature, etc) can be overcome. The use of time-series neural network-based prediction models aims at reducing the stochastic uncertainty of wind power and can be a powerful means for planning the daily operation strategy of the storage system. Based on CAES technical data of the Alabama plant and wind turbine data provided by GE, a detailed economic analysis has been carried out: investment and maintenance costs are estimated based on literature data, while operational costs are calculated according the actual energy market prices.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} of an electric system is to match a fluctuating power demand. This problem {{becomes more and more}} complex thanks to the growing recourse to renewable sources, which are unpredictable and intermittent in nature, largely depending upon local site and unpredictable weather conditions. By coupling suitable storage systems with power plants, based on conventional or renewable sources, significant benefits in terms of flexibility in matching a fluctuating power demand can be achieved. Among storage systems, <b>Compressed</b> <b>Air</b> Energy Storage (CAES) and Pumped Hydroelectric Storage (PHS) seem today the only storage technologies that offer sufficiently low storage-specific capital costs suitable for use in conjunction with large plants. In CAES, particularly suitable for dry and flat regions, energy is stored as <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> in a <b>reservoir</b> during off-peak periods, while it is used on demand during peak periods to generate power with a turbo-generator system. Interesting perspectives are also offered by the Vehicle to Grid (V 2 G) technology. In this approach, plug-in electric, hybrid or fuel cell vehicles, when parked, can both absorb energy from the grid (Plug-In Vehicles) or also give energy to it. V 2 G may therefore provide a means by which to utilise the spare power capacity available in each parked vehicle and avoid the need to maintain the excess conventional electricity generation capacity currently required to provide regulation, peak power and spinning reserves. V 2 G technologies represent therefor...|$|R

50|$|The {{release of}} <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> into the brake {{cylinders}} {{is achieved by}} triple valves, which are themselves controlled by the pressure of air in the train pipe, a pneumatic pipe running {{the length of the}} train.

When the driver wishes to release the brakes, his operation of the driver’s brake valve returns <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> (stored in a cylinder near the driving position) into the train pipe and this moves the triple valve so as to release the air in the brake cylinders to atmosphere, allowing the brake blocks to move clear of the wheels.
