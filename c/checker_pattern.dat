5|$|According to {{literary}} critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé's story include Jules Verne's 1870 novel Around the Moon and the 1950 American film Destination Moon. Hergé was certainly {{inspired by a}} number of photographic stills from the Destination Moon film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first computer to be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his moon rocket on the designs of the V-2 rocket which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white <b>checker</b> <b>pattern</b> on Hergé's rocket was based upon an illustration of a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon's 1947 book German Research in World War II. He commissioned the construction of a model rocket with detachable parts from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he showed it to Ananoff, asking him if it was a realistic representation of what a moon rocket might look like. He and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.|$|E

According to the Hong Kong-based Apple Daily newspaper, the company was seeking a compensation of HK$25,000 (around US$3,200) and the publication of an apology in the form of newspaper advertisement. The owner had sourced basic furniture and equipment from the PRC for starting his shop. Facing this accusation, the barber shop owner said he had no means to tackle Louis Vuitton and may have to close down his shop which has been operating for 1 year in a remote local district on Hong Kong Island.The controversy had caused tremendous concern on Hong Kong news forums and viral protest on Facebook pages.|$|E
50|$|In mid-level vision, {{the visual}} system {{utilizes}} {{a set of}} heuristic methods, called Gestalt grouping rules, to quickly identify a basic perception of an object that helps to resolve an ambiguity. This allows perception to be fast and easy by observing patterns and familiar images rather than a slow process of identifying each part of a group. This aids in resolving ambiguous images because the visual system will accept small variations in the pattern and still perceive the pattern as a whole. The Gestalt grouping rules {{are the result of}} the experience of the visual system. Once a pattern is perceived frequently, it is stored in memory and can be perceived again easily without the requirement of examining the entire object again. For example, when looking at a chess board, we perceive a <b>checker</b> <b>pattern</b> and not a set of alternating black and white squares.|$|E

5000|$|Since its foundation, Willy Serrato's {{colors and}} badge {{were very similar}} to those of the English clubs Manchester City F.C., to the point of {{including}} the Premier League and UEFA Champions League badges on the left and right shirt sleeves respectively during the 2013 season.

50|$|As Shigemori {{became more}} {{interested}} in Japanese garden design, he meticulously surveyed and researched 242 gardens in Japan. His findings were published in 1938 as a collection called Illustrated Book on the History of the Japanese Garden. Upon completing his research, Shigemori started to apply his own aesthetics to garden design. Shigemori believed that Japanese garden design had stopped evolving since the Edo Period (1600-1868), and resolved to modernize the medium. His first major work was at Tofu-kuji Temple in Kyoto. Within the gardens Shigemori blended traditional garden design with more contemporary concepts. The gardens of Tofu-kuji have strong elements of cubism and surrealism in particular {{in the use of}} stone. The stones consisted of square cubes, creating a <b>checker</b> <b>pattern</b> as well as round stone pillars which replaced naturally shaped stone. While at first glance the gardens appear to have abandoned traditional constraints, the design upon closer examination highlight an evolution of aesthetics. Shigemori continued to be a prolific designer and scholar until his death in 1975. His philosophical approach to Japanese garden design reinterpreted foreign influences to breathe new vitality to a traditional medium. He took uniquely Western design aesthetics and created an evolved Japanese garden.|$|E

50|$|Trailer camps were {{established}} {{to handle the}} sudden influx of workers and other housing facilities were pressed to the limit.It had always been reported that the number may have been closer to 16,500. That is the figure the Mellon-Stuart firm mentioned in a wartime letter.In all some 1,000 structures were erected about the time 1942 had run its course. In addition to barracks facilities for both officers and men the camp included several theaters and gymnasiums, three obstacle courses, chapels, fire stations, warehouses, dayrooms, post exchanges, a 100-bed hospital, mess halls, latrines, a rifle range, motor pool quarters, etc. In short, these facilities could support a temporary town of 90,000 persons at any given time.Additionally, the base had its own sewage treatment plant and waste disposal facilities. There were 18 miles of sewer lines, hundreds of fire hydrants, 25 miles of paved roads, 22 miles of water lines, and over 100 miles of electric lines. Two 250,000-gallon water tanks (painted in a large red-and white <b>checker</b> <b>pattern)</b> {{at the southern end}} of the encampment supplied water for the area for many years after the war ended. They were among the many facilities which were to have a lasting value to the area and to be in part responsible for the housing development which started in the 1950s.Originally it was estimated that the camp project would cost a few million dollars, but a total in excess of $19,000,000 was said to have been spent in the overall construction. The final cost never was announced officially.|$|E
