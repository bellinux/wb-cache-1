40|$|Utilizing a {{stochastic}} frontier approach, {{this paper}} examines the importance that input-oriented technical and scale efficiency may have for Greek cotton {{farmers in the}} context of the current EU cotton policy. To that end, a sample of cotton-growing farms in the representative cotton -producing county of Karditsa (central Greece) is empirically analyzed. The results suggest that the farms examined exhibit decreasing returns to scale and they are both scale and technically inefficient. Moreover, elimination of these inefficiencies could result in considerable gains; the cotton farmers examined could reduce production costs by 46. 0 %, by becoming both technically and scale efficient. Additionally, we estimate that if cotton farms in the area examined were technically and scale efficient the intervention price reductions (<b>co-responsibility</b> <b>levy)</b> imposed by the EU for excessive cotton production would be smaller for all Greek cotton growers. ...|$|R

But recent shortages in apprenticeship positions have led to a renewed debate about appropriate training policy. At present, there are renewed calls to introduce a training <b>levy</b> <b>scheme,</b> which would impose training levies on non-training firms and give additional support to training firms. Some economists favor this policy in order to counteract poaching of trained apprentices. Other economists oppose it strongly on the basis that positive spillovers do not occur. Still others suggest to loosen training regulations and allow for reimbursement clauses in training contracts. Surprisingly, a general economic analysis and comparison of these alternative instruments is still lacking. This work attempts to close this gap. It investigates whether poaching enables to derive positive spillovers from apprenticeship training, and if so, whether training policy could play a mitigating role. Following the recent training literature, we use a simple oligopsonistic labor market model with endogenous turnover. Such a setting allows us to explain why firms provide and (at least partially) finance general vocational training. Moreover, it demonstrates that a positive externality arises as competing firms benefit from vocational training through poaching. We then introduce alternative policy instruments into the model.

The proposed training <b>levy</b> <b>scheme,</b> however, is a particular scheme that links subsidies and levies.

We show that introducing this training <b>levy</b> <b>scheme</b> can entail ambiguous repercussions on general welfare even when transaction costs are excluded. Reimbursement clauses, in contrast, oblige the trainee to compensate for training when quitting the firm. They alter workers' outside options and thereby increase firms' wage-setting power. In this model, in opposition to earlier studies, we show that they do not affect training spillovers. Instead, they are identified as an implicit training loan.

In theory, fiscal instruments are more efficient and effective to change people’s behaviour, but its impacts towards attitude are still in question. Also, the level of green citizenship, which emphasising that people {{have the responsibility to}} protect and sustain the environment, is a good indicator to know people’s attitudes towards the environment, but the Hong Kong government tends to rely on fiscal disincentives to change people’s behaviour, Green Citizenship had never been addressed. Green citizenship is a personal commitment {{to learn more about the}} environment and to take responsible environmental action. Environmental citizenship encourages individuals, communities and organizations to think about the environmental rights and responsibilities we all have as residents of the planet Earth (Environmental Canada, 2006). This study carried out a questionnaire research to identify the policy effect that the Levy in Hong Kong have on environmental attitudes and behaviours, as well as to identify the relative impact of economic incentive versus Green Citizenship on green attitudes and behaviours. The survey was conducted from 25 th April to 9 th May 2012 for two weeks in the form of internet survey. The research found that the Environmental <b>Levy</b> <b>Scheme</b> on Plastic Shopping Bags affected citizens’ behaviour and attitude to reduce the use of plastic shopping bags, and also changed people’s behavioural intention to act pro-environmentally, if their beliefs are strong enough to override the disadvantages brought by pro-environmentally actions. However, the level of green citizenship in Hong Kong is still in a private level, the sense of green citizenship of the society is still weak, thus, a comprehensive education programme should be carried out by both the society (bottom-up) and the government (top-bottom) to raise the level of green citizenship of the society. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

However, employer-employee data are costly and hardly available.

One solution currently being considered in the UK, is the idea of imposing a levy on businesses for utilising private parking spaces. However, while the legislation enabling local authorities to introduce such a charge was passed in 2000, only one local authority (Nottingham) retains an interest in the measure and it is still uncertain as to whether it will eventually be implemented.

40|$|Following the Information Society Directive of 2001 (introducing {{the concept}} of “fair compensation” for private copying into EU Law), total {{collection}} from levies on copying media and equipment in the EU tripled, from about € 170 m to more than € 500 m per annum. <b>Levy</b> <b>schemes</b> exist now in 22 out of 27 Member States (with only the UK, Ireland, Malta, Cyprus and Luxembourg remaining outside). Despite their wide adoption, levy systems are little understood, both in respect of their rationale and their economic consequences. Tariffs are increasingly contested in court, leading to a large gap between claimed and collected revenues. The European Commission has announced “comprehensive legislative action” for 2012. This report offers the first independent empirical assessment of the European levy system as a whole. The research consolidates the evidence on levy setting, collection and distribution; reviews the scope of consumer permissions associated with levy payments; and reports the results of three product level studies (printer/scanners, portable music/video/game devices, and tablet computers), analysing the relationship between VAT, levy tariffs and retail prices in 20 levy and non�levy countries. Key findings: There are dramatic differences between countries in the methodology used for identifying leviable devices, setting tariffs, and allocating beneficiaries of the levy. There are levies on blank media in 22 EU countries, on MP 3 players in 18 countries, on printers in 12 countries, on personal computers in 4 countries. Revenues collected per capita vary between € 0. 02 (Romania) and € 2. 6 (France). The distribution of levy revenues to recording artists is less than € 0. 01 per album These variations cannot be explained by an underlying concept of economic harm to rightholders from private copying The scope of consumer permissions under the statutory exceptions for private copying within the EU vary, and generally do not match with what consumers ordinarily understand as private activities In levy countries, the costs of levies as an indirect tax are not always {{passed on to the}} consumer. In competitive markets, such as those for printers, manufacturers of levied goods appear to absorb the levy. There appears to be a pan-European retail price range for many consumer devices regardless of <b>levy</b> <b>schemes</b> (with the exception of Scandinavia). In non-levy countries, such as the UK, a certain amount of private copying is already priced into retail purchases. For example, right holders have either explicitly permitted acts of format shifting, or decided not to enforce their exclusive rights. Commercial practice will not change as a result of introducing a narrowly conceived private copying exception. A more widely conceived exception that would cover private activities that take place in digital networks (such as downloading for personal use, or non-commercial adaptation and distribution within networks of friends) may be best understood not as an exception but as a statutory licence.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether the public sharing of music over networks like Napster should be considered copyright infringement, we must first conclude that digital works should be entitled to copyright protection. Professor Ku argues against copyright protection for digital works because the economics of digital technology undercut prior assumptions about the efficacy of a private property regime as a remedy to the public goods nature of information. This becomes clear when we separately examine the two interests served by copyright, the creation and the dissemination of works to the public. By questioning {{the conventional wisdom that}} these interests are aligned, Professor Ku reveals that the argument for copyright is primarily an argument for protecting the distributors of content {{in a world in which}} 2 ̆ 2 middlemen 2 ̆ 2 are no longer necessary. Copyright is no longer needed to encourage distribution because consumers, themselves, build and fund the distribution channels for digital content. With respect to the creation of music, Professor Ku argues that the exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute copies currently provide little, if any, incentive for creation, and that free music and digital technology may in fact increase the financial rewards to artists. Consequently, the exclusive rights to reproduce and disseminate digital music under copyright cannot be justified. To the extent that additional incentives are considered necessary, he proposes the Digital Recording Act that would fund artists through a statutory <b>levy</b> <b>scheme</b> with the distribution of funding tied to aggregate Internet downloading or use.

They derive the welfare changes in terms of net consumer and producer surplus, rather than in terms of producer income as in the Newbery and Stiglitz approach. The authors present formulas for measuring the welfare changes for domestic price stabilization achieved through profitable storage (as assumed by Newbery and Stiglitz) and for stabilization through a variable tariff scheme. These formulas differ significantly, so it is inappropriate to use the Newbery and Stiglitz formula to justify the use of domestic price controls such as a variable levy. In recent years, governments {{in many developing countries}} have liberalized their trade policies in the pursuit of improved economic performance. But this has exposed their economies to variations in international prices and raised questions about the desirability of domestic price stabilization programs. A popular mechanism for this purpose is a variable import <b>levy</b> <b>scheme.</b> The authors'analysis confirms that domestic welfare is lower under trade policies that stabilize domestic prices, as such policies serve only to shift the price uncertainty from producers and consumers to the government budget - while incurring the social costs of the distortionary tariffs and subsidies.

This study explores {{the development of the}} technical institutes in Hong Kong,from the mid 1960 s, when the first one was planned, to August 31, 1980, and places on record some of the experience gained in the process. The thesis includes a short history of technical education in Hong Kong and examines the rapidly changing industrial and social background, {{and the way in which}} it affected the technical institutes. The rate of development in student numbers and build up of staff has been rapid and these factors, together with the number of female students and the size of classes, are examined and comparisons are made with other countries such as Britain and Singapore. There have also been developments in Hong Kong in areas such as secondary education, higher education, apprenticeships, industrial-training centres, <b>levy</b> <b>schemes,</b> credit-units and handicapped students which, have affected the technical institutes and these too are examined. The different types and levels of courses are then reviewed and reasons are given why emphasis has been placed on part time day studies. This thesis goes on to examine the standard of education provided in the technical institutes. This is done by analysing attitudes towards technical education, by examining various surveys and by looking at other "indicators of excellence". These include the demand for student places and employment prospects; the views of educationalists, employers, students, parents and the general public; and the recognition of technical institute courses by overseas bodies. The study is reviewed in Chapter 7 and the general conclusion arrived at is that despite the very rapid development of the technical institutes they have provided a satisfactory standard of education which has risen over the years.
