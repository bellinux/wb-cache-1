5|$|The Nation Alliance Party was {{guided by}} a support for multiculturalism. Specifically, the party sought to {{increase}} translation services for people who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> or speak English or people whose first language is not English, equivalency of academic standards, more supportive immigration services that assist transition into Canadian society, and better working conditions for recent immigrants and migrant labourers.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Petrie {{launched}} the academic journal Ancient Egypt, published {{through his own}} British School of Archaeology in Egypt (BSAE), which was based at UCL. Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt, Murray was left to operate as de facto editor much of the time. She also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews, particularly of the German-language publications which Petrie <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>read.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many of Riley's {{poems are}} filled with musical references. Riley had no musical education, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> sheet music, but learned from his father how to play guitar, and from a friend how to play violin. He {{performed}} in two different local bands, and became so proficient on the violin {{he was invited to}} play with a group of adult Freemasons at several events. A few of his later poems were set to music and song, one of the most well known being A Short'nin' Bread Song—Pieced Out.|$|E

5|$|Jack {{eventually}} married Polly in 1915, {{after they}} had moved to Elmore Street, Everton. One of the witnesses at the wedding was Polly's sister, Catherine Seddon. Daughter Edith Lennon was born that year and then Charles (21 November 1918 – 26 May 2002). The Lennons moved back to Toxteth Park, and Jack died in 1921, at 57 Copperfield Street. He was buried on 6th August 1921 at Allerton Cemetery. His grave, number 206 in Roman Catholic section 4, is an unmarked public grave. Polly <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> or write, but {{was reported to be}} very humorous and supposedly had psychic abilities. After Jack died, Polly did not have enough money to keep the whole Lennon family together, so she placed two of her children, Alf and Edith, in the Blue Coat School Orphanage. It was situated just around the corner from Newcastle Road (where Julia Stanley lived). Polly died on 30 January 1949.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Gilbert {{travelled}} to Italy in 1838 {{and then}} France {{for two years}} with his parents, who finally returned to settle in London in 1847. He was educated at Boulogne, France, {{from the age of}} seven (he later kept his diary in French so that the servants <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> it), then at Western Grammar School, Brompton, London, and then at the Great Ealing School, where he became head boy and wrote plays for school performances and painted scenery. He then attended King's College London, graduating in 1856. He intended to take the examinations for a commission in the Royal Artillery, but {{with the end of the}} Crimean War, fewer recruits were needed, and the only commission available to Gilbert would have been in a line regiment. Instead he joined the Civil Service: he was an assistant clerk in the Privy Council Office for four years and hated it. In 1859 he joined the Militia, a part-time volunteer force formed for the defence of Britain, with which he served until 1878 (in between writing and other work), reaching the rank of Captain. In 1863 he received a bequest of £300 that he used to leave the civil service and take up a brief career as a barrister (he had already entered the Inner Temple as a student), but his legal practice was not successful, averaging just five clients a year.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps Burton's best-known book is his {{translation}} of The Kama Sutra.

The Kama Shastra Society first printed the book in 1883 and numerous editions of the Burton translation are in print to this day.|$|E
