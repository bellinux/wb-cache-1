40|$|OBJECTIVE. the {{objective}} of our {{study was to identify}} which imaging features may be used to differentiate between cirrhosis and chronic hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and to assess image interpretation agreement for MRI findings. MATERIALS and METHODS. Retrospective review of 27 patients with alcoholic or virus-induced cirrhosis and 24 patients with chronic hepatosplenic schistosorniasis who underwent MRI (1. 5 T) of the abdomen was performed. Images were interpreted independently by two radiologists evaluating the following MRI features: hepatic fissure widening, irregularity of hepatic contours, periportal fibrosis, hepatic parenchyma heterogeneity, and splenic siderotic nodules. Left, right, and <b>caudate</b> hepatic <b>lobe</b> measurements were obtained, and the splenic index was measured. the Fisher's exact test, chi-square test, and Student's t test were used to compare both groups, and regression analysis was performed. Observer agreement was measured using kappa and intraclass correlation tests. RESULTS. Periportal fibrosis, heterogeneity of hepatic parenchyma, and splenic siderotic nodules were more frequent in the group with schistosomiasis (p < 0. 05), with periportal fibrosis showing the largest difference in presence and distribution (peripheral greater than central). the transverse diameter of the right hepatic <b>lobe,</b> <b>caudate</b> lobe-right <b>lobe</b> ratio, and splenic index were larger in patients with chronic schistosomiasis (P < 0. 001). At multiple regression analysis, splenic siderotic nodules, splenic index, and <b>caudate</b> lobe-right <b>lobe</b> ratio were predictive of schistosomiasis. Observer agreement was substantial or almost perfect for almost all variables analyzed (K or r = 0. 81 - 1. 00). CONCLUSION. the presence of peripheral periportall fibrosis,heterogeneity of hepatic parenchyma, and splenic siderotic nodules, and the splenic index and <b>caudate</b> lobe-right <b>lobe</b> ratio are useful features for differentiating alcoholic or virus-induced cirrhosis from chronic schistosomiasis using MRI.

40|$|Anatomic {{distortion}} and {{displacement of}} hilar structures due to liver lobe atrophy and hypertrophy occasionally complicates the surgical approach for biliary stricture repair. Benign biliary stricture following hepatic resection deserves special consideration {{in this regard}} because the inevitable hypertrophy of the residual liver causes marked rotation and displacement of the hepatic hilum that if not anticipated may render exposure for repair difficult and dangerous. Three patients with biliary stricture after hepatectomy illustrate the influence of hepatic regeneration on attempts at subsequent stricture repair. Following left hepatectomy, hypertrophy of the right and <b>caudate</b> <b>lobes</b> causes an anteromedial rotation and displacement of the portal structures. After right hepatectomy, the rotation is posterolateral, and a thoracoabdominal approach may be necessary for adequate exposure.

Using both immunohistochemical procedures, staining for epoxide hydrolase was detected within hepatocytes throughout the liver. However, differences were noted in the intensity of immunohistochemical staining of hepatocytes within the liver lobule. Microfluoro-metric determinations of the relative extents of binding of the anti-epoxide hydrolase to hepatocytes within the three regions of the liver lobule revealed that, although midzonal and periportal hepatocytes bound the antibody to similar extents, centrilobular hepato-cytes bound significantly more anti-epoxide hydrolase. Similar patterns of intralobular distribution for the anti-epoxide hydrolase were determined within livers of untreated male and female rats.

40|$|In {{selected}} {{patients with}} huge right hepatic tumors that had infiltrated the surrounding structures, injudicious mobilization {{of the liver}} before transection, as in the conventional manner, may result in excessive bleeding, prolonged ischemia from rotation of the hepatoduodenal ligament, and spillage of cancer cells into the systemic circulation. Alternatively, the 'anterior' approach, which involves initial completion of the parenchymal transection before the right hepatic lobe is mobilized, can be adopted for these patients with difficult right hepatic tumors. After hilar control of the inflow vessels, liver parenchyma was transected using an ultrasonic dissector until the anterior surface of the inferior vena cava is exposed. The right hepatic lobe is then mobilized laterally by securing all venous tributaries, including the right hepatic vein. The prospective data of 25 patients who had major right hepatectomy using the 'anterior' approach were compared with data from 34 patients who had their operation performed in the conventional manner. Despite the facts that larger tumors (p < 0. 004), more extrahepatic structures (p < 0. 05), and the <b>caudate</b> <b>lobes</b> (p < 0. 03) were resected, the amount of perioperative blood transfusion, fluid replacement, and outcome {{between the two groups}} of patients were comparable.

40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Ischemia/reperfusion causes organ damage {{but it is}} {{mandatory}} in hepatic transplantation, trauma and other complex liver surgeries, when Pringle maneuver is applied to minimize bleeding during these procedures. It {{is well known that}} liver ischemia/reperfusion leads to microcirculatory disturbance and cellular injury. In this setting hypothermia is known to reduce oxygen demand, lowering intracellular metabolism. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of hypothermia in liver ischemia/reperfusion injury, using a new model of topic isolated liver hypothermia. METHODS We used male Wistar rats weighting about 250 grams, kept in ad libitum feeding regime and randomly divided into two groups of nine animals: 1) Normothermic group, rats were submitted to normothermic ischemia of the median and left hepatic lobes, with subsequent resection of right and <b>caudate</b> <b>lobes</b> during liver reperfusion; and 2) Hypothermic group, rats were submitted to liver ischemia under hypothermia at 10 °C. Liver ischemia was performed for 45 minutes. The animals were euthanized 48 hours after liver reperfusion for blood and liver tissue sampling. RESULTS The transaminases analyses showed a significant decrease of AST and ALT in Hypothermic group (P< 0. 01) compared to Normothermic group (1403 ± 1234 x 454 ± 213 and 730 ± 680 x 271 ± 211 U/L, respectively). Histology showed severe necrosis in 50 % and mild necrosis in 50 % of cases in Normothermic group, but severe necrosis in 10 % and mild or absent necrosis 90 % of the cases in hypothermic group. CONCLUSION: A simplified model of liver ischemia/reperfusion that simulates orthotopic liver autotransplantion was demonstrated. Topical hypothermia of isolated hepatic lobules showed liver protection, being a viable and practical method for any kind of in vivo liver preservation study...|$|R
40|$|Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), {{inherent}} in liver transplantation (LT), {{is the main}} cause of initial deficiencies and primary non-function of liver allografts. Living-related LT was developed to alleviate the mortality resulting from the scarcity of suitable deceased grafts. The main problem in using living-related LT for adults is graft size disparity. In this study we propose {{for the first time that}} the use of a proteasome inhibitor (Bortezomib) treatment could improve liver regeneration and reduce IRI after Reduced-Size Orthotopic Liver transplantation (ROLT). Rat liver grafts were reduced by removing the left lateral lobe and the two <b>caudate</b> <b>lobes</b> and preserved in UW or IGL- 1 preservation solution for 1. h liver and then subjected to ROLT with or without Bortezomib treatment. Our results show that Bortezomib reduces IRI after LT and is correlated with a reduction in mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, Bortezomib also increased liver regeneration after reduced-size LT and increased the expression of well-known ischemia/reperfusion protective proteins such as nitric oxide synthase, heme oxigenase 1 (HO- 1) and Heat Shock Protein 70. Our results open new possibilities for the study of alternative therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing IRI and increasing liver regeneration after LT. It is hoped that the results of our study will contribute towards improving the understanding of the molecular processes involved in IRI and liver regeneration, and therefore help to improve the outcome of this type of LT in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background: Laterality {{disorders}} of {{the abdominal}} organs include situs inversus totalis that mirrors the arrangements of all internal organs and heterotaxy syndrome (situs ambiguus) {{in which the}} thoracic or abdominal organs are abnormally arranged. Heterotaxy is often accompanied by multiple congenital malformations, and it generally comprises asplenia and polysplenia syndromes. To our knowledge, polysplenia syndrome {{has been reported in}} only three cattle, and computerized tomographic (CT) images of these animals were not obtained. Case presentation: A six-month-old Holstein heifer had ruminal tympani and right abdominal distension. CT imaging showed that the rumen occupied {{the right side of the}} abdominal cavity, the omasum and abomasum occupied the left ventral side and the liver was positioned on the left. The colon and cecum were located at the left dorsum of the cavity, and the left kidney was located more cranially than the right. Postmortem findings revealed two spleens attached to the rumen. Significantly, the duodenum was too short to be divided into segments, except the cranial and descending parts, or flexures, except the cranial flexure, and the pancreas, which lacked a left lobe, was covered with mesojejunum. The liver comprised a relatively large right lobe and a small left lobe without quadrate and <b>caudate</b> <b>lobes.</b> The caudal vena cava that connected to the left azygous vein passed irregularly through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm, and the common hepatic vein without the caudal vena cava passed through the caval foramen. Although the lungs and heart were morphologically normal, the right atrium received three major systemic veins. Polysplenia syndrome was diagnosed based on the CT and postmortem findings. Conclusion: We defined the positions of the abdominal organs and morphological abnormalities in various organs of a calf with polysplenia syndrome based on CT and postmortem findings. These findings will improve understanding of the malpositioning and malformations that can occur in the organs of cattle with polysplenia syndrome. © 2017 The Author(s).
