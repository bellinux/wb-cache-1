50|$|After Los Angeles and {{the whole}} of {{southern}} California was secured, the <b>command</b> <b>issue</b> between Stockton and Kearny heated up once again. Stockton, {{who had been the}} initial military governor of California, later granted that post to his aide, Lieutenant-Colonel (later General) John C. Fremont. Kearny, based on his more recent orders from the War Department, asserted that post for himself but was initially ignored.|$|E
40|$|Means are the Ends: The <b>Command</b> <b>Issue</b> (2014) was an {{exhibition}} of sculptural works exhibited at LEVEL Artist-Run Initiative, Brisbane. The exhibition playfully critiqued the portrayal of women’s desire in cultural production and symbolic discourse through a focus on fetish sensibilities. Developed during a summer residency, the artworks looked to the rituals, materials and iconographies associated with certain divergent subcultures. Employing strategies of sculptural intervention and appropriation, the exhibition consisted of found objects, which had been deconstructed, altered and intervened; a dildo became a faux drawing machine, a butt-plug a makeshift horn. Reconstructing these visual codes through the formal and theoretical language of contemporary sculptural practice, Means are the Ends: The <b>Command</b> <b>Issue</b> spoke to the problematic, humorous and often paradoxical relationship between depictions of the feminine and women’s desire and agency...|$|E

40|$|Hosted at Blindside Artist-Run Initiative (Melbourne) the {{exhibition}} Towards (dis) Satisfaction (2015) was a re-staging of earlier sculptural works from {{the exhibition}}s Means are the Ends: The <b>Command</b> <b>Issue</b> and Crude Tools (2014), Feeble Actions (2013). The forms humorously interrogated representations of gender and sexuality via strategies of sculptural intervention. A stripper’s pole oozes grease from its stainless surface, fluted with holes. A dildo vibrates on a glass tabletop; propped up by simulated testicles, {{the intensity of the}} dildo’s vibrations makes the form spin. With its continual circling, the phallus drags Vaseline over the table, performing a drawing and redrawing of a smeared circle. In Towards (dis) Satisfaction fetish is used as an instrumental strategy, employed as a mode to work across different theoretical and material discourses. In the works the play between explicit and implicit depiction creates an ambiguity that has suggestive potency, where fragmentation and dysfunction initiate diverse readings. These material dialogues make apparent the anxiety and desire inherent in the viewer and question how the visual conventions of erotica and art history are mutually informative...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a probabilistic {{model of a}} pursuit-evasion game on Rn, in which neither pursuer nor evader positions are known with certainty. Both parties are represented by normal distributions that evolve according to a Kalman filter as new sensor readings (observation from overhead camera/satellite images) are obtained. The objective is to design the control <b>commands</b> <b>issued</b> by the pursuer (which is executed noisily). The control <b>commands</b> <b>issued</b> by the evader are unknown – only sensor measurements are given. Even with such limited knowledge we prove boundedness of a distance between the pursuer’s distribution and the evader’s true distribution (one {{that takes into account}} the evader’s control commands). Our simulation results support the claimed guarantees. I...|$|R
