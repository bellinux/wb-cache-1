As junction temperature increases, leakage current due to minority charge carriers (ICBO)(collector base current with emitter open) increases. As ICBO increases, ICEO(collector emitter current with base open) also increases, causing {{an increase in}} collector current IC. This produces heat at the <b>collector</b> <b>junction.</b> This process repeats, and, finally, the Q-point may shift into the saturation region. Sometimes, the excess heat produced at the junction may even burn the transistor. This is known as thermal runaway.|$|E
40|$|The {{base width}} of a Bipolar Junction Transistor in an {{integrated}} circuit is very small and recombination within the base can safely be neglected. In most of the works on Base Transit Time with reverse biased <b>collector</b> <b>junction</b> the expressions for transit time have been derived separately for high injection and low injection condition of operations. But in this work we have obtained a new analytical expression for Base Transit Time with reverse biased <b>collector</b> <b>junction</b> {{that can be applied}} for all levels of injections. The results obtained by using the new formulation are in good agreement with numerical results available in the literature. In the second part of this work, the Base Transit Time with <b>collector</b> <b>junction</b> forward biased is studied. When the <b>collector</b> <b>junction</b> is forward biased, the base is extended into the collector. Under this situation total transit time is the time taken by electron to traverse base and also the injection region of the collector. Recent works have shown that the collector minority carrier lifetime is finite. Therefore, recombination current in the collector minority carrier lifetime is finite. Therefore recombination current in the collector cannot be neglected. Considering drift and diffusion current and recombination, expressions for collector transit time with forward biased <b>collector</b> <b>junction</b> are obtained for quasi- and hard-saturation regions of operation. The results are compared with those obtained without recombination. The two results are deviated significantly from each other. The transit time is found strongly dependent upon collector minority carrier lifetime. When the effective surface recombination velocity is not infinite, the charge storage in collector is large and transit time increases with current...|$|E
50|$|Integrated {{injection}} logic (IIL, I2L, or I2L) is a {{class of}} digital circuits built with multiple <b>collector</b> bipolar <b>junction</b> transistors (BJT). When introduced it had speed comparable to TTL yet was almost as low power as CMOS, making it ideal for use in VLSI (and larger) integrated circuits. Although the logic voltage levels are very close (High: 0.7V, Low: 0.2V), I2L has high noise immunity because it operates by current instead of voltage. It is sometimes also known as merged transistor logic.|$|R
40|$|The {{market for}} {{solar thermal power}} plants {{especially}} in Spain {{becomes more and more}} interesting since primaries allow profitable operation of such plants. Besides the efficiency numbers for solar field and power block components the operational strategy offers potential for reducing the costs of electricity production. This paper concentrates on the start-up procedure for a solar field in order to identify an ap-propriate strategy and to estimate the duration of the process. As a reference plant a 5 MWel parabolic trough plant with direct steam generation is chosen. It consists of seven parallel loops with a length of 1000 m each. The transition from subcooled water to saturated wa-ter-steam and finally to superheated steam flow along the collector row makes the system complex and highly transient. The Modelica language was chosen for the simula-tion of the system since it offers enough flexibility to combine fluiddynamic components together with control systems in one simulation tool. The models for the parabolic trough collectors and other fluid system components are taken from a proven library at the institute. For the analysis of the start-up procedure the whole model was split into two layers. The plant layer represents the physical components like <b>collectors,</b> tanks, <b>junctions,</b> and pipes. The con-trol layer is responsible for the generation of all in-put-signals for the plant layer. The layers communi-cate via a bus system. Since the start-up procedure can be described as a sequence of system states the Modelica StateGraph library is used to model the different states of the system and the transitions be-tween them. Depending on the actual state, control-lers, switches, set-points and parameters can be de-fined. After a short introduction of the power plant system the paper presents the idea for the structure of the control system and the way the coupling between the two layers is implemented. Using one set of bound-ary conditions the results of several simulation runs are presented and discussed. It is shown that the de-sign of the process is of vital importance for its en-ergy consumption. Especially the pre-heating of the field with water stored in isolated tanks over night has positive effect on the duration of the start-up and therefore on the economics of the plant...|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) is {{a well-known}} contributor that reduces the reliability and yield of the integrated circuits (ICs). As ICs become more complex, they are increasingly susceptible to such failures due to the scaling of physical dimensions of devices and interconnect on a chip [1]. These failures are caused by excessive electric field and/or excessive current densities and result in the dielectric breakdown, electromigration of metal lines and contacts. ESD can affect the IC in its different life stages, from wafer fabrication process to failure in the field. Furthermore, ESD events can damage the integrated circuit permanently (hard failure), or cause a latent damage (soft failure) [2]. ESD protection circuits consisting of I/O protection and ESD power supply clamps are routinely used in ICs to protect them against ESD damage. The main objective of the ESD protection circuit {{is to provide a}} low-resistive discharge path between any two pins of the chip to harmlessly discharge ESD energy without damaging the sensitive circuits. The main target of this thesis is to design ESD power supply clamps that have the lowest possible leakage current without degrading the ESD protection ability in general purpose TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology. ESD clamps should have a very low-leakage current and should be stable and immune to the power supply noise under the normal operating conditions of the circuit core. Also, the ESD clamps must be able to handle high currents under an ESD event. All designs published in the general purpose 65 nm CMOS technology have used the SCR as the clamping element since the SCR has a higher current carrying capability compared to an MOS transistor of the same area [3]. The ESD power supply clamp should provide a low-resistive path in both directions to {{be able to deal with}} both PSD and NDS zapping modes. The SCR based design does not provide the best ESD protection for the NDS zapping mode (positive ESD stress at VSS with grounded VDD node) since it has two parasitic resistances (RNwell and RPsub) and one parasitic diode (the <b>collector</b> to base <b>junction</b> diode of the PNP transistor) in the path from the VSS to VDD. Furthermore, SCR-based designs are not suitable for application that exposed to hot switching or ionizing radiation [2]. In GP process, the gate oxide thickness of core transistors is reduced compared with LP process counterpart to achieve higher performance designs for high-frequency applications using 1 V core transistors and 2. 5 V I/O option. The thinner gate oxide layer results in higher leakage current due to gate tunneling [4]. Therefore, using large thin oxide MOS transistors as clamping elements will result in a huge leakage. In this thesis, four power supply ESD clamps are proposed in which thick oxide MOS transistors are used as the main clamping element. Therefore, the low-leakage current feature is achieved without significantly degrading the ESD performance. In addition, the parasitic diode of the MOS transistors provides the protection against NSD-mode. In this thesis, two different ESD power supply clamp architectures are proposed: standalone ESD power supply clamps and hybrid ESD power supply clamps. Two standalone clamps are proposed: a transient PMOS based ESD clamp with thyristor delay element (PTC), and a static diode triggered power supply (DTC). The standalone clamps were designed to protect the circuit core against ± 125 V CDM stress by limiting the voltage between the two power rails to less than the oxide breakdown voltage of the core transistors, BVOXESD = 5 V. The large area of this architecture was the price for maintaining the low-leakage current and an adequate ESD protection. The hybrid clamp architecture was proposed to provide a higher ESD protection, against ± 300 V CDM stress, while reducing the layout area and maintaining the low-leakage feature. In the hybrid clamp structure, two clamps are connected in parallel between the two power supply rails, a static clamp, and a transient clamp. The static clamp triggers first and starts to sink the ESD energy and then an RC network triggers the primary transient clamp to sink most of the ESD stress. Two hybrid designs were proposed: PMOS ESD power supply clamp with thyristor delay element and diodes (PTDC), and NMOS ESD power supply clamp with level shifter delay element and diode (NLDC). Simulation results show that the proposed clamps are capable of protecting the circuit core against ± 1. 5 kV HBM and at least against ± 125 V CDM stresses. The measurement results show that all of the proposed clamps are immune against false triggering, and transient induced latch-up. Furthermore, all four designs have responded favorably to the 4 V ESD-like pulse voltage under both chip powered and not powered conditions and after the stress ends the designs turned off. Finally, TLP measurement results show that all four proposed designs meet the minimum design requirement of the ESD protection circuit in the 65 nm CMOS technology (i. e. HBM protection level of ± 1. 5 kV) ...|$|R

Receiving the optical signal in such systems is carried by photoreceiving modules {{based on a}} photodetector, which defines {{the quality of the}} received signal, the range and speed of the entire system. However, hitherto used p–i–n- and avalanche photodiodes do not fully meet the growing demands. The present work is devoted to investigate the photovoltaic characteristics of semiconductor thin base transistor structure based on germanium, which is superior the silicon counterparts by speed and gain. Investigated p+–n–p-structures were obtained by diffusion of antimony onto the substrate of p-type germanium to a depth of 1 micron and alloying of indium to the part of its surface which creates diffusion layer of ?+-type and with thickness of 0, 5 microns. Experiments have shown that the reverse biasing of a single p+-n-emitter-base junction leads to a smooth increase in reverse current, at the same time when it is connected in series to forward biased collector p-n-junction there is a sharp increase in the current by voltage, giving properties of voltage surge suppressor.

The ratio of n- to p-region {{conductivity}} is taken to be very high, so that the transition region is restricted almost entirely to the p-region. The electron density distribution n within the transition region is investigated {{as a function of}} the applied reverse bias V_c, and of the minority carrier electron current density J which is injected into the transition region from the neutral p- region. It is shown that significant departures occur from the conventional solutions in which the presence of current is neglected. In particular, the electron density n_c at the plane of injection and the transition region thickness w_t, used as collector boundary conditions in the analysis of transistor operation, are shown to be current-dependent. Two cases are considered. In Case I, applicable to transistors with an epitaxial layer under the collector, the electron velocity is assumed much less than the limiting drift velocity. For low injection level, where the minority carrier density n is everywhere less than the equilibrium majority carrier density p_p, the transition region is a essentially a depletion region and the injected electrons move in an electric field determined uniquely by the applied voltage. It is shown that n_ ∝ J and w_t ∝ V_c^(l/ 2). For high injection level, hen n >> p_p, the transition region is essentially an accumulation region, and conditions of space-charge-limited current flow are established for which n_c ∝ J^(2 / 3) and w_t ∝ V_c^(2 / 3 /(J^(l-/ 3)). In Case II, applicable to most alloy and diffused-base transistors, the electron velocity is assumed equal to the limiting drift velocity throughout the transition region.
