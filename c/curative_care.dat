40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the consequences of the different remuneration schemes in terms of incentives for the physician to realize some secondary prevention. Indeed, the provision of prevention depends on the trade-off of the physician between time granted to curative practice and time granted to preventive practice. According to the intuition, the capitation system to remunerate the <b>curative</b> <b>cares</b> gives to the physician more incentives to provide prevention as she takes into account the long-term effects of prevention. We also use our model to evaluate the impact of different processes aiming to reduce the loss of information between physicians (electronic medical records). Classification JEL : I 18...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how, {{in temporary}} economic hardship, agents change their consumption of health services, {{and how this}} depends on whether the service is universally free-of-charge visits to GP's or privately co-financed dental care. We find that own expenditures for dental care decrease. The decrease is mainly seen in preventive treatment, a durable good, but for the lowest income quartile {{there is also a}} substantial decrease in expenditures for <b>curative</b> dental <b>care,</b> although this is a consumption good with very low intertemporal substitution. The expenditures for GPs are unaltered. The findings indicate that consumption of health services critically depends on the existence of user charges versus universal coverage. The welfare loss associated with postponement of preventive care is considerably lower than the welfare loss related to a decrease in the use of <b>curative</b> dental <b>care</b> induced by economic hardship. The policy implication could be public support for means-tested curative dental services...|$|R

Materials and Methods: This study was carried out retrospectively for one year from July/Aug 2010...|$|R
40|$|Background: The major {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the existing primary health care service provisions in the public and private sector and utilization of the services, and to assess the existing manpower and material resources. Methods: Data were collected through interviews with the primary health care providers. Data were also collected from the records maintained at the polyclinics and the Ministry of Health Statistics. An analysis and discussion of all the available data was conducted to develop a comprehensive primary health care service utilization and resources inventory at the polyclinics. Similar data were collected from the primary care providers in the private sector. Results: In the public sector, there are 8 polyclinics that provide primary health care to the children. All the polyclinics have immunization services and <b>curative</b> acute <b>care.</b> Some of the polyclinics have a range of services, including dental care, eye care, and rehabilitative care services that common to both adults and children. In the private sector, primary health care is delivered through the 76 private office and of the individual physicians and 11 grouped private practices. All of the private offices and group practices have <b>curative</b> acute <b>care</b> for children and some of the offices have immunization services. Over all 87. 5 % of all the immunizations were done at the polyclinics. Over all 60. 1 % of acute care visits were to the private sector and 39. 9 % to the public sector. In the public sector, 59. 5 % were under 5 years children while 40. 5 % were 5 years or older. The corresponding figures in the private care settings were 80. 9 % and 11. 9 %. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate the complimentary role of the public and the private sector in the primary health care of children in this country. While the private sector has {{a major role in the}} <b>curative</b> acute <b>care</b> of children, the public sector plays a pivotal role in the immunization services...|$|R
