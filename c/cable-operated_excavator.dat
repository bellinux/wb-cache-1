50|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the {{locomotive}} plant in Nordhausen went idle. Under the German Democratic Republic, O&K changed its name to the VEB Company, and resumed heavy mechanical manufacturing at Nordhausen, producing <b>cable-operated</b> <b>excavator</b> shovels, among other things.|$|E
50|$|At the Spandau factory, O&K built <b>cable-operated</b> <b>{{excavators}}</b> and bucket-wheel excavators {{for use in}} the lignite {{coal mines}} of eastern Germany. Under the Aryanisation scheme of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, the Orenstein family's shares in the company were forcibly sold in 1935; Orenstein and Koppel was placed under trust administration, and the Babelsberger works were taken over and renamed in 1941. O&K existed in name only, but more commonly used the abbreviation MBA (Maschienenbau und Bahnbedarf AG).|$|R
5000|$|Excavators (Hydraulic Excavators) {{are heavy}} {{construction}} equipment {{consisting of a}} boom, dipper (or stick), bucket and cab on a rotating platform known as the [...] "house". The house sits atop an undercarriage with tracks or wheels. They are a natural progression from the steam shovels and often mistakenly called power shovels. All movement and functions of a hydraulic excavator are accomplished {{through the use of}} hydraulic fluid, with hydraulic cylinders and hydraulic motors. [...] Due to the linear actuation of hydraulic cylinders, their mode of operation is fundamentally different from <b>cable-operated</b> <b>excavators</b> which use winches and steel ropes to accomplish the movements.|$|R
