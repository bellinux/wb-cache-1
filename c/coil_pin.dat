40|$|Summary: Percutaneous {{intraspinal}} navigation (PIN) {{is a new}} {{minimally invasive}} approach to the subarachnoid space. Using conventional radiographic fluoroscopy, en-trance is gained to the lumbar subarachnoid space, allow-ing navigation throughout the spinal canal. Using an antenna/guidewire introduced via PIN, we performed en-dospinal MR imaging of the thoracic spinal cord in a cadaver and canine subject. Comparison images were ob-tained with an optimal surface <b>coil.</b> <b>PIN</b> allows endospinal MR imaging of the spinal cord, providing significant sig-nal-to-noise ratio gains over conventional imaging. Percutaneous intraspinal navigation (PIN) has been recently described as a minimally invasive ap-proach to the subarachnoid compartment of the spine and brain (1). MR fluoroscopy {{has been used to}} guid...|$|E
50|$|When <b>coiled</b> spring <b>pins</b> are installed, the {{compression}} {{starts at the}} outer edge and moves through the coils toward the center. <b>Coiled</b> <b>pins</b> continue to flex after insertion when a load {{is applied to the}} pin thus providing excellent performance to counter fatigue in dynamic applications. <b>Coiled</b> spring <b>pins</b> were invented by Herman Koehl circa 1948.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coiled</b> <b>pins</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in cosmetic cases, automotive door handles and locks, and latches as hinge pins. They {{are also used}} as pivots and axles, for alignment and stopping, to fasten multiple components together—such as a gear and shaft—and even as ejector pins to remove motherboards from PCs. The automotive and electrical industries use <b>coiled</b> <b>pins</b> in such products as steering boxes and columns, pumps, electric motors and circuit breakers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coiled</b> <b>pins</b> are commercially {{available}} {{in three different}} duties, standard (ISO 8750), heavy (ISO 8748) and light duty (ISO 8751), which provide {{for a variety of}} combinations of strength, flexibility and diameter to suit different mating host materials and performance requirements. Typical materials for <b>coiled</b> spring <b>pins</b> include high carbon steel, stainless steel and alloy 6150.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of spring pins: slotted spring <b>pins</b> and <b>coiled</b> spring <b>pins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Heavy duty <b>coiled</b> spring <b>pins</b> are {{typically}} used in high shear strength applications and hardened host materials.|$|R

50|$|A <b>coiled</b> spring <b>pin,</b> {{also known}} as a spiral pin, is a self {{retaining}} engineered fastener manufactured by roll forming metal strip into a spiral cross section of 2 1/4 <b>coils.</b> <b>Coiled</b> spring <b>pins</b> have a body diameter larger than the recommended hole diameter and chamfers on both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole, the spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole.|$|R

50|$|In {{engineering}} and machine design, a pin is a machine element that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. A large variety of types has been known for a long time; the most commonly used are solid cylindrical pins, solid tapered pins, groove pins, slotted spring <b>pins</b> and spirally <b>coiled</b> spring <b>pins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the {{compressive}} wave, {{however, the}} torsional waves are considerably {{more resistant to}} problems caused by mechanical imperfections, {{so much so that}} the wires could be wound into a loose <b>coil</b> and <b>pinned</b> to a board. Due to their ability to be coiled, the wire-based systems could be built as [...] "long" [...] as needed, and tended to hold considerably more data per unit; 1k units were typical on a board only 1 foot square. Of course this also meant that the time needed to find a particular bit was somewhat longer as it traveled through the wire, and access times on the order of 500 microseconds were typical.|$|R
60|$|My {{method was}} deliberate, and simple, and drastic. In the first place, I {{resolved}} {{to do my}} work, {{no matter how hard}} or dangerous it might be, so well that no man would be called upon to do it for me. Further, I put ginger in my muscles. I never malingered when pulling on a rope, for I knew the eagle eyes of my forecastle mates were squinting for just such evidences of my inferiority. I {{made it a point to}} be among the first of the watch going on deck, among the last going below, never leaving a sheet or tackle for some one else to <b>coil</b> over a <b>pin.</b> I was always eager for the run aloft for the shifting of topsail sheets and tacks, or for the setting or taking in of topsails; and in these matters I did more than my share.|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{amount of}} traffic combined with higher traffic loads leads to many existing bridges needing strengthening {{in the future}} to ensure their expected lifespan. This means the bridge owners will be focusing more on strengthening projects and smart solutions will be crucial for preserving a healthy bridge stock. When strengthening existing non-composite bridges (with steel girder and concrete deck) one potential method is to achieve composite action by installing shear connectors. The post-installed shear connectors prevent slip between the steel girders and the concrete. The composite action will reduce bending stresses and deflection of the bridge, due to the increase in moment of inertia and relocation of the neutral axis. Different types of shear connectors can be used for achieving composite action and each type of connector has its own installation method. The biggest distinction between the methods is how the connectors gain access to the steel girder for installation and what technique is used when installing them. This thesis presents the theory behind composite action, the current methods used for achieving composite action on existing bridges and to what extent a bridge can be strengthened by composite action. The thesis also provides a status of the existing road bridge stock around the world. The four case studies examined in this thesis have used different post-installed shear connectors to manage different strengthening problems like weight restriction, fatigue life of shear connectors and a unique problem on the Pitsund Bridge where loud bangs appeared from the bridge when truck passed in the morning. For the case study on the Pitsund Bridge an interview was conducted that explains the entire procedure of the project, from the noise problem to how the installation of <b>coiled</b> spring <b>pins</b> was performed. The bridge over Lule River at Akkatsfallen consists of two steel girders and a concrete deck. This bridge is chosen as a real case study to determine to what extent a bridge can increase its capacity by achieving composite action. The calculations are performed in accordance with the Eurocodes on both non- and full-composite action and the result is compared to the other case studies...|$|R
