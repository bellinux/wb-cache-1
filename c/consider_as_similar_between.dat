40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we carry out}} an {{investigation}} {{into some of the}} major features of exam timetabling problems with a view to developing a similarity measure. This similarity measure will be used within a casebased reasoning (CBR) system to match a new problem with one from a case-base of previously solved problems. The case base will also store the heuristic or meta-heuristic technique(s) applied most successfully to each problem stored. The technique(s) stored with the matched case will be retrieved and applied to the new case. The motivation behind our similarity measure is that similar problems should be solved equally well by the same technique. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss which features and combinations of features of exam timetabling problems are potentially important for measuring such similarity. These will be the features whose values must be <b>similar</b> <b>between</b> two problems for the whole problems to be <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar...</b>|$|R

40|$|Hash-based {{similarity}} search reduces {{a continuous}} similarity {{relation to the}} binary concept “similar or not similar”: two feature vectors are <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> if they are mapped on the same hash key.

Similarity hashing is applied with great success for near similarity search in large document collections, and it is <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> a key technology for near-duplicate detection and plagiarism analysis. This papers reveals the design principles behind hash-based search methods and presents them in a unified way. We introduce new stress statistics that are suited to analyze the performance of hash-based search methods, and we explain the rationale of their effectiveness. Based on these insights, we show how optimum hash functions for similarity search can be derived. We also present new results of a comparative study between different hash-based search methods...|$|R

When we use the software to do design work, such filler wall is <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> load on the beam, shown with Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Since the load is non uniform, the work will be heavy if we input the load as the matter of fact.

40|$|Classification {{has been}} {{considered}} a fundamental step towards improved catchment hydrology science. This paper proposes a catchment classification scheme where the classification procedure is based on similarity interpreted as distances between catchments. If many sets of model parameters lead to similar model performance for two catchments, they are <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> catchments. Two procedures, namely multidimensional scaling (MDS) and local variance reduction (LVR), are undertaken to construct a configuration of n catchments’ characteristics in a Euclidean space using information about <b>similar</b> performance <b>between</b> the catchments. MDS is {{used to determine the}} appropriate dimension of the Euclidean space and LVR is used to obtain the transformation matrix and the coordinates in the transformed Euclidean space. This scheme avoids the idea of parametric regression-based regionalization approaches where a regression function is pre-defined between model parameters and catchment characteristics. The proposed scheme is tested with a research version of the HBV-IWS model on a total number of 27 catchments selected from the Rhine River Basin. The scheme can be extended to regional calibration of rainfall runoff models as well as regional drought or flood studies once similarity within catchments has been established...|$|R

30|$|Importance {{of a given}} node is, in fact, the {{accumulative}} {{importance of}} the incoming node edges to it. For example, the importance of edge ‘e’ {{is dependent on the}} number on outgoing edges from node ‘v’. The number of nodes plays an important role on a bidirectional algorithm as it is a ‘node base’, meaning that the bigger the number of nodes get, the more the time complexity increases. One method used in this study was to reduce number of nodes used by applying a similarity algorithm, which finds similar nodes and combines them together as a single node. There is a threshold choosing the nodes to be <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> nodes. If the number of nodes in the graph between node I and node E are reduced, then the number of iterations needed to reach the target E also will reduce. On the other hand, the number of random walks needed to reach to the front set will decrease as well.|$|R

40|$|Magnetotactic {{bacteria}} possess organelles called magnetosomes that confer {{a magnetic}} {{moment on the}} cells, resulting in their partial alignment with external magnetic fields. Here we show that analysis of the trajectories of cells exposed to an external magnetic field {{can be used to}} measure the average magnetic dipole moment of a cell population in at least five different ways. We apply this analysis to movies of Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB- 1 cells, and compare the values of the magnetic moment obtained in this way to that obtained by direct measurements of magnetosome dimension from electron micrographs. We find that methods relying on the viscous relaxation of the cell orientation give results comparable to that obtained by magnetosome measurements, whereas methods relying on statistical mechanics assumptions give systematically lower values of the magnetic moment. Since the observed distribution of magnetic moments in the population is not sufficient to explain this discrepancy, our results suggest that non-thermal random noise is present in the system, implying that a magnetotactic bacterial population should not be <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> <b>similar</b> to a paramagnetic material...|$|R
