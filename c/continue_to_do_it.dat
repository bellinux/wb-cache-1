[...] Coach Kiffin added, [...] "We'll see if he can <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. Great quarterbacks put together good games every week."

6000|$|... "Yes, unable--that is {{the precise}} word. Take Pennsylvania, for instance; {{that is one}} of the richest {{communities}} in the civilized world; its coal and iron alone would make any country affluent, and a portion of its agricultural population is one of the most affluent I know of. Nevertheless, Pennsylvania, owing to a concurrence of events, could not pay the interest on her debt for two years and a half, though she is doing it now, and will doubtless <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> The sudden breaking down of that colossal moneyed institution, the soi-disant Bank of the United States, after it ceased to be in reality a bank of the government, brought about such a state of the circulation as rendered payment, by any of the ordinary means known to government, impossible. I know what I say, and repeat impossible. It is well known that many persons, accustomed to affluence, had to carry their plate to the mint, in order to obtain money to go to market. Then something may be attributed to the institutions, without disparaging a people's honesty. Our institutions are popular, just as those of France are the reverse; and the people, they who were on the spot--the home creditor, with his account unpaid, and with his friends and relatives in the legislature, and present to aid him, contended for his own money, before any should be sent abroad." ...|$|E
60|$|Fancy your {{imagining that}} you had come into my life in order to darken it. Why, you ARE my life. If you went out of it, what would be left?

I did it to please mother, but there really seemed no very clear reason why I should <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Then you came, and everything was changed. I read because you are fond of reading and because I {{wanted to talk about}} books with you. I played because you are fond of music. I sang in the hope that it might please you. Whatever I did, you were always in my mind. I tried and tried to become a better and nobler woman, because I wanted to be worthy of the love you bore me. I have changed, and developed, and improved more {{in the last three months}} than in all my life before. And then you come and tell me that you have darkened my life. You know better now. My life has become full and rich, for Love fills my life. It is the keynote of my nature, the foundation, the motive power. It inspires me to make the most of any gift or talent that I have. How could I tell you all this if I did not know that your own feeling was as deep. I could not have given the one, great, and only love of my life in exchange for a half-hearted affection from you. But you will never again make the mistake of supposing that any material consideration can affect our love.|$|E

50|$|Whether teasing is playful or hurtful or educative {{is largely}} {{subject to the}} {{interpretation}} of the person being teased. If the person being teased feels harmed, then the teasing is hurtful. A difference in power between people may also make the behavior hurtful rather than playful. Ultimately though, if someone perceives him or herself as the victim of teasing, and experiences the teasing as unpleasant, then it is considered hurtful. If parents' intentions are positive, as in many Indigenous American Communities, then teasing to the community can be seen as an educational tool. The child may or may not understand that in the moment. If the other person <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> after being asked to stop then it is a form of bullying or abuse.|$|R
