500|$|The House of Lords, {{as well as}} its robing and {{committee}} rooms, {{were all}} destroyed, as was the Painted Chamber, and the <b>connecting</b> <b>end</b> of the Royal Gallery. The House of Commons, along with its library and committee rooms, the official residence of the Clerk of the House and the Speaker's House, were devastated. Other buildings, such as the Law Courts, were badly damaged. The buildings within the complex which emerged relatively unscathed included Westminster Hall, the cloisters and undercroft of St Stephen's, St Mary Undercroft Chapel, the Jewel Tower and Soane's new buildings to the south. The British standard measurements, the yard and pound, were both lost in the blaze; the measurements had been created in 1496. Also lost were most of the procedural records for the House of Commons, which dated back as far as the late 15th century. The original Acts of Parliament from 1497 survived, as did the Lords' Journals, all of which were stored in the Jewel Tower {{at the time of the}} fire. In the words of Shenton, the fire was [...] "the most momentous blaze in London between the Great Fire of 1666 and the Blitz" [...] of the Second World War. Despite the size and ferocity of the fire, there were no deaths, although there were nine casualties during the night's events that were serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|E

Information-centric Networking (ICN) focuses on finding and transmitting information to end-users, instead of <b>connecting</b> <b>end</b> hosts that exchange data. The key concepts of ICN are expected to have significant impact on the FI, and to create new challenges for all associated stakeholders. In order to investigate the motives as well as the arising conflicts between the stakeholders, we apply a tussle analysis methodology in a content delivery scenario incorporating socioeconomic principles. Our analysis highlights the interests of the various stakeholders and the issues that should be taken into account by designers when deploying new content delivery schemes under the ICN paradigm...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} find the {{shortest}} angular path between any two points, it is only necessary to search the set of border end points and the lines connecting mutually visible end points (calling them E-lines hereafter) (Fig. 4 b). For this purpose, Viraph creates a graph representing all E-lines (except for the lines <b>connecting</b> <b>end</b> points of the same border). Each E-line is recorded as two vectors of opposite directions (thus the graph has 2 n vertices, with n {{as the number of}} E-lines). Then, two databases are made: Table α that is a k[*]×[*] 2 n table (k is the number of grid cells) containing the supplementary angle made by any E[*]−[*]line vector and any grid cell[*],[*]and Table β[*],[*]a  2 n[*]×[*] 2 n table which contains the angular depth between all the E-line vectors. For Table β, the angles between the adjacent continuing vectors are calculated directly without pathfinding.|$|E

40|$|Data center {{networks}} leverage multiple parallel paths <b>connecting</b> <b>end</b> host pairs {{to offer}} high bisection bandwidth for cluster computing applications. However, {{state of the}} art distributed multi-pathing protocols such as Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) use static flow-to-link assignment, which is load-oblivious. They may cause bandwidth loss due to flow collisions on a same link. Recently proposed centralized scheduling algorithm or host-based multi-pathing may suffer from scalability problems. In this paper, we present Distributed Flow Scheduling (DiFS) for data center networks, which is a switch-only distributed solution. DiFS allows switches cooperate to avoid over-utilized links and find available paths without centralized control. DiFS is scalable and can react quickly to dynamic traffic, because it is independently executed on switches and requires no synchronization. Extensive experiments show that the aggregate bisection bandwidth of DiFS using various traffic patterns is much better than that of ECMP, and is similar to or higher than that of a recent proposed centralized scheduling algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Our main {{objective}} was to use videoconferencing as a primary means to: a) assist in launching an epilepsy surgery program in Pakistan, 2) participate in case conferences on complex epilepsy Patients in each country. Methods: Extensive testing using both point to point and bridged integrated service digital network (ISDN) and internet protocol (IP) connections was carried out using bandwidths of 384 - 768 kilobits per second (kbps). Videoconferences between sites were arranged {{two to three weeks}} in advance and connections were tested a day prior to the scheduled conference. Sharing of PowerPoint presentations, neuroimaging and video-EEG was available to all sites. Discussions centered on Patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Results: Between July 2006 and June 2008, 17 sessions were booked. Five of these conferences bridged in specialists from West Virginia University. Most successful connections occurred using IP point to point calls or a bridge <b>connecting</b> <b>end</b> points through IP at 512 kbps. We conducted three surgeries for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy in Pakistan. At follow-up in January 2009, two Patients have been seizure free and one had two breakthrough seizures after sudden unsupervised discontinuation of Levetiracetam. Conclusion: Our international tele-epilepsy collaboration has proven feasible and valuable to all participants. Our experience suggests considerable thought and preparation are needed before a teleconference to ensure its success. We provide a recipe to set-up similar telemedicine collaborations. Considerations include time zone differences, equipment type, interoperability between endpoints, connection capabilities, bandwidth availability, and backup plans for unsuccessful connections.

40|$|Computer network {{used for}} {{laboratory}} training and for {{different types of}} network and security experiments represents a special environment where hazardous activities take place, which may not affect any production system or network. It is common that students need to have administrator privileges in this case which makes the overall security and maintenance of such a network a difficult task. We present our solution which has proved its usability {{for more than three}} years. First of all, four user requirements on the laboratory network are defined (access to educational network devices, to laboratory services, to the Internet, and administrator privileges of the end hosts), and four essential security rules are stipulated (enforceable end host security, controlled network access, level of network access according to the user privilege level, and rules for hazardous experiments), which protect the rest of the laboratory infrastructure as well as the outer university network and the Internet. The main part of the paper is dedicated to a design and implementation of these usability and security rules. We present a physical diagram of a typical laboratory network based on multiple circuits <b>connecting</b> <b>end</b> hosts to different networks, and a layout of rack devices. After that, a topological diagram of the network is described which is based on different VLANs and port-based access control using the IEEE 802. 1 x/EAP-TLS/RADIUS authentication to achieve defined level of network access. In {{the second part of the}} paper, the latest innovation of our network is presented that covers a transition to the system virtualization at the end host devices – inspiration came from a similar solution deployed at the Department of Telecommunications at Brno University of Technology. This improvement enables a greater flexibility in the end hosts maintenance and a simultaneous network access to the educational devices as well as to the Internet. In the end, a vision of a system of virtual machines preparation and automated deployment tailored for our needs is briefly outlined...|$|E
40|$|Multicast is an {{important}} communication paradigm, upon which many distribution applications are built, such as video-on-demand, live broadcasting, teleconferencing, large-volume content dissemination, etc. The efforts to support multicast at IP layer, however, {{have proved to be}} slow and painful, due to factors such as ISP's lack of incentives, shortage of address space, difficulty to support reliable transmission and congestion control, and others. Recently proposed overlay multicast appears to be a more practical solution to address above problems. In this approach, end hosts, instead of routers, organize themselves into a logical overlay network and relay data to each other via unicast transport services. The fundamental difference between these two approaches, is that in IP multicast, the data forwarding/replication task is performed by the routers, while in overlay multicast, the same task is performed by participating end hosts of the overlay network. Although seemingly it just elevates the multicast functionality into application layer, overlay network actually revolutionizes the way network applications can be built. In IP network, except for nodes at the edge, the network is composed of routers, whose task is no more than forwarding packets. In contrast, each node in overlay network is an intelligent one that can collaborate and contribute various resources (CPU, storage, access bandwidth, etc.). Our argument is validated by our study on supporting multimedia content distribution, a classical multicast-based application, via overlay-based solution. We identify two key challenges of this application: on-demand user requests, where different users may request to view the same multimedia content at different times, and high throughput requirement}, where the multicast solution is demanded to maintain data distribution structure with high throughput to each user. Regarding the on-demand challenge, how to design overlay-based on-demand media distribution solution by utilizing the flexibilities offered by overlay network (each host contributing its own resources) ? Furthermore, how do we quantify the performance tradeoff between the new overlay-based solution to the traditional IP-multicast-based solutions? Regarding the high throughput challenge, a theoretical framework needs to be established to model overlay multicast, which gives answers to the following questions. What is the theoretical upper bound to maximize throughput of an overlay multicast session, and what is the optimal solution (construction of multicast trees) to achieve so? When multiple sessions exist, can fairness be achieved? Given answers to these questions, can we use this model to analytically and quantitatively evaluate existing overlay multicast solutions and offer theoretical guidance to the design of new ones? Given the fact that both challenges need to be addressed in practice, how to design practical overlay-based content distribution solution, which combines previously developed techniques to each individual challenge? How to analyze the performance bound of our solution, given the insights obtained when studying previous problems? In this thesis, we report our solutions to the aforementioned challenges. Our work is built on the overlay graph model. An overlay graph is a virtual network <b>connecting</b> <b>end</b> hosts of an overlay multicast session. In the graph, an edge bridging two end hosts corresponds to their unicast route in the physical network. Our objective is to find optimal data distribution path, i. e., optimal spanning tree(s) (minimum cost, maximum throughput, etc.), on the given overlay graph. Our application is on-demand multimedia distribution. The contributions of this thesis are as follows. We propose an overlay-based on-demand media distribution solution. Through extensive analytical and experimental analysis, we exhibit the great potential of overlay-based solution at saving server load and network bandwidth consumption compared to the ideal IP-multicast-based solutions. Using multicommodity flow theory, we establish the theoretical foundation for multi-tree overlay multicast. We note that such a foundation works for all kinds of distribution applications such as large-volume file downloading, teleconferencing, etc. Based on this foundation, we propose a series of algorithms, which are able to derive the optimal solutions to achieve (1) maximum throughput for a given multicast session, (2) maximum throughput for multiple sessions, while maintaining weighted max-min fairness among them. Combining the techniques developed to individually address the on-demand and high throughput challenges, we propose an overlay-based dynamic high-bandwidth content distribution solution. Theoretically, we prove the approximation bound of our solution regarding the optimal throughput. Experimentally, we show our solution to greatly outperform the theoretical bound, and give consistent performance to various node dynamics and network topologies...|$|E
