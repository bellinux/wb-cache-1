40|$|Nine cultivars of corn stover {{selected}} for ethanol potential were harvested (34 to 40 % dry matter) and each ensiled with six treatments: untreated, lactic acid bacteria, cell-wall degrading enzymes, sulfuric acid, bacteria-enzyme combination and enzyme-acid combination. Ensiling was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in vacuum-sealed <b>bags</b> at ~ 22 °C for 60 d. The untreated stovers ensiled well. Lactic acid bacteria and enzyme treatments {{had no effect}} on pH, but the bacteria-enzyme combination lowered pH in some cultivars. The acid and acid-enzyme treatments had low pH values ranging from 1. 3 to 1. 5. Lactic acid was generally highest in the bacteria-enzyme treatment whereas acetic acid was highest for the acid treatments. The acid treatments substantially reduced hemicellulose. Potential ethanol yield on average was highest in the bacteria-enzyme treatments...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of regional cooling for reducing brain temperature (BrTe) and intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients where conventional clinical treatment has failed. METHOD: Regional cooling was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> using ice <b>bags</b> covering the area of the craniectomy (regional method) in 23 patients. The BrTe and ICP were determined using a fiber optic sensor. Thirteen patients (56. 52 %) were female. The ages ranged from 16 to 83 years (mean of 48. 9). The mean APACHE II score was 25 points (11 - 35). The patients were submitted, on mean, to 61. 7 hours (20 - 96) of regional cooling. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in mean BrTe (p< 0. 0001 -from 37. 1 ºC to 35. 2 ºC) and mean ICP (p= 0. 0001 -from 28 mmHg to 13 mmHg). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that mild brain hypothermia induced by regional cooling was effective in the control of ICP in patients who had previously undergone decompressive craniectomy...|$|R

Everything I looked at had but one meaning--that she was not there. I did not dare to admit into my heart a hope of the future, since it would be treason to the absent. There was an ecstatic mournfulness even {{in the sight of}} the January sun, the greening fields, the first scarcely perceptible signals of a new year. And when one morning I awoke early and heard, still half in dream, a thrush in all but darkness singing of spring, it seemed it was a voice pealing in the empty courts of paradise.

40|$|The {{filtration}} efficiency of free-standing dust extractors fitted with filter bags {{of various types}} and challenged with wood dust of various grades has been measured. During each test, the air pressure inside the filter bag, the extractor air flow rate and the concentration of dust penetrating the filter bag were monitored. Needlefelt filter bags allowed a limited quantity of dust, usually at a concentration well below the maximum exposure limit (MEL) of 5 mgm ~ 3, to penetrate when they were clean and improved greatly as they became loaded with dust. Filter bags made from woven cotton let more dust through. Needlefelt bags with specially coated fibres were no more efficient than standard bags but those with a microporous membrane coating were highly efficient. However, an increase in {{filtration efficiency}} during loading was invariably accompanied {{by an increase in}} air pressure inside the filter bag and a drop in extractor air flow, all effects being more marked when fine dust was used. Some of the extractors leaked dust from around loosely fitting filter bags and dust collector bags, or through holes in the fan housing, indicating that not all aspects of design are ideal. Tests <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> on <b>bags</b> that had been used for long periods indicated that air entering the filter bag gives rise to an initial high external dust concentration, though this did not usually persist. Periodic cleaning of the bag is recommended. Vacuum cleaning the inside when the bag is removed from the cleaner almost restores its original condition, but results in the generation of large quantities of airborne dust. The use of a tool that fits inside the bag enables cleaning to be <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> effectively in situ without exposing the operator to significant con...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of pre-treatments on overcoming dormancy of A. coriacea seeds. Seeds were processed and stored in polyethylene bags at temperatures of at - 18 &# 176;C (42 % RH), 5 &# 176;C (34 % RH), 15 &# 176;C (60 % RH) and 25 &# 176;C (34 % RH), during 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days. After storage, seeds were immersed in 350 mg. L&# 8722; 1 gibberellic acid for 144 hours. Sowing was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in plastic <b>bags</b> containing Red Latosol + Bioplant&# 174;. Moisture content, emergence percentage, emergence speed index, length and dry mass of seedlings, were evaluated. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial with four replications of 50 seeds each. The seed storage at 5 &# 176;C and subsequent immersion in gibberellic acid was efficient to reach high percentage, emergence speed and plant growth. A. coriacea seeds showed non-deep simple morphophysiological dormancy wherein the physiological component can be overcome after the seeds are storage at 5 &# 176;C for a maximum period of 53 days and subsequent immersed in exogenous GA (350 mg.

40|$|Men <b>carrying</b> body <b>bag</b> <b>out</b> of the ruins. At {{approximately}} 9 : 12 a. m. on {{the morning}} of April, 16, 1947 the Grandcamp cargo ship exploded triggering one of the worst industrial disasters in American history. The explosion was caused by a fire in the hold containing ammonium nitrate fertilizer. The fire was discovered just before 8 : 00 a. m. The captain chose not to use water to put out the fire because it would ruin the cargo. Instead, he elected to fight the fire by battening down the hatches, closing the ventilators, and turing on the steam system. According to the Red Cross and Texas Department of Public Safety, there were 405 identified and 63 unidentified dead. Another 100 were classified as "believed missing" because no trace of their remains were ever found. Another approximately 3, 500 people were injured. The damage was estimated at $ 100 million in 1947 dollars excluding loss of petroleum products that burned up and damaged refinery infastructure and pipelines.

40|$|The {{film blowing}} {{plays a major}} role in {{manufacturing}} poly bag products that are indispensable in day-to-day life. Film blowing is largely deployed to manufacture poly bags in a continuous flow. As material prices skyrocket to new heights and forecasters see no end to this trend, any positive contribution in the poly bag manufacturing value chain has a great impact on reducing the manufacturing costs. High density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and polypropylene (PP) are basically used as raw materials for the poly bag manufacturing and subsequently undergo some other processes such as cutting, sealing, printing, quality checking, and packing. Due to the variations of parameters in poly bag manufacturing process with different products, a considerable setting time as conceded and substantial amount of raw material is wasted. Material wastage is high as 10 % to 12 % in figures. Rather high lead-time, improper line balancing, and improper inventory control mimic serious bottlenecks in the system from performance point of view. With the purpose of identifying the productivity and the efficiency problems of the poly bag manufacturing system, as a preliminary study to simulation, risk analysis, bottle neck analysis, and SWOT analysis were <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in poly <b>bag</b> manufacturing system. Then the possible risk of the selected system was prioritized. In addition, a computer based simulation has been <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> to simulate the system and thereby find the draw backs. The poly bag manufacturing system has been modelled to obtain the optimum production times and throughput time of a given type of bag. Production schedule has been developed for maximum productivity by using the simulated production and throughput times, and customer orders. The effect of changing the parameters of the control process was investigated through simulation trials. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed to present the result of simulation easily and user friendly...|$|R

40|$|Plastics are not degradable materials, {{therefore}} improper disposal after use constitute environmental problem. The developed plastic recycler was fabricated using 1. 5 mm mild {{metal sheet}} punched and rolled into cylindrical form. The outer peeling drum was punched inward and {{fixed to the}} machine frame while the inner peeling drum was punched outward. The inner drum was constructed using 1. 5 mm galvanized metal sheet while the die was constructed using carbon steel. It has an outer diameter of 70 mm and inner diameter of 68 mm. The main frame of the machine was constructed from 50 x 50 mm angle bar to provide support for other units. It has a height of 850 mm, length of 6600 mm and width of 400 mm. A 68 mm diameter and 550 mm length cast iron rod shaft ensures satisfactory rigidity and strength when the shaft transmits power under different operating and loading conditions {{with the aid of}} a 3 kW, 3 -phase electric motor. The performance valuation of the machine was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> using polythene <b>bags</b> and polyethylene bottles at speeds 200 and 300 rpm and temperature of 220 oC. Results obtained indicated that torque increases for all screw speeds due to a proportional increase in extruder feed rate as screw speed is decreased. The recycling efficiency of the machine is estimated to be 86 % while the capacity of the machine is 300 kg/hr. Hence, a cost effective machine for recycling low-density plastic was developed.
