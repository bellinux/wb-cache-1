5|$|On August 25, 2016, {{a similar}} {{phenomenon}} was reported for another stellar object: EPIC 204278916, a young M-type pre-main-sequence star with a resolved disk. Dimmings {{of up to}} 65% for 25 <b>consecutive</b> <b>days</b> (out of 79 total observation) were observed. The variability is highly periodic and attributed to stellar rotation. The researchers hypothesize that the irregular dimmings are caused by either a warped inner-disk edge or transiting cometary-like objects in either circular or eccentric orbits.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Ginger {{formed on}} September6 and lasted until October3, {{for a total}} of 27.25days. Its {{duration}} surpassed that of Hurricane Inga in 1969, which was the previous record-holder, by three days. In 2003, it was discovered that the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane lasted as a tropical cyclone longer than Ginger, although its duration as a tropical cyclone was not continuous. This made Ginger the second longest-lived of any Atlantic hurricane, but it remains the storm that lasted the most <b>consecutive</b> <b>days</b> as a tropical cyclone in the basin.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{pyrethroids}} and neonicotinoids {{have been}} used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its attraction to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised to spray in absence of pollinators {{in the early morning}} and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four <b>consecutive</b> <b>days</b> after treatment (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four <b>consecutive</b> <b>days</b> after treatment. The end of blooming indicates the end of adult activity in the field. This stage is therefore a threshold marking the end of insecticide application and occurs no later than five days after last blooming. Forecasting systems (Bruchi-LIS, Arvalis, France and BruchidCast, Syngenta, UK) have been developed to optimize insecticide applications based on temperature and crop stage.|$|E

5|$|The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is {{an image}} of a small region in the {{constellation}} Ursa Major, constructed from a series of observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. It covers an area about 2.6 arcminutes on a side, about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in angular size to a tennis ball at a distance of 100metres. The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 over ten <b>consecutive</b> <b>days</b> between December 18 and December 28, 1995.|$|E

Missouri remained in Egyptian hands though, posing a threat to the Israeli corridor to the canal.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, {{as in the case}} of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, {{as in the case of}} games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of <b>consecutive</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
