5|$|U-23 was {{launched}} on 5 January 1917, but It {{is not known}} with certainty when U-23 was commissioned. Author Paul Halpern reports that U-23 and her three sisters all entered service between August and November 1917. Although there are no specific reports of problems with U-23, the U-20 <b>class</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole suffered from unreliable engines which compounded the poor handling characteristics of the boats.|$|E
5|$|In March 1949, British Railways {{ordered a}} final 20 from Brighton works despite a {{pressing}} need for smaller tank locomotives. This imbalance was rectified by building forty-one {{examples of the}} LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for the Southern Region. Also at this time Brighton works staff were embroiled in the difficulties associated with Bulleid's experimental and problematic Leader <b>class.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, Brighton sought assistance from the other Southern Region works to complete this final order. Ashford works cut the frames and constructed the tenders, and Eastleigh works constructed six of the final batch of locomotives.|$|E

5|$|Yamashita {{was born}} in Kanazawa, then {{the capital of the}} {{powerful}} Kaga Domain. His father was of the samurai <b>class.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> boy, Yamashita trained in the traditional (koryū) Japanese martial arts schools of Yōshin-ryū and Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū jujutsu. In August 1884, he joined the Kodokan judo dojo of his childhood friend Kano Jigoro as its nineteenth member. He advanced to first degree black belt (shodan) rank in three months, fourth degree (yondan) ranking in two years, and sixth degree (rokudan) in fourteen years. He was prone to discuss the philosophy of judo with Kano, as Yamashita initially believed power should be applied before technique.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, two less {{powerful}} T single-car units were built, {{designed to be}} prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway. After a one-year trial, they were put into scheduled traffic to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The production series is somewhat different in design and performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the <b>class</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them operate on {{the western part of the}} network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8.|$|E

25|$|Many {{settlers}} occupied land without {{authority and}} beyond these authorised settlement limits: they {{were known as}} squatters and became {{the basis of a}} powerful landowning <b>class.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of opposition from the labouring and artisan classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of Van Diemen's Land (first settled in 1803, later renamed Tasmania) and Moreton Bay (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.|$|E

25|$|Some {{regarded}} female gladiators of {{any type}} or <b>class</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symptom of corrupted Roman appetites, morals and womanhood. Before he became emperor, Septimius Severus may have attended the Antiochene Olympic Games, which had been revived by the emperor Commodus and included traditional Greek female athletics. His attempt to give Rome a similarly dignified display of female athletics was met by the crowd with ribald chants and cat-calls. Probably as a result, he banned the use of female gladiators in 200 AD.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{attempts}} by Lascăr Catargiu's cabinet {{to force a}} transition in which some corvées were to be maintained, Cuza's reform marked {{the disappearance of the}} boyar <b>class</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> privileged group, and led to a channeling of energies into capitalism and industrialization; at the same time, however, land distributed was still below necessities, and the problem became stringent over the following decades – as peasants reduced to destitution sold off their land or found that it was insufficient for the needs of their growing families.|$|E
25|$|This {{classification}} {{is used in}} para-Alpine and para-Nordic standing skiing, where LW {{stands for}} Locomotor Winter. Skiers in this class have a disability in one lower extremity, which may {{be a result of}} a leg amputation below the knee, knee arthrodesis or a hip arthrodesis. If there are functional problems on the leg, the strength of the leg will be 30 or less, where a fully functional leg normally has a strength of 40. Lower limb monoplegia is a type disability that is comparable to knee amputation for this class. Skiers may be in this <b>class</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of an amputation, or polio.|$|E

25|$|Althusser's {{influence}} is also {{seen in the}} work of economists Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick, who have interpreted that Marx's mature works hold a conception of class different from the normally understood ones. For them, in Marx class refers not to a group of people (for example, those that own the means of production versus those that do not), but to a process involving the production, appropriation, and distribution of surplus labor. Their emphasis on <b>class</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> process is consistent with their reading and use of Althusser's concept of overdetermination in terms of understanding agents and objects as the site of multiple determinations.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} two years the pitches at The Oval were exceedingly fiery and gave Lockwood a lot of help. In 1892, he was regarded as the most difficult bowler {{of the year and}} took a career-high 151 wickets. The following year, he proved his <b>class</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bowler with 9 for 126 for Lord Sheffield's XI against the Australians in May, and 8 for 33 against Cambridge University to give Surrey a surprise win. After taking twenty-one wickets in two games on firm pitches against Yorkshire and Sussex, Lockwood played his first Test at Lord's and took an impressive six for 101. He followed this up with eight for 133 in two innings of the second Test, but injury ruled him out of the last.|$|E
25|$|The old mercantile and {{industrial}} elite, with their relative sophistication {{in matters of}} industry, trade and financing, were well poised to expand under British rule, using their own financing for new technology, represented by British machinery. Instead {{of just a few}} merchants introducing new industrial machinery, as elsewhere in India, in Ahmedabad the mercantile <b>class</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole supported the new techniques, even though hand spinners and handloom weavers, as well as female spinners in the outlying communities had their traditional operations upset as a result. They and others were recruited into the new manufacturing plants. The merchant class tended to support the British, thinking the rule provided more security than under the Marathas, lower taxes (including lower octroi), and more property rights.|$|E
