American author David Arora suggests that the fruit bodies {{may be used in}} a manner similar to the candy cap mushrooms, despite being not as fragrant. Chefs in the San Francisco Bay Area have been known to use it for desserts such as ice creams, cakes and <b>caramels.</b>|$|E
25|$|Milton then {{traveled}} to Denver and, finding {{work at a}} local confectioners, {{learned how to make}} <b>caramels</b> using fresh milk. He then went to New Orleans and Chicago looking for opportunities, before settling in New York City in 1883 and training at Huyler's. He started his second business which, while initially successful, lasted only three years, closing in 1886.|$|E
25|$|Besides Nestlé, {{a number}} of notable {{chocolate}} companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree's of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868. In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey's chocolates with chocolate-coated <b>caramels.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{high-volume}} {{production of}} <b>caramel</b> apples, {{a sheet of}} <b>caramel</b> can be wrapped around the apple, followed by heating the apple to melt the <b>caramel</b> evenly onto it. This creates a harder <b>caramel</b> that is easier to transport but more difficult to eat. <b>Caramel</b> apple production at home usually involves melting pre-purchased <b>caramel</b> candies for dipping or making a homemade <b>caramel</b> from ingredients like corn syrup, brown sugar, butter, and vanilla. Homemade <b>caramel</b> generally results in a softer, creamier coating.|$|R

25|$|The factory was in {{the center}} of a dairy farmland, but with Hershey’s support, houses, businesses, churches and a {{transportation}} infrastructure accreted around the plant. Because the land was surrounded by dairy farms, Hershey was able to use fresh milk to mass-produce quality milk chocolate. Hershey continued to experiment and perfect the process of making milk chocolate using the techniques he had first learned for adding milk to make <b>caramels</b> when he had moved to Drexel Hill.|$|E
25|$|Hershey {{returned}} to Lancaster in 1883. He borrowed {{money from the}} bank to start the Lancaster Caramel Company, which quickly became an outstanding success. He used the caramel recipe he had obtained during his previous travels to make candies. Also, from his previous travels, he learned that <b>caramels</b> sell better in bulk, so {{that is what he}} did. This company soon became a success when a man from England visited Lancaster. He loved Hershey's candies once he tasted them and placed a big order to be delivered to Britain. Hershey was able to pay off the debt from the bank and had some money left over to buy more ingredients and equipment.|$|E
2500|$|After an {{apprenticeship}} to a confectioner in 1873, Milton S. Hershey {{founded a}} candy shop in Philadelphia. This candy shop was only open for six years, after which Hershey apprenticed with another confectioner in Denver, {{where he learned}} to make caramel. After another failed business attempt in New York, Hershey returned to Pennsylvania, where in 1886 he founded the Lancaster Caramel Company. The use of fresh milk in <b>caramels</b> proved successful, and in 1900, after seeing chocolate-making machines {{for the first time}} at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Hershey sold his caramel company for $1,000,000 (equal to $ today), and began to concentrate on chocolate manufacturing, stating to people who questioned him, [...] "Caramels are just a fad, but chocolate is a permanent thing." ...|$|E
50|$|The American <b>Caramel</b> Company {{was created}} on March 28, 1889, when the Breisch-Hine Co. of Philadelphia and the P. C. Wiest Co. of York, Pennsylvania, merged. After {{acquiring}} the Lancaster <b>Caramel</b> Company in 1900, the American <b>Caramel</b> Company became famous by including baseball and other cards in with its candies. With {{the addition of}} Lancaster <b>Caramel</b> Company, the American <b>Caramel</b> Company grew to control 90% of the <b>caramel</b> in the country. The American <b>Caramel</b> Company {{was one of the}} early businesses to issue of Baseball Cards with their product. In December 1928 The American <b>Caramel</b> Company shut down the York Plant, moving the candy making machinery to a more modern facility.|$|R

2500|$|The Democrats {{have also}} had a candy desk since at least 1985. A rolltop desk located on the front wall, {{belonging}} to the United States Senate Democratic Conference Secretary, is also filled with sweets. This tradition began [...] "sometime later" [...] than the better known candy desk; Hershey Kisses were the most popular candy from this desk during the 1980s, followed by small <b>caramels.</b> Candy for this desk is paid for through a [...] "candy fund" [...] to which senators {{who would like to}} partake of the desk's contents contribute. Until he left the Senate in 2015, Jay Rockefeller was responsible for collecting the money and purchasing the candy. This tradition is not widely known; in fact, it is so little-known that the Historian of the United States Senate does not know much about it.|$|E
2500|$|Surrounded by the sea, Brittany {{offers a}} wide range of fresh seafood and fish, {{especially}} mussels and oysters. Among the seafood specialities is a fish stew called cotriade. The beurre blanc sauce, invented in Saint-Julien-de-Concelles, close to Nantes, is often served with fish. Brittany is also known for its salt, mainly harvested around Guérande and used in butter and milk <b>caramels.</b> The region is notable for its biscuit factories, many towns having their own: Quimper, Lorient, Pont-Aven, Saint-Brieuc, BN and LU in Nantes, La Trinitaine in La Trinité-sur-Mer, and Galettes Saint-Michel in Saint-Michel-Chef-Chef. They usually make their biscuits with salted butter and sell them in iron boxes. Famous Breton pastries include the kouign amann ("butter cake" [...] in Breton) made with bread dough and high quantities of butter and sugar, and the [...] far, a sort of sweet Yorkshire pudding usually made with plums.|$|E
