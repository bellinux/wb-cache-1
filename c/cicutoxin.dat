5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle <b>cicutoxin,</b> an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. <b>Cicutoxin</b> is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. <b>Cicutoxin</b> acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of <b>cicutoxin</b> this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. <b>Cicutoxin</b> is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Water hemlock {{poisoning}} {{is usually}} diagnosed following {{a history of}} plant ingestion and symptoms of abrupt onset of seizures. Laboratory tests to determine the presence of <b>cicutoxin</b> in the blood such as spectrofluorimetry, high pressure liquid chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and mass spectrometry {{have been used to}} detect <b>cicutoxin</b> but these tests are not performed routinely in hospital laboratories. If a sample of the plant ingested has been retained, diagnosis can be confirmed by having the plant identified by a botanist.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{some plants}} use fatty acid derivates, amino acids and even {{peptides}} as defenses. The cholinergic toxine, <b>cicutoxin</b> of water hemlock, is a polyyne {{derived from the}} fatty acid metabolism. β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid as simple amino acid {{is used by the}} sweet pea which leads also to intoxication in humans. The synthesis of fluoroacetate in several plants {{is an example of the}} use of small molecules to disrupt the metabolism of herbivores, in this case the citric acid cycle.|$|E
5|$|Water hemlock is {{considered}} one of North America's most toxic plants, being highly poisonous to humans. Three members of the genus contain a toxin named <b>cicutoxin</b> which causes central nervous system stimulatory effects including seizures following ingestion. Medical treatment of poisoning may include the use of activated charcoal to decrease gastrointestinal absorption of the toxic principle along with supportive care including anticonvulsant drugs such as a benzodiazepine. High doses of anticonvulsant medicine are often required to halt seizure activity and further medical care including intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required.|$|E
25|$|According to Ferdinand Bohlmann, {{the first}} {{naturally}} occurring acetylenic compound, dehydromatricaria ester, was isolated from an Artemisia species in 1826. In the nearly two centuries that have followed, {{well over a}} thousand naturally occurring acetylenes have been discovered and reported. Polyynes, a subset of this class of natural products, have been isolated {{from a wide variety}} of plant species, cultures of higher fungi, bacteria, marine sponges, and corals. Some acids like tariric acid contains an alkyne group. Diynes and triynes, species with the linkage RC≡C–C≡CR′ and RC≡C–C≡C–C≡CR′ respectively, occur in certain plants (Ichthyothere, Chrysanthemum, Cicuta, Oenanthe and other members of the Asteraceae and Apiaceae families). Some examples are <b>cicutoxin,</b> oenanthotoxin, falcarinol and carotatoxin. These compounds are highly bioactive, e.g. as nematocides. 1-Phenylhepta-1,3,5-triyne is illustrative of a naturally occurring triyne.|$|E
500|$|Further {{treatment}} for complications of metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, or low blood pressure may be required. [...] Metabolic acidosis is treated by administering sodium bicarbonate. Low {{blood pressure is}} usually treated with intravenous fluid replacement, but the administration of dopamine or norepinephrine {{may be required to}} restore blood pressure. The management of rhabdomyolysis includes ensuring adequate hydration and urinary alkalinization; a complication of rhabdomyolysis is acute renal failure which may require management with hemodialysis. However, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion or other extracorporeal techniques do not remove <b>cicutoxin</b> from the blood and are therefore not useful in enhancing elimination.|$|E
500|$|The [...] in mice {{administered}} <b>cicutoxin</b> by {{intraperitoneal injection}} is 48.3mg per kg body weight (mg/kg); this compares with 5.9mg/kg for mice given potassium cyanide by intraperitoneal injection, while the LD50 for arsenic via intraperitoneal injection in mice is 46.2mg/kg. The exact toxic dose of plant material in humans is unknown; {{it is thought}} ingestion of water hemlock in any quantity can result in poisoning and very small amounts may lead to death. Poisoning has been reported following children blowing whistles made from the hollow stem of water hemlock plants. Intoxication has also been reported following skin contact with the plant; a case was reported where a family of five people rubbed the plant onto the skin and were poisoned, with two children dying. Livestock have long been the worst affected, leading to the common name [...] "cowbane". Poisoning in livestock is common and typically occurs following ingestion of roots of the plant. In the spring when the ground is soft, grazing animals tend to pull the entire plant {{out of the ground}} ingesting both the foiliage and the roots. Roots exposed by ploughing can also be the source of livestock poisonings. Ingestion of plant material may cause death in the animal in as little as 15 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{molecular}} formula for <b>cicutoxin</b> is C17H22O2. It is an aliphatic, highly unsaturated alcohol with two triple bonds, three double bonds and two hydroxyl groups. The natural form {{that occurs in}} plants is (R)-(−)-cicutoxin, but when <b>cicutoxin</b> is synthesized it is racemic mixture. There are also some closely related compounds that have almost the same structure <b>cicutoxin</b> such as Virol A and Virol C. When <b>cicutoxin</b> is isolated it is a yellowish oil. In the plant the compound is stable but when exposed to air, light or heat it becomes brown and <b>cicutoxin</b> is broken down. [...] Because <b>cicutoxin</b> breaks down so rapidly, research on the compound isn’t easy.Cicutoxin has a long carbon structure and few hydrophilic substituents which gives it hydrophobic characteristics. Hydrophobic and/or small molecules can be absorbed through the skin and for <b>cicutoxin</b> it has been proven to be absorbed through the skin of frogs. There is also {{the example of the}} family that used a cicuta plant to relieve themselves of pruritus (also mentioned in the history) that shows <b>cicutoxin</b> can be absorbed through the skin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{toxic effect}} of the plants that {{contains}} <b>cicutoxin</b> have been known for centuries. As early as 1911, 27 cases of <b>cicutoxin</b> poisoning were known, 21 of the cases resulted in death. In some of these cases the plant was used for murder or execution. 78 cases were reported in 1962, 33 of them resulted in death. These days there are still cases of <b>cicutoxin</b> poisoning: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Cicutoxin</b> is a noncompetitive gamma-aminobytyric acid (GABA) {{antagonist}} in {{the central}} nervous system (CNS). GABA normally binds to the beta domain of the GABAa receptor and activates the receptor which causes a flow of chloride across the membrane. <b>Cicutoxin</b> binds to the same place as GABA, because of this the receptor is not activated by GABA. The pore of the receptor won’t open and chloride can’t flow across the membrane. Binding of <b>cicutoxin</b> to the beta domain also blocks the chloride channel. Both effects of <b>cicutoxin</b> on the GABAA-receptor cause a constant depolarization. This causes hyperactivity in cells, which leads to seizures.|$|E
5000|$|Efficacy is {{the ability}} of a drug to {{reproduce}} a desired effect. So, although <b>cicutoxin</b> is a known strong poison, a study showed that it can also be used as a natural antileukemia drug. The toxin inhibits the proliferation of the lymphocytes. This has made it a substance of interest in research for a medicine against leukemia. In 1986 <b>cicutoxin</b> was first tested for its antitumor activity. This study showed that a methanolic extract of C. maculate gave a significant cytotoxicity in the 9 KB (human nasopharyngeal carcinoma) cell structure assay. These results showed the anti-leukemic effect of <b>cicutoxin.</b> [...] <b>Cicutoxin</b> is also used as a natural drug against breast cancer, because of its antitumor activity.|$|E
50|$|All {{plants from}} the genus Cicuta contain <b>cicutoxin,</b> C. virosa also {{contains}} virol A, virol C and an isomer of <b>cicutoxin,</b> isocicutoxin. O. crocata contains the toxin oenanthotoxin, also an isomer of <b>cicutoxin.</b> All {{of these plants}} contain a similar toxin. The principal structure of these toxins is a C17 conjugated polyactylene with a terminal hydroxyl group and an allylic hydroxyl group attached at C14. These toxins can be extracted from the plants named above or they can be synthesized.|$|E
50|$|There {{are quite}} some known cases of {{toxicity}} caused by consumption of a Cicuta plant. Most {{of these cases}} are accidental intake of <b>cicutoxin</b> because the stem looks {{like that of a}} celery plant and the roots look and smell like that of parsnip. But eating a small piece of the root can be fatal. The cause of death after absorption of <b>cicutoxin</b> is usually respiratory failure. The LD50 of <b>cicutoxin</b> for mice is 2.8 mg/kg (10.8 μmol/kg). In comparison, the LD50 of virol A is 28.0 mg/kg (108 8 μmol/kg) and LD of isocicutoxin is 38.5 mg/kg (149 μmol/kg). For cattle eating cicutoxin-containing plants is lethal faster than for humans, because cattle cannot vomit {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>cicutoxin</b> that will be absorbed.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of action is not known for <b>cicutoxin,</b> {{even though it is}} well-known to be a violent toxin. The mechanism is not known because of the chemical instability of <b>cicutoxin,</b> but there have been studies that delivered some evidence for a {{mechanism of}} action.|$|E
50|$|It is {{structurally}} {{related to}} the oenanthotoxin and <b>cicutoxin.</b>|$|E

50|$|The plant {{contains}} <b>cicutoxin,</b> which {{disrupts the}} workings of the central nervous system. In humans, <b>cicutoxin</b> rapidly produces symptoms of nausea, emesis and abdominal pain, typically within 60 minutes of ingestion. Poisoning can lead to tremors and seizures. A single bite of the root (which has the highest concentration of <b>cicutoxin)</b> can be sufficient to cause death. In animals the toxic dose and the lethal dose are nearly the same. One gram of water hemlock per kilogram of weight will kill a sheep and 230 grams is sufficient to kill a horse. Due to the rapid onset of symptoms, treatment is usually unsuccessful.|$|E

50|$|All {{plants from}} the genus Cicuta contain <b>cicutoxin,</b> these plants {{are found in}} swampy, wet {{habitats}} in North America and parts of Europe. The Cicuta plants are often mistaken for edible roots such as parsnip, wild carrot or wild ginseng. All parts of the cicuta plants are poisonous, though the root is the most toxic part of the plant. 17 boys ingested parts of the plant, only those who consumed the root were experiencing seizures, the others who consumed the leaves and flowers were only unwell. The toxicity of the plants depends on various factors, such as seasonal variation, temperature, geographical location and soil conditions. Especially {{in the early spring}} the roots are the most toxic part of the plant. The roots contain their toxicity even after drying. <b>Cicutoxin</b> was first isolated by C.A. Jacobsen in 1915. In 1953, the structure of the toxin was determined. The first synthesis of <b>cicutoxin</b> was reported in 1955, the researchers had a yield of only 4 percent. Given that they had no access to modern coupling reactions, this was a great accomplishment. The absolute configuration of <b>cicutoxin</b> was identified in 1999, they also discovered that the plants contain multiple congeners of <b>cicutoxin.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Oenanthotoxin is a toxin {{extracted}} from hemlock water dropwort (Oenanthe crocata) {{and other plants}} of the genus Oenanthe. It is a central nervous system poison, and acts as a noncompetitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist. A case has been made {{for the presence of}} this toxin in local Oenanthe species playing a causative role in euthanasia in ancient Sardinia. It was crystallized in 1949 by Clarke and co-workers. It is structurally closely related to the toxins <b>cicutoxin</b> and carotatoxin. [...] Oenanthotoxin is a C17 polyacetylene isomer of <b>cicutoxin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although oenanthotoxin is a {{relatively}} well known poison, its mechanism of action is not entirely understood. However, {{there is evidence that}} it is similar to the mechanism of <b>cicutoxin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Cicutoxin</b> is a {{poisonous}} polyyne and alcohol found in various plants, {{such as the}} highly toxic water hemlock (Cicuta species). It is a natural product structurally related to the oenanthotoxin of hemlock water dropwort.|$|E

50|$|The {{first article}} about the {{synthesis}} of <b>cicutoxin</b> was published in 1955. The racemic <b>cicutoxin</b> that was synthesized, {{turned out to be}} about twice as active as the natural material. In 2009 the synthesis of the natural polyenyne (R)-(-)-cicutoxin was described (R)-(-)-cicutoxin can be synthesized in four linear steps, with the three key fragments: (R)-(-)-1-hexyn-3-ol (8), 1,4-diiodo-1,3-butadiene (9), and THP-protected 4,6-heptadiyn-1-ol (6). (R)-(-)-1-hexyn-3-ol (8) is a known compound and was obtained by Corey-Bakshi-Shibata reduction of 1-hexyn-3-one. 1,4-diiodo-1,3-butadiene (9) is also a known compound and it is readily available by dimerization of acetylene accompanied by addition of iodine in the presence of platinum (IV) catalyst and sodium iodide. The last keyfragment, THP-protected 4,6-heptadiyn-1-ol (6) is a known compound.|$|E
50|$|Cattle usually ingest {{parts of}} cicuta plant while they’re grazing on new {{growth in the}} spring around ditches and rivers where cicuta plants grow. Animals mostly have the same {{symptoms}} of <b>cicutoxin</b> poisoning as humans do, but animals do not vomit and measuring amnesia will be very hard. Symptoms that are described for animals are salivation, seizures, frequent urination and defecation and skeletal and cardiac myodegeneration. The seizures are usually short, {{less than a minute}} per seizure, with 15-30 minutes between each seizure. These seizures are spread over 2 hours after which seizures stop. The same article describes how the ewes slowly recover of its seizures and completely recovered seven days after eating the <b>cicutoxin</b> containing tubers.|$|E
5000|$|There {{also have}} been some studies that suggest that <b>cicutoxin</b> {{increases}} {{the duration of the}} neuronal repolarization in a dose-dependent manner. The toxin could increase the duration of the repolarization up to sixfold at 100 µmol/l. The prolonged action potentials may cause higher excitatory activity ...|$|E
5000|$|First {{signs of}} <b>cicutoxin</b> {{poisoning}} start 15-60 minutes after ingestion and are vomiting, convulsions, widened pupils, salivation, excess sweating {{and the patient}} may go into a coma. Other described symptoms are cyanosis, amnesia, absence of muscle reflexes, metabolic acidosis and cardiovascular changes which may cause heart problems and central nervous system problems which manifest themselves as convulsions and either an overactive or underactive heart. [...] Due to an overactive nervous system respiratory failure occurs which may cause suffocation and accounts {{for most of the}} deaths. Dehydration from water loss due to vomiting can also occur. If untreated, the kidneys can also fail, causing death. Since there currently isn't any antidote for <b>cicutoxin,</b> the symptoms have to be treated to prevent death and/or permanent damage.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{distinguishable}} {{characteristic of}} western water hemlock is its toxicity. <b>Cicutoxin</b> is the toxin that {{is produced by}} the water hemlock, making it the most poisonous plant in North America. [...] <b>Cicutoxin</b> is a yellowish liquid that is prevalent in the roots. It is an unsaturated alcohol that has {{a major impact on}} the central nervous system of animals. Early symptoms of <b>cicutoxin</b> poisoning include excessive salivation, frothing at the mouth, nervousness, and incoordination. These symptoms can turn into tremors, muscular weakness, seizures and respiratory failure. [...] Very small amounts of green materials of W. water hemlock, about [...]1% of a person’s body weight can even lead to death. In addition to being extremely dangerous to humans, this plant has an enormous impact on animals. It {{is one of the first}} plants to come out in springtime, and has a very appealing odor. As little as 0.2%-0.5% body weight for sheep, 0.1% body weight for cattle, 0.5% body weight for horses, and 0.3% body weight for swine can be lethal. Death can occur within fifteen minutes of ingesting this toxin. These characteristics, along with the fact that it grows in moist areas make it a very desirable, yet deadly, plant for grazing animals.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is unknown}} how the body {{gets rid of}} <b>cicutoxin.</b> There is {{evidence}} {{that it has a}} long half-life in the body, because of a patient who was submitted in a hospital after eating a root of a Cicuta plant. The man was in the hospital for two days and still had a fuzzy feeling in his head two days after leaving the hospital. There is also the case of a sheep (discussed in Effects on animals) where the sheep fully recovered after seven days. [...] This can also be explained by the structure of <b>cicutoxin,</b> it consists of 17 carbons, which is hydrophobic. It also has 3 double bonds, 2 triple bonds and two hydroxyl groups, which make the toxin very reactive and not easy to excrete.|$|E
50|$|Convulsant drugs (the {{functional}} opposites of anticonvulsants) {{will always}} induce seizures at sufficient doses. Examples of such agents, {{some of which}} are used or have been used clinically for various purposes, and others of which are naturally occurring toxins, include strychnine, bemegride, flumazenil, cyclothiazide, flurothyl, pentylenetetrazol, bicuculline, <b>cicutoxin,</b> and picrotoxin.|$|E
50|$|Other polyynes {{from plants}} include oenanthotoxin and <b>cicutoxin.</b> Polyynes {{including}} falcarindiol {{can be found}} in Apiaceae vegetables like carrot, celery, fennel, parsley and parsnip where they show cytotoxic activities. Aliphatic C(17)- polyynes of the falcarinol type were described to act as metabolic modulators and are studied as potential health-promoting nutraceuticals.|$|E
