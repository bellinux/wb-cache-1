5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything.</b> It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
500|$|Objects {{that can}} be interacted with in the game world display a small circle next to them. Puzzles in the game are solved by finding the correct {{frequency}} on Alex's handheld radio, which <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> from unlock doors to communicate with ghosts, and by winding up tape recorders at the correct speed. Oxenfree {{does not have any}} [...] "game over" [...] loss conditions; the player's choices and relationships with the characters determine which of several possible endings the player receives.|$|E
500|$|At those Games, Lamhamedi won {{the gold}} medal in the boy's Super-G competition. At the time, he said [...] "I wanted to prove that Moroccans can ski well, and I proved it. This {{represents}} that in life you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything,</b> never give up." [...] This achievement meant that he was the first African competitor to win a medal of any colour at a Winter Olympics event.

500|$|Other {{critics have}} been much less forgiving; common critiques have derided the princess as a spoiled, shallow, bland and overly sexualized character. Common Sense Media criticized Jasmine for lacking an {{original}} predicament and premise, while Creative Loafing's Matt Brunson described the character as a [...] "liberated" [...] but [...] "stiff" [...] heroine. Janet Maslin of The New York Times panned Jasmine: [...] "the sloe-eyed Princess Jasmine... a nymph in harem pants, use words like 'fabulous' and 'amazing' to express unremarkable thoughts", concluding, [...] "Luckily, [...] surrounded by an overpowering array of secondary characters who make the film's sidelines much more interesting than its supposed center." [...] Time Out called the character disappointing, and TV Guide described her as [...] "bland". Film critic Roger Ebert cited Jasmine among the film's weaknesses, dismissing the relationship between her and Aladdin as [...] "pale and routine" [...] in comparison to Belle and the Beast's. Additionally, Ebert wrote that the characters [...] "look unformed, as if even the filmmakers didn't see them as real individuals." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine derided the character as [...] "another 'free-spirited' type in the Barbie-doll tradition, a faux feminist who wants everyone {{to know that she}} <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> the boys can". Orange Coasts Henry A. Giroux dismissed Jasmine as little more than [...] "an object of 's immediate desire" [...] and [...] "stepping stone to social mobility." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another, more literal {{translation}} is [...] "Ruler of All" [...] or, less literally, [...] "Sustainer of the World". In this understanding, Pantokrator is a compound word formed from the Greek for [...] "all" [...] and the verb meaning [...] "To accomplish something" [...] or [...] "to sustain something" [...] ( [...] , [...] ). This translation speaks more to God's actual power; i.e., God does everything (as opposed to God <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything).</b>|$|E

Ransom describes the emotional connection between the races as a cross between that of equals and that of person to an animal, mirrored {{in the way that}} humans tend to anthropomorphize pets.

5|$|The Elves, {{particularly}} the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various {{things such as}} smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females <b>can</b> <b>do</b> almost <b>everything</b> equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the males go to war. This is {{because they believe that}} taking life interferes with the ability to preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as Elrond.|$|R
2500|$|After the September 11 attacks, the US invaded Afghanistan {{to fight}} Al-Qaeda, which had orchestrated the attack. [...] The {{invasion}} of Afghanistan began on October 7, 2001.

Wolfowitz rebuffed the offer, saying: [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> we need to."

50|$|Hose clamps are {{frequently}} used for {{things other than}} their intended use, and are often used as a more permanent version of duct tape wherever a tightening band around something would be useful.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Clark hit a rich vein for his {{flamboyant}} clothing range. The fashion press dubbed Ossie the [...] "King of King's Road". Clark pronounced himself a [...] "master cutter. It's {{all in my}} brain and fingers and there's no-one {{in the world to}} touch me. I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> myself." [...] Clark's great idol was the famous dancer Nijinsky and his love of dance inspired his clothes to be free moving and not to restrict the female form. This style of dressing became quite popular in the 1970s {{thanks in large part to}} the popularity of Clark's clothing. Ossie Clark is well known for his use of muted colours and moss crepe fabric. He also designed shoes, paper dresses, and snakeskin jackets.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of his fine {{performances}} in 1952, mainly in Test cricket against India, Trueman was voted the Young Cricketer of the Year by the Cricket Writers' Club. The following spring, he was named as one of the Cricketers of the Year for 1952 by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in its 1953 edition. Wisden said of Trueman in its citation that he [...] "is 5 ft 10½ in. and weighs 13st 9lbs" [...] and [...] "gives promise of becoming a second Harold Larwood". Having mentioned his problem with [...] "stitch", Wisden remarked that [...] "it is doubtful whether Trueman has reached the stage of physical development to bowl the long spells which may be necessary against Test batsmen of the highest class". While Yorkshire thought Trueman would need two more seasons [...] "before he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> asked", England certainly possess [...] "the best fast bowling prospect in years" [...] and Wisden followed this comment with a direct comparison of Trueman's attributes with those of Larwood.|$|E
2500|$|Williams stated {{his love}} for Toronto and {{mentioned}} the possibility of returning to the Canadian game during his professional career.

[...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You feel like you have a life. I come to work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store.

5000|$|Derulo {{explained}} {{the significance of}} the title saying: [...] "It's callled Everything is 4 because it's my fourth album, but there are also other meanings.

I could go on, but in the end the meaning is [...] "Everything happens for a reason". Then there is also the meaning of the number 4: a chair has four legs, a table even.

In the ensuing battle we see just how powerful Alice really is as she is the first heroine in the series to face Freddy in the dream, alone, and triumph.
