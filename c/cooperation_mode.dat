Coco Bandicoot as a playable character was omitted from the PlayStation 2 version of the game due to her distinct animations taking up much of the console's memory.

Furthermore absorptive capacity and the organizational structure of in-house R&D play an important role.

Second, with regard to the impact of IUG cooperation, we conspicuously find no significant impact on the innovation probability of firms when we control the possible endogeneity, such that already innovative firms would participate more at such <b>cooperation</b> <b>modes.</b> This implies that the IUG cooperation cannot guarantee the success of a firm in technological innovation. Rather, it may have an influence on the selection or direction of the research projects of a firm. When we limited the analysis to innovative firms, we do find a positive impact of the IUG cooperation on patents generated from new product innovation but find none in terms of volume of sales or labor productivity.

Customer cooperativeness may be manifested in several modes: they may assist by approaching the salesperson, by reselling the goods they purchased to other customers, or by doing both. Several objectives are of interest: minimizing the total distance traveled by all of the participants, minimizing the maximal distance traveled by a participant and minimizing the total time until all of the deliveries are made. All of the combinations of <b>cooperation</b> <b>modes</b> and objective functions are considered, both in weighted undirected graphs and in Euclidean space.

40|$|Abstract. "Clean {{technology}} and low carbon " {{is becoming a}} new trend of energy development worldwide. To speed up Coalbed Methane (CBM) exploration and development is of significant importance to reduce coal mine gas accidents, to protect atmospheric environment and to improve energy structure. Greater efforts have been exerted to CBM development, and three major CBM enterprises emerged. Qinnan, Lu’an and Sanjiao <b>cooperation</b> <b>modes</b> are developed to promote the coordinated development of gas extraction and coal mining. Many exploration and development technologies, tailored for various rank coal methane and for different geological conditions, are developed. Exploring technology, in CBM buried deeper than 800 m and in low-rank coal bed methane development, has achieved substantial breakthrough. Moreover, Qinnan, Hancheng, Daning-jixian and Baode four favorable blocks are all adjacent to the major existing pipelines. China is rich in CBM resources, with great potentials and promising prospects, however, two factors of {{technology and}} management are still constraining the development of China’s CBM.

40|$|Current {{industrial}} processes often involve the collaboration {{of people at}} distant and remote locations. The technological media for such a tele-cooperation reach from simple email or text-based chatting systems to highly-sophisticated systems for an interactive video-conferencing. But with limited bandwidth the communication between persons at distant locations is often restricted to single modalities. Although this may still be suitable for some tasks, it may result into serious shortcomings and decreased performance with complex tasks like cooperative assembly or maintenance. This is because restricted communication reduces {{the availability of a}} common ground, i. e. sharing a common understanding of knowledge, opinions, and goals. The study presented in this paper examines the effect of different communication media on performance of a collaborative assembly task. The results show that tele-cooperation leads to additional verbal communication (AM(direct) = 71. 1 s; AM(vide o) = 145. 6 s; AM(audio) = 204. 7 s) and, thus, longer times to complete the task (AM (direct) = 45. 95 min; AM (video) = 50. 2 min; am AM(audio) = 56. 16 min). The percentage of relative speech duration also increases significantly. Workload measurement with NASA-TLX did not show any significant differences between <b>cooperation</b> <b>modes.</b> The results allow estimating the effect of reduced communication modalities on time to complete an assembly task.
