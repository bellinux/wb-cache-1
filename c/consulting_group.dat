5|$|Recruited {{by several}} firms in 1975, Romney joined the Boston <b>Consulting</b> <b>Group</b> (BCG), {{reasoning}} that {{working as a}} management consultant {{for a variety of}} companies would better prepare him for a future position as a chief executive. Part of a 1970s wave of top graduates who chose to go into consulting rather than join a large company directly, he found his legal and business education useful in his job. He applied BCG principles such as the growth-share matrix, and executives viewed him as having a bright future there. At the Boston <b>Consulting</b> <b>Group,</b> he was a colleague of Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he formed a friendship that has lasted for more than forty years.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} {{independent}} environmental <b>consulting</b> <b>group</b> FishBio {{showed that the}} artificial spring pulse flows from New Melones Dam do fairly little to support salmon and steelhead out-migration in the Stanislaus River. Rather, the fish take their cues from increased water flow due to rainfall, as they naturally would have before the many dams on the Stanislaus River were built. In the spring of 2016 about 12,500 juvenile salmon migrated downriver to the sea during April and May, but less than 1percent migrated during the pulse flow. In years of drought when the lake level is low, releasing water during the spring creates consequences {{later in the year}} – because there is not enough cold water left for the autumn spawning run.|$|E

5|$|The rise {{in global}} demand {{has been driven}} by high growth rates in glass fiber, {{fiberglass}} and borosilicate glassware production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill <b>Consulting</b> <b>Group</b> forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.|$|E
