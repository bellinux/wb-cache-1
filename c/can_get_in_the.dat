He is a very good on-the-ball defender and a tremendous athlete and we think he really solidifies our backcourt for the future." ...|$|E

In an interview with IGN, Sakurai said the Wii's motion sensing features might not be included because [...] " [...] found that trying to implement too much motion-sensory functionality <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of the game". As far as Wi-Fi play is concerned, Sakurai stated his plan was to include Wi-Fi connection compatibility from the start. He goes on to say, [...] "One of the primary reasons Super Smash Bros. Brawl was created was that Nintendo, when taking Wii online, wanted to have Smash Bros. to do that." [...] However, Sakurai stated on the Japanese version of the Smash Bros. website that there were [...] "hurdles of all sorts that [...] it very difficult" [...] to implement online battles. Furthermore, he said that an online ranking system is unlikely to be implemented. During a test play between Sakurai and Hideo Kojima, Kojima stated that the game felt complete and that Nintendo [...] "could put it out now and it would sell millions of copies".

We didn't {{do a lot of}} overdubs, mostly just the vocals." [...] Nonetheless, while the album succeeded in countering the over-production present on Byrdmaniax, the band themselves weren't particularly satisfied with the finished product. [...] In a 1997 interview, bass player Skip Battin expressed his dissatisfaction with the album by saying [...] "When we finished it, I didn't think we had anything, I thought the stuff was rotten - it didn't sound good, it was scattered and there was no unification." [...] Drummer Gene Parsons concurred with Battin's assessment of the album, stating [...] "I felt that Farther Along was a good album, but it was under produced. It was done really rapidly and it suffered in under production as a reaction to Byrdmaniax." ...|$|E
