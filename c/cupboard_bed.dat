60|$|There {{fell upon}} him {{the manner of}} a {{conspirator}} revealing secrets. He glanced guiltily round the room; then, creeping on tip-toe, he opened a <b>cupboard</b> behind the <b>bed.</b> Within was a tin basin and a small can.|$|R
5000|$|Sleepbox is a brand {{offering}} {{a bed and}} associated facilities in a limited space. It is a larger version of a capsule hotel. [...] Some versions include a bed with linen, a ventilation system, alarm clock, LCD TV, WiFi, desk space with LED lighting and electrical outlets for a laptop and rechargeable phone; luggage {{can be stored in}} a <b>cupboard</b> under the <b>bed.</b> They exist in New York, Moscow, and other locations, often in airport terminals.|$|R
50|$|Little {{remains of}} the {{furnishings}} and medical equipment. There {{is no evidence of}} the operating theatre equipment, <b>beds,</b> <b>cupboards</b> and other moveable equipment. Some material remaining prior to the fire included benching along the eastern wall, timber shelving, light fittings and timber shoring in the north tunnel. There was also a considerable amount of post war material such as files, X-ray plates and medical equipment such as an autoclave. It is believed that the files and X-ray plates fuelled the 1997 fire.|$|R
50|$|The {{smallest}} ones had 2-4 rooms. Larger ones {{would have}} many more, including guest rooms and a chapel. Magnates' palaces would even boast their own opera house. Common furniture included benches, <b>cupboards,</b> tables, <b>beds</b> and small chairs, commonly made from tilia wood. Rarer furniture would include chests and wardrobes. Furniture was often painted (green {{being the most}} common color), sometimes engraved and inlaid. Walls were often painted with floral or moral and historical motifs, and decorated with Eastern (Persian, Turkish) tapestries and rugs, coats of arms, portraits, mirrors, weapons and trophies. Floors were wooden. Ceilings were carved and decorated with various hanging decorations (including candelabras). Windows in the richest mansions would be fitted with Venetian glass, and the rest would use green glass or waxed canvas. Stoves were common. Depending on a family's wealth, they would be made of materials from rough earthenware to porcelain and alabaster.|$|R
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour later half dozen men of the Republican Guard, with {{corporal}} and sergeant in command, were in the small apartment on the fifth floor of the tenement house in the Rue Jolivet. They had demanded an entry {{in the name of the}} Republic, had roughly hustled petite maman and Rosette, questioned them to Lenegre's whereabouts, and not satisfied with the reply which they received, had turned the tidy little home topsy-turvy, ransacked every <b>cupboard,</b> dislocated every <b>bed,</b> table or sofa which might presumably have afforded a hiding place for a man.|$|R

Medical services are available {{by way of a}} resident doctor, nurses and a sick room. Dorm-representatives and matrons meet regularly to sort out difficulties, if any.|$|R
5000|$|Within Zen monastic society, the {{hierarchy}} is all-pervading and rigid. For {{the first seven}} years {{he lived in the}} zendo, the meditation hall, with three by six feet of space on the meditation platform and two <b>cupboards,</b> one for <b>bedding</b> and one for robes. Daizan Rōshi reflects: [...] "As junior monks, we were almost never alone. Every action 24 hours a day was expected to be obedient to instructions, undertaken mindfully and with consideration for others. The monastery is a pressured environment. The image used to exemplify it was the rock tumbler; the months and years of living cheek by jowl gradually smooth off all the rough corners so that each monk becomes a polished jewel.” He received dharma transmission on December 21, 1995.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} unique stone {{furniture}} has been excavated in Skara Brae, a Neolithic village in Orkney, Scotland. The site dates from 3100-2500 BC {{and due to}} a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into items for use within the household. Each house shows {{a high degree of}} sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from <b>cupboards,</b> dressers and <b>beds</b> to shelves, stone seats, and limpet tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important as it symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic Carved Stone Balls also found at the site.|$|R
5000|$|The album's {{survival}} is remarkable, given the strenuous efforts {{made by the}} Nazis to keep the [...] "Final Solution" [...] a secret. Also remarkable {{is the story of}} its discovery. Lili Jacob (later Lili Jacob-Zelmanovic Meier) was selected for work at Auschwitz-Birkenau while the other members of her family were sent to the gas chambers. The Auschwitz camp was evacuated by the Nazis as the Soviet army approached. Jacob passed through various camps, finally arriving at the Dora concentration camp, where she was eventually liberated. Recovering from illness in a vacated barracks of the SS, Jacob found the album in a <b>cupboard</b> beside her <b>bed.</b> Inside, she found pictures of herself, her relatives, and others from her community. The coincidence was astounding, given that the Nordhausen-Dora camp was over 640 km away, and that over 1,100,000 people were killed at Auschwitz.|$|R
50|$|Fanny and Edith {{are sitting}} on Fanny's bed, talking about the {{materials}} {{to be used for}} the clothes for the wedding, when Michelle, Yvette and René enter the room. Michelle operates the aerial with a few switches installed in the <b>cupboard.</b> Firstly, the <b>bed</b> folds in half {{to make room for the}} aerial. Secondly, the roof opens up and thirdly, the aerial rises out of one of the bedposts. When they have sent the message ("The cow is ready to jump over the moon and Jack and Jill are standing in a bucket"), Crabtree shows up, complaining to Michelle that he cannot unglue his false ears. She then gives him a removal for this. When he has gone, it starts snowing through the opened roof, down on the bed. When Michelle lowers the aerial, to be able to close the roof, there is a big bird sitting on it, which they have to get rid of first.|$|R
60|$|The {{houses were}} usually {{composed}} of one room, where, near the open fire, and fixed against the wall, stands the bedstead or lit clos, of old oak, shut in by carved sliding panels, often bearing an inscription or some sacred symbol. The mattresses and feather-beds are so piled up, {{that there is}} hardly room to creep in. Before it is the big chest containing the family wardrobe, answering the double purpose of a seat and a step by which to ascend the lofty <b>bed.</b> <b>Cupboards</b> on each side often have wide shelves, where the children sleep. Settles and a long table complete the furniture; the latter often has little wells hollowed out in the top to hold the soup instead of plates. Over the table, suspended by pulleys, are two indispensable articles in a Breton house,--a large round basket to cover the bread, and a wooden frame to hold the spoons. Festoons of sausages, hams, candles, onions, horse-shoes, harness, and tools, all hang from the ceiling. The floor is of beaten earth. One narrow window lets in the light. There are no out-houses, and pigs and poultry mingle freely with the family.|$|R
50|$|Bela Borsody’s fourth {{marriage}} was to Magdolna Mányi, granddaughter {{of the famous}} engineer-teacher István Kruspér. They got married on March 2, 1962, but Bevilaqua died on March 12. György Kőbányai tells about the romantic marriage ceremony in his obituary as follows: “He lived in Nap utca, Józsefváros, for tens of years, {{but at the end}} of last year he moved to a small flat in Kisfaludy utca. A metal <b>bed,</b> <b>cupboard,</b> table, books and lumber… he lit a candle in the evening. It was the end of February when he left the house for the last time. The old scholar was not alone when he came back: he was supported by an exquisite old lady. ‘This is my fiancée,’ he introduced her to the caretaker. Love lasting for a lifetime. They had met when he was a student, but they parted. They loved each other, they had been exchanging letters for more than half a century. The lady was from Martonvásárhely, she was a scientist and a retired teacher. Now she accompanied the scholar, who was sick, up to the street and called a doctor.|$|R
6000|$|I {{could not}} but notice {{some of the}} peculiarities of my visitors. Girls and boys and young women {{generally}} seemed glad {{to be in the}} woods. They looked in the pond and at the flowers, and improved their time. Men of business, even farmers, thought only of solitude and employment, and of the great distance at which I dwelt from something or other; and though they said that they loved a ramble in the woods occasionally, it was obvious that they did not. Restless committed men, whose time was an taken up in getting a living or keeping it; ministers who spoke of God as if they enjoyed a monopoly of the subject, who could not bear all kinds of opinions; doctors, lawyers, uneasy housekeepers who pried into my <b>cupboard</b> and <b>bed</b> when I was out--how came Mrs.--to know that my sheets were not as clean as hers?--young men who had ceased to be young, and had concluded that it was safest to follow the beaten track of the professions--all these generally said that {{it was not possible to}} do so much good in my position. Ay! there was the rub. The old and infirm and the timid, of whatever age or sex, thought most of sickness, and sudden accident and death; to them life seemed full of danger--what danger is there if you don't think of any?--and they thought that a prudent man would carefully select the safest position, where Dr. B. might be on hand at a moment's warning. To them the village was literally a com-munity, a league for mutual defence, and you would suppose that they would not go a-huckleberrying without a medicine chest. The amount of it is, if a man is alive, there is always danger that he may die, though the danger must be allowed to be less in proportion as he is dead-and-alive to begin with. A man sits as many risks as he runs. Finally, there were the self-styled reformers, the greatest bores of all, who thought that I was forever singing,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Entering {{beneath a}} wide archway, still bearing {{the sign of}} the Bear and Ragged Staff, Lucas led the way into what must {{have been one of the}} courts of offices, for it was {{surrounded}} with buildings and sheds of different heights and sizes, and had on one side a deep trough of stone, fed by a series of water-taps, intended for the use of the stables. The doors of one of these buildings was unlocked by Master Hansen, and Ambrose found himself in what had once perhaps been part of a stable, but had been partitioned off from the rest. There were two stalls, one serving the Dutchman for his living room, the other for his workshop. In one corner stood a white earthenware stove--so new a spectacle to the young forester that he supposed it to be the printing press. A table, shiny with rubbing, a wooden chair, a couple of stools, a few vessels, mirrors for brightness, some chests and corner <b>cupboards,</b> a <b>bed</b> shutting up like a box and likewise highly polished, completed the furniture, all arranged with the marvellous orderliness and neatness of the nation. A curtain shut off the opening to the other stall, where stood a machine with a huge screw, turned by leverage. Boxes of type and piles of paper surrounded it, and Ambrose stood and looked at it with a sort of awe-struck wonder and respect as the great fount of wisdom. Hansen showed him what his work would be, in setting up type, and by and by correcting after the first proof. The machine could only print four pages at a time, and for this operation the whole strength of the establishment was required. Moreover, Master Hansen bound, as well as printed his books. Ambrose was by no means daunted. As long as he might read as well as print, and while he had Sundays at St. Paul's to look to, he asked no more--except indeed that his gentle blood stirred at the notion of acting salesman in the book-stall, and Master Hansen assured him with a smile that Will Wherry, the other boy, would do that better than either of them, and that he would be entirely employed here.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed that}} Trumbull had {{had in his}} {{possession}} over {{a hundred and fifty}} pounds, of which the greater part was in gold, and that he kept this in a money-box in his bedroom. One of the two women who lived in his service,--he himself had been a widower without children,--declared that she had always known that at night he took the box out of his <b>cupboard</b> into <b>bed</b> with him. She had seen it there more than once when she had taken him up drinks when he was unwell. When first interrogated, she declared that she did not remember, at that moment, that she had ever told anybody; she thought she had never told anybody; at last, she would swear that she had never spoken a word about it to a single soul. She {{was supposed to be a}} good girl, had come of decent people, and was well known by Mr. Fenwick, of whose congregation she was one. Her name was Agnes Pope. The other servant was an elderly woman, who had been in the house all her life, but was unfortunately deaf. She had known very well about the money, and had always been afraid about it; had very often spoken to her master about it, but never a word to Agnes. She had been woken in the night,--that was, as it turned out, about 2 A.M.,--by the girl who slept with her, and who declared that she had heard a great noise, as of somebody tumbling,--a very great noise indeed, as though there were ever so many people tumbling. For a long time, for perhaps an hour, they had lain still, being afraid to move. Then the elder woman had lighted a candle, and gone down from the garret in which they slept. The first thing she saw was the body of her master, in his shirt, upon the stairs. She had then called up the only other human being who slept on the premises, a shepherd, who had lived for thirty years with Trumbull. This man had thrown open the house, and had gone for assistance, and had found the body of the dead dog in the yard.|$|R
50|$|People {{have been}} using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as {{furniture}} {{since the beginning of}} human civilisation. Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia, depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland, and includes <b>cupboards,</b> dressers and <b>beds</b> all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including stools and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, with thrones being commonplace as well as the klinai, multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the Middle Ages was usually heavy, oak, and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded Baroque designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by revival styles. The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards Modernism. One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.|$|R
