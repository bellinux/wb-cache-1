5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> mass and the elevation of the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|Antananarivo is the {{administrative}} capital and largest city of Madagascar. It {{is located in}} the highlands region, near the geographic <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the island. King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga. As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their <b>center</b> <b>of</b> colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants. The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).|$|E
