5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and physicians {{have suggested that}} this condition {{may be the result}} of an underlying <b>connective</b> tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized <b>connective</b> tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common <b>connective</b> tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E

5|$|<b>Connective</b> tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. <b>Connective</b> tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose <b>connective</b> tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous <b>connective</b> tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} attention to <b>connectives</b> {{has led to}} more {{evidence in support of}} their processing benefits for discourse understanding. As Murray(1997) reviewed, psychological experiments have shown that the presence of <b>connectives</b> between adjacent clauses reduces the reading time of the second clause (Haberlandt, 1982; Millis & Just, 1994), enhances memory for the clauses (Caron et al., 1988; but see Millis et al., 1993), increases accuracy in response to comprehension questions, and decreases question-answering time (Millis & Just, 1994). Despite the view that <b>connectives</b> facilitate comprehension, two issues still remain. First, what remains unclear is how different types of <b>connectives</b> impact processing. Research has presented an equivocal picture on this issue. For example, Caron et al. (1988) showed that memory for sentence pairs was improved when because was placed between the sentences, suggesting that causal <b>connectives</b> result in better sentence integration than do additive or adversative <b>connectives.</b> In contrast, Murray (1995) showed that adversative <b>connectives</b> were associated with better memory than were additive and causal <b>connectives.</b> The disagreement of these results is linked to different procedures in how to read any upcoming clauses after <b>connectives.</b> Different classes of <b>connectives</b> are associated with different knowledge bases, each of which consists of potentially differin...|$|R

We argue that this result has immediate implications for the seman-tics of causal relations and for the anno-tation of implicit <b>connectives.</b> In particu-lar, it shows that the assumption, implicit in some work on NLP, that the semantics of explicit <b>connectives</b> can be translated to implicit <b>connectives</b> is not anodyne. ...|$|R
5|$|According to some authors, {{who use the}} {{original}} description by Treitz, the muscle may {{be divided into two}} sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the <b>connective</b> tissue surrounding the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the <b>connective</b> tissue attaching to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the duodenum.|$|E

5|$|The osteoderms (scutes) {{covering}} {{the back of}} Deinosuchus were unusually large, heavy, and deeply pitted; some were of a roughly hemispherical shape. Deep pits and grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for <b>connective</b> tissue. Together, the osteoderms and <b>connective</b> tissue would have served as load-bearing reinforcement to support the massive body of Deinosuchus out of water. These deeply pitted osteoderms {{have been used to}} suggest that, despite its bulk, Deinosuchus could probably have walked on land much like modern-day crocodiles.|$|E

5|$|According to {{more recent}} analyses, in the {{development}} of nemertean embryos, ectomesoderm (outer part of the mesoderm, which is the layer in which most of the internal organs are built) is derived from cells labelled 3a and 3b, and endomesoderm (inner part of the mesoderm) is derived from the 4d cell. Some of the ectomesoderm in annelids, echiurans and molluscs is derived from cells 3a and 3b, while the ectomesoderm of polyclad flatworms is derived from the 2b cell and acoel flatworms produce no ectomesoderm. In nemerteans the space between the epidermis and the gut is mainly filled by well-developed muscles embedded in noncellular <b>connective</b> tissue. This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as polyclads and triclads, but a similar structure of body-wall muscles embedded in noncellular <b>connective</b> tissue is widespread among the Spiralia (animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern) such as sipunculans, echiurans and many annelids.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to automatically identifying the arguments of discourse <b>connectives</b> {{based on data from}} the Penn Discourse Treebank. Of the two arguments of <b>connectives,</b> called Arg 1 and Arg 2, we focus on Arg 1, which has proven more challenging to identify. Our approach employs a sentence-based representation of arguments, and distinguishes intra-sentential <b>connectives,</b> which take both their arguments in the same sentence, from inter-sentential <b>connectives,</b> whose arguments are found in different sentences. The latter are further distinguished by paragraph position into ParaInit <b>connectives,</b> which appear in a paragraph-initial sentence, and ParaNonInit <b>connectives,</b> which appear elsewhere. The paper focusses on predicting Arg 1 of Inter-sentential ParaNonInit <b>connectives,</b> presenting a set of scope-based filters that reduce the search space for Arg 1 from all the previous sentences in the paragraph to a subset of them. For cases where these filters do not uniquely identify Arg 1, coreference-based heuristics are employed. Our analysis shows an absolute 3 % performance improvement over the high baseline of 83. 3 % for identifying Arg 1 of Inter-sentential ParaNonInit <b>connectives.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Existing works {{indicate}} {{that the absence of}} explicit discourse <b>connectives</b> makes it difficult to recognize implicit discourse relations. In this paper we attempt to overcome this difficulty for implicit relation recognition by automatically inserting discourse <b>connectives</b> between arguments {{with the use of a}} language model. Then we propose two algorithms to leverage the information of these predicted <b>connectives.</b> One is to use these predicted implicit <b>connectives</b> as additional features in a supervised model. The other is to perform implicit relation recognition based only on these predicted <b>connectives.</b> Results on Penn Discourse Treebank 2. 0 show that predicted discourse <b>connectives</b> help implicit relation recognition and the first algorithm can achieve an absolute average f-score improvement of 3 % over a state of the art baseline system. ...|$|R

5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the <b>connective</b> tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the <b>connective</b> tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
