30|$|The {{choice between}} protracting work and {{retiring}} depends on various economic and institutional variables, shaping {{the environment in}} which the decision is taken and having to do with regulations in both the labour market and the pension system. These include the pension formula, which characterises the economic pros and cons of the decision and take into account the opportunities/constraints characterising the working career. In the case of a Defined Contribution (DC) with actuarial adjustments, the continuation of work is not penalised and the worker can freely decide according to her personal preferences, possibly mitigated by firm issues, on the one hand, and health status plus family considerations, on the other (Coda Moscarola et al. 2016). When the formula is, instead, of the Defined Benefit (DB) type, favouring steep earning profiles and partly independent of the total amount of paid contributions, the continuation of work generates an implicit tax on the pension wealth, because the increase in the pension benefit does not totally compensate for the additional contributions and the loss of 1  year of pension benefits. This kind of disincentive can be enough to induce workers to withdraw as soon as possible. Another important feature comes from the possibility of combining work and pension. DB pensions are typically associated with stricter limitations on work with respect to the DC ones. In the case of retirement as a binary choice, the worker is either engaged full-time or is a full-time retiree. The DC formula makes the combination of work and pension much easier, and in variable ways, by reducing or <b>canceling</b> <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> for continuing work.|$|R
50|$|It {{was more}} of the same in 2003 for Rossi's rivals when he claimed nine pole {{positions}} as well as nine race wins to claim his third consecutive World Championship, clinching the title in Malaysia. This year, Sete Gibernau became his strongest opponent, beating Rossi several times, although Rossi got the better of Gibernau in the Czech Republic, by just 0.042 seconds. The Australian Grand Prix at Phillip Island is considered by many observers to be one of Rossi's greatest career moments due to unique circumstances. After being given a 10-second penalty for overtaking during a yellow flag due to a crash by Ducati rider Troy Bayliss, front runner Rossi proceeded to pull away {{from the rest of the}} field, eventually finishing more than 15 seconds ahead, more than enough to <b>cancel</b> out <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> and win <b>the</b> race.

In the case of a double-minor (4-minute) <b>penalty,</b> <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> is treated as two consecutive 2-minute <b>penalties.</b> If <b>the</b> opposing team scores, only <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> currently being served is cancelled; if at least one <b>penalty</b> interval remains, <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> clock is reset to reflect this (two minutes if one interval remains, four minutes if two intervals remain) and the player must remain in the box; if less than two minutes remain, <b>the</b> remaining <b>penalty</b> is <b>cancelled</b> and <b>the</b> player is released.

Goaltenders never go to <b>the</b> <b>penalty</b> box even though they are assessed penalty minutes (but they can be ejected and replaced with a substitute).

40|$|In this thesis, I {{study the}} {{influence}} of country-specific institutions on the labour supply decision of prime-aged women. In chapter 1, I use reduced-form methods, to evaluate the impact of wide changes to the benefit system and childcare subsidies targeted at households with pre-school age children in France. I estimate strong responses to maternity leave type benefits, and a positive impact of childcare subsidies on mothers employment rates in the long-run. In chapter 2, I develop and estimate a static labour supply model with part-time wage equations as well as demand-side constraints. I can compare the elasticities estimates and predictions from tax reform simulations to those of models assuming a unique hourly productivity {{and the absence of}} any employment constraint. The structural model also enables me to clearly simulate the impact of each component of the wide policy reform studied in the first chapter. In chapter 3, I try to understand why the number of hours worked by British married women is lower than that of French married women. I find that in the presence of children, British mothers are far more responsive to financial incentives. Husbands’ earnings and their interaction with childcare prices seem to play an important role. Nevertheless, the fall in hours worked in the British households with children, despite facing lower taxes than in France, remains somewhat puzzling. It could be mainly attributed (in the framework used) to different preferences. In the final chapter, I study the impact of joint-taxation on the labour supply choices of married women with working husbands in France. I simulate a revenue-neutral reform that would <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> tax <b>penalty</b> or gain associated with being married. I find that the overall labour supply of these women would increase by 1. 2...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is {{to analyze the}} issue of life imprisonment. This {{punishment}} is in the recently legal order of the Czech Republic the strictest punishment, which is imposed only for the most serious crimes. It is the punishment, which replaced <b>the</b> death <b>penalty</b> in many countries of the world.

My thesis deals not only with the law aspects of this problem, but also discusses the sociological, psychological, moral and economical implications too. The thesis is composed of twelve chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of the issue of life imprisonment. The brief introduction is followed by the chapter about the conception and purpose of the punishment. Chapter Three discusses the problem, if life imprisonment is a sufficient alternative to <b>the</b> <b>cancelled</b> death <b>penalty.</b> After that follows the inevitable chapter about the historical excursion.
