For the opinion task, whose goal is to "uncover the public sentiment towards a given entity/target", we focused on combining multiple sources of evidence to detect opinionated blog postings. Since detecting opinionated blogs on a given topic (i. e., entity/target) involves not only retrieving topically relevant blogs but also identifying those that contain opinions about the target, our approach to the opinion finding task consisted of first applying traditional IR methods to retrieve on-topic blogs and then boosting the ranks of opinionated blogs based on <b>combined</b> <b>opinion</b> scores generated by multiple opinion detection methods. The key idea underlying our opinion detection method is {{to rely on a}} variety of complementary evidences rather than trying to optimize a single approach. This fusion approach to opinionated blog detection is motivated by our past experience that suggested no single approach, whether lexicon-based or classifier-driven, is well-suited for the blog opinion retrieval task. To accomplish the polarity subtask, which requires classification of the retrieved blogs into positive or negative orientation, our opinion detection module was extended to generate polarity scores to be used for polarity determination...|$|E

Aims: To identify variables in practice of FNAC as used for diagnosis of breast lesions and commonly perceived diagnostic significance of cytological features for diagnosis of benign or malignant condition of breast lesions. Materials and Methods: An India-wide questionnaire-based survey of cytopathologists/pathologists′ breast FNAC reporting practices and their opinion on diagnostic significance of cytological features in diagnosis of benign or malignant nature of breast lesion were conducted. Results: Fifty-one experts working with various medical education institutes (~ 52 % of participants), oncological tertiary care centers (~ 28 %) and primary care centers/private diagnostic pathology laboratories (~ 20 %) spread over 13 states of India {{have participated in the}} survey.

40|$|There {{are some}} chronic critics who al-ways {{complain}} about the entity in social media. We are working to automatically detect these chronic critics {{to prevent the spread}} of bad rumors about the reputation of the entity. In social media, most com-ments are informal, and, there are sarcas-tic and incomplete contexts. This means that it is difficult for current NLP technol-ogy such as opinion mining to recognize the complaints. As an alternative approach for social media, we can assume that users who share the same opinions will link to each other. Thus, we propose a method that <b>combines</b> <b>opinion</b> mining with graph analysis for the connections between users to identify the chronic critics. Our ex-perimental results show that the proposed method outperforms analysis based only on opinion mining techniques. ...|$|R

This was true despite receiving identical feedback about the accuracy of past judgments. Second, why do people consistently tend to overweight their own opinions at the expense of profitable advice? We compared two prominent explanations for this, differential access to reasons and egocentric beliefs, and found that neither adequately accounts for the overweighting of the self.
