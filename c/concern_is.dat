5|$|Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> {{the fact}} that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> {{the risk}} of {{clearing}} rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production, such as the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Cerrado. Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000km from the Amazon, and expansion during the last 25 years {{took place in the}} Center-South region, also far away from the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In São Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands. The impact assessment commissioned by the Dutch government supported this argument.|$|E
5|$|Archaea show {{high levels}} of {{horizontal}} gene transfer between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to/from cells with less-related genomes, as in the genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies in Halorubrum found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. A second <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> to what extent such species designations have practical meaning.|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{advanced}} separation of concerns, most researches focus on programming levels. On the other hand, many analysis/design techniques utilize separation of <b>concerns,</b> as it <b>is</b> {{one of the common}} techniques in the software engineering field. Though the utilization of these <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> slightly different from that in programming level techniques dealing with advanced separation of <b>concerns,</b> it <b>is</b> important to recognize what kinds of <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> used in the analysis/design field, and to clarify the current issues. In this paper, we analyze the concerns in the analysis/design field, observe the current status of separation of concerns, and discuss issues and future research directions. 1. CONCERNS IN ANALYSIS/DESIGN TECHNIQUES Separation of <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> one of the basic techniques in software engineering fields, and many analysis/design techniques apply the technique. Though their utilization of <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> not as same as that of advanced separation of <b>concerns</b> [2][3], it <b>is</b> important to analyze the existing concerns and clarify the difference for further researches.

5|$|The {{drilling}} {{project has}} been opposed by some environmental groups and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact. The main <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> that the lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the bore hole from refreezing. Scientists of the United States National Research Council have taken the position {{that it should be}} assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.|$|E
5|$|Using {{actinides}} {{in nuclear}} fuel, sealed radioactive sources or advanced {{materials such as}} self-glowing crystals has many potential benefits. However, a serious <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> the extremely high radiotoxicity of actinides and their migration in the environment. Use of chemically unstable forms of actinides in MOX and sealed radioactive sources is not appropriate by modern safety standards. There {{is a challenge to}} develop stable and durable actinide-bearing materials, which provide safe storage, use and final disposal. A key need is application of actinide solid solutions in durable crystalline host phases.|$|E

As one of the registrants said, the stigma that existed during this time made the participant feel “dirty… like...a lower minority than most minorities” (19). Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> that HIV/AIDS would interfere with individuals seeking sexreassignment surgery.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the direct activation of relational versus instrumental concerns affects reactions to {{decisions made by}} an authority. It is demonstrated that when instrumental <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> experimentally induced, people's evaluations of the authority (Studies 1 and 2) {{as well as their}} intentions to protest (Study 3) are more strongly affected by how the procedures used by the authority affect anticipated outcomes (i. e., whether procedures are favorably or unfavorably inaccurate) than when relational <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> activated. By contrast, authority evaluations (Study 2) and protest intentions (Study 3) are more strongly affected by whether procedures used are fair (accurate) or unfair (inaccurate) when relational (versus instrumental) <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> activated. These findings extend previous research where relational versus instrumental <b>concerns</b> <b>were</b> inferred, but not directly examined, to explain differences in responses to authorities' decisions...|$|R
40|$|Separation of <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> a {{fundamental}} principle of software engineering. Of course, <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> modeled {{in a variety}} of guises in contemporary software development, but the modeling approaches used typically depend on the development method, development stage, artifact formalism, and other project-specific factors. Concerns in various representations are also the focus of aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) techniques. However, <b>concerns</b> as such <b>are</b> still not modeled independently, and concernmodeling is still not a distinguished activity in software development. In this chapter we argue that <b>concerns</b> must <b>be</b> first-class entities and <b>concern</b> modeling must <b>be</b> a first-class activity in AOSD. That <b>is,</b> <b>concern</b> modeling should <b>be</b> an explicit and integral part of AOSD methods, and <b>concerns</b> should <b>be</b> modeled in their own appropriate formalisms, separately from their representations in requirements, design, code, and other software artifacts. We discuss the meaning of concern and consider the characteristic...|$|R
5|$|Another area of <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> California, where {{recovery}} {{began to}} fluctuate or {{decline in the}} late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E
5|$|Pesticides are {{formulated}} to kill pests, {{but many}} have detrimental effects on non-target species; of particular <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> {{the damage done}} to honey-bees, solitary bees and other pollinating insects and in this regard, the time of day when the spray is applied can be important. The widely used neonicotinoids have been banned on flowering crops in some countries because of their effects on bees. Some pesticides may cause cancer and other health problems in humans, as well as being harmful to wildlife. There can be acute effects immediately after exposure or chronic effects after continuous low-level, or occasional exposure. Maximum residue limits for pesticides in foodstuffs and animal feed are set by many nations.|$|E
