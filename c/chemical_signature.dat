5|$|In 2007, a {{hypothesis}} was put forth that argued the impactor {{that killed the}} dinosaurs belonged to the Baptistina family of asteroids. Concerns have been raised regarding the reputed link, in part because very few solid observational constraints exist of the asteroid or family. Indeed, it was recently discovered that 298 Baptistina does not share the same <b>chemical</b> <b>signature</b> {{as the source of}} the K–Pg impact. Although this finding may make the link between the Baptistina family and K–Pg impactor more difficult to substantiate, it does not preclude the possibility. A 2011 Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, (WISE), study of reflected light from the asteroids of the family estimated the break-up at 80Ma, giving it insufficient time to shift orbits and impact the Earth by 66Ma.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNestmate {{recognition}} codes show remarkable chemical complexity, involving multiple biochemical pathways. This complexity {{provides the}} opportunity to evaluate the ecological and social conditions that favor the evolution of complex signaling. We investigated how the <b>chemical</b> <b>signatures</b> of three populations of the social paper wasp Polistes biglumis differed in terms of concentration of hydrocarbons, proportions of branched hydrocarbons and overall variation. We tested whether the variation in <b>chemical</b> <b>signatures</b> among populations {{could be explained by}} the prevalence of social parasites or whether this was just an effect of local abiotic conditions which influenced the composition of the hydrocarbon cuticular layer. We studied the chemical signa-ture in three populations in which obligate social parasites differed in the selection pressures they imposed on host populations. Within each population, we restricted our analyses to non-parasitized hosts, to avoid potential short-term effects of parasite pres-ence on the host <b>chemical</b> <b>signatures.</b> We found that host colonies in parasitized populations had more diverse profiles than the parasite-free population. Moreover, the overall concentration of hydrocarbons and the relative proportion of branched hydrocar-bons were larger in the parasitized populations, relative to the non-parasitized one. This is to our knowledge the first evidence in favour of the hypothesis that different traits in the host <b>chemical</b> <b>signatures</b> as a whole undergo evolutionary changes resulting from directional or balancing selection imposed by social parasites. We conclude that obligate social parasites act as 'engines of diversity' on host <b>chemical</b> <b>signatures</b> and operate in favor of a geographic mosaic of diverging communication codes [Current Zoology 60 (1) : 137  148, 2014]...|$|R

25|$|Modelling {{indicates}} {{a system where}} andesitic melts coming from the mantle rise through the crust and generate a zone of mafic volcanism. Increases in the melt flux and thus heat and volatile input causes partial melting of the crust, forming a layer containing melts reaching down to the Moho that inhibits the ascent of mafic magmas because of its higher buoyancy. Instead, melts generated in this zone eventually reach the surface, generating felsic volcanism. Some mafic magmas escape sideward after stalling in the melt containing zone; these generate more mafic volcanic systems {{at the edge of}} the felsic volcanism, such as Cerro Bitiche. The magmas are mixtures of crust derived and mafic mantle-derived melts with a consistent petrological and <b>chemical</b> <b>signature.</b> The melt generation process may involve several different layers in the crust.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} fully take control and {{integrate}} {{themselves into the}} host colony, the P. atrimandibularis queen needs to alter her distinct chemical order, as to not get rejected by the hosts. Before invading host colonies, the parasites have a species-specific epicuticular signature: unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes), which are absent in host species. After the invasion, these alkenes start decreasing in the parasite epicuticular profiles, and compounds abundant in the host <b>chemical</b> <b>signature</b> start increasing. Within one month, when the host workers emerge, the female P. atrimandibularis’s <b>chemical</b> <b>signature</b> perfectly mimics the host signature. At this point the parasites and host foundress are chemically indistinguishable.

The aim of these studies was twofold: (1) to investigate whether frontal circulations can transport ozone from the boundary layer to the free troposphere in well-defined layer; and (2) to ascertain whether or not conveyor belts associated with extratropical cyclones exhibit well-defined <b>chemical</b> <b>signatures.</b> The first case study (March 2, 1994) sampled a well-defined ozone-enhanced layer within the free troposphere. It is demonstrated that this air was transferred from the boundary layer to the free troposphere during the development of a baroclinic wave. Two warm conveyor belts sampled within this flight (one associated with the developing baroclinic wave and the other with a mature low-pressure system) displayed clear and contrasting <b>chemical</b> <b>signatures,</b> a consequence of their geographically different origins. During the second case study (April 25, 1994), both the dry intrusion and the warm conveyor belt of a mature, occluded low-pressure system were sampled. Their <b>chemical</b> <b>signatures</b> (in particular, that of the dry intrusion) showed that interleaving of the two airstreams had occurred, probably in the vicinity of the occluded front.
