5000|$|<b>Clomazone</b> {{was first}} {{registered}} by the USEPA on March 8, 1993 and was commercialized by FMC Corporation. It {{is used for}} broadleaf weed control in several crops, including soybeans, peas, maize, oilseed rape, sugar cane, cassava, pumpkins and tobacco. [...] It may be applied pre-emergence of incorporated before planting the crop. <b>Clomazone</b> is relatively volatile (vapor pressure is 19.2 mPa) and vapors induce striking visual symptoms on non-target sensitive plants. <b>Clomazone</b> undergoes biological degradation, exhibiting a soil half life of one to four months. [...] Adsorption of the herbicide to soil solids slows degradation and volatilization. [...] Encapsulation helps reduce volatility and therefore reduces off-target damage to sensitive plants.|$|E

40|$|Echinochloa phyllopogon (late watergrass) {{is a major}} weed of California rice (Oryza sativa) {{that has}} evolved {{cytochrome}} P 450 -mediated metabolic resistance to different herbicides with multiple modes of action. E. phyllopogon populations from Sacramento Valley rice fields have also recently shown resistance to the herbicide <b>clomazone.</b> <b>Clomazone</b> is a proherbicide that must be metabolized to 5 -ketoclomazone, which is the active compound that inhibits deoxyxylulose 5 -phosphate synthase, a key enzyme of the nonmevalonate isoprenoid pathway. This study evaluated the differential <b>clomazone</b> metabolism within strains {{of the same species}} to investigate whether enhanced oxidative metabolism also confers <b>clomazone</b> resistance in E. phyllopogon. Using reverse-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry techniques in the multireaction monitoring mode, we elucidated that oxidative biotransformations are involved as a mechanism of <b>clomazone</b> resistance in this species. E. phyllopogon plants hydroxylated mostly the isoxazolidinone ring of <b>clomazone,</b> and <b>clomazone</b> hydroxylation activity was greater in resistant than in susceptible plants. The major <b>clomazone</b> metabolites resulted from monohydroxylation and dihydroxylation of the isoxazolidinone ring. Resistant plants accumulated 6 - to 12 -fold more of the monohydroxylated metabolite than susceptible plants, while susceptible plants accumulated 2. 5 -fold more of the phytotoxic metabolite of <b>clomazone,</b> 5 -ketoclomazone. Our results demonstrate that oxidative metabolism endows multiple-herbicide-resistant E. phyllopogon with cross-resistance to <b>clomazone</b> through enhanced herbicide degradation and lower accumulation of the toxic metabolite in resistant versus susceptible plants...|$|E

Merr.) seedlings. The order of species sensitivity was velvetleaf > spinach > barley > soybean. <b>Clomazone</b> (100 micromolar) {{did not affect}} the in vitro activities of spinach isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase or prenyl transferase. <b>Clomazone</b> also {{did not affect the}} synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate from mevalonic acid. Thus, <b>clomazone</b> had no direct in vitro effect on the synthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate from mevalonic acid. Greening seedlings of both soybean and velvetleaf metabolized <b>clomazone.</b> No qualitative differences in the metabolites were detected between soybean and velvetleaf. Thus, differential metabolism of <b>clomazone</b> to a toxic chemical that inhibits terpenoid synthesis is unlikely. <b>Clomazone</b> has either a mode of action not yet identified or a metabolite that is selective in that it is much more active in sensitive than tolerant species...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>clomazone</b> herbicide on oxidative stress biomarkers and acetylcholinesterase activity in human erythrocytes in in vitro conditions. The activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as well as the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured in human erythrocytes exposed (in vitro) to <b>clomazone</b> at varying concentrations in the range of 0, 100, 250 and 500 µg/L for 1 h at 37 °C. TBARS levels were significantly higher in erythrocytes incubated with <b>clomazone</b> at 100, 250 and 500 µg/L. However, erythrocyte CAT and AChE activities were decreased at all concentrations tested. SOD activity was increased only at 100 µg/L of <b>clomazone.</b> GSH levels did not change with <b>clomazone</b> exposure. These results clearly showed <b>clomazone</b> to induce oxidative stress and AChE inhibition in human erythrocytes (in vitro).

40|$|O herbicida <b>clomazone</b> é utilizado para controle de poáceas na cultura do arroz irrigado. Porém, sua dose de registro para essa cultura não proporciona controle eficiente para determinadas espécies de plantas daninhas. Assim, há a necessidade de elevar sua dose para melhorar a eficácia sobre estas espécies. A seletividade do <b>clomazone</b> no arroz irrigado está condicionada ao tipo de solo, à dose do herbicida e a {{cultivar}} semeada, necessitando-se o uso de protetor de plantas quando se praticam altas doses de <b>clomazone.</b> Entretanto, há a necessidade de adequar esses fatores para melhor uso da tecnologia. Em vista do exposto, instalaram-se dois experimentos em casa de vegetação. O primeiro, com o objetivo de quantificar a seletividade de doses de <b>clomazone</b> em solo com característica arenosa e argilosa e verificar a ação do protetor de plantas dietholate sobre cultivares de arroz. O segundo experimento objetivou verificar se o organofosforado phorate proporciona efeito protetor semelhante àquele proporcionado pelo dietholate. Os resultados permitiram concluir que as cultivares IRGA 409 e IRGA 417 são igualmente sensíveis ao <b>clomazone,</b> e respondem igualmente aos tratamentos com dietholate. Tanto no solo arenoso como no solo argiloso, o dietholate como tratamento de sementes permitiu aumento da dose de <b>clomazone</b> em até três vezes a dose em relação ao tratamento sem dietholate. O phorate apresenta papel protetor na cultivar de arroz IRGA 417, contra a ação do herbicida <b>clomazone,</b> de forma equivalente ao protetor dietholate. <b>Clomazone</b> is a herbicide {{used for}} grass weed control in paddy rice.

Though, it is necessary to adjust those factors for better use of this technology. For this reason, it were conducted two greenhouse experiments, the first with the objective of quantify the selectivity of <b>clomazone</b> in sand and clay soils, to quantify the protection of the dietholate on rice plants in these soil conditions. The second experiment had the objective of verify if phorate provides similar protective effect as dietholate provides for <b>clomazone.</b> The results allowed to conclude that the cultivars IRGA 409 and IRGA 417 are equally sensible to <b>clomazone.</b> In regards of soil type, <b>clomazone</b> cause higher injury to rice cultivated in sandy soil. The application of dietholate allows the increase of dose of <b>clomazone.</b> As much in the sandy soil as in the clay soil, dietholate as treatment of seeds allowed increase of the dose of <b>clomazone</b> in up to three times the dose in relation to the treatment without dietholate.

Whole-plant change in fresh weight and B-carotene concentrations were measured. For growth, the No Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) were 7. 9, 0. 21, 0. 21, 0. 46, and 0. 46 µM <b>clomazone</b> for rice, EWG (R), EWG (S), LWG (R), and LWG (S), respectively, while the concentrations causing 25 % inhibition in response (IC 25 s) were 5. 6, 0. 46, 0. 42, 0. 92 and 0. 79 µM <b>clomazone,</b> respectively. For rice, EWG (R), EWG (S), LWG (R), and LWG (S), the B-carotene NOECs were 0. 21, < 0. 08, < 0. 08, 0. 08 and 0. 46 µM <b>clomazone,</b> respectively and IC 25 s were 0. 42, 0. 08, 0. 08, 0. 33 and 0. 54 µM, respectively. At a field-relevant <b>clomazone</b> application rate resistance to <b>clomazone</b> was observed in EWG (R) and LWG (R) as measured by growth and B-carotene, respectively. Due to similar sensitivity between rice and late watergrass, use of <b>clomazone</b> in rice culture may {{require the use of}} a safening technique. Rice and EWG (S) were exposed to 14 C-labeled <b>clomazone</b> to determine accumulation, biotransformation and mass balance. In terms of extractable 14 C, rice contained more total residues than EWG (p < 0. 05), but the concentration in EWG was significantly higher (p < 0. 01). More metabolized residue was measured in EWG compared to rice (p < 0. 01). Both species produced hydroxylated forms of <b>clomazone,</b> B-D-glucoside conjugates, and unidentified polar metabolites. The suspected active metabolite, 5 -ketoclomazone, was found at a significantly higher concentration in EWG vs. rice (21 ± 2 vs. 5. 7 ± 0. 5 pmol g- 1, respectively; p < 0. 01). Qualitatively and quantitatively, more <b>clomazone</b> metabolism was observed in the relatively sensitive EWG compared to rice. R and S biotypes of EWG and LWG were exposed to <b>clomazone</b> alone and in combination with P 450 inhibitors. Growth reduction (GR 25, GR 50, and GR 75) values were lower for S biotypes than for R biotypes (p < 0. 05) with exposure to <b>clomazone</b> alone indicating resistance to <b>clomazone</b> in the R biotypes. In combination with <b>clomazone</b> disulfoton increased 20 -d growth in LWG (R) by as much as 5 -fold, compared to application of <b>clomazone</b> alone.

Although a 10 micromolar <b>clomazone</b> treatment did not significantly reduce the terpene or mixed terpenoid content (microgram per gram fresh weight) of the SB-M cell line, there was over a 70 % reduction in the chlorophyll (Chl), carotenoid (CAR), and plastoquinone (PQ) content of the COT-M cell line. The tocopherol (TOC) content was reduced only 35. 6 %. Reductions in the levels of Chl, CAR, TOC, and PQ indicate that the site of <b>clomazone</b> action in COT-M cells is prior to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). The <b>clomazone</b> treatment did not significantly reduce the flow of [14 C]mevalonate ([14 C]MEV) (nanocuries per gram fresh weight) into CAR and the three mixed terpenoid compounds of SB-M cells. Conversely, [14 C]MEV incorporation into CAR and the terpene moieties of Chl, PQ, and TOC in COT-M cells was reduced at least 73 %, indicating that the site of <b>clomazone</b> action must be after MEV. Sequestration of <b>clomazone</b> away from the chloroplast cannot account for soybean tolerance to <b>clomazone</b> since chloroplasts isolated from both cell lines incubated with [14 C]clomazone contained a similar amount of radioactivity (disintegrations per minute per microgram of Chl).

The half-lives for <b>clomazone</b> degradation in paddy soils ranged from 5. 7 to 22. 0 d. The order of <b>clomazone</b> dissipation rate was reddish yellow paddy soil > alluvial sandy paddy soil > yellow clayey paddy soil > purple sandy paddy soil. <b>Clomazone</b> sorption quantity was significantly correlated with organic carbon (R- 2 = 0. 62) and clay content (R- 2 = 0. 67) in the tested paddy soils.

40|$|<b>Clomazone</b> is a {{carotenoid}} biosynthesis inhibitor {{commonly used}} as a preemergence and postemergence herbicide in rice for the control of grass weeds. Rice injury can occur and symptoms are often associated with soil characteristics and environmental conditions. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate how environmental conditions and planting density influence <b>clomazone</b> injury in rice plants. Also, different fertility treatments were assessed to determine if remediation from <b>clomazone</b> injury occurred. Field studies were conducted in 2008 and 2009 to determine the role of planting date, planting density and soil characteristics on <b>clomazone</b> injury in rice plants. Also, another field study was conducted in 2010 to assess any <b>clomazone</b> injury remediation benefits selected fertility treatments might have in rice cropping systems. In the 2008 and 2009 field studies, hybrid rice was seeded at three densities that comprised a range of slightly lower, slightly higher and commonly recommended planting rates. Two planting dates, March and April, were a test parameter to simulate early and optimal planting dates. Two locations with different soil characteristics, near Eagle Lake and Beaumont, TX, were the study sites. <b>Clomazone</b> herbicide treatments were applied at different rates and timings following planting. Visual injury ratings and yield data were collected during this two-year, two location study. <b>Clomazone</b> injury in rice was more severe in the coarse-textured soils planted at the early, March planting date near Eagle Lake. Visual injury ratings as high as 90 % were observed in some plots. Injury was less severe in the April planting date near Eagle Lake, and at both planting timings near Beaumont. In both locations, <b>clomazone</b> injury did not translate into yield loss at any seeding rate or planting timing. In 2010, field studies were conducted near Eagle Lake and Ganado, TX to assess fertility-based <b>clomazone</b> injury remediation. In one experiment, hybrid rice plots were subject to linearly increasing rates of <b>clomazone</b> herbicide to produce a standard curve of <b>clomazone</b> injury. In the second experiment, a uniform, label rate of <b>clomazone</b> was applied to induce injury for the assessment of the effect of fertility amendments on clomazone-injured rice. Fertility treatments consisted of nitrogen-based fertilizers and foliar-applied iron sulfate and magnesium sulfate. Visual injury ratings, plant height, and yield were collected during the study.

40|$|The {{photodegradation}} of the herbicide <b>clomazone</b> in {{the presence}} of S(2) O(8) (2 -) or of humic substances of different origin was investigated. A value of (9. 4 +/- 0. 4) x 10 (8) m(- 1) s(- 1) was measured for the bimolecular rate constant for the reaction of sulfate radicals with <b>clomazone</b> in flash-photolysis experiments. Steady state photolysis of peroxydisulfate, leading to the formation of the sulfate radicals, {{in the presence}} of <b>clomazone</b> was shown to be an efficient photodegradation method of the herbicide. This is a relevant result regarding the in situ chemical oxidation procedures involving peroxydisulfate as the oxidant. The main reaction products are 2 -chlorobenzylalcohol and 2 -chlorobenzaldehyde. The degradation kinetics of <b>clomazone</b> was also studied under steady state conditions induced by photolysis of Aldrich humic acid or a vermicompost extract (VCE). The results indicate that singlet oxygen is the main species responsible for <b>clomazone</b> degradation. The quantum yield of O(2) (a(1) Delta(g)) generation (lambda = 400 nm) for the VCE in D(2) O, Phi(Delta) = (1. 3 +/- 0. 1) x 10 (- 3), was determined by measuring the O(2) (a(1) Delta(g)) phosphorescence at 1270 nm. The value of the overall quenching constant of O(2) (a(1) Delta(g)) by <b>clomazone</b> was found to be (5. 7 +/- 0. 3) x 10 (7) m(- 1) s(- 1) in D(2) O. The bimolecular rate constant for the reaction of <b>clomazone</b> with singlet oxygen was k(r) = (5. 4 +/- 0. 1) x 10 (7) m(- 1) s(- 1), which means that the quenching process is mainly reactive.

Soybean and cotton on a whole plant level are tolerant and susceptible to <b>clomazone,</b> respectively. Preliminary studies indicated that I 50 values for growth, chlorophyll (Chl), β-carotene, and lutein were, respectively, > 22, 14, 19, and 23 times greater for the soybean cell line (SB-M) 8 days after treatment (DAT) compared to the cotton cell line (COT-M) 16 DAT. Differences in [14 C]clomazone uptake cannot account for selectivity since there were significantly greater levels of <b>clomazone</b> absorbed by the SB-M cells compared to the COT-M cells for each treatment. The percentage of absorbed <b>clomazone</b> converted to more polar metabolite(s) was significantly greater by the SB-M cells relative to COT-M cells at 6 and 24 hours after treatment, however, only small differences existed between the cell lines by 48 hours after treatment. Nearly identical levels of parental <b>clomazone</b> was recovered from both cell lines for all treatments.

40|$|<b>Clomazone</b> is an {{effective}} herbicide widely used for preemergence grass control in rice. However, use of <b>clomazone</b> on sandy textured soils of the western Texas rice belt may cause serious rice injury. When labeled for rice in 2001, sandy textured soils were excluded. Laboratory experiments were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of soil characteristics and water potential on plant-available <b>clomazone</b> and rice injury. A centrifugal double-tube technique was used to determine plant-available concentration in soil solution (ACSS), total amount available in soil solution (TASS), and Kd values for <b>clomazone</b> on four soils at four water potentials. A rice bioassay was conducted parallel to the plant-available study to correlate biological availability to ACSS, TASS, and Kd. TASS was significantly different in all soils at the 1 % level of significance. The order of increasing TASS for the soils studied was Morey Edna Nada Crowley which correlated well with soil characteristics. Two field experiments at three locations were conducted in 2002 and 2003 to determine the optimum rate range that maximizes weed control and minimizes crop injury across a wide variety of soil textures and planting dates. At Beaumont, Eagle Lake, and Ganado, TX, preemergence application of 0. 41 to 0. 56, 0. 38 to 0. 43, and 0. 36 to 0. 42 kg ha- 1 <b>clomazone,</b> respectively, provided optimum weed control with minimal rice injury. Data suggests that <b>clomazone</b> is safe to use on rice on sandy textured soils. Injury may occur, but, rates suggested from this research will minimize injury and achieve excellent weed control.

40|$|ABSTRACT Knowledge of {{herbicides}} sorption by colloids predicts its {{movement in}} the soil profile and its effectiveness in controlling weeds and crops poisoning when directly applied to the soil. This knowledge becomes even more important for herbicides which have long persistence in the soil. In this research, <b>clomazone</b> sorption was estimated by the biological method in Brazilian soil samples with different physical and chemical characteristics, cultivated with sugarcane crops. As {{an indicator of the}} presence of <b>clomazone</b> in the soil, Sorghum bicolor was used. The data relating to assessments of poisoning and accumulation of dry matter of the plants were subjected to multivariate analysis of similarity among variables. After that, <b>clomazone</b> doses that caused 50 % of intoxication in sorghum plants grown (C 50) as well as sorption ratio (SR) of the herbicide in different soil types were estimated. There was similarity greater than 80 % for data regarding the percentage of intoxication and accumulated dry matter, with the option to use only those related to the first variable. RS and C 50 were higher in Organosol and lower in red-yellow Latosol with and without changing the pH. It was concluded that the <b>clomazone</b> dose to be recommended must be differentiated for different soils, since the value of <b>clomazone</b> sorption in the soil is dependent on its attributes, and the organic matter content is of the utmost importance...|$|E
