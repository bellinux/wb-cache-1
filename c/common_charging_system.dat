40|$|The {{design of}} an {{efficient}} <b>charging</b> management <b>system</b> for on-the-move Electric Vehicles (EVs) {{has become an}} emerging research problem, in future connected vehicle applications given their mobility uncertainties. Major technical challenges here involve decision-making intelligence for the selection of Charging Stations (CSs), {{as well as the}} corresponding communication infrastructure for necessary information dissemination between the power grid and mobile EVs. In this article, we propose a holistic solution that aims to create high impact on the improvement of end users' driving experiences (e. g., to minimize EVs' charging waiting time during their journeys) and charging efficiency at the power grid side. Particularly, the CS-selection decision on where to charge is made by individual EVs for privacy and scalability benefits. The communication framework is based on a mobile Publish/Subscribe (P/S) paradigm to efficiently disseminate CSs condition information to EVs on-the-move. In order to circumvent the rigidity of having stationary Road Side Units (RSUs) for information dissemination, we promote the concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) by exploiting the mobility of public transportation vehicles (e. g. buses) to bridge the information flow to EVs, given their opportunistic encounters. We analyze various factors affecting the possibility for EVs to access CSs information via opportunistic Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) communications, and also demonstrate the advantage of introducing buses as mobile intermediaries for information dissemination, based on a <b>common</b> EV <b>charging</b> management <b>system</b> under the Helsinki city scenario. We further study the feasibility and benefit of enabling EVs to send their charging reservations involved for CS-selection logic, via opportunistically encountered buses as well. Results show this advanced management system improves both performances at CS and EV sides...|$|R

A magnetic resonance imaging-derived and high-resolution model of the human body is used. An exposure assessment of a representative wireless inductive <b>charging</b> <b>system,</b> under a limited set of operating conditions, is provided to estimate the induced EMFs. The numerical analysis is performed with the finite element method. Numerical modeling of the system next to a standing human model shows that the EM exposure limits can be absolutely satisfied even when the transmitter coil is very close to the body. Furthermore, the worst configuration for the exposure evaluation of the wireless <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> is taken into consideration. This paper provides a useful guideline for the industry to develop inductive <b>charging</b> <b>systems</b> following the safety standards of radiation protection...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a 5 kW inductive <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> for electric vehicles (EVs). Over 90 % efficiency is maintained from grid to battery across a wide range of coupling conditions at full load. Experimental measurements show that the magnetic field strength meets the stringent International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for human safety. In addition, a new dual side control scheme is proposed to optimize system level efficiency. Experimental validation showed that a 7 % efficiency increase and 25 % loss reduction under light load conditions is achievable. The authors believe this paper is the first to show such high measured efficiencies for a level 2 inductive <b>charging</b> <b>system.</b> Performance of this order would indicate that inductive <b>charging</b> <b>systems</b> are reasonably energy efficient when compared to the efficiency of plug-in <b>charging</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{wireless}} <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> now {{becomes one}} of the emerging technologies especially {{in the application of}} communication systems and beneficial to the wireless electronic appliances. Among them are mobile phones, cameras, personal digital assistance (PDA), cooler, torchlight and drill. Those wireless devices require battery to store and provide power before the device can be used. Hence, in order {{to solve the problem of}} short life of the battery of mobile phone, this project proposes adding a solar <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> base on inductive coupling method to the mobile phone to improve the usage of mobile phone in term of standby time, talk-time, online applications and power consumption especially in the remote area. Inductive coupling is among the effective method in wireless <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> to <b>charge</b> electronics device and reduce the constraint of the power cord or wired system. Meanwhile, solar cell is among the energy harvesting devices that is widely employed in many electronics application. The outcome of the project describes the comparison of the power consumption between the wire <b>charging</b> <b>systems</b> with solar-based wireless <b>charging</b> <b>system.</b> From the analysis of the results, solar-powered mobile phone with inductive coupling produced 21 h 46 min standby time after charging for 13 h 15 min compared to the existing <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> (wired system) which produce 17 h 5 min standby time after charging for 2 h 30 min. In addition, proposed system has high power consumption in term of standby time, talk-time and online application. Based on the results of the project, it could suggest that the wireless solar-powered mobile phone can replace the existing <b>charging</b> <b>system</b> in term of standby time...|$|R
