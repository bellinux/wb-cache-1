The Philippine advertising industry adopted an Advertising Code of Ethics essentially to promote efficiency in processing applications and resolution cases and avoid costly litigation in regular courts. The earliest Advertising Code of Ethics {{dates back to}} the Philippine Board of Advertising (PBA) established in 1974. In 1989, the PBA was renamed Advertising Board of the Philippines (ADBOARD) and was mandated by the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 7394 or The Consumer Protection Act to ensure that all advertising materials conform to its Code of Ethics. The ADBOARD Advertising Content & Regulations Committee (ACRC) had been the main implementing arm of advertising self-regulation in the Philippines until March 31, 2008, when the Ad Standards Council (ASC) took over this function.

Processing alfalfa to obtain value added products includes three different fractionation methods: 1) wet fractionation; separation into juice fraction and a fiber fraction, 2) dry fractionation; separation into leaves and stems, and 3) fractionation by passage of the whole herbage through the digestive systems of ruminant animals, leaving a high fiber residue. Phytase from transgenic alfalfa has been tested in poultry and swine rations. Chicks supplemented with phytase from transgenic alfalfa juice or leaf meal had growth equal to chicks fed phosphorus supplemented rations. The manure from these chicks supplemented with alfalfa phytase contained {{less than half the}} phosphorus levels of manure from chicks fed inorganic phosphorus supplements. The economic value of phytase alfalfa product could generate $ 750 to $ 1500 /A income from alfalfa grown in the Midwest. Alfalfa hay can be fractionated to yield stems and leaf meal. Alfalfa leaf meal {{has been shown to be}} acceptable supplement to replace a portion of alfalfa hay and soybean meal in diets of lactating dairy cattle, replace protein supplement in beef cow diets, finishing steer diets and diets of growing turkeys. Current energy costs in this <b>country</b> <b>limit</b> the use of alfalfa stems to generate electricity from gasification. The fiber portion of alfalfa can produce lactic acid and ethanol. The fiber from alfalfa manure has yielded press board and water filters capable of removing heavy metals from contaminated water...|$|E
40|$|Burkina Faso is a {{landlocked}} country {{south of the}} Sahara Desert. Much of northern Burkina Faso lies in the Sahel zone at {{the fringe of the}} Sahara. The climatic and agroecological zones change from near desert in the north via a central plateau zone into areas of wooded savanna in the south. Annual rainfall increases from less than 200 mm in the north to 1, 100 mm in the south of the country. Burkina Faso’s economy is largely founded on agricultural and livestock based production. In 1999, the agricultural sector accounted for 31 % of the GDP and provided a livelihood to more than 90 % of the population. Crop production is mainly at the subsistence level, but some larger farms cultivate cotton for export. The agro-pastoral land use system is based largely on the production of pearl millet, sorghum, cowpeas and groundnuts. The main soil productivity constraints on the predominantly sandy acid soils are related to climatic conditions and nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies (Bationo et al. 1998, 1992). Unpredictable rainfall distribution patterns in the north of the <b>country</b> <b>limit</b> the growth of the main cereals, millet and sorghum. In the central plateau zone where millet, sorghum and maize are grown, the pressure on soils is the greatest (Teboh et al. 1997). Degradation of soils is largely related to water and wind erosion as well as nutrient removal. Regional soil nutrient balances for the period 1979 - 1988 show that annual nutrient removal without replacement are approximately 23 kg/ha of N, 5 kg/ha of P 2 O 5, and 16 kg/ha of K 2 O (Teboh et al. 1997). Mining only accounts for a small amount of Burkina Faso’s GDP. The main mineral commodity produced is gold, much of which is extracted by the approximately 60, 000 - 70, 000 small-scale gold miner...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Yerel yönetimlerin önemi bütün dünyada her geçen gün artmaktadır. Yerel halkın ortak ihtiyaçlarını karşılamak amacıyla özerk kamu tüzel kişileri olarak kurulmuş olan yerel yönetimler, demokrasinin olgunlaşmasında ve yerleşmesinde son derece önemli roller üstlenmişlerdir. Bunda en önemli etken yerel yönetimlerin yerel hizmetleri daha iyi karşılayabilme avantajlarının ve demokrasinin gelişmesinde oynadığı etkin rolün anlaşılması olmuştur. Bu nedenle yerel yönetimler, yerine getirmiş oldukları hizmetler ve ülkenin demokratikleşmesi açısından büyük önem taşımaktadırlar. Türkiye‟de planlı dönemden beri gerek merkezi yönetimin gerekse yerel yönetimlerin idari yapılarını ve işleyişlerini düzenleyen birçok idari reform projesi uygulanmasına rağmen yerel yönetimlerin plan yapma konusundaki sorunlarını giderecek kapsamlı bir çalışma yapılmamıştır. Türk kamu yönetiminde global dönüşüme paralel olarak gerçekleşen reform, il özel idarelerinin yapısında da önemli bir değişimi beraberinde getirmiştir. Reformla birlikte il özel idarelerinin uzun zamandır sahip olduğu yapıdan, gerek yönetim anlayışı gerekse idari uygulamalar açısından ayrıldığı görülmüştür. İl özel idareleri açısından son dönemlerde yaşanan en önemli, değişim, 3360 sayılı İl Özel İdaresi Kanununun yürürlükten kaldırılıp, 5302 sayılı İl Özel İdaresi Kanununun konulmasıdır. Yeni il özel idaresi kanunu ile il özel idarelerinin kuruluşu, organları, yönetimi, görev, yetki ve sorumlulukları ile çalışma usul ve esasları yeniden düzenlenmiştir. Bu kanun, il özel idareleri için birçok yeniliği de beraberinde getirmiştir. Üst ölçekli planlarda yetki karmaşasından kaynaklı sorunların çözümü için de kararların alındığı 22. 02. 2005 tarih ve 5302 sayılı “İl Özel İdaresi Kanunu” ile il özel idarelerine üst ölçek fiziki plan yapma yetkisi yanında yerel fiziki plan yapma yetkisi de verilmiştir. Yeni kanun ile belediye sınırı ve mücavir alan sınırı dışında kalan alanlarda “Uygulama İmar Planı ve Nazım İmar Planı” yapma yetkisine sahipken, il sınırında ise İl Çevre Düzeni Planı” yapma yetkisini elde etmiştir. Bu çalışma, yerel yönetimlerin bir ayağı olan il özel idarelerinin söz konusu yeni düzenlemelerle ilgili olarak; sürece adaptasyonu ve sorunların üstesinden gelip, elindeki yetkiyi tam anlamıyla kullanıp kullanamadığının bir araştırmasını içermektedir. İncelemede il özel idareleri ile ilgili teorik bilgiler yer alırken, yapılan alan çalışması ile de çalışmanın pratik kısmı desteklenmiştir. Çalışma yöntemi olarak anket uygulamasına gidilmiştir. İl özel idareleri ve planlama yetkileri konulu, toplamda 20 sorudan oluşan, bir anket hazırlanmıştır. Anket kapsamında ülke sınırı çalışma sınırı olarak kabul edilmiş ve hazırlanan anketler posta yolu ile bütün il özel idarelerine gönderilmiştir. Ülke genelinde katılımın % 70 gibi ciddi bir orana ulaşmış olduğu ankette, İl özel idarelerinin planlamada karar alma süreci, karar merciinin yapısı, eğitim düzeyi, planlama kadrosu, teknik eleman kapasitesi, il özel idareleri ile diğer kamu kurumlarının planlama konusunda ilişkisi, planlama noktasında bu gün gelmiş oldukları nokta, yapılan plan türleri, teşkilat yapısı analiz edilmiştir. The {{importance}} of local governments {{all over the}} world is increasing every day. Local governments which are extremely important role in the maturation of democracy, has been established as an autonomous public entities, In order to meet the common needs of the local population The most important factor in this, the advantages of local governments and its effective role on the development of democracy have been recognized. Since the planned period in Türkey, both the central government and local governments applied to many administrative reform project that regulate the functioning and administrative structures, but there was no any comprehensive study to resolve the planning problems of local governments Held in parallel with the global transformation of the Turkish public administration reform, has brought an important change in the structure of special provincial administrations. In this process, the long-accepted and implemented structures of the special provincial administrations have also changed in terms of understanding of management and administrative practices. The most important change in the recent period from the ponit of view the special provincial administration is the repaeling of the the Special Provincial Administration code numbered 3360 and promulgation of the the special provincial administration code numbered 5302 trought the new special provincial administration code; the establishment, organs, administrations, task, authorizations, responsibilities, working methods and essential were re-organized. This code has brought many novelties and changes for the special provincial administration No. 5302 dated 22. 02. 2005 Special Provincial Administration Law taken decisions for the solution of problems originating from the the upper scale plans of the authority chaos. This law also give authority the special provincial administrations to make local physical plan as well as the upper scale the physical plan. According to law numbered 5302 special provincial administrations have obtained the authority to make Implementation Plan and Main City Plan outside of the municipal boundary and adjacent areas, on the other hand they can also make Provincial Environmental Plan at provincial border. In this study; adaptation process at special provincial administrations had been examined, and the answer of “Can special provincial administration use the full autority that they have” wondered and investigated. The study consist of two part; theorical and practical parts. Theoritical parts informed us about the scope of the low, on the other hands practical part give ideas about how to practice, what special provincial administrations did until today. Restructuring of the special provincial administrations emerge as one of the important changes of Turkish administrative system. The purpose and method of the study are determined in the first chapter of in this study, which named “special provincial administrations and planning authorities, In Turkey”. First chapter gives the methodology, shows how the study developed and what the working hypothesis is. In this study; adaptation process at special provincial administrations had been examined, and the answer of “Can special provincial administration use the full autority that they have” wondered and investigated. The study consist of two part; theorical and practical parts. Theoritical parts informed us about the scope of the low, on the other hands practical part give ideas about how to practice, what special provincial administrations did until today. The method of study is the survey. a questionnaire which named special provincial administrations and the planning authority was designed. 20 questions were prepared on the track. The scope of the survey, <b>country</b> <b>limit</b> has been accepted as study limit and has been sent questionnaires by postal to all the provinces The country participation has reached serious proportion like 70 %. In the survey; decision-making process in planning in the special provincial administrations, the structure of decision-makers, education level of decision-makers, planning staff, capacity of technical staff, planning relationship between the special provincial administrations and other public institutions, the point reached in the planning, types of plan, organizational structure, etc. have been analyzed. In the second chapter, the planning system in Turkey is discussed. Planning system, plan types, hierarchy and authority of planning system were discussed in all three-sub concepts. Types of plans in the planning system that is socio-economic plans, senior fziki plans and local physical plans examined in this sub-headings. Hierarchy and authority of planning system consist of what kind of connection between the plans, when making a plan which other plans become important and include theorical knowledges of which institutions do what kind of plan. Understanding of management and planning system from Turkey mentioned in the third chapter. Management system in Turkey consists of two parts, the first central administration, and the other local administration system. Centralized management and decentralized management is the opposite of each other, but complete each other s weaknesses. For this reason, the form of government cannot completely be neighter a centralized administration nor local administration, may be the dominant one another, but the sysyem must have boht. The fourth chapters, special provincial administrations, which have also been the main subject of study in this chapter are carried out by a unit of local government. In this section, the historical development of the special provincial administrations, organizational structure, organs, financial structure, norms, staff evaluated in this section. In the fifth chapter, special provincial administrations and planning authorities are discussed in details. New special provincial administration law gives authority to make plans. According to this new law, special provincial administrations make the provincial environment plan in the province and development plan in the municipality and adjacent areas outside the boundary. This study has come into being by the new special provincial administrations of Law, which consist of planning authorities. The main subject of this thesis is special provincial administrations and its planning power. Sixth chapter is {{the last part of the}} study, consist of questionnaire survey the special provincial administrations in Turkey. The answers of the questionnaire survey provide researcher to make a good decision for the main hypothesis and sub-hypotheses. In order to Questionnaires were prepared to answer the questions of hypothesis and sub-hypotheses. Scope of the study; firstly, a main hypothesis determined. In addition, four sub-hypotheses were determined, in order to reach the right conclusion about the main hypotheses. Sub-hypotheses discuss the situation about decision making mechanism, organizational structure and staff of the norm, plan status Main hypothesis is as follows: H 0 = Special Provincial Administrations in Turkey, dated 02. 22. 2005 and numbered 5302 Law on Special Provincial Administrations given planning powers of entry into force of the law since 2005, has used effectively. H 1 = Special Provincial Administrations in Turkey, dated 02. 22. 2005 and numbered 5302 Law on Special Provincial Administrations given planning powers of entry into force of the law since 2005,not used effectively. As a result; based on the assumptions of the sub-hypotheses, main hypotheses was rejected. Result of the sub- hypotheses; decision-makers‟ inadequate technical knowledge about planning principles, spending long time to establish planning departmants in provincial private administration, insufficient and inadequate urban planner in special provincial administrations, until today no provincial environmental scheme plan at most of the provinces, local physical planning problems cause of technical deficiencies These results show that, Special provincial administrations in Turkey, dated. 2005 and numbered 5302 Law on Special Provincial Administrations planning powers given to the law coming into force in 2005, not used effectively. Evaluation of their own in the planning system in Turkey, we will accept as the law of planning, the main addition to the Law number 3194, again depending on the law, with a very special purpose registration law was enacted. At this point, the Special Provincial Administration Law No. 5302 is one of them. Within the scope of this law, the most important pillar of the upper scale spatial planning provincial environmental scheme plan construction are given special provincial administrations. With the power of municipalities to plan their almost grown, research findings show that the use of this power lasted special provincial administrations. So main Hypothesis H 0 is rejected within the scope of the research. In the last part of the research, the seven part, the solution proposals are given. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
