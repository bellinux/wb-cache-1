40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the effect of}} {{insulating}} and non-insulating <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> on internal trade in a model of incomplete information. From the perspective of firm-wide profit, the allocation scheme that results in {{the least amount of}} rationing (forgone profitable trade) is the optimal one. If one thinks of internal trade as a form of cooperation, one might expect non-insulating allocations to increase trade. As it turns out, non-insulating <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> may either encourage or discourage internal trade. This is because while the non-insulating scheme imposes a tax on new trade (as does the insulating allocation) it also provides a subsidy on existing trade. The subsidy varies in a non-linear fashion with the transfer price making the comparison of the allocation methods subtle. The broader point is that, in incomplete information environments, whether or not non-insulating <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> encourage cooperation is context-specifi...|$|R

40|$|This study {{documents}} and evaluates {{the effectiveness of}} using a hands-on conceptual model in an active learning environment in a first accounting class. A hands-on model {{that can be used}} to help students learn inventory <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> is described. The model's potential for enhancing student learning is assessed. Three learning scenarios are evaluated. The first is predominately a traditional lecture-oriented approach using numerical examples to illustrate concepts. The second adds the use of a model within a lecture setting. The third uses an active learning approach along with the model. Student performance and preferences are assessed. Students indicate they perceive that the model helped them understand inventory <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> better than solely using numerical examples. Results from an assessment instrument indicate that students who use the model in an active learning environment show enhanced problem-solving skills over that which can be attained in a lecture-oriented environment. There is no evidence, however, that the use of a conceptual hands-on model enhances conceptual recall over that which can be attained in a lecture-oriented environment.

40|$|Activity-based costing (ABC) {{is given}} much {{attention}} in the literature. Most authors seem to agree that improved <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> are useful to indicate the long-term profitability of products. However, a controversy starts when the relevance of ABC for short-term decision-making is discussed. This topic is addressed here {{and some of the}} arguments found in the literature are reviewed. The first objective is to contribute to discussions on the usefulness of ABC for decision-making. In this paper it is suggested that ABC can be relevant for short-term decisions. It is suggested here that particular costs and revenues become controllable by making a particular decision, even if these costs and revenues appear to be uncontrollable a priori. This concept should be considered as a hypothesis which still needs to be tested. The second objective is to contribute to the literature on why managers use <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> for decision-making instead of only controllable costs and revenues. It is discussed that uncertainty about controllable costs and revenues will stimulate a manager to use <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> for decision-making. Allocated costs provide a reference point which helps a manager to resolve how much risk he or she is willing to take. This has been confirmed in an experiment, reported in Wouters (1993) ...|$|R

50|$|The core {{components}} of a <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> system consist {{of a way to}} track which organizations provides a product and/or service, the organizations that consume the products and/or services, and a list of portfolio offerings (e.g. service catalog). Depending on the operating structure within a company, the <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> data may generate an internal invoice or feed an ERP system's chargeback module. Accessing the data via an invoice or chargeback module are the typical methods that drive personnel behavior. In return, the consumption data becomes a great source of quantitative information to make better business decisions. Today’s organizations face growing pressure to control costs and enable responsible financial management of resources. In this environment, an organization is expected to provide services cost-effectively and deliver business value while operating under tight budgetary constraints. One way to contain costs is to implement a <b>cost</b> <b>allocation</b> methodology, where your business units become directly accountable for the services they consume.|$|E

It can also be calculated for a particular route of an airline. However, when it is calculated for anything other than the entire operation of an airline, the relevant costs will inevitably involve <b>cost</b> <b>allocations</b> that require judgments. For instance, the salary of the airline's senior management needs to be spread across the different parts of the airline and can be divvied up across its routes according to many different methodologies—by the number of flights on that route during that time period, by the number of flight hours on that route, etc. There is not necessarily any right method for making such <b>cost</b> <b>allocations,</b> but it is important when making comparisons across airlines that if an allocation methodology is relevant (i.e. less than the entire of each airline is being compared) then the same allocation methodology is used with each airline being compared.|$|R

For instance, economic decisions such as make-or-buy, capacity {{planning or}} product pricing may require dif ferent costs to be considered.
