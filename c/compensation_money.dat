5|$|Under {{mounting}} political pressure, John finally negotiated {{terms for}} a reconciliation, and the papal terms for submission were {{accepted in the}} presence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio in May 1213 at the Templar Church at Dover. As part of the deal, John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to the papacy for a feudal service of 1,000 marks (equivalent to £666 at the time) annually: 700 marks (£466) for England and 300 marks (£200) for Ireland, as well as recompensing the church for revenue lost during the crisis. The agreement was formalised in the Bulla Aurea, or Golden Bull. This resolution produced mixed responses. Although some chroniclers felt that John had been humiliated by the sequence of events, there was little public reaction. Innocent benefited from the resolution of his long-standing English problem, but John probably gained more, as Innocent became a firm supporter of John for the rest of his reign, backing him in both domestic and continental policy issues. Innocent immediately turned against Philip, calling upon him to reject plans to invade England and to sue for peace. John paid some of the <b>compensation</b> <b>money</b> he had promised the church, but he ceased making payments in late 1214, leaving two-thirds of the sum unpaid; Innocent appears to have conveniently forgotten this debt for the good of the wider relationship.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, the Attorney-General, Paul Landa, {{established}} an inquiry {{to investigate the}} convictions of Dunn, Alister and Anderson. The inquiry was similar to a Royal Commission, and was headed by Justice Wood. Richard Seary was in England {{at the time and}} did not take part, but after the inquiry he indicated {{that he was willing to}} take part. Justice Wood reconvened the inquiry and it ran through to February 1985. The result was that Justice Wood recommended the pardoning of the three, and they were released in 1985. (The inquiry did not directly cover the Hilton Bombing.) The pardoned trio received compensation from the NSW Government. Alister ploughed his <b>compensation</b> <b>money</b> into land on Bridge Creek Road near Maleny, Queensland, which would become his home, and also the site of the Ananda Marga River School.|$|E

Weeks later, a traumatized Cristina reminisces to Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) about her time in the woods, telling him that she had fought with wild animals to keep them away from Lexie's body. Weeks after the crash, Meredith comes across a young girl presenting with injuries identical to Lexie's, and tirelessly works to save the girls life, with the experience eventually causing {{her to come to}} terms with her sister's death. Despite making it home from the woods, Mark later died from the injuries he sustained in the crash.

2500|$|In the United Kingdom, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} incidence of false whiplash claims to car insurance companies from motorists involved in minor car accidents (for instance; a shunt).

Resultingly, [...] "no win no fee" [...] personal injury solicitors exploit this [...] "loophole" [...] for easy <b>compensation</b> <b>money</b> (often a £2500 payout). Ultimately this has resulted in increased motor insurance premiums, which has had the knock-on effect of pricing younger drivers off the road.|$|E

Chief executive Donald Tsang refused to intervene, labeling it a civil case. Democratic Party lawmaker James To had assisted Chan and Yik in their plea for legal aid, which was expensive and complicated. During the visit by Manila Mayor Estrada and Cabinet Secretary Almendras {{to meet with the}} victims and Hong Kong officials, the latter had stated that a [...] "token of solidarity" [...] will be given to the victims and their families.

Although rebuffed, Spain and Clarke would not accept the Maoris' refusal, deciding that the Port Nicholson area had to be completely ceded and that <b>compensation</b> <b>money</b> would simply be banked for later use by Ngāti Toa. In a letter to Te Rauparaha Spain cited Emer de Vattel's work, Law of Nations, to explain that a civilised nation {{had the right to}} occupy a country or continent occupied by [...] "erratic" [...] people who were not making productive use of the land, as such inhabitants could not be seen as having true, legal possession.

2500|$|In the 20th {{century the}} {{population}} of Keynsham grew, {{partly due to the}} construction of the Somerdale Factory. Douglas Percival Hatchard, who had taken over as the vicar in 1901, [...] continued work on the church school and raised money for the restoration of the church. Heating was provided by the Keynsham Electric Light Company from their plant next to the church. The mission church at Chewton Keynsham continued as a dependent chapel and was often served by lay readers. After World War I a memorial was built. The vicar during World War II was Vernon Graham Havergal Shaw. He was pacifist which brought him into conflict with members of the church council and churchwardens as they thought prayers should be said for the troops, however the vicar disagreed. He left the parish in 1945 and was replaced by Trevor Wright, who was in charge when further problems were uncovered in the church during the 1950s. The woodwork was affected by deathwatch beetle and wet rot and repair work costing over £15,000 was needed. Mervyn Wedgewood took over as the vicar in 1956 as the town expanded further. He led the establishment of new classes and groups for the population and {{the construction of a new}} church dedicated to St Francis. The old church rooms were demolished to make way for a bypass, in the 1960s and the <b>compensation</b> <b>money</b> used for the construction of a new church hall and vicarage.
