Most of the Starfleet uniforms had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to dress the main characters in civilian clothes.

Many scenes {{turned out to be}} underexposed, but the type of film negative that was used permitted this, and the crew was enthusiastic about the visual effects created. Deodato believes {{that as a result of}} the limitations imposed by the cold weather and the low budget, as well as the craftsmanship of production members such as <b>costumer</b> Marcella De Marchis (the wife of Roberto Rossellini), the film has a neorealistic aesthetic comparable to the works of Rossellini and Gualtiero Jacopetti.

I wanted to analyse how UMEVA ́s goals regarding sustainable development and other environmental issues are reflected in their communication towards their <b>costumers</b> and how they are trying to create an environment awarness with their <b>costumers.</b> The theories used in this essay are substantially based or developed from strucuralism. To find discourses in the material I used the theories of Saussure and Barthes regarding semiotics to discribe words, signs and pictures. To further discover discourses in the communication I have applied Foucaults, Mouffe and Laclau ́s theories to see how words collaborate to create a meaning. To investigate how UMEVA are directing their communication I have used Stuart Halls theories regarding encoding and decoding. To find discourses I analysed the language and pictures that are used in the material using rethoric and discourse analysis, together with semiotic analysis. The material analysed are folders and a calender regarding recycling and re-using that are ment for UMEVA ́s <b>costumers.</b> I also analysed the information on UMEVA ́s website conserning their goals and policy ́s concerning the environment. The results from the analyses show that the presence of the environment discourse is constant through the material. UMEVA are not clear regarding how to achieve their environmental goals, they are however constant throughout the material that their intent is to make the <b>costumers</b> recycle and be more aware of the environment.
