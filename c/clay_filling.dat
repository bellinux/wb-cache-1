30|$|In {{this short}} note we analyze data {{recorded}} by six stations (FKSH 10, IBRH 12, IBRH 15, IBRH 16, MYGH 04, TCGH 16). The six stations generally feature strong velocity {{contrast between the}} surface soil layers and the underlying bedrocks. The soil layers at the top several tens of meters generally consist of clay, sandy <b>clay,</b> <b>filling,</b> and gravel with very low S-wave velocities of ~ 100 – 200 m/s. The bedrocks are typically conglomerate, argillite, and shale with S-wave velocities of ~ 700 – 3000 m/s. These stations are chosen mainly because the PGAs recorded are well above the common soil nonlinearity threshold of ~ 200 Gal indicated by previous studies (Chin and Aki, 1991; Beresnev and Wen, 1996 b), due to their relatively close distances to {{the epicenter of the}} Tohoku Earthquake. We also find that the observed temporal changes in peak frequencies and peak spectral ratios (maxima of the spectral ratios) at these stations are much clearer than those at other stations, allowing us to better quantify temporal changes associated with the strong ground motion caused by the To-hoku main shock.|$|E

The channel facies {{comprises}} elongate, tabular, fining-up-ward sand beds that exhibit gently dipping point-bar surfaces (sigmoidal {{cross bedding}}). Trough cross bedding {{in the lower}} part of the sand beds grades upward to planar and ripple cross bedding. Paleocurrent data indicate current directions generally parallel to bed trends. Channel-plug facies consist of organic silty <b>clay</b> <b>filling</b> arcuate, asymmetrically trough-shaped abandoned meanders. Levee facies grade upward from channel facies and consist of ripple cross-bedded sandy silt and silty clay. Floodbasin facies comprise dark-gray, organic, bioturbated silty clay, and grade upward to woody lignite of the swamp facies. Petrified tree stumps are present in levee, floodbasin, and swamp facies. Deltaic facies include distributary-channel, channel-plug, natural-levee, marsh, delta-front, prodelta, interdistributafy-bay, and crevasse-splay facies. The channel facies consists of elongate, narrow, trough-shaped, luting-upward sand beds. Planar cross bedding rades upward to ripple and climbing-tipple cross bedding. Paleocurrent indicators are parallel to sand bed trends. Most channel deposits grade upward to organic, disturbed clay and lignite of the marsh facies, but others grade upward to ripple cross-bedded sandy silt and silty clay of the charmel-plug facies. Small levee facies of silty clay border the upper part of the channel facies and grade downward to planar cross-bedded silty sand and silty clay of the delta-front facies. The delta-front facies overlies laminated, sparsely fossiliferous silty clay of the prodelta facies and grades laterally to fissile silty clay of the interdistributary-bay facies.

Red beds in the unmetamorphosed, ca. 2. 15 Ga FA Formation of the Franceville Basin, Gabon were geochemically, petrographically, and mineralogically characterized to constrain the process of their formation {{and their relationship to}} atmospheric oxygenation in the early Paleoproterozoic. Petrographic observations indicate that ferric oxides are dispersed in <b>clay</b> <b>filling</b> intergranular pores and along platy cleavage in altered phyllosilicates. Grain-coating hematite is generally rare to absent in most samples suggesting hematite precipitation after sediment deposition and during burial diagenesis. Textures and geochemical data suggest that iron was likely sourced internally by alteration of iron-bearing minerals such as biotite and chlorite in sediments and redistributed in rocks during late diagenesis. Positive correlation between Fe/Mg ratio and δ 56 Fe values of bulk samples suggests mixing relationship with end members being authigenic hematite and iron-bearing silicates (biotite and chlorite). The lack of relationship between Fe 3 +/FeT ratios and iron isotope compositions suggest that the isotopically heavy iron oxide was already present in the sediments during early diagenesis, and was incorporated into green (reduced) facies that likely replaced red facies during diagenesis and burial. Large range of δ 56 Fe values extending towards positive values, up to + 1 permil, is similar to that observed in Archean and Paleoproterozoic iron formations or modern groundwater-derived Fe-oxyhydroxides, suggesting partial oxidation of Fe under mildly oxidizing conditions during early diagenesis. In addition, positive correlation between Cr/Fe ratios and iron isotope values, especially in the fine-grained sandstones and mudstones, is evidence for authigenic Cr enrichment under locally mildly-reducing conditions in a fluvial setting and strongly oxidizing conditions during weathering and riverine transport. Uranium released from the lower, fluvial oxidized sandstones and added to the reduced sandstones and silty mudstones in the upper tidal-deltaic sediments potentially resulted in a uranium mineralization of a sandstone-type in the FA Formation of the Franceville Basin...|$|E

Microstructures of dry <b>clay</b> <b>fill</b> samples from the pits were examined with a scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Their microstructural parameters were further measured and analyzed quantitatively using digital image analysis. The clay SEM images are automatically converted into ternary images representing particles, pores, and contact zones for effective and efficient calculation of the clay microstructural parameters. The effect of dynamic compaction on the clay microstructural properties at different blow numbers and compaction energy levels is examined. Analysis revealed that the changes of the soil microstructural properties have a good correlation with the observed ground settlements at the three pits.

40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} {{studies have been}} carried out into the desiccation fissuring of <b>clay</b> <b>fill</b> for flood embankments. The preliminary results confirmed that desiccation fissuring occurs to a depth of typically 60 cm within the outer surface of a flood embankment constructed from <b>clay</b> <b>fill</b> and can occur within 2 years of construction. The critical condition occurs when desiccation creates an interconnected network of sub-vertical and sub-horizontal fissures that increases the mass permeability of the fill material similar to that of coarse sand or gravel and hence allows rapid seepage of flood water through the surface layer of the embankment (crest and sides slopes). The aim of the thesis is to investigate the influence of desiccation fissuring on the stability of flood embankments, In particular, the main objectives of this thesis are as follows: 1. Survey of flood embankments in UK constructed from <b>clay</b> <b>fill</b> to determine the extent and nature of desiccation fissuring. 2. Construction and investigation of the behaviour of macro-scale embankment model subjected to desiccating processes. 3.

The lower section of this outcrop is characterized by thick, deep grey-to-black shale with siltstone and sandstone interstratification (Fig.  4 a, b). Concretional bands and nodules occur within the shale units (Fig.  4 b). The middle section {{is made up of}} rapid alternation of shale, siltstone and fine-grained sandstone (heterolithic interval), whereas the upper section is characterized by a fairly thick shale package with ironstone concretional bands (Fig.  4 c, d). Bioturbation is common in these siltstones and fine-grained sandstones. Structural features in this section include anastomosing sets of vertical joints, northeast–southwest trending faults (with a throw of about 2  m) in the heterolithic and shale intervals (Fig.  4 a, d). The fault in this section exhibits attribute of a listric fault which has a curvilinear slip plane. There is also evidence of <b>clay</b> <b>filling</b> (clay smear) within the fault zone. Nwajide (2013) identified this structure as growth fault, which is a deformational sedimentary structure that develops in response to gravitational instability due to sediment loading, especially on plastic and ductile shales. Sediment package is thicker at the down-thrown section (hanging wall) and thinner at the up-thrown section (footwall); (2) Amagu section, a road-cut exposure along Enugu–Port Harcourt expressway, is characterized by thick shale intervals with basal and top heterolithic intervals (interlamination of fine-grained sand, siltstone and shale unit). There is also a normal fault structure exposed at this section with observable throw of 1.9  m (Fig.  4 e); and (3) thick shale package (about 4  m) exposure at Four Corner Junction, Ozalla road-cut (about 3  km north of the University of Nigeria, Teaching Hospital) along Enugu–Port Harcourt expressway, southeastern Nigeria, containing sandstone/siltstone/shale heterolithic interbeds. The lower section of this outcrop shows a structural displacement due to a normal fault with a sharp diagonal truncation of the sediment package (Fig.  4 e). The sandstones, heterolith and carbonaceous shale of Enugu Formation represent sediment packages deposited in fluvio-deltaic, delta front and estuarine environments (Table  1; Obi and Okogbue 2004; Odunze and Obi 2013).|$|E
40|$|This Systematic Review aims to {{consider}} the impact {{of changes in the}} ground water table and soil moisture regime on structural stability of buildings and foundation systems. The possible changes in the water table levels and soil moisture conditions are expected as a result of environmental change. Building and infrastructure damage occurs where differential movements exceed the thresholds that the buildings or infrastructure can sustain. At locations where uniform vertical settlement dominates, buildings often move vertically with the subsiding ground surface and little damage occurs. It is when excessive differential deformation occurs that buildings and infrastructure are more prone to damage. A number of criteria for damage risk assessment are described. The expectation is that that settlement (downward movement of the ground surface) will occur during groundwater lowering and heave (upward movement of the ground surface) during groundwater rise. However, no cases of damage due to heave resulting from groundwater level rise per se were found in the literature reviewed. However, there were a significant number of cases of damage due to collapse settlements due to inundation during groundwater level rise. Collapse settlements in fill materials due to rising ground water levels are of major concern in the UK. Capillary rise may occur in soil above the water table. Capillary rise can cause deterioration to structures formed from monumental sandstone through dissolution of cementing minerals reducing the strength of stone and recrystallisation of dissolved salts leading to expansion of the stone. Flooding, where surface water exists above the ground surface, can be one circumstance that can lead to wetting and ground water table rise within the soil. In the first stage of flooding, the building structure is subject to the destructive impacts of water streams. In the aftermath of flooding, when water levels subside, the subsoil remains saturated with water. A further effect of flooding is that of soil erosion and scour which can do significant damage to foundations. Rises in groundwater level, can cause reductions in strength of the soil that can lead to failures of slopes. In regions of significant slope instability, significant damage to buildings can occur as a result of landslides. Lowering of the groundwater table can cause the soil to consolidate, which induces settlement. With softer, more compressible soils, settlements can become large. Many of the cases of damage reported are due to large scale land-surface subsidence induced by ground water abstraction. In some of these examples, the ground surface has fallen by as much as 8 m. Other cases deal with more localised ground water control measures, usually associated with dewatering during construction of a tunnel or deep excavation such as an underground car park or metro station. The evidence suggests that significant consolidation settlements can be induced by groundwater lowering. In soft compressible soils, very large settlements can be induced. Settlements of the order of metres can be induced by large drops in groundwater level (30 + metres). Even land subsidence of less than 1 metre can induce significant damage to buildings. Much of the damage reported that is associated with groundwater lowering occurs in buildings on shallow foundations. However, deep foundations on piles can also be affected. If soil settles relative to the pile, this can result in downdrag on the pile (known as “negative skin friction”). This additional load could potentially overstress the pile and lead to failure. A further particular problem occurs with wooden piles when the groundwater level is lowered. If the water table is lowered, this exposes {{the upper part of the}} pile to aerobic conditions and rotting and decay can start to take place. There are examples of building damage due to rotting of wooden piles Karstic conditions exist in soluble rocks such as limestone and dolomite, where ground water flow causes dissolution of the rock leading to the formation of caverns. Sinkhole formation and ground surface subsidence due to dissolution of soluble rocks is a major cause of damage to buildings in karstic areas. This is often associated with groundwater lowering changing the dynamics of the hydrogeology in calcareous rocks. However, there are examples where damage has resulted from additional flow under high water table conditions, as the greater flow causes more dissolution of the soluble rocks and erosion or removal of <b>clay</b> <b>filling</b> from the fissures. Shrinkage and swelling of clay soils is the single most common cause of foundation-related damage to low-rise buildings in the UK. Vegetation, particularly larger trees, has a significant effect of removing water from the soil and inducing shrinkage. Seasonal shrinkage and swelling will be a major factor of concern if climate change produces drier summers and wetter winters, as predicted for the UK, since greater extremes of wetting and drying will induce greater cycles of swelling and shrinkage. The evidence suggests that shrinkage during periods of drought causes the greatest degree of damage. There is evidence from France that soil conditions are becoming progressively drier and this is consistent with a long-term drying trend predicted for the UK. Peat poses particular geotechnical problems due to its high compressibility. It is made from decaying vegetation and can be very fibrous with a very open, compressible structure. Due it its high compressibility, any changes in stress resulting from groundwater level changes are likely to result in large surface settlement or heave. To be able to assess the future implications of damage to structures due to environmental change it is important to understand the economic cost of damage to buildings due the mechanisms of groundwater level change, shrink/swell etc. The costs of damage due to shrink/swell movements on clay soils have resulted in economic losses of over £ 1. 6 billion in the UK during drought years in the 1990 s. Similar figures are evident from France where losses have been as high as 3. 3 billion Є (£ 2. 7 billion) in a single year. In China, losses due to land subsidence in Shanghai are estimated to be about £ 10 billion over a decade with £ 0. 3 billion a year in losses in three other cities. Consideration has been given by researchers and strategists to the impacts of climate change on the UK built environment and what might be needed for adaption. A consensus is that potential problems to foundations could be addressed through higher specification of foundations, including greater depths for foundations, as well as by new construction methods. It is also possible that higher [increasing] minimum temperatures and fewer cold days could reduce problems associated with frost heave. It may be that an increase in the number of properties suffering damage could result in changes in the perception of the severity of damage and householders may become willing to accept minor levels of damage. Discussions about building performance in New Zealand also lead to the suggestion that risks of future climate change to buildings should be managed and this means that building codes and practices around the world will need to change to suit new climate conditions. However, changing codes and practices requires a good foundation of evidence and research. This is difficult to establish given the uncertainty of current climate change scenarios and their long timescale. There is also an awareness that buildings built now will still be in use in 50 - 100 years time. This produces a need for early action in the construction sector...|$|E

It showed that exfoliated nanocomposite structures were formed up to 3 wt. % nanoclay, whereas, intercalated nanocomposite structures formed above 3 wt. % nanoclay in the PP matrix. Furthermore, the woven fibre reinforced PP composites demonstrated superior crack resistant properties than that of <b>clay</b> <b>filled</b> nanocomposites and chopped fibre PP composites. However, KIC and GIC values for woven fibre composites were lesser than that of chopped fibre composites. Moreover, KIC and GIC values for both nanoclay filled PP composites and woven fibre composites are comparable even though the <b>clay</b> <b>filled</b> PP demonstrated catastrophic failure. Also, the crack propagation rate of PP-nanoclay composites is {{comparable to that of}} chopped fibre composites...|$|R

50|$|This {{tradition}} is {{very old and}} nowadays it coincides with the Saturday (Sâmbăta Morților) before Rusalii (Whitsuntide equivalent). It is the commemoration {{day of the dead}} elders (moșii) and it continues a tradition inherited probably from Dacians. The housewives prepare <b>clay</b> dishes (străchini), <b>filled</b> with sweet milk boiled rice (local tradition - colarezi), boiled eggs, some sweets and cherries or strawberries, and <b>clay</b> pots, <b>filled</b> with water (or wine) and garden flowers, sharing them with neighbors, relatives and the needy.|$|R
40|$|The hyperaluminous clays of Portugal in the Andornha-Cantanhede region make an {{interesting}} matchup against lateritic bauxite deposits of Jamaica. In several {{parts of the}} region of Andorinha, bauxitic facies occur, overlying argillaceous and arkosic (Grés Belasiano) sandstone. The bauxitic clays are weathering product from the sandstone in the region. The <b>clays</b> <b>fill</b> karst cavities that are up to 12 meters deep and increases in depth moving from east to west. In Jamaica bauxite shows a strong correlation with the White Limestone group in general and in the Central Inlier of the country the bauxitic facies show a slight evidence of igneous or volcanic origin...|$|R
