5|$|Another blow to Soviet <b>communism</b> in the First World {{came with}} the {{establishment}} of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet <b>communism</b> {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet <b>communism</b> in general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala, a CIA-backed {{military}} coup ousted the left-wing President Jacobo Árbenz in 1954. The post-Arbenz government—a military junta headed by Carlos Castillo Armas—repealed a progressive land reform law, returned nationalized property {{belonging to the}} United Fruit Company, set up a National Committee of Defense Against <b>Communism,</b> and decreed a Preventive Penal Law Against <b>Communism</b> {{at the request of}} the United States.|$|E

These accusations received wide publicity, increased his approval rating, and gained him a powerful national following.|$|E

5|$|In January 1957, the US {{adopted the}} Eisenhower Doctrine and pledged {{to prevent the}} spread of <b>communism</b> and its {{perceived}} agents in the Middle East. Although Nasser was an opponent of <b>communism</b> in the region, his promotion of pan-Arabism was viewed as a threat by pro-Western states in the region. Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform King Saud into a counterweight. Also in January, the elected Jordanian prime minister and Nasser supporter Sulayman al-Nabulsi brought Jordan into a military pact with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.|$|E

5|$|The {{perception}} of <b>communism</b> in the US {{was shaped by}} the Cold War, which began after World WarII when the Soviet Union failed to uphold the commitments it made at the Yalta Conference. Instead of holding elections for new governments, as agreed at Yalta, the Soviet Union occupied several Eastern European countries, leading to a strained relationship with the US. Subsequent international events served to increase the apparent danger that <b>communism</b> posed to Americans: the Stalinist threats in the Greek Civil War (1946–1949); the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948; and the 1948 blockade of Berlin.|$|E

5|$|The senator {{alleged that}} Stevenson had downplayed {{the threat of}} <b>communism,</b> and was thus unfit to be president.

5|$|The view of <b>communism</b> {{was also}} {{affected}} by evidence of espionage in the US conducted by {{agents of the}} USSR. In 1945, a Soviet spy, Elizabeth Bentley, repudiated the USSR and provided a list of Soviet spies in the US to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI also had access to secret Soviet communications, available from the Venona decryption effort, which revealed significant efforts by Soviet agents to conduct espionage within the US. The growing influence of <b>communism</b> {{around the world and}} the evidence of Soviet spies within the US motivated the Department of Justicespearheaded by the FBIto initiate an investigation of communists within the US.|$|E

5|$|According to Hobsbawm, the Fasci were a {{prime example}} of {{primitive}} agrarian movement that became modern by aligning itself with socialism and <b>communism.</b> Many of its leaders continued in the Socialist Party and continued the struggle for land rights and land reform once they were released.

5|$|After 1952 the Polish sport {{life was}} {{organized}} through the Polish Cultural and Educational Union. Through the communist era Polish minority declined demographically and this process continue to date, hence {{after the fall}} of <b>communism</b> in 1989 only a few sport organizations resumed their activity. Beskid Śląski, the only notable one, focuses on tourism. No exclusively Polish sport club exists today in Zaolzie.|$|E
5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish <b>communism</b> to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in <b>communism</b> was due to them.|$|E
5|$|By {{broadcasting}} {{accusations of}} <b>communism</b> among Fretilin leaders and sowing discord in the UDT coalition, the Indonesian government fostered instability in East Timor and, observers said, created {{a pretext for}} invading.

50|$|Until <b>Communism's</b> fall, Humphrey {{kept his}} new methods confidential.

(2) In place of compartmentalized, primarily mental education, Humphrey has developed a human-nature-guided (moral, physical, artistic, mental) approach.|$|R
