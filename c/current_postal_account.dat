40|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, {{available}} empirical evidence on Italy does not include estimates of money laundering based on econometric models using observed data. This knowledge gap we try to close in this paper. We define a model of demand for cash deposit services, using as dependent variable the ratio of the value of total cash in-payments on the <b>current</b> (bank and <b>postal)</b> <b>accounts</b> to the value of total non-cash in-payments credited to <b>current</b> (bank and <b>postal)</b> <b>accounts.</b> In order to disentangle the “dirty money ” component of cash in-payments we estimate a full model which controls for alternative sources of cash deposit demand, i. e. linked to official and shadow economy activities. We find the following interesting empirical results: First, the estimated size of total money laundering ranges from 6. 6 % of GDP to around 8 % when using a restricted specification. Second, more precisely, the share of “dirty money ” on GDP is 7. 1 % in the Centre-North of Italy against 5. 4 % in the South of Italy; while the inverse is true for money laundering coming from extortion activities, for which the share in the South is 1. 5 times the value of the Centre-North (2. 1 % versus 1. 4 %) ...|$|R
