40|$|The Magellanic Bridge is {{a region}} of {{predominantly}} neutral hydrogen, connecting the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC respectively). We present here widefield observations of this region in the 21 cm transition of HI. These observations are made using the ATCA and Parkes telescopes. The resulting dataset encompasses a spatial range of 98 ? � 7 (degrees) and are at a velocity resolution of ~ 1. 63 km s(superscript � 1). This dataset has {{formed the basis for}} a series of analyses which are the subject of this thesis. The HI in the Bridge is seen to have a complex and filamentary structure across the entire range of observed spatial and velocity scales. A census of the expanding shell population, which were parameterised using a strict selection criteria, has resulted in the detection of a shell population with a mean kinematical age of 6. 2 Myr. This is in general agreement with the shell population of the SMC, although is shown that the strict shell selection criteria was insensitive to fragmenting or incomplete shells. A strict selection criteria led to the detection of a region in the Bridge where an apparently older shell population exists. The HI of this region, found at Right Ascensions greater than approximately 2 (superscript h) 20, appears relatively quiescent. It appears that shells in this region may left to develop for a longer time before they are ruptured and distorted by ambient turbulence. A study of the spatial power spectrum has shown that distribution of structure in the Bridge is quite inhomogeneous. Two apparently different morphological regions are detected in the Bridge: the northern part is at a higher velocity and shows very little small scale variation and the southern, lower velocity and significantly brighter part shows an approximately Kolmogorov power spectrum. The power law index of the southern part is consistent with power indices derived from HI in the SMC. The power spectrum of both the northern and southern part are well fit using a single component, and show no indication for a dominant scale. Visually, {{the southern part of the}} Bridge appears to suggest a east-west elongation in the structure. This is not apparent in a quantitative test of the Fourier transform of the image data. A smaller-scale analysis using the Spectral Correlation Function, which provides a measurement of the variation of spectra as a function of spatial lag, suggests that the spectra do in fact vary more slowly in the East-West direction, i. e. approximately along the line joining the SMC and LMC. Several large scale features found in the Bridge show evidence for large energy deposition events. Part of the HI in the Bridge appears to be distinctly offset in velocity and position and a comparison of numerical N-Body simulations of the Magellanic System, where the SMC is modelled as a spiral galaxy, shows excellent agreement with the observed HI distribution, both in position and in velocity. From these simulations, it appears that the velocity offset part of the Bridge is in fact a distant arm of the SMC while the <b>closer</b> <b>arm</b> comprises a link between the LMC-SMC. The observed filamentary nature of the lower velocity component is consistent with severe turbulent mixing which may be generated by the tidal interaction of the SMC and LMC. The brighter, lower velocity part of the Bridge is shown to have a bimodal spectral profile. The bimodality is contiguous in position and in velocity with a shell complex in the SMC. The observed bimodality in the Bridge indicates that the Bridge formed after the formation of the SMC shell complex, however the kinematical ages for the shell complex are a factor of ~ 15 younger than the predicted age of the Bridge structure. A large radii (~ 1. 6 kpc) loop filament is observed off the North-Eastern corner of the SMC. The velocity structure of the loop is reminiscent of an expanding region, although the energy requirements for this shell are so extreme that no current hole or shell formation theories can satisfactorily account for its development. Such a feature would require an unseen massive stellar association to generate the necessary energy output. To form the observed feature by a high velocity cloud collision would require the impinging mass to have velocities and densities which are entirely inconsistent with the observed HVC population. Finally, the idea that the loop occurs at the first gravitational Lagrange point of the LMC-SMC system is inconsistent with Numerical simulations in that the simulations suggest that the loop is in fact located in the distant spiral arm of the SMC and therefore not in the correct location of L 1 point. Furthermore, the simulations do not show any evidence for the formation of this feature as observed. As such, the formation mechanism for this significant, large-scale loop is still uncertain. A survey of H? emission regions throughout the Bridge, using a new and untested H� dataset, has isolated several new H? emission regions. In general, these H? regions appear to be spatially associated with UV sources from the FAUST catalogue, although in some cases the H� emission region show a morphology which is characteristic of formation by collisional heating. Some of the H� features which show a ring-like morphology are compared with the HI dataset. In this way, an estimate of the age of the shell can be made. Due to calibration difficulties, and a lack of continuum information, this part of the thesis comprises only a list of positions of the H? features and a discussion of possible ionisation mechanisms. A search for (superscript 12) CO(1 - 0) emissions regions in the Bridge has resulted in the first detection of this molecule in the Magellanic Brodge. The CO emission region appears to be embedded in an HI cloud and has a S(subscript 60) /S(subscript 100) which is similar to those found in the SMC. The marrow line width of the Bridge CO detection is consistent with a low metallicity, indicating that the HI in the Bridge is less evolved than that of the SMC or the Magellanic Stream. From empirical models based on analyses of CO emission regions in the SMC, an upper limit of the radius of this region is estimated at ~ 16 pc.

We used muscimol in Wistar rats to estimate its influence on locomotor activity in the open field test {{as well as on}} the processes of consolidation and retrieval, evaluated in the test of passive conditioned reflexes. Anxiolytic activity was examined in the elevated “plus” maze in physiological state and after hypoxia-induced amnesia. Following intraperitoneal administration of muscimol (1 mg/kg, ip), the animals showed a decrease in motility, in retrieval of skill reflexes and in a number of entries into open and <b>closed</b> <b>arms</b> in the elevated plus “maze”. In animals exposed to hypoxia, we observed reduced motility in the open field, inhibition of retrieval and consolidation of passive conditioned reflexes, shortened time of sojourn in open arms and decreased number of entries into open and <b>closed</b> <b>arms.</b> In the group of animals which underwent hypoxia and then received muscimol, we observed no effect of hypoxia on muscimol activity in the open field test, except rearing when muscimol action was significantly reduced. Muscimol improved consolidation but not retrieval in comparison with the hypoxic saline-treated group of rats. In the elevated “plus ” maze test, treatment of rats with muscimol after hypoxia significantly prolonged the time spent in open arms and increased the number of entries into open arms, while shortened the time spent in <b>closed</b> <b>arms.</b> In conclusion, muscimol in hypoxia-exposed group of rats exerted beneficial effect on consolidation in passive avoidance situation and exerted anxiolytic activity.

40|$|The role of {{serotonin}} {{in depression}} and anxiety is still highly controversial. In this experiment the effect of two substances upon anxiety was studied in rats. Methods: Forty adult (45 – 55 weeks old) male Wistar rats were used to study the following behavioral parameters on elevated plus maze test: open <b>arm</b> and <b>closed</b> <b>arm</b> entries; open <b>arm,</b> <b>closed</b> <b>arm</b> and central square activity duration, open arm preference and total distance traveled. Results: A single injected dose of the antidepressant fluoxetine had no significant effect on animals` activity in the open-arm test, neither in a small dosage (5 mg/kgbw) nor in a higher one (10 mg/kgbw), whereas a single high dose of buspirone significantly impeded the open-arm activity of the rats. None of the substances influenced the general locomotor activity significantly, but the higher doses of buspirone mainly blocked the closed-arm entries and they even decreased the total distance traveled. Conclusion: Acute fluoxetine and buspirone administration influenced the rats’ behavior in the elevated plus-maze test in a dose dependent manner. Anxiolytic effects occur after small doses but anxiogenic-like effects were noticed in rodents when higher doses were used.

Because of synthetic drugs and medications possess enormous side effects, hence {{the present study was}} to investigate anxiolytic effect of seed of Ziziphus jujuba extract (SZJE) in rat using in Elevated plus maze (EPM). Methods: Anxiety was measured by the number of entries and duration spent in open and <b>close</b> <b>arm</b> of the EPM following administration of the extracts intraperitoneally (i. p). Total number of entries was measured as an index of locomotor activity. Diazepam (1. 0 mg/kg, i. p.) was used as the positive control. Results: The SZJE at the dosage 50 - 100 mg/kg increased the percentage of time-spent (p< 0 / 05, p< 0 / 001) and at the dosage 100 mg/kg increased the percentage of arm entries in the open arms of the EPM (p< 0 / 001) and decreased the percentage of time-spent and the percentage of arm entries in the <b>closed</b> <b>arms</b> of the EPM. The effect of The SZJE at the dosage 100 mg/kg did not differ signiﬁcantly from diazepam. Administration of the extracts in these doses had no effect on locomotor activity.

40|$|Background Medicinal {{plants with}} natural {{antioxidants}} {{have been shown}} to be beneficial in a variety of complications such as anxiety. The elevated plus-maze (EPM) is one of the most widely used models to assess anxiety in small rodents. Objectives This study was designed to characterize the anxiolytic-like activity of Borago officinalis (Linnaeus, family Boraginaceae) or Borage flowers extract, using an EPM test. Materials and Methods Male Wistar rats weighing 220 - 250 grams were used in the present study. Thirty minutes after an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of the Borage extract (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) or saline, each animal was placed in the EPM. Animal behaviors in the experimental sessions were recorded by a video camera located above the maze, interfaced with a monitor and a computer in an adjacent room. The time spent in the open arms, the percentage of entries into the open arms of the EPM and the numbers of entries into the <b>closed</b> <b>arms</b> were recorded for five minutes.

The Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM) has been predominantly used to investigate anxiety levels in rodents. Objectives The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the effectiveness of extract of OB on rat behavior in the EPM test. Materials and Methods Male Wistar rats weighing 220 - 250 g were used in the present study. Forty rats were divided into 4 groups: three OB groups (25, 50, 100 mg/kg oral administration of OB for 7 days) and a saline control group. One day after the last day of feeding, the animals’ behavior in EPM was videotaped for 10 minutes. Then, their behavior scored for formal indexes of anxiety, such as the total distance covered by animals, the percentage of entries into and the time spent in open and <b>closed</b> <b>arms.</b> Results The results showed that after oral feeding of OB, the percentage of open arms entry and open arms time in EPM increased in the experimental groups. OB extract has no effect on the total distance covered by animals and number of <b>closed</b> <b>arm</b> entries. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the extract of OB could induce anxiolytic effect in rats after 1 week oral administration. The effect of OB was not induced through changes in motor activity.

40|$|Aim of the {{research}} was to evaluate, by means of quantitative and multivariate temporal pattern analyses, the behavior of Wistar rat in elevated plus maze (EPM) test. On {{the basis of an}} ethogram encompassing 24 behavioral elements, quantitative results showed that 130. 14 ± 8. 01 behavioral elements occurred in central platform and in <b>closed</b> <b>arms</b> (protected zones), whereas 88. 62 ± 6. 04 occurred in open arms (unprotected zones). Percent distribution was characterized by a prevalence of sniffing, walking and vertical exploration. Analysis of minute-by-minute duration evidenced a decrease for time spent in open arms and central platform and an increase for time spent in <b>closed</b> <b>arms.</b> As to multivariate t-pattern analysis, 126 different temporal patterns were detected. Behavioral stripes, summarizing distribution of such t-patterns along time, showed that several t-patterns were not homogeneously distributed along the test observational period: t-patterns encompassing behavioral events occurring prevalently in central platform-open arms were observed during the first minutes, whereas t-patterns structured on the basis of events occurring mainly in central platform-closed arms were detected during the last minutes. Therefore, during the observation in elevated plus maze, rat’s behavior undergoes significant rearrangements of its temporal features. Present research demonstrates, for the first time, the existence of complex and significantly timed behavioral sequences in the activity of Wistar rats tested in elevated plus maze. Application of t-pattern analysis can provide useful tools to characterize the behavioral dynamics of anxiety-related rodent behavior and differentiate the effect of various anxioselective substances...|$|R
40|$|In {{exploratory}} animal {{models of}} anxiety, {{such as the}} elevated plus maze, the anxiogenic- and anxiolytic-like effects of drugs may be confounded by changes in locomotor activity. In the present experiments, the sensitivity of several measures of anxiety and locomotor activity in the elevated plus maze were assessed. Both chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (CDP, 7. 5 mg/kg) and d-amphetamine sulphate (AMP, 0. 75, 1. 5 mg/kg) increased the percent time on the open arms and doses of 7. 5 mg/kg and 1. 5 mg/kg CDP and AMP, respectively, {{increased the number of}} entries into the open arms. The increase in these measures might suggest that both compounds induced an anxiolytic-like effect. Although FG 7142 (30. 0 mg/kg) did not decrease the number of entries to the open arms, it did decrease the time on the open arms, which might suggest that it had anxiogenic-like effects. Similarly, buspirone reduced both the number of entries into the open arms and the time spent on the open arms. However, all the compounds significantly affected locomotor activity. CDP (3. 0 and 7. 5 mg/kg) increased the total number of arm entries, the distance travelled on the open arms and the mean speed of the animals on the open, and in the <b>closed</b> <b>arms.</b> Moreover, the distance travelled by the animals in the <b>closed</b> <b>arms</b> was increased by 1. 0 mg/kg CDP, a dose that had no measurable effects on the indices of anxiety.
