5|$|A museum {{displays}} the trophy heads of animals shot {{by family members}} on safari, ethnographic items {{from around the world}} and an important collection of archaeological artifacts. The museum retains its Victorian-Edwardian arrangement, and is housed in an 18th-century summer-house adjoining the formal gardens.

5|$|All of the high-penetrating (armor-piercing) and hollow-point {{ammunition}} {{is classified}} as <b>category</b> <b>A</b> (see above). The alternative to a hollow point ammunition was Federal EFMJ, which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only full metal jacket or soft-nosed semi-jacketed rounds and or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.|$|E

5|$|Fort Stikine {{arrived at}} Bombay {{in the early}} morning of 12 April. Having taken on a pilot shortly before 10:00 she was docked at the Victoria Dock at midday. The {{practice}} of flying a red flag to signify dangerous cargo on board had been discontinued in wartime as doing so would identify such vessels {{in the event of an}} enemy air raid on a port. Also, the practice on unloading such vessels into lighters offshore had also been discontinued due to the war. At the time, explosives were graded as <b>Category</b> <b>A,</b> B, or C. <b>Category</b> <b>A</b> explosives, such as those carried on board Fort Stikine, were the most dangerous. These were only allowed to be offloaded onto lighters, and not directly to the quayside.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular and reserve armies, all former Regular Army personnel (known as the Regular Reserve) may be recalled for duty as needed. The Regular Reserve has two categories: A and D. <b>Category</b> <b>A</b> is mandatory, with {{the length of time}} in the category dependent on time spent in Regular Army service. Category D is voluntary, and consists of personnel who are no longer required to serve in <b>category</b> <b>A.</b> Regular Reserves in both categories serve under a fixed-term reserve contract and may report for training or service overseas and at home, similar to the Army Reserve. In 2007, there were 121,800 Regular Reserves, of which 33,760 served in categories A and D. Beginning in April 2013, the full Regular Reserve strength was no longer reported—only those serving in categories A and D (30,000 in 2015).|$|E

5|$|It {{was later}} {{the home of}} Charles Hope-Weir, who made several {{improvements}} to the estate policies. Craigiehall was extended several times, before being sold to the Earl of Rosebery, who leased out the property. It was briefly a hotel and country club, before being requisitioned by the Army at {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. Craigiehall continues to be used as the Army's Scottish Headquarters. The house has been protected as a <b>category</b> <b>A</b> listed building since 1971, as a substantial 17th-century classical house, worked on by several notable architects.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} century the neglect continued until some basic external renovation work was undertaken between 1965 and 1971, making the structure {{wind and water}} tight, although it remained unoccupied. The castle was again abandoned and left unmaintained. The condition of the building further declined, becoming derelict. It was in a ruinous state when marketed for sale in April 2013 {{after the death of}} Count Robin Mirrlees, who had owned it for about fifty years. At the end of that year it was purchased by the former model Olga Roh, who said she intended to restore it. Modern day reports suggest that the spirit of the 3rd Lord Banff and that of a white dog haunt the castle, which is classified as a <b>category</b> <b>A</b> listed building.|$|E
