40|$|After the {{proposal}} of CO 2 transcritical cycle in 1980 s by Professor Gustav Lorentz, researchers have looked into theoretical and experimental research, {{as well as}} commercial system development to improve transcritical system performance to a level {{similar to that of}} conventional heat pump systems. Over the years researchers are investigating for newer system concepts with transcritical CO 2 cycle that can be implemented across the globe for different climate conditions. One of the major challenges of CO 2 transcritical cycle is that the system COP is greatly dependent on the gas <b>cooler</b> <b>outlet</b> condition. Thus, application of such systems in wormer climate may result in poor system performance where ambient temperature is relatively high and unstable. However, the temperature of the ground remains comparatively stable and can be utilized as a heat sink to bring down the gas <b>cooler</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature to avoid low cooling performance and large expansion losses. These observations lead the concept of a hybrid system where part of the gas cooler heat is rejected to ambient air and rest to the ground using a ground-coupled heat exchange. Furthermore, incorporating an ejector instead of conventional expansion valve may increase the system performance. It is necessary to evaluate these system alternatives and figure out the maximum borehole length required for such systems to be functional and economically viable. This thesis investigates the performance of CO 2 ground-coupled ejector cycle to conventional CO 2 transcritical cycle with expansion valve when ambient air temperature constraints the cooling of supercritical CO 2.

The possible parameters affecting system efficiency such as heat rejection pressure, gas <b>cooler</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature, evaporating temperature, expander isentropic efficiency and IHE effectiveness are investigated. It is found that the IHE addition in the carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle with an expander increases the specific cooling capacity and compression work, and decreases the optimum heat rejection pressure and the expander output power. An IHE addition does not always improve the system performance in the refrigeration cycle with an expander. The throttle valve cycle with IHE provides a 5. 6 % to 17 % increase in maximum COP compared to that of the basic cycle. For the ideal expander cycle with IHE, the maximum COP is approximately 12. 3 % to 16. 1 % lower than the maximum COP of the cycle without IHE. Whether the energy efficiency of the cycle by IHE can be improved depends on the isentropic efficiency level of the expander.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cost-effective enhancement of a trans-critical carbon dioxide (CO 2) cycle in air-conditioning mode by utilizing a thermoelectric sub-cooler. It is well-documented that the cooling COP of the transcritical CO 2 cycle decreases as the ambient air temperature significantly increases above the critical {{temperature of the}} refrigerant. Â A high gas <b>cooler</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature limits the enthalpy of evaporation so that the air-conditioning cooling performance is reduced. Sub-cooling {{is known as a}} mitigation method to this problem. Â However, adding a small-scale heat pump to a residential or light commercial air conditioner can be quite costly. Therefore, a thermoelectric solid-state sub-cooler is proposed. The thermoelectric cooling (TEC) devices utilized in small temperature differences ranging from 5 to 15 oC can be quite efficient since the intrinsic heat loss of the TEC by heat conduction in reverse direction of pumping heat is minimal. Based on the prior work, the optimum design for cost-per-performance shows that the cost for sub-cooling is dominated by the heat exchangers and it is not by the thermoelectric material itself. The TECs are compact and have a low thickness, which is in the range of a few mm. Hence the TEC modules can be integrated into the form factor of a plate heat exchanger. In this study, the cooling COP of the CO 2 air conditioner is enhanced by approximately 12 % using an optimally designed thermoelectric sub-cooler at an ambient temperature of 35 oC. This potential improvement is based on a figure-of-merit (ZT) of currently available thermoelectric materials (ZT~ 1). The seasonal primary energy efficiency and the cost performance of the optimized TE sub-cooled CO 2 heat pump system will be presented in comparison to other compact sub-cooling technologies...|$|E

Several optimal discharge pressure correlations for transcritical CO 2 heat pump {{have been proposed}} {{in the past few}} years, most of which are related to the ambient temperature, the evaporation temperature and the gas <b>cooler</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature. In an earlier study, the authors’ research group had presented a study on the dependency of the optimal discharge pressure on the ambient temperature and the hot water outlet temperature. In this study, a revised model for optimal discharge pressure is developed based on experimental results. In order to validate the optimal discharge pressure model developed, field tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of an air-source transcritical CO 2 heat pump water heater in practical application. The system is comprised of a semi-hermetic reciprocating compressor, a counter-flow tube-in-tube gas cooler, a counter-flow internal heat exchanger, a fin-and-tube evaporator, and an electronic expansion valve (EEV) driven by electrically operated step motor. A Siemens SIMATIC S 7 - 200 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) was used to regulate the compressor discharge pressure by adjusting the EEV opening and the water flow rate by changing the frequency of the variable speed water pump. Field tests were conducted under three different operating scenarios: the nominal test condition, high water supply temperature condition and low ambient air temperature condition. The results show that the coefficient of performance (COP) can achieve 3. 76 in the nominal test condition with 15 ? water inlet temperature and 80 ? hot water supply temperature. Even when the hot water temperature is higher than 90 ?, the COP remains at 3. 21 with 20 ? dry-bulb temperature and 15 ? wet-bulb temperature. Under low ambient air temperature condition, the COP was 2. 19 with the hot-water supply temperature of 60 ?. Comparison between the field test results and the model predictions show that the maximum relative error of discharge pressure control was 5. 6 % in the low temperature condition, while the maximum relative error of system COP was only 4. 7 %. With the reasonable agreement observed between the field test results and the model prediction. It is reasonable and effective to model the optimal discharge pressure as the function of the ambient temperature and the water outlet temperature...|$|E
40|$|The energy {{consumption}} of the chiller and cooling tower in a process cooling application was analyzed using the TRNSYS computer code. The basic system included a constant speed centrifugal chiller and an induced-draft, counterflow cooling tower. Typical performance data was used to generate empirical models of the chiller and cooling tower. The cooling load profile was based on averaged electrical demand data for three plastic processing plants. The simulation was conducted using hourly Typical Meteorological Year weather data to determine the cooling tower operating conditions. Three alternative systems were modeled to predict the savings associated with the following energy conservation options: 1) variable speed drive chiller, 2) two-speed cooling tower fan, and 3) natural cycle cooling. The annual energy savings are presented {{as a function of}} <b>cooling</b> tower <b>outlet</b> temperature and average cooling load ratio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A lumped {{parameter}} {{model is}} developed to study thermal management system performance of underwater vehicle equipping large power proton exchange membrane fuel cell propulsion unit. Fuel cell voltage current characteristic and heat release characteristic are represented by models which take effect of cooling water temperature into considered. Fuel cell stack performance models are validated against experimental data. Cooperated with experimental based models of water pump and heat exchanger, thermal management system performance is analyzed while fuel cell stack fresh <b>cooling</b> water <b>outlet</b> temperature is set {{to be at a}} certain value. The results show that inlet seawater temperature variation has little effect on opening of regulating valve, but engine power output variation results in notably regulating valve opening fluctuation. Modeling results would be employed in design of a underwater vehicle 300 kW fuel cell engine system. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaporative}} refrigerator or cooler comprising {{a bundle}} of spaced, porous walled tubes closed at one of their ends and vented to a vacuum {{at the other end}} is disclosed. The tube bundle is surrounded by a water jacket having a hot water inlet distribution manifold and a <b>cooled</b> water <b>outlet</b> through a plenum chamber. Hot water is pumped into the jacket to circulate around the tubes, and when this water meets the vacuum existing inside the tubes, it evaporates thereby cooling the water in the jacket. If cooling proceeds to the point where water penetrating or surrounding {{all or part of the}} tubes freezes, operation continues with local sublimation of the ice on the tubes while the circulating water attempts to melt the ice. Both sublimation and evaporation may take place simultaneously in different regions of the device...|$|R
