5000|$|Nerve fibers {{of various}} kinds {{are more or less}} {{randomly}} mixed in most nerves. This is true for fibers of different functions as well as fibers of different size. Basically fiber diameter is closely related to function, e.g. cutaneous pain system is dependent on small fibers whereas discriminative touch is dependent on large fibers. With regard to fiber diameter there are two main categories: A-fibers are large and conduct impulses at high or moderate speed (5-75 m/s). C-fibers are small and conduct impulses at low speed (around 1 m/s). In microneurography recordings, A- and C-fiber impulses differ in shape. Because fibers are mixed in most nerves, it is usually essential to record from an individual nerve fiber at a time to explore the properties of a functional system, although multi-unit recording has been very rewarding in studies of sympathetic efferent activity. An individual nerve consists of a number of parallel fascicles, i.e. bundles of nerve fibers enclosed within a <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath</b> that may be quite tough and hard for a needle microelectrode to penetrate.|$|E
40|$|The {{continuously}} remodeled {{hair follicle}} is a uniquely exploitable epithelial-mesenchymal interaction system. In {{contrast to the}} cyclical fate of the hair follicle epithelium, {{the dynamics of the}} supposedly stable hair follicle mesenchyme remains enigmatic. Here we address this issue using the C 57 BL/ 6 hair research model. During hair growth, increase in total follicular papilla size was associated with doubling of papilla cell numbers, much of which occurred before intra-follicular papilla cell proliferation, and subsequent to mitosis in the proximal <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath.</b> This indicates that some papilla cells originate in, and migrate from, the proliferating pool of <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath</b> fibroblasts. Follicular papilla cell number and total papilla size were maximal by anagen VI, but intriguingly, decreased by 25 % during this period of sustained hair production. This cell loss, which continued during catagen, was not associated with intra-follicular papilla apoptosis, strongly indicating that fibroblasts migrate out of the late anagen/early catagen papilla and re-enter the proximal <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath.</b> Low-level apoptosis occurred only here, along with the “detachment” of cells from the regressing <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath.</b> Thus, the hair follicle mesenchyme exhibits significant hair cycle-associated plasticity. Modulation of these cell interchanges is likely to be important during clinically important hair follicle transformations, e. g. vellus-to-terminal and terminal-to-vellus during androgenetic alopecia...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{complications}} of diabetes mellitus is diabetic neuropathy. It may be provoked by metabolic and/or vascular factors, and depending on duration of disease, various layers of nerve may be affected. Our aim was to investigate influence of diabetes on the epineurial, perineurial, and endoneurial <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheaths.</b> The study included 15 samples of sural nerve divided into three groups: diabetic group, peripheral vascular disease group, and control group. After morphological analysis, morphometric parameters were determined for each case using ImageJ software. Compared to the control group, the diabetic cases had significantly higher perineurial index (P< 0. 05) and endoneurial <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> percentage (P< 0. 01). The diabetic group showed significantly higher epineurial area (P< 0. 01), as well as percentage of endoneurial <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> (P< 0. 01), in relation to the peripheral vascular disease group. It is obvious that hyperglycemia and ischemia present in diabetes lead to substantial changes in <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheaths</b> of nerve, particularly in peri- and endoneurium.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of proteoglycans in hair {{growth has been}} recognized through the observation of increased hair growth in diseases such as the mucopolysaccharidoses and pre-tibial myxedema, which involve an increase in skin proteoglycan content. In an attempt to understand this, we have examined the distribution of chondroitin 6 sulphate (C 6 S), unsulphated chondroitin (COS), dermatan sulphate (DS), and heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) in frozen tissue sections of normal scalp by immunostaining. Results show that during anagen, the thick <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath</b> around the follicle stains strongly for C 6 S, COS, and DS. COS is uniquely associated with this region and is not found beneath the epidermis or infundibular epithelium. HSPG is, however, localized in the basement membrane zone adjacent to the outer root sheath. In addition, all of these proteoglycans are localized in the dermal papilla. In mid-catagen, we observed significant loss of C 6 S and COS staining from both the dermal papilla and the <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath,</b> but no decrease in staining for HSPG. In late catagen, very little staining of C 6 S and COS was observed. In early anagen, we observed that C 6 S was again present in the <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath</b> and dermal papilla; however, COS staining appeared to be weaker and less {{closely associated with the}} follicle. HSPG staining was observed in early anagen in a pattern very similar to that found for other basement membrane components. Results for DS were not obtained for catagen or early anagen. These results provide further evidence that hair growth is associated with the presence of chondroitin proteoglycans in the follicle environment and that the cessation of growth is associated with their removal. Further studies are underway to characterize the relationship between hair growth and proteoglycans...|$|E

40|$|Protease nexin- 1, a serine {{protease}} inhibitor, is expressed {{specifically in the}} dermal papilla (DP) of anagen hair follicles and is suggested {{to be one of}} the modulators of the cyclic growth of hair follicles. Accumulating evidence has shown that protease nexin- 1 plays its biologic role by inhibiting thrombin action in various systems other than the hair follicle. Thrombin has various physiologic functions including blood coagulation cascade, mostly via activation of protease-activated receptors (PAR). In this study, we investigated the expression of PAR mRNA using RT-PCR in dissected human hair follicles. We showed that PAR- 1 mRNA was expressed specifically in the mesenchymal portions, including DP and <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath,</b> of anagen hair follicles. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for PAR- 1 was detected in the DP and lower portion of <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath</b> in the anagen and catagen phases and in the DP of telogen hair follicles. Because only a pharmacologic level (100 nM) of thrombin significantly stimulated cell proliferation and DNA synthesis of the cultured dermal papilla cells, thrombin does not seem to have a mitogenic effect on dermal papilla cells physiologically. These results raise the possibility that thrombin is involved in the cyclic hair growth through its receptor of PAR- 1...|$|E

Four gestational ages were chosen for the investigation. The diaphragm at 20 days gestation revealed early myogenesis which was characterised by many myogenic cells in the process of mitosis and by fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes. A large number of lipid droplets and a moderate quantity of glycogen were observed in the myotubes. These myotubes contained a few myofibrils peripherally. At 22 days of gestation, the myotubes exhibited a relatively large number of myofibrils and large amounts of glycogen.

The epidermis consists of a stratified squamous epithelium, four to seven cell layers thick, with one to two layers being cornified. The dermis is composed of two layers. The outer stratum spongiosum contains chromatophores, capillaries, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and skin glands. The inner stratum compactum is composed of horizontal bundles of collagenous fibers. The granular and mucous glands are simple alveolar glands possessing an intercalary region and a duct. The alveolar wall of the granular gland is comprised of a columnar epithelium, muscle layer, and <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath.</b> The mucous gland alveolar wall consists of two layers, a cuboidal to columnar epithelium and a <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath.</b> The roughness of the terrestrial skin is due to two types of tubercles.

The dry mass of normal tendons, which makes up about 30% {{of their total}} mass, is composed of about 86% collagen, 2% elastin, 1 - 5% proteoglycans, and 0.2% inorganic components such as copper, manganese, and calcium. The collagen portion {{is made up of}} 97 - 98% type I collagen, with small amounts of other types of collagen.

Collagen fibres coalesce into macroaggregates. After secretion from the cell, the terminal peptides are cleaved by procollagen N- and C-proteinases, and the tropocollagen molecules spontaneously assemble into insoluble fibrils. A collagen molecule is about 300 nm long and 1 - 2 nm wide, and the diameter of the fibrils that are formed can range from 50 - 500 nm. In tendons, the fibrils then assemble further to form fascicles, which are about 10 mm in length with a diameter of 50 - 300 μm, and finally into a tendon fibre with a diameter of 100 - 500 μm.

We allowed the muscle to contract against a servomotor at submaximal force conditions while filming with a high-speed camera, then analyzed the images taken at the extremes of the muscle length to measure strain in the inner and outer fibers. Both species of frogs exhibited significantly less strain in the outer muscle fibers compared to the innermost fibers, in broad agreement with predictions from our model. We then added an external constrain to the PL muscle of R. catesbeiana and measured force and length output under otherwise identical conditions. Adding this radial constraint reduced the length the muscle could contract by 50 %, resulting in a decrease in the amount of mechanical work it could perform of 50 %.

This structure differs unmistakably from that of the dense-edged fibrils called "neurotubules" and {{it is clear that the}} latter are not axonic constituents. Though dense-edged fibrils can readily be demonstrated in fragmented formalin-fixed nerve preparations, they are seldom observed in thin sections. When such structures were seen in these experiments they were located in the <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath.</b> The present evidence offers no support for the view that "neurotubules" are structural entities of normal intact nerves...|$|E
40|$|The {{direct current}} {{longitudinal}} {{resistance of the}} squid giant axon was measured {{as a function of}} the electrode separation. Large sea water electrodes were used and the inter-electrode length was immersed in oil. The slope of the resistance vs. separation curve is large for a small electrode separation, but becomes smaller and finally constant as the separation is increased. An analysis of the resistance vs. length curves gives the following results. The nerve membrane has a resistance of about 1000 ohm cm. 2 The protoplasm has a specific resistance of about 1. 4 times that of sea water. The resistance of the <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheath</b> outside the fiber corresponds to a layer of sea water about 20 µ in thickness. The characteristic length for the axon is about 2. 3 mm. in oil and 6. 0 mm. in sea water...|$|E
40|$|Extracts from fresh {{normal human}} <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> (rectus <b>sheath)</b> {{exhibited}} a decided inhibiting action on grafts of Rat Tumor 256 transplanted into test animals. There was complete inhibition of tumor growth in 66 per {{cent of the}} animals; there was a marked retardation {{in the rate of}} growth in another 15 per cent, the tumors in these instances being much smaller than the controls transplanted at the same time. In only one experiment was there failure to obtain a lasting growth-inhibitory effect. The tumors in these animals (19 per cent) although showing an initial retardation in growth, apparently overcame the restraint {{and at the end of}} 5 weeks were larger than the control series. Extracts from fresh normal human muscle tissue, on the other hand, showed no such inhibiting action on grafts of Rat Tumor 256...|$|R
40|$|The {{notochord}} and notochordal sheath of 10 adult amphioxus {{were investigated}} ultrastructurally and histochemically. The notochord in amphioxus consists of parallel notochordal cells (plates) and each plate consists of parallel thicker and thinner fibrils and numerous profiles of smooth endoplasmic reticulum situated {{just beneath the}} cell membrane. Histochemical staining shows that the notochordal plates resemble neither the <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> notochordal <b>sheath</b> nor the typical muscular structure myotomes. The notochordal sheath has a complex three-layered organization with the outer, middle and inner layer. The outer and middle layer are composed of collagen fibers of different thickness and course, that correspond to collagen type I and collagen type III in vertebrates, respectively, and the inner layer is amorphous, resembles basal lamina, and is closely attached to the notochord by hemidesmosome junctions. These results confirm the presence of collagen fibers and absence of elastic fibers in amphioxus...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on the sheaths which envelop rat tail tendons. The samples were processed for observation by light and electron microscopy. In the case of electron microscopy, thin sections of specimens embedded in epoxy resin and replicas of freeze etched samples were used. On the basis of histological and ultrastructural observations, four distinct <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>sheaths</b> have been detected. The paratendineum is a thick fibrous sheath that covers externally the four groups of tendons arranged around the vertebrae of the tail; the epitendineum is a distinct fibrous sheath surrounding each tendon group; the peritendineum is composed of concentric cellular laminae enveloping each tendon; lastly, the endotendineum {{is made up of}} one cellular lamella which adheres to the fibres of the tendon, projecting trabeculae between the individual tendon fascicles. In the para- and epitendineum, thick bundles of collagen fibrils, running parallel to the fibres of the tendon, were visible. The collagen fibrils had a wide variability of diameters (from 35 to 220 nm) and, when examined in replica, their microfibrillar arrangement appeared to be straight. In the peri- and endotendineum, thin bundles of collagen fibrils were visible between the cellular laminae, parallel to the main axis of the tendon. Among these collagen bundles, elastic fibres and numerous glycoproteins containing microfibril-like filaments were visible. The collagen fibrils were small and of uniform diameter (50 nm) and, when observed on replica, showed a helicoidal microfibrillar arrangement. The cell layers of the peri- and endotendineum were made up of flattened fibroblasts which were connected by specialised junctions and which contained numerous micropinocytotic vesicles. A thin layer of granular electron-dense material, with ultrastructural characteristics similar to those of a basement membrane, was visible {{on the surface of the}} most external cellular layer of the peritendineum and on the outer surface of the cellular lamella of the endotendineum. Due to their morphological characteristics it is supposed that the four tendon sheaths are involved in different and special functions. Moreover, collagen Type I and collagen Type III, demonstrated by means of immunofluorescence techniques in previous investigations, show respectively a close similarity in distribution to the thick collagen fibrils, with a straight microfibrillar arrangement, of the two external sheaths, and to the thin collagen fibrils, with a helicoidal microfibrillar arrangement, of the two internal sheaths...|$|R
