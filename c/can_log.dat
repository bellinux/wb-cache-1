5|$|Improvements for {{the game}} include the ability to {{synchronize}} the player's progress across multiple devices; for example, a player who completes a level on an Android phone <b>can</b> <b>log</b> into their copy of the game on an Android tablet and see the same statistics and level of progress.|$|E
5|$|Mobile data {{terminal}} – Some ambulances are fitted with Mobile {{data terminal}}s (or MDTs), which are connected wirelessly {{to a central}} computer, usually at the control center. These terminals can function instead of or alongside the two-way radio {{and can be used}} to pass details of jobs to the crew, and <b>can</b> <b>log</b> the time the crew was mobile to a patient, arrived, and left scene, or fulfill any other computer based function.|$|E
25|$|For an organization, RDS {{allows the}} IT {{department}} to install applications on a central server instead of multiple computers. Remote users <b>can</b> <b>log</b> on and use those applications over the network. Such centralization can make maintenance and troubleshooting easier. RDS and Windows authentication systems prevent unauthorized users from accessing apps or data.|$|E
5000|$|Plinking {{refers to}} {{informal}} target shooting done for pleasure typically at non-standard targets such as tin <b>cans,</b> <b>logs,</b> soda bottles, {{or any other}} homemade or naturally occurring target. [...] A person involving in the plinking exercise is colloquially known as a plinkster.|$|R
50|$|The NetInsight Extract, transform, load process <b>can</b> read <b>log</b> {{files in}} {{virtually}} any format, including logs from web servers, proxy servers, streaming media servers and FTP servers. As well as processing normal server <b>log</b> files NetInsight <b>can</b> use <b>log</b> files derived from page tags to replace or augment log file data.|$|R
50|$|Up to 36 files can be open at once in {{the same}} NB window. All open {{documents}} can be saved with one keystroke. A group of documents <b>can</b> be <b>logged</b> at program shutdown, then re-opened exactly as they were. Multiple groups of files <b>can</b> be <b>logged</b> for work on different projects.|$|R
25|$|The {{choice of}} {{regional}} Comic Reader software is {{dictated by the}} PSP's firmware region, and cannot be chosen. The Japanese Comic Reader will not display comics purchased from the European store, and vice versa. So although a Japanese PSP <b>can</b> <b>log</b> into the European PlayStation Store and purchase and display videos and games bought there, any comics purchased cannot be displayed.|$|E
25|$|While simply {{completing}} the registration web form is in general enough to generate an account, the status label Inactive is commonly provided by default until the registered user confirms the email address given while registering indeed {{belongs to the}} user. Until that time, the registered user <b>can</b> <b>log</b> in to the new account but may not post, reply, or send private messages in the forum.|$|E
25|$|The website {{no longer}} lists new caches without a {{physical}} container, including virtual and webcam caches; however, older caches {{of these types}} have been grandfathered in (except for locationless/reverse, which are completely archived). Earthcaches {{are one of the}} two exceptions to the no-container rule; they are caches in which players must answer geological questions to complete the cache. The other exception is for event caches; for an event to qualify, it must be specifically or mainly for geocachers, and must have a minimum duration dependent upon its category (CITO, regular, Mega, or Giga). Attendees of event caches <b>can</b> <b>log</b> that they 'attended', which will increment their number of found caches. Groundspeak created a waymarking website to handle all other non-physical caches.|$|E
50|$|The player {{takes the}} role of a biker boy who must cross a road with {{obstacles}} and a very blocky background in order to buy a present for his girlfriend. The bike is able to jump to avoid the obstacles (<b>cans,</b> <b>logs,</b> police cars, etc.). The road has many gaps that must be jumped too.|$|R

25|$|The {{first step}} will be {{interactive}} Web-based portal called Learning Village {{that would be}} fully functioning by fall 2010. The Learning Village program will give DPS the ability to digitize its textbooks, curriculum and lesson plans. Teachers {{will have access to}} students' assessment results and prospective lesson plans to more quickly diagnosis struggling students. Parents <b>can</b> <b>log</b> into the system to track their students' progress, print additional worksheets and view cumulative test results for a teacher's entire class. The purpose of the Learning Village tool is to serve as a unified portal to connect students, teachers, parents and principals, and deliver real-time learning. DPS will also use $14.2 million in federal stimulus and Title I dollars for netbooks for all 36,000 students and 4,000 teachers in grades 6–12 for access to technology to support hands-on learning. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is setting up a Detroit-based office with at least 13 employees for technical support, training and outreach. Detroit is the company's largest client.|$|E
25|$|Determined to {{help the}} boys slay the griefer, the {{executives}} decide to give the boys the Sword of a Thousand Truths, a weapon so powerful that it {{was removed from the}} game and stored on a 1 GB USB flash drive. Unaware of the plan however, the boys have already initiated what becomes a seventeen-hour battle against the griefer. The executives arrive at Stan's house with the flash drive, unaware that the boys are actually at Cartman's house. Randy tells the executives that he <b>can</b> <b>log</b> in with the sword and give it to the boys' characters online. Eventually logging onto a demo of the game at a Best Buy, Randy gives Stan the weapon, but Randy's character is mortally wounded by the griefer in the process. Enraged, Stan attacks the griefer with the sword, allowing Kyle and Kenny to attack. Cartman approaches him and proceeds to smash the griefer's head with a hammer. Numerous World of Warcraft players celebrate the griefer's demise, praising the boys as heroes.|$|E
500|$|The Special Edition DVD was {{released}} on November 16, 2004. In 2014, Brad Bird went to Warner Bros. {{to talk about the}} possibility of releasing The Iron Giant on Blu-ray. [...] "WB & I have been talking. But they want a bare-bones disc. I want better," [...] Bird said on his Twitter account. He also said that fans <b>can</b> <b>log</b> on to their Twitter accounts and post a tweet on the Twitter homepage of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, demanding a Collector's Edition Blu-ray for the film. On September 6, 2016, the movie {{was released}} on Blu-ray for the first time titled the [...] "Signature Edition".|$|E

2500|$|Facebook Connect, {{also called}} Log in with Facebook, like OpenID, {{is a set}} of {{authentication}} APIs from Facebook that developers can use to help their users connect and share with such users' Facebook friends (on and off Facebook) and increase engagement for their website or application. [...] When so used, Facebook members <b>can</b> <b>log</b> on to third-party websites, applications, mobile devices and gaming systems with their Facebook identity and, while logged in, can connect with friends via these media and post information and updates to their Facebook profile.|$|E
2500|$|In Windows 2000, the user's RSA {{private key}} {{is not only}} stored in a truly {{encrypted}} form, {{but there is also}} a backup of the user's RSA private key that is more weakly protected. If an attacker gains physical access to the Windows 2000 computer and resets a local user account's password, the attacker <b>can</b> <b>log</b> in as that user (or recovery agent) and gain access to the RSA private key which can decrypt all files. [...] This is because the backup of the user's RSA private key is encrypted with an LSA secret, which is accessible to any attacker who can elevate their login to LocalSystem (again, trivial given numerous tools on the Internet).|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} port scanners use {{the operating}} system's network functions and are generally the next option {{to go to}} when SYN is not a feasible option (described next). Nmap calls this mode connect scan, named after the Unix connect (...) system call. If a port is open, the operating system completes the TCP three-way handshake, and the port scanner immediately closes the connection to avoid performing a Denial-of-service attack. Otherwise an error code is returned. This scan mode has the advantage that the user does not require special privileges. However, using the OS network functions prevents low-level control, so this scan type is less common. This method is [...] "noisy", particularly if it is [...] a [...] "portsweep": the services <b>can</b> <b>log</b> the sender IP address and Intrusion detection systems can raise an alarm.|$|E

50|$|The island's {{population}} was 13,950 {{as of the}} 2000 census. The only cities on the island are Ketchikan and Saxman, although the unincorporated community of Ward Cove and the historical community of Loring {{are also on the}} island. The principal industries are fishing, <b>canning,</b> <b>logging</b> and tourism. In addition to the cities, several logging communities are based on barges, which move about the waterways. These serve the unconnected system of logging roads that dot the island and have access to waterfront.|$|R
30|$|Recording HTTP traffic: The HTTP {{requests}} exchanged {{between a}} browser and the server <b>can</b> be <b>logged</b> at different {{places in the}} network; they <b>can</b> be <b>logged</b> on the server, in the proxy-server or even on the client-side. However, recording on the client-side requires additional configuration/installation of recording software which is not desired. HTTP servers (such as Apache 15 or IIS 16) can be configured to record the full traffic. To use D-ForenRIA, {{there is no need}} to change the Web application or to instrument any code on the client side 17.|$|R

50|$|Major event {{subscribers}} {{include the}} Event Collector service and Task Scheduler 2.0. The Event Collector service can automatically forward event logs to other remote systems, running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 R2 on a configurable schedule. Event <b>logs</b> <b>can</b> also be remotely viewed from other computers or multiple event <b>logs</b> <b>can</b> be centrally <b>logged</b> and monitored agentlessly and managed {{from a single}} computer. Events can also be directly associated with tasks, which run in the redesigned Task Scheduler and trigger automated actions when particular events take place.|$|R
