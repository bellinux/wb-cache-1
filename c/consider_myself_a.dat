500|$|Irwin was {{a passionate}} {{conservationist}} and believed in promoting environmentalism by sharing his excitement about {{the natural world}} rather than preaching to people. He was concerned with conservation of endangered animals and land clearing leading to loss of habitat.

[...] Irwin bought [...] "large tracts of land" [...] in Australia, Vanuatu, Fiji and the United States, which he described as [...] "like national parks" [...] and stressed the importance of people realising that they could each make a difference.|$|E
500|$|In early 2010, {{a primary}} {{challenge}} from {{radio talk show}} host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth materialized in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the Tea Party movement. With Hayworth using the campaign slogan [...] "The Consistent Conservative", McCain said – despite his own past use of the term {{on a number of occasions}} – [...] "I never considered myself a maverick. I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>a</b> person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities." [...] The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts, closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, campaign finance restrictions, and gays in the military.|$|E
500|$|Pilgrim at Tinker Creek {{is a work}} of {{creative}} nonfiction that uses poetic devices such as metaphor, repetition, and inversion to convey the importance of recurrent themes. [...] Although it is often described as a series of essays, Dillard has insisted it is a continuous work, as evidenced by references to events from previous chapters. [...] Although the chapters are separately named—several have also been published separately in magazines and anthologies—she referred to the book in a 1989 interview as a [...] "single sustained nonfiction narrative". [...] Dillard has also resisted the label of [...] "nature writer", especially in regard to Pilgrim.

For in truth there are really two kinds of Modernism to be uncovered in the space of the last two and a half centuries, and it is to the first and largest of these that I belong and to which, in my small way, I contribute. This is the Modernism that was born in neo-classicism and has, as its great central titan, the mighty Richard Wagner." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{importance}} {{in the context of}} Indian art scene is much beyond a simplistic cultural exchange. On the international art scene, he represents the region as a whole, and he shares a deep connection with the country. The artist had his very first international solo in New Delhi with Nature Morte in 2004. Looking back at those times, he had once stated: “India was my launch pad. I didn’t <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>a</b> professional artist till that show in 2004. It changed my approach.” He has not looked back since then, and has now become a poster boy for the Indian art gallery circuit. One edition of his work [...] "Red Carpet-1" [...] was auctioned at Sotheby’s New York on 16 May 2008, for a record price of 623,000 USD, highest price ever paid for a work of art produced by a Pakistani.|$|E

On June 14, 1968, Dohrn was elected the Inter-organizational Secretary of SDS, and, once elected, was asked {{if she was a}} socialist. She replied, [...] "I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>a</b> revolutionary communist." [...] From August 30 to September 1, 1968, Dohrn visited Yugoslavia. Her involvement with SDS and political advocacy stretch beyond the United States as well, as she and other SDS leaders had met with representatives from North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in Budapest, Hungary to discuss peace talks. She and a delegation from the SDS also traveled to Cuba via Mexico City, Mexico on July 4, 1969, and later arrived in Canada via a Cuban vessel on August 16, 1969.|$|E
2500|$|Although Wiener {{eventually}} became a staunch pacifist, he eagerly contributed {{to the war effort}} in World War I. In 1916, with America's entry into the war drawing closer, Wiener attended a training camp for potential military officers, but failed to earn a commission. One year later Wiener again tried to join the military, but the government again rejected him due to his poor eyesight. In the summer of 1918, Oswald Veblen invited Wiener to work on ballistics at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Living and working with other mathematicians strengthened his interest in mathematics. However, Wiener was still eager to serve in uniform, and decided to make one more attempt to enlist, this time as a common soldier. Wiener {{wrote in a letter to}} his parents, [...] "I should <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>a</b> pretty cheap kind of a swine if I were willing to be an officer but unwilling to be a soldier." [...] This time the army accepted Wiener into its ranks and assigned him, by coincidence, to a unit stationed at Aberdeen, Maryland. World War I ended just days after Wiener's return to Aberdeen and Wiener was discharged from the military in February 1919.|$|E

5000|$|The Foreign Ministers of ASEAN {{member states}} {{determined}} that {{invitation to the}} inaugural East Asian Summit, {{the first of which}} is to be held in late 2005 and hosted by Malaysia, was to be restricted to parties to the treaty. The Howard Government in Australia, although seeking invitation, was reluctant to accede to the treaty claiming it was out of date and might conflict with obligations and rights it had under other treaties. However, with entry to the Summit confined to parties to the treaty, and with domestic pressure to sign, Australia decided in early 2005 to sign the treaty on the condition that its rights under the UN Charter are recognised as inalienable. Upon the announcement of accession, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer was asked whether or not he considered himself an east Asian, he replied: [...] "Do I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>an</b> East Asian? ...

2500|$|Cleverly {{earned the}} interim {{version of the}} belt on 11 December 2010 in an unimpressive contest with the Frenchman Nadjib Mohammedi at the Echo Arena in Liverpool. Winning 115–112, 116–111 and 115–113 on the {{scorecards}} despite also having a point deducted Cleverly described his opponent as [...] "very awkward" [...] and said [...] "he was making me miss and dragging me in {{but this is the}} way it goes sometimes." [...] Cleverly had fought for the interim title as the full champion Jürgen Brähmer was in the midst of an appeal against a 16-month jail sentence for assault and insulting behaviour. An appeal heard in Germany on 13 December 2010 would, if Brähmer had been unsuccessful and sent to prison, have resulted in the belt being vacated and Cleverly being upgraded to the full champion status. Proceedings however didn't result in the champion being sent to prison and a fight with Brähmer was scheduled for 21 May 2011 Speaking of the match up Cleverly said that he was glad that it was going to happen saying [...] "He's the champion and the only way I would <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>a</b> true champion is if I took the belt from him, rather than picking up the vacant title." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bond began A String in the Harp {{while looking}} for a job after {{returning}} to the United States from a year in graduate school studying librarianship in Aberystwyth. She drew closely on her experiences and reactions to write the book, saying [...] "the American family notices and adjusts to the same things I did". She did not intend to write a fantasy. [...] "I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>a</b> realistic kind of person, and it really surprised me in many ways that the first book I should write would be a fantasy." [...] According to Elizabeth Briggs in On the Inside Looking In: Contemporary Anglo-Welsh Fantasy, non-Welsh authors use Welsh mythology in their books to develop a sense of fantasy and unreality. But Bond found using Taliesin's life was a good way to introduce Welsh history into the story. Because he was already associated with the area she was writing about and his presence helped convey a sense of the country's age to her American reading audience, she chose to use him as her link to Wales' past. She needed a talisman to trigger the fantasy sections of the story, and when she read that harp keys are essential for tuning she knew she had found an object she could use in the book. The visions the key brings to Peter and the others tie the various elements of the story together.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, in a {{town hall}} meeting in Pennsylvania debating the Jewish Tradition with Martin Amis, Hitchens commented on his {{political}} philosophy by stating, [...] "I am no longer a socialist, but I still am a Marxist". In a June 2010 interview with The New York Times, he stated that [...] "I still think like a Marxist in many ways. I think the materialist conception of history is valid. I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> <b>a</b> very conservative Marxist". In 2009, in an article for The Atlantic entitled [...] "The Revenge of Karl Marx", Hitchens frames the late-2000s recession in terms of Marx's economic analysis and notes how much Marx admired the capitalist system that he called for the end of, but says that Marx ultimately failed to grasp how revolutionary capitalist innovation was. Hitchens was an admirer of Che Guevara, yet in an essay written in 1997, he distanced himself from Che, and referred to the mythos surrounding him as a [...] "cult". In 2004 he re-emphasized his positive view of Che, commenting that [...] " [...] death {{meant a lot to me}} and countless like me at the time. He was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us bourgeois romantics insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do—fought and died for his beliefs." ...|$|E
