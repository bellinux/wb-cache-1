40|$|Recent {{literature}} on statistical process monitoring {{pointed out that}} the quality of products and processes can be often related to profiles, where the function relating a response to one or more location variables (in time or space) is the quality characteristic of interest. An important application of profile monitoring concerns geometric specifications of mechanical components, such as straightness, roundness or free-form tolerance. This paper presents a new approach aimed at extending the method proposed for profile monitoring to surface monitoring. In this case, a geometric specification (such as cylindricity, flatness, etc.) is assumed to characterize the machined surface. The proposed method is based on combining a Spatial Autoregressive Regression (SARX) model (i. e. a regression model with spatial autoregressive errors) to multivariate and univariate control charting. In this work, the approach is applied to a case study concerning surfaces obtained by turning and subject to <b>cylindricity</b> <b>tolerance...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} contribution {{deals with}} the comparison of selected ecological oils of the same viscosity class in terms of wear of the sliding bearing B 60 M 4 {{as part of the}} matched sliding pair lubricated by ecological lubricant. The wear of the sliding bearing is monitored using the parameters; the change of geometric <b>tolerance</b> <b>cylindricity</b> having the most indicative capability about the size and location of wear. The second parameter is weight loss, and the third parameter is the change of surface roughness at the contact point of friction elements. Results are statistically processed and presented in the form of graphs and tables...|$|R
40|$|Dimensional {{inspection}} of a manufactured surface {{by means of}} a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) produces a set of Cartesian coordinates. The coordinates are processed to yield the geometric tolerance of the surface. This paper presents a new approach to the evaluation of flatness, <b>cylindricity</b> and sphericity <b>tolerance</b> based on surface invariance with regard to the rigid motions. The proposed algorithm transforms, through homogeneous transformation matrices, the coordinates measured to best fit the reference element of the surface class from which the actual measurements were sampled. The transformation matrix is simplified taking into account the invariance of the sum of the squared normal distances of the measured points from the nominal surface as regards some rigid motions. This invariance is a consequence of the invariance as regards some displacements of the nominal surface from which the data points were sampled. In this way, the number of parameters to be optimised is reduced in comparison with the six parameters characterizing the general homogeneous transform matrix. The methodology was computer implemented and numerical simulations were performed for planes, cylinders, and spheres in order to validate the effectiveness of the approach. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate and quick assessments...|$|R
