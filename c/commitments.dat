Metoden för att undersöka detta var en webbenkät som delades ut till sammanlagt 188 personer, med en svarsfrekvens på 35 %. Respondenterna arbetade i tre olika organisationer inom offentlig sektor. I enkäten fick respondenterna ta ställning till påståenden rörande sin organisation och sin närmaste chef.
