40|$|Purpose: Embolic stroke is a dreaded {{complication}} of thoracic endovascular aortic repair. The prevailing theory about its cause is that particulate debris from atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic wall are dislodged by endovascular instruments and embolize to the brain. An alternative source of embolism might be air {{trapped in the}} endograft delivery system. The aim of this experimental {{study was to determine}} whether air is released during deployment of a thoracic endograft. Methods: In an experimental benchtop study, eight thoracic endografts (five Medtronic Valiant Thoracic and three Gore TAG) were deployed in a water-filled transparent container drained from air. Endografts were prepared and deployed according to their instructions for use. Deployment was filmed and the volume of air released was collected and measured in a <b>calibrated</b> <b>syringe.</b> Results: Air was released from all the endografts examined. Air volumes ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 3 [*]mL for Medtronic Valiant Thoracic and from < 0. 025 to 0. 04 [*]mL for Gore TAG. The largest bubbles had a diameter of approximately 3 [*]mm and came from the proximal end of the Medtronic Valiant device. Conclusion: Air bubbles are released from thoracic endografts during deployment. Air embolism may be an alternative cause of stroke during thoracic endovascular aortic repair...|$|E
40|$|A full {{understanding}} of the phase behavior of CO 2 –hydrocarbon mixtures at reservoir conditions {{is essential for the}} proper design, construction and operation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. While equilibrium data for binary CO 2 –hydrocarbon mixtures are plentiful, equilibrium data and validated equations of state having reasonable predictive capability for multi-component CO 2 –hydrocarbon mixtures are limited. In this work, a new synthetic apparatus was constructed to measure the phase behavior of systems containing CO 2 and multicomponent hydrocarbons at reservoir temperatures and pressures. The apparatus consisted of a thermostated variable-volume view cell driven by a computer-controlled servo motor system, and equipped with a sapphire window for visual observation. Two <b>calibrated</b> <b>syringe</b> pumps were used for quantitative fluid injection. The maximum operating pressure and temperature were 40 MPa and 473. 15 K, respectively. The apparatus was validated by means of isothermal vapor–liquid equilibrium measurement on (CO 2 + heptane), the results of which were found to be in good agreement with literature data. In this work, we report experimental measurements of the phase behavior and density of (CO 2 + synthetic crude oil) mixtures. The ‘dead’ oil contained a total of 17 components including alkanes, branched-alkanes, cyclo-alkanes, and aromatics. Solution gas (0. 81 methane + 0. 13 ethane + 0. 06 propane) was added to obtain live synthetic crudes with gas-oil ratios of either 58 or 160. Phase equilibrium and density measurements are reported for the ‘dead’ oil and the two ‘live’ oils under the addition of CO 2. The measurements were carried out at temperatures of 298. 15, 323. 15, 373. 15 and 423. 15 K and at pressures up to 36 MPa, and included vapor–liquid, liquid–liquid and vapor–liquid–liquid equilibrium conditions. The results are qualitatively similar to published data for mixtures of CO 2 with both real crude oils or and simple hydrocarbon mixtures containing both light and heavy components. The present experimental data have been compared with results calculated with two predictive models, PPR 78 and PR 2 SRK, based on the Peng–Robinson 78 (PR 78) and Soave–Redlich–Kwong (SRK) equations of state with group-contribution formulae for the binary interaction parameters. Careful attention was paid to the critical constants and acentric factor of high molar-mass components. Since the mixture also contained several light substances with critical temperatures below some or all experimental temperatures, we investigated the use of the Boston–Mathias modification of the PR 78 and SRK equations. The results showed that these models can predict with reasonable accuracy the vapor–liquid equilibria of systems containing CO 2 and complex hydrocarbon mixtures without the need to regress multiple binary parameters against experimental data...|$|E

Tests of this device were undertaken to determine its accuracy and reliability. METHODS: The performance of the Spirophone was tested using computer generated wave forms, by delivering blows from <b>calibrated</b> <b>syringes</b> at different flows, and by comparing subjects' blows with those recorded with a commercial spirometer. RESULTS: Using computer generated wave forms all lung function indices were accurate to within 1 % and blows delivered from <b>calibrating</b> <b>syringes</b> were accurate to within 5 %. When subjects performed repeated forced vital capacity (FVC) manoeuvres {{there were no significant}} differences between lung function indices recorded with the Spirophone and with a commercial spirometer. With the Spirophone and commercial spirometer in series the FVC and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) were within 5 % of each other in nine out of 10 healthy subjects.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Lung volume {{measurement}} by nitrogen washout {{is widely used}} in infants, though a lack of accuracy and changes of calibration over time have been reported. The potential sources of error were explored {{in order to increase}} the accuracy and reliability of the technique.  METHODS—A commercial system for nitrogen washout and a 0. 5 litre <b>calibrating</b> <b>syringe</b> as a lung model were used to perform over 2000 in vitro washouts, including simulated rapid breathing, shallow breathing, periodic breathing, sighs, and brief apnoeas. A constant 10 l/min bias flow of oxygen and extended equipment warming times were employed. A collapsible breathing bag was incorporated into the washout circuit. Following a single two point calibration, known air volumes from 42 ml to 492 ml were measured by nitrogen washout over a 14 hour period. The flow waveform in the nitrogen mixing chamber during a washout in vitro, with and without the breathing bag in the circuit, was also studied.  RESULTS—The mean coefficient of variation of all volumes was 0. 66 %. The mean difference between measured and known volumes was 0. 30 ml (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 18 to 0. 79). This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0. 22). The mean percentage error was - 0. 1 % (range - 0. 47 % to 0. 46 %). Nitrogen calibration remained stable for 14 hours.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Scintigraphic image {{analysis}} of 99 mTc-mertiatide (Mag- 3, mercaptoacetyltriglycine) clearance provides {{the determination of}} the blood flow, the tubular transit time and the excretion as well from both kidneys. Radiopharmaceutical routine recommends a radiochemical purity control before administration of the product to a patient. The main objective {{of this study is to}} develop a Mag- 3 labeling procedure that fits better than the previous one in our daily routine production of radiopharmaceuticals. METHODS: Increasing proportions of 99 mTc-Mag- 3 were measured during the heating and cooling steps of the Mag- 3 labeling procedure. HPLC analysis was used to confirm the results of a rapid radiochemical quality control assay on standard ITLC-SG paper. RESULTS: The reconstitution time takes 20 - 25 minutes from the harvest of pertechnetate to a ready-for-use <b>calibrated</b> patient <b>syringe.</b> The HPLC profile of 99 mTc-Mag- 3 including its minor impurities remains unchanged for 24 - 48 hours after reconstitution.

Three individual samples (a minimum of 10 plants of each) of each shrub species were collected from different areas and prepared for chemical and secondary metabolite analysis. In vitro evaluations for each sample of each shrub species were completed in three incubation runs in different weeks using <b>calibrated</b> glass <b>syringes</b> in a 7 × 2 factorial design (i. e., 7 shrub species × 2 treatments with or without PEG). In vitro gas production after 24 and 96 h, partitioning factor (PF), metabolizable energy (ME) content, efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (EMPS), and volatile fatty acids (VFA) were determined. A shrub species × PEG interaction (P< 0. 05) only occurred for some VFA, such as C 3, C 4, C 4 i and C 5 i, concentrations. Relative to control, addition of PEG increased (P< 0. 05) the concentrations of individual VFA in A. shaffneri, C. lycioides and C. parvifolia. Interactions between shrub and PEG occurred (P< 0. 001) for all gas production parameters (i. e., b, k, IVGP 24, IVGP 48). The fractional rate of gas production and IVGP 24 h were highest in A. constricta and lowest (P< 0. 001) in A. shaffneri. L. tridentata had the highest PF and C. lycioides the lowest. A. constricta had the highest ME content. Purine content and EMPS differed (shrubs × PEG; P< 0. 001) among shrubs. Microbial protein synthesis was highest in M. biuncifera and lowest in C. eriophylla, while total VFA were highest in C. eriophylla. Incorporation of PEG increased (P< 0. 001) in vitro fermentation parameters and ME content with L. tridentata and C. lycioides being the highest. PEG also promoted reductions in the EMPS and PF values. In vitro fermentation variables such as fractional rate of gas production, VFA concentrations and EMPS support the potential of A. constricta, C. parvifolia and M. biuncifera as protein and energy sources for small ruminants in semiarid regions of North Mexico. Increments in gas production in these shrub species confirmed the affinity of PEG to bind condensed tannins and reduce EMPS...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Shortage of {{feedstuff}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} problems of animal nutrition in Iran. Salinity is a global problem worldwide in particular in arid and semi-arid zones such as Iran. Salinity {{is an important factor in}} the growth of plants. Its initial effect to plants is through its effect in the availability of water to plants. Halophytes have good ability to draw water from soils of low water potential due to their ability to maintain a salt balance comparable to the salt in the soil they are growing. Lands in high irrigation districts are susceptible to soil salinization. Soil salinization is the primary cause of productivity decline in highly developed and irrigated land schemes While the increase in soil and water salinity in many agricultural areas of the world has created major challenges in the production of food crops, it has also presented some new prospects for livestock agriculture. There are plants that grow under saline conditions, and historically, they have been opportunistically used as fodder for grazing livestock or as components of mixed rations to replace roughage. Using of seawater for irrigation of this plant because of shortage of sweet water and for higher production of these plants was necessary for feedstuff. The aim of this study was evaluation of Chemical composition, In vitro digestibility and gas production of Kochia scoparia under six level of salinity including 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 ds/m. Materials and Methods The Kochia scoparia was irrigated by normal tap water (the control) and water containing 6 levels of salinity including 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 deci Siemens per meter (ds/m). The salinity was applied gradually in accordance with the plant growth advancement (2 ds/m increment per each irrigation period. Oven dried (65 ◦C for 48 h) chopped samples were ground to pass through a 1 -mm screen. The samples were analyzed according to the standard procedures for chemical composition (AOAC 2000, Van-Soest et al. 1991). Procedure of in vitro gas production was performed according to Menke and Steingass (1988). Rumen fluid was obtained from three fistulated Baluchi male lamb before morning feeding. The DM degradation data were fitted to the exponential equation p = a + b (1 - e-ct). The in vitro dry matter, NDF and organic matter digestibility were determined according to the Arroquy et al (2005) procedure. Test samples were incubated for different hrs and then filtered through the nylon cloth with the pore size of 44 microns. The remaining materials were dried at 60 °C for 72 hrs and utilized for the subsequent analysis according to the procedure. In vitro gas production was completed according to the procedure described by Menke and Steingass (1988). Each sample, both original forages and insoluble residues, weighing about 200 mg, were put into 100 ml <b>calibrated</b> glass <b>syringes</b> (FORTUNA®, Häberle Labortechnik, Germany) together with 30 ml rumen liquid media solution on a 1 : 2 ratio.

Two blanks and a standard hay sample of known gas production were included in each run. Results and Discussion NDF content of Kochia scoparia without salinity (irrigate with tap water) was higher than that for Kochia samples irrigated with various levels of salinity.
