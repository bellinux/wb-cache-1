In the majority of cases CPD systems are points-based where physicists are awarded a number of points for each activity they participate in. There is a requirement that they accumulate a number of points for various activities over a set number of years. In other systems where there is an emphasis on quality of CPD rather than quantity, physicists just keep a record of their activities which are audited periodically. It is difficult to achieve a ‘perfect’ system that balances the amount and quality of CPD undertaken by an individual. However, guidelines to how to assess CPD can be developed...|$|R

The education of medical radiation physics in Sweden has traditionally had a high international reputation, and goes back as an academic education to the mid- 1950 s. ‘Medical Physicist’ became a protected professional title and a state-registered health care profession in 1999. Physicists must now hold a licence to practise any sub-area of the profession, that is, diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance tomography, or radiation therapy. In addition, the medical physicist must obtain expert skills and knowledge in radiation protection of both ionising and non-ionising radiation.

40|$|Abstract Current {{clinical}} {{guidelines for the}} management of radiotherapy patients having either a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (both CIEDs: Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices) do not cover modern radiotherapy techniques and do not take the patient’s perspective into account. Available data on the frequency and cause of CIED failure during radiation therapy are limited and do not converge. The Dutch Society of Radiotherapy and Oncology (NVRO) initiated a multidisciplinary task group consisting of <b>clinical</b> <b>physicists,</b> cardiologists, radiation oncologists, pacemaker and ICD technologists to develop evidence based consensus guidelines {{for the management of}} CIED patients. CIED patients receiving radiotherapy should be categorised based on the chance of device failure and the clinical consequences in case of failure. Although there is no clear cut-off point nor a clear linear relationship, in general, chances of device failure increase with increasing doses. Clinical consequences of device failures like loss of pacing, carry the most risks in pacing dependent patients. Cumulative dose and pacing dependency have been combined to categorise patients into low, medium and high risk groups. Patients receiving a dose of less than 2 Gy to their CIED are categorised as low risk, unless pacing dependent since then they are medium risk. Between 2 and 10 Gy, all patients are categorised as medium risk, while above 10 Gy every patient is categorised as high risk. Measures to secure patient safety are described for each category. This guideline for the management of CIED patients receiving radiotherapy takes into account modern radiotherapy techniques, CIED technology, the patients’ perspective and the practical aspects necessary for the safe management of these patients. The guideline is implemented in The Netherlands in 2012 and is expected to find clinical acceptance outside The Netherlands as well. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{evaluate}} a noninvasive method to assess rotation time in modern commercial computed tomography (CT) systems. The rotation time was measured at a selected nominal rotation time (400 ms) utilizing two types of solid-state detectors: the RTI's CT Dose Profiler (CTDP) and Unfors' Xi (Xi) probes. Either CTDP or Xi was positioned on the inner cover of the gantry and a sheet of lead (1 mm thick) placed on top of the detector. Since a pair of two successive peaks is used to determine the gantry rotation time, by necessity the helical scan must be employed. Upon completion of the data acquisition, these peak times were determined with the dedicated software to obtain rotation time. The average rotation time obtained with CTDP and Xi operated under the dedicated software was found to be 400. 6 and 400. 5 ms, respectively. The detector for this measurement need not be specifically designed for CT dosimetry. The measurements of CT scanner rotation time can be accomplished with a radiation probe designed for the CT application or a conventional radiation probe designed for radiography and fluoroscopy applications. It is also noteworthy to point out that the measurement results are in good agreement between the two radiation detector systems. Finally, <b>clinical</b> medical <b>physicists</b> should be aware of the accuracy and precision of gantry rotation time, and take into consideration for QA where and when applicable.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the dose-volume variations of planning target volume (PTV) and organs-at-risk (OARs) in prostate volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) when varying collimator angle. The collimator angle has the largest impact and is worth considering, so, its awareness is essential for a planner to produce an optimal prostate VMAT plan in a reasonable time frame. Methods : Single-arc VMAT plans at different collimator angles (0 o, 15 o, 30 o, 45 o, 60 o, 75 o and 90 o) were created systematically using a Harold heterogeneous pelvis phantom. The conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), gradient index (GI), machine monitor units (MUs), dose-volume histogram and mean and maximum dose of the PTV were calculated and analyzed. On the other hand, the dose-volume histogram and mean and maximum doses of the OARs such as the bladder, rectum and femoral heads for different collimator angles were determined from the plans. Results: There was no significant difference, based on the planned dose-volume evaluation criteria, found in the VMAT optimizations for all studied collimator angles. A higher CI (0. 53) and lower HI (0. 064) were found in the 45 o collimator angle. In addition, the 15 o collimator angle provided a lower value of HI similar to the 45 o collimator angle. Collimator angles of 75 o and 90 o were found to be good for rectum sparing, and collimator angles of 75 o and 30 o were found to be good for sparing of right and left femur, respectively. The PTV dose coverage for each plan was comparatively independent of the collimator angle. Conclusion: Our study indicates that the dosimetric results provide support and guidance to allow the <b>clinical</b> radiation <b>physicists</b> to make careful decisions in implementing suitable collimator angles to improve the PTV coverage and OARs sparing in prostate VMAT. </p...|$|R

Dosimetric uncertainties during treatment delivery are considered briefly but are not included in the detailed analysis. For low- and high-energy brachytherapy sources of low dose rate and high dose rate, a combined dosimetric uncertainty < 5 % (k= 1) is estimated, which is consistent with prior literature estimates.

These recommendations include the use of the GUM and NIST reports, a requirement of constancy of manufacturer source design, dosimetry investigator guidelines, provision of the lowest uncertainty for patient treatment dosimetry, and the establishment of an action level based on dosimetric uncertainty. These recommendations reflect the guidance of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) and the Groupe Européen de Curiethérapie–European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) for their members and may also be used as guidance to manufacturers and regulatory agencies in developing good manufacturing practices for sources used in routine clinical treatments...|$|R
40|$|In several western {{countries}} {{there is a}} formal medical physicists’ training scheme after {{which a lot of}} graduates are employed in government hospitals where there is a formal, national salary scale and levels of responsibility through which physicists can expect to move. Those who are employed in private institutions are usually employed on contacts that are somewhat similar to those in the government institutions, but with perhaps a higher salary level but with an expectation that they will have a higher output. This is often not the case in AFOMP countries, especially in developing countries where there may be very few medical physicists. There may not be a “recognised” path that a <b>clinical</b> medical <b>physicist</b> would expect to follow from being a trainee/registrar/resident to a chief physicist in charge of the physics in an imaging or radiation oncology or medical physics department. There is often no official salary scale, limited access to continuing professional development, and little concept of how their careers might be expected to progress, especially amongst administrators. Those countries that do define a career path for medical physicists usually do so through a nation- or state-wide employment contract (or award) negotiated between the profession and the government. These {{can be used as a}} model for career planning elsewhere. A survey done of the career pathways in other countries showed that where awards exist, often they are constructed as a multilevel system consisting of, for example, four levels: physicist, senior physicist, principal physicist and chief physicist. Minimum education qualifications and experience are often needed to enter each level, along with a compilation of achievements and an expectation that the physicist will be able to fulfil the requirements of the level. If possible, such systems should be set up in all AFOMP countries where this is possible so that medical physicists will be able to see where their career will lead and how far they have progressed. Sometimes this can be difficult to set up because being a medical physicist is not a government-recognised profession in some countries, even though it is recognised by the International Labour Organization. To ensure that physicists’ careers will develop in a way that will fully develop their potential, it is important that issues such as have proper education and training, sufficient access to continuing professional development, interaction with physicists within and outside their own institution. Also, for those who temporarily leave the profession, a pathway for them to re-enter must be available. Career progression is something that all AFOMP National Member Organizations must address if the potential of their members is to be properly developed and their skills to be fully utilized...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} factors {{determining the}} possibility of role development for therapeutic radiographers in Hong Kong public hospitals. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to all ranks of radiographers, <b>clinical</b> oncologists, medical <b>physicists</b> and nurses in four clinical oncology departments in local public hospitals. Information was sought on role development {{and the nature of}} extended role tasks that should be undertaken by therapeutic radiographers. Both open and closed questions were used to ascertain views. Individual, semi-structured interviews were used to explore further opinions of therapeutic radiographers. For open-ended questions, data were analysed thematically by grouping similar opinions, while for closed questions data were analysed by descriptive statistics and independent-samples t-test/Levene's test for homogeneity of variances. Results and Discussion: In total, 132 out of 285 questionnaires were returned (46. 32 %). Subjects (77. 10 %) expressed views that role development in therapeutic radiography (RT) would {{have a positive impact on}} oncology services within the region. Medical dominance was highlighted as the main barrier to role development (mean: 2. 86; SD: 1. 78). Radiographers would tend not to extend their roles by taking up tasks that were performed by oncologists: for example, radiographers would not want to prescribe drugs to patients with radiation side-effects (57. 58 %), while 83. 33 % of oncologists also disagreed with this being performed by radiographers. Other professionals (nurses and medical physicists) held a reserved view in delegating their tasks to radiographers, even after accredited clinical training. Conclusion: Role development in RT should relieve the increasing workload of the entire clinical oncology department. It also increases the status of therapeutic radiographers within the health care setting, which is beneficial for the whole profession. However, efforts must be made by all health professionals within the department to ensure that the greatest effectiveness can be achieved from such developments. School of Optometr...|$|R
40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) is {{a valuable}} technology to the healthcare enterprise {{as evidenced by the}} more than 70 million CT exams performed every year. As a result, CT has become the largest contributor to population doses amongst all medical imaging modalities that utilize man-made ionizing radiation. Acknowledging the fact that ionizing radiation poses a health risk, there exists the need {{to strike a balance between}} diagnostic benefit and radiation dose. Thus, to ensure that CT scanners are optimally used in the clinic, an understanding and characterization of image quality and radiation dose are essential. The state-of-the-art in both image quality characterization and radiation dose estimation in CT are dependent on phantom based measurements reflective of systems and protocols. For image quality characterization, measurements are performed on inserts imbedded in static phantoms and the results are ascribed to clinical CT images. However, the key objective for image quality assessment should be its quantification in clinical images; that is the only characterization of image quality that clinically matters as it is most directly related to the actual quality of clinical images. Moreover, for dose estimation, phantom based dose metrics, such as CT dose index (CTDI) and size specific dose estimates (SSDE), are measured by the scanner and referenced as an indicator for radiation exposure. However, CTDI and SSDE are surrogates for dose, rather than dose per-se. Currently there are several software packages that track the CTDI and SSDE associated with individual CT examinations. This is primarily the result of two causes. The first is due to bureaucracies and governments pressuring clinics and hospitals to monitor the radiation exposure to individuals in our society. The second is due to the personal concerns of patients who are curious about the health risks associated with the ionizing radiation exposure they receive as a result of their diagnostic procedures. An idea that resonates with <b>clinical</b> imaging <b>physicists</b> is that patients come to the clinic to acquire quality images so they can receive a proper diagnosis, not to be exposed to ionizing radiation. Thus, while it is important to monitor the dose to patients undergoing CT examinations, it is equally, if not more important to monitor the image quality of the clinical images generated by the CT scanners throughout the hospital. The purposes of the work presented in this thesis are threefold: (1) to develop and validate a fully automated technique to measure spatial resolution in clinical CT images, (2) to develop and validate a fully automated technique to measure image contrast in clinical CT images, and (3) to develop a fully automated technique to estimate radiation dose (not surrogates for dose) from a variety of clinical CT protocols.
