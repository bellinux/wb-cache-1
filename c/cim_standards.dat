30|$|The Renewable Energy Directive {{requires}} the EU {{member states to}} fulfill at least 20 % of their total energy needs {{with a wide range}} of renewable energy technologies by 2020 (European Commission 2018). More renewables often require smart grid operation with an increasing application of ICT systems exchanging information among one another. The Common Information Model (CIM) was developed to meet the requirements on a well-defined and extensible data format, nowadays used by many entities in the energy sector, such as the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). CIM was standardized in IEC 61970 (Energy Management), IEC 61968 (Distribution Management), and IEC 62325 (Energy Market Communications) (IEC 2012 a; 2012 b; 2014) as part of the IEC/TR 62357 reference architecture (IEC 2016). Among others, these <b>CIM</b> <b>standards</b> define an ontology, i. e. classes of virtual objects, representing real-world objects, and their relations (Uslar et al. 2012). Most important for this paper is IEC 61970 which defines things needed for the representation of power grids (i. e. the topologies with equipment, lines, etc.), used by grid operators as a software tool independent data format.|$|E
40|$|The IEC Common Information Model (CIM) is {{of central}} {{importance}} in enabling smart grid interoperability. Its continual development aims {{to meet the}} needs of the smart grid for semantic understanding and knowledge representation for a widening domain of resources and processes. With smart grid evolution the importance of information and data management has become an increasingly pressing issue not only because far more data is being generated using modern sensing, control and measuring devices but also because information is now becoming recognised as the ‘integral component ’ that facilitates the optimal flexibility required of the smart grid. This thesis looks at the impacts of CIM implementation upon the landscape of smart grid issues and presents research from within National Grid contributing to three key areas in support of further CIM deployment. Taking the issue of Enterprise Information Management first, an information management framework is presented for CIM deployment at National Grid. Following this the development and demonstration of a novel secure cloud computing platform to handle such information is described. Power system application (PSA) models of the grid are partial knowledge representations of a shared reality. To develop the completeness of our understanding of this reality it is necessary to combine these representations. The second research contribution reports on a novel methodology for a CIMbased model repository to align PSA representations and provide a knowledge resource for building utility business intelligence of the grid. The third contribution addresses the need for greater integration of information relating to energy storage, an essential aspect of smart energy management. It presents the strategic rationale for integrated energy modeling and a novel extension to the existing <b>CIM</b> <b>standards</b> for modeling grid-scale energy storage.

40|$|AbstractCIM(Common Information Model) descrybed by IEC 61970 / 61968 {{standards}} {{is recognized as}} the Smart Grid ontology, while Chinese localized standards of the IEC 61970 series are published as DL/T 890 series and are widely applied to power management systems throughout China. The CIM series standards define an application program interface (API) for energy management system (EMS). One core part of the {{standards is}} IEC 61970 - 301, which defines the CIM base set of packages which provide a logical view of the functional aspects of an EMS. Also, there are {{other parts of the}} standards which define logical views of the parts related to EMS, such as IEC 61970 - 302 and IEC 61968 - 11. Although each part of the standards is defined as a standalone UML (Unified Modeling Language) model, a unified UML model in one UML file is maintained by IEC TC 57. However, as each part of the standards and its partitive ontology model are developed by different working groups of the committee and are at different standard statuses, it is necessary to provide a continuous maintenance for the CIM ontology publicly and worldwide. Difficulties to realize the continuous CIM ontology management are caused by the present CIM model. Some typical insufficiencies of the existing CIM model are described in [1]. E. g., CIM model has a lack of version information and no version control mechanism for each entity is provided in the <b>CIM</b> <b>standards</b> so that the data integrity between ontologies of new version and old version is not guaranteed. In this paper, to achieve a continuous CIM ontology management, at first, a CIM model is transformed to the IEC 62656 model which provides a methodology to overcome the current CIM weakness. This paper will focus on the principle of transformation of CIM UML model to the IEC 62656 model. In addition the prime advantages brought about by the CIM on the IEC 62656 model such as CIM localization, customization and validation are explained. Furthermore, an evolution- mechanism integrated CIM ontology database manage- ment system via the IEC 62656 model is introduced...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{provision}} of quality-assured IT services through a service provider requires that all IT components {{involved in these}} services can be managed in an efficient and effective way. The necessary management infrastructure must be adapted to these IT components and must be standard-based to allow its integration into an overall management environment. The broad spectrum of applications differing in functionality and architecture together {{with the need for}} a deep correlation of the management infrastructure with the internal structure and processes of an application make it difficult to use pre-defined application management solutions off-the-shelf. The development process described in this paper addresses the problem by integrating the development of the management infrastructure into the software development process. The integration assures that the management infrastructure is adapted to the application to be managed. The infrastructure, including the management model as its core component, is based on the Common Information Model (<b>CIM)</b> <b>standard.</b> To support the development of the management model, a management design pattern catalog is introduced, that provides CIM-based patterns for the definition of standardized management models. The use of this catalog is demonstrated by an extension to the management model for the distributed Enterprise Resource Plannin...|$|R

Initial results are promising {{with regard to the}} applicability of our model-based approach, with the proposed solution being suitable for reducing costs of utilizing information from different DSO systems by standardizing their data models and interfaces. As the platforms employs the CIM, data exchange is independent from proprietary data models. Currently, we employ subsets of the CIM, i.e. CIM profiles, for source systems, and only utilize entities contained in the <b>CIM</b> <b>standard.</b> However, for future work, it has to be investigated to which degree the CIM can cover required entities in order to describe the DSO domain sufficiently complete, without requiring proprietary extensions. In fact, as CIM development continues, efforts to establish a standardized CIM profile for DSOs (analogous to the CGMES profile of the ENTSO-E for transmission system operators which currently dominates application landscapes), which covers all requirements of the DSO domain, will be vital. Furthermore, currently, new CIM versions are provided without instructions for migrating models from one version to another, which complicates the maintenance of existing models. Here, future work has to investigate whether our model-based approach can support migration from different CIM versions.|$|R

A concrete outcome of this thesis is an integration of the ABB MicroSCADA Pro DMS 600 distribution management system and a work management system.

The latter aspect of the semantics is achieved by incorporating exponential smoothing prediction techniques into the truth function for statements of our language. The semantics is generic over the aspects of an application that are represented by states and state transitions. This enables the language to be used to describe a wide range of nonfunctional properties for runtime verification and prediction purposes.
