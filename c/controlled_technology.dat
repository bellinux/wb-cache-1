In the Eastern Bloc, typewriters (together with printing presses, copy machines, and later computer printers) were a <b>controlled</b> <b>technology,</b> with secret police in charge of maintaining files of the typewriters and their owners. In the Soviet Union, the First Department of each organization sent data on organization's typewriters to the KGB. This posed a significant risk for dissidents and samizdat authors. In Romania, according to State Council Decree No. 98 of March 28, 1983, owning a typewriter, both by businesses or by private persons, was subject to an approval given by the local police authorities. [...] People previously convicted of any crime or those who because of their behaviour were considered to be [...] "a danger to public order or to the security of the state" [...] were refused approval. In addition, once a year, typewriter owners had to take the typewriter to the local police station, where they would be asked to type down a sample of all the typewriter's characters. It was also forbidden to borrow, lend, or repair typewriters other than at the places that had been authorized by the police.|$|E
