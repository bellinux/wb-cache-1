40|$|Crown rust {{is a major}} oat disease. Partial {{resistance}} is a promising option for disease control for being potentially more durable than complete resistance. The objective of this study <b>was</b> <b>to</b> investigate the inheritance of partial resistance <b>to</b> <b>crown</b> rust in oat populations that were derived from a cross between cultivar URS 21 (partially resistant) and URS 22 (susceptible). In 2010, the six basic generations (P 1, P 2, F 1, F 2, BC 1, and BC 2) were sown in the field, and resistance <b>to</b> <b>crown</b> rust <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> using the area under the disease progress curve, normalized and corrected for each individual plant. The inheritance of the trait partial resistance was oligogenic, indicating the presence of genes with both major and minor phenotypic effects. Additive and dominance effects <b>were</b> important <b>to</b> determine the partial resistance and the heritability estimates were high, indicating the possibility of selection for resistance in early generations...|$|R

50|$|To {{enable the}} {{stainless}} steel <b>crown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> placed on the tooth, there must be sufficient space between the teeth. If this space is not currently available, orthodontic separators may be placed between the tooth indicated for the Hall Technique and adjacent teeth (see image 1). If the placement <b>is</b> impaired due <b>to</b> interproximal breakdown a temporary restorative material may <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> build up the contact point, to allow the effective placement of separators. However temporary restorative material is not a common practice of the Hall Technique, and case selection appropriateness should be considered. The separators are generally placed 3-5 days prior to the placement of {{the stainless steel}} <b>crown</b> <b>to</b> space <b>to</b> <b>be</b> created. The clinician will provide advice on this procedure and how to proceed if these fall out prior to the next appointment.|$|R
