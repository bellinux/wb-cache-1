5|$|Bean dip {{is a type}} of {{dipping sauce}} made using beans or refried beans as a primary ingredient. It is {{typically}} served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with other foods such as crackers and crudités. Various types of beans are used, and fresh-cooked, canned or flaked beans can be used. Various additional ingredients are used in its preparation, such as onion, garlic, chili peppers and spices, and it is sometimes garnished with some ingredients. Bean dip can be served <b>cold,</b> <b>at</b> room temperature, or hot. Bean dip is sometimes used as an ingredient in the preparation of other dishes such as burritos and quesadillas.|$|E
5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter <b>cold</b> <b>at</b> night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Letting bean dip {{sit for a}} {{while before}} serving can {{increase}} the intermingling of flavors in the dish. Bean dip can be served <b>cold,</b> <b>at</b> room temperature, or as a hot dish. Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked at a later time, and can also be prepared using a slow cooker and served in the appliance. Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E
5|$|Sajak and White have starred on the {{syndicated}} version continuously as host and hostess, respectively, since it began, except for very limited occasions. During {{two weeks in}} January 1991, Tricia Gist, the girlfriend and future wife of Griffin's son Tony, filled in for White {{when she and her}} new husband, restaurateur George San Pietro, were honeymooning. Gist returned for the week of episodes airing March 11 through 15, 1991, because White had a <b>cold</b> <b>at</b> the time of taping. On an episode in November 1996, when Sajak proved unable to host the bonus round segment because of laryngitis, he and White traded places for that segment. On the March 4, 1997 episode, Rosie O'Donnell co-hosted the third round with White after O'Donnell's name was used in a puzzle.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly <b>cold</b> <b>at</b> only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze. The reality has turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.|$|E

50|$|Because of its temperature, the {{atmosphere}} emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes <b>colder</b> <b>at</b> night at higher elevations.|$|R

25|$|Thermal nociceptors are {{activated}} by noxious heat or <b>cold</b> <b>at</b> various temperatures. There are specific nociceptor transducers {{that are responsible}} for how and if the specific nerve ending responds to the thermal stimulus. The first to be discovered was TRPV1, and it has a threshold that coincides with the heat pain temperature of 42°C. Other temperature in the warm–hot range is mediated by more than one TRP channel. Each of these channels express a particular C-terminal domain that corresponds to the warm–hot sensitivity. The interactions between all these channels and how the temperature level is determined to be above the pain threshold are unknown at this time. The cool stimuli are sensed by TRPM8 channels. Its C-terminal domain differs from the heat sensitive TRPs. Although this channel corresponds to cool stimuli, it is still unknown whether it also contributes in the detection of intense cold. An interesting finding related to cold stimuli is that tactile sensibility and motor function deteriorate while pain perception persists.|$|E

500|$|In 1920, the National Geographic Society {{began an}} archaeological {{examination}} of Chaco Canyon and appointed Neil Judd, then 32, {{to head the}} project. After a reconnaissance trip that year, Judd proposed to excavate Pueblo Bonito, the largest ruin at Chaco. Beginning in 1921, Judd spent seven field seasons at Chaco. Living and working conditions were spartan at best. In his memoirs, Judd noted dryly that [...] "Chaco Canyon has its limitations as a summer resort". By 1925, Judd's excavators had removed 100,000 short tons of overburden, using a team of [...] "35 or more Indians, ten white men, and eight or nine horses".

500|$|The Quadrophenia tour {{started in}} Stoke on Trent in October and was {{immediately}} beset with problems. Daltrey resisted Townshend's wish to add Joe Cocker's keyboardist Chris Stainton (who played on the album) to the touring band. As a compromise, Townshend assembled the keyboard and synthesizer parts on backing tapes, as such a strategy had been successful with [...] "Baba O'Riley" [...] and [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again". Unfortunately, the technology was not sophisticated {{enough to deal with}} the demands of the music; added to this issue, tour rehearsals had been interrupted due to an argument that culminated in Daltrey punching Townshend and knocking him out <b>cold.</b> <b>At</b> a gig in Newcastle, the tapes completely malfunctioned, and an enraged Townshend dragged sound-man Bob Pridden on-stage, screamed at him, kicked all the amps over and partially destroyed the backing tapes. The show was abandoned for an [...] "oldies" [...] set, {{at the end of which}} Townshend smashed his guitar and Moon kicked over his drumkit. The Independent described this gig as one of the worst of all time. The US tour started on 20 November at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California; Moon passed out during [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] and during [...] "Magic Bus". Townshend asked the audience, [...] "Can anyone play the drums?—I mean somebody good." [...] An audience member, Scot Halpin, filled in for the rest of the show. After a show in Montreal, the band (except for Daltrey, who retired to bed early) caused so much damage to their hotel room, including destroying an antique painting and ramming a marble table through a wall, that federal law enforcement arrested them.|$|E
