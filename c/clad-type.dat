40|$|AbstractSumitomo Electric (SEI) {{has been}} {{involved}} in the development of 66 kV-class HTS cables using REBCO wires. One of the technical targets is to reduce the AC loss to less than 2 W/m/phase at 5 kA. SEI has developed a <b>clad-type</b> textured metal substrate with lower magnetization loss than NiW substrate. REBCO tapes 30 mm-wide were slit into 4 mm-wide strips, and these strips were wound spirally on a former with small gaps. The measured AC loss of the manufactured cable was 1. 8 W/m/phase at 5 kA, achieving the AC loss goal...|$|E
40|$|Activities in {{a program}} to test and develop {{prototype}} fission-heated thermionic cells for space uses are reported. During the period, in-reactor tests were conducted on two W-clad U-bearing fuel emitters and one unclad type. Fuel emitter proof tests were also conducted which demonstrated 1000 -hr operational capability of W-clad systems. Output power density and the temperature of heat rejection {{were found to have}} major effects on the weight- performance characteristics of the system. Advances in techniques related to W vapor deposition are reported. Descriptions of the fuel-emitter development, cell design and development, and testing of out-of-pile and in-pile cells are included. Operation of the <b>clad-type</b> test cells at design power and temperature led to selection of these cells for planned long-duration in-pile tests. (J. R. D. ...|$|E

The measured AC loss of the manufactured cable was 1. 8 W/m/phase at 5 kA, achieving the AC loss goal. Another important target was to manage fault current. The copper protection layers were designed based on simulation findings. Fault current tests (max. 31. 5 kA, 2 sec) showed that the designed HTS cable has the required withstanding performance. The development of the elemental technologies was finished on schedule, and a 15 m-long HTS cable system will be constructed to demonstrate that it meets all the required specifications...|$|E
