25|$|The soliton {{model of}} a ball {{lightning}} was further developed. It was suggested that a ball lightning is based on spherically symmetric nonlinear oscillations of charged particles in plasma – the analogue of a spatial Langmuir soliton. These oscillations were described in both classical and quantum approaches. It {{was found that the}} most intense plasma oscillations occur in the central regions of a ball lightning. It is suggested that bound states of radially oscillating charged particles with oppositely oriented spins – the analogue of Cooper pairs – can appear inside a ball lightning. This phenomenon, in its turn, can lead to a superconducting phase in a ball lightning. The idea of the superconductivity in a ball lightning was considered earlier. The possibility of the existence of a ball lightning with a <b>composite</b> <b>core</b> was also discussed in this model.|$|E
500|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind the}} <b>composite</b> <b>core</b> {{was to make}} better use of the available fissionable material. The use of uranium-235 in an implosion weapon instead of the inefficient gun type Little Boy was an obvious development. However, while plutonium was more expensive and harder to produce than uranium-235, it fissions faster, because it makes better use of the neutrons its fission produces. On the other hand, the slower reaction of uranium-235 permits the assembly of super-critical masses, making it theoretically possible to produce weapons with high yields. By July 1945, Oppenheimer and Groves were considering [...] using both materials in a <b>composite</b> <b>core</b> containing [...] of plutonium and [...] of uranium-235. The composite cores became available in 1946. Los Alamos' priority then became {{the development of an}} all-uranium-235 core. By January 1948 the national stockpile contained 50 cores, of which 36 were composite Christy cores, nine were plutonium Christy cores, and five were composite levitated cores. Testing the new levitated, composite and uranium-235 cores would require at least three test firings.|$|E

Six crowns were adhesively luted to dentin stubs, six to endodontically treated teeth with adhesive titanium posts and adhesive <b>composite</b> <b>cores,</b> and six to adhesive <b>composite</b> <b>cores</b> without posts. Another ten unprepared teeth served as a control. All restored teeth were subjected to long-term occlusal and thermal stresses. The marginal adaptation was evaluated in the SEM before and after loading. Load to fracture was recorded {{at the end of}} the stress. Before stressing, 72. 2 to 85. 0 %, and after stressing, 51. 9 to 66. 2 % of "continuous margin" were recorded at the dentin-luting composite interface. The best results after stressing were achieved with crowns luted to adhesive <b>composite</b> <b>cores</b> without titanium posts. At the luting composite-composite crown interface, 61. 6 to 88. 7 % of "continuous margin" before and 57. 7 to 75. 5 % after stressing were recorded. The required load to fracture the restored teeth ranged from 72. 0 to 89. 2 % of the unrestored, unloaded control.

Secondly, short core segment failed to simulate mass transfer mechanism due to early gas breakthrough and more oil remained in pores. Thirdly, longer contacting time between CO 2 and oil strengthens the vaporizing and dissolution mechanism which helps to decrease oil viscosity and IFT. However, it is should be noticed, long <b>composite</b> <b>cores</b> and new data processing method in this paper improved CO 2 –oil relative permeability curves obtained in laboratory, {{but it is still}} failed to simulate the fully miscible flooding in natural cores.|$|R

30|$|Relative {{permeability}} curves {{are crucial}} parameters for reservoir engineer and reservoir commercial simulator to predict reservoir performance throughout {{the life of}} a reservoir, but meet difficulties in laboratory to obtain reliable data under miscible conditions {{due to the lack of}} proper testing and formulation methods. Up to now, most relative permeability curves are measured in short core segments by core flooding, which can hardly display miscible flooding features for early gas breakthrough and insufficient contacting time between CO 2 and oil. In addition, the commonly used analytical and semi-analytical data processing methods are not suitable for miscible flooding for ignoring the mechanism of vaporizing and dissolving mechanism. In this study, slim tubes (101 and 1, 528  cm in length) and long <b>composite</b> <b>cores</b> (74.46  cm in length) instead of conventional core segments were used to acquire reliable experimental data of CO 2 flooding under miscible or near miscible condition. Then, using improved empirical Corey model which assumes shape defining factor bog is a function of displacement pressure P combined with history-matching method to calculate relative permeability curves under near miscible and miscible conditions. Results indicated core length is another important parameter to simulate miscible flooding other than pressure, temperature and oil composition, and using long <b>composite</b> <b>cores</b> and improved data processing method more reliable data can be obtained compared with conventional measured method. It is found residual oil saturation in short slim tube is 16.25  % higher than that of long slim tube and CO 2 relative permeability is lower in short slim tube/core segment than in long slime tube/long <b>composite</b> <b>cores.</b>|$|R

The added aluminum content helps reduce line losses by 25 to 40% compared to other conductors of the same diameter and weight, depending upon electric current. The carbon core conductor's reduced thermal sag allows it to carry up to twice the current ("ampacity") compared to all-aluminum conductor (AAC) or ACSR.|$|E

RESULTS Forty-one cast posts and <b>cores</b> and 31 <b>composite</b> <b>cores</b> were examined clinically and radiologically after an average observation period of 8. 56 (SD 1. 45) years. Four teeth were extracted during the observation period, and 2 more were extracted at the time of the examination.
