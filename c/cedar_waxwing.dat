5|$|The {{range of}} the Bohemian waxwing {{overlaps}} those of both {{the other members of}} the genus. The <b>cedar</b> <b>waxwing</b> is smaller than the Bohemian; it has browner upperparts, a white undertail and a white line above the black eye patch. Adult cedar waxwings have a yellowish belly, and all ages have less strongly patterned wings than the Bohemian waxwing. The Japanese waxwing is easily distinguished from its relatives; it has a red terminal band to the tail, the black mask extends up the rear of the crest, and there is no yellow stripe or red tips on the wings.|$|E

5|$|The {{waxwings}} are a family, Bombycillidae, of short-tailed stocky {{birds with}} soft plumage, a head crest and distinctively patterned wings and tails. There are three species, the Bohemian, cedar, and Japanese waxwings. DNA studies and shared {{features such as}} a relatively large size, grey underparts and similar undertail patterns suggest that the Japanese and Bohemian waxwings are most closely related within the genus. Although only the cedar and Bohemian waxwings normally have red tips on their wing feathers, this feature is occasionally shown by the Japanese waxwing, suggesting that this was originally a whole-family characteristic that has been lost in one species, rather than an indicator of a close relationship. DNA analysis confirms that the <b>cedar</b> <b>waxwing</b> diverged early from {{the other members of}} the family. Outside the genus, the closest relatives of the waxwings are believed to be the silky-flycatchers, the palmchat, and the grey hypocolius, all of which have sometimes been included in the Bombycillidae.|$|E

50|$|The {{waxwings}} are passerine birds classified in {{the genus}} Bombycilla.

50|$|Phoradendron {{species are}} hemiparasites which {{produce their own}} {{chlorophyll}} but rely on the host plant to provide water, minerals, and other nutrients.

Germinating seeds produce a radicle, a holdfast, and eventually the germinated seeds produce haustoria. The haustorium is a root-like structure that penetrates the host plant's bark and cambium, reaching the xylem and phloem where it extracts water and minerals, primarily carbon and nitrogen compounds.
