Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to control pre-production by commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. Arad said of the goal for control, [...] "When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost. That isn't working for us.

In the following December, Marvel Entertainment Group went through a reorganization plan, including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment. By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the eventual films X-Men (2000), Daredevil (2003), Elektra (2005) and Fantastic Four (2005).

40|$|The {{replacement}} of a chloride in OsH 2 Cl 2 (P iPr 3) 2 (1) by a hydride, to afford OsH 3 Cl(PiPr 3) 2 (2), produces {{dramatic changes in}} the behavior of the system. Complex 1 hydrogenates the sterically most hindered C-C double bond of gem-disubstituted allenes. In contrast, the trihydride 2 reacts with 1, 1 -dimethylallene and 1 -methyl- 1 -(trimethylsilyl) allene to give the alkenyl derivates OsH 2 Cl{C(CH 3) - C(CH 3) R}(PiPr 3) 2 (R = CH 3 (3), SiMe 3 (4)), which do not undergo reductive elimination of olefin in spite of the coplanar cis disposition of the metalated carbon atom and one of the hydride ligands. The X-ray structure of 3 proves that the α-methyl substituent of the alkenyl group <b>cancels</b> the unsaturated <b>character</b> of the metal center. Complex 2 also reacts with ethyl allenecarboxylate. The reaction leads to the metallafuran OsH 2 Cl{κ 2 C,O-[C(CH 3) -CHC(O) OEt]}(P iPr 3) 2 (5), which has been also characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. DFT calculations suggest that the formation of 3 and 4 is a consequence of the coplanar cisoid disposition of the hydride ligand and the CH 2 group of the allene in a hydride-dihydrogen-π-allene intermediate. The DFT calculations also show that 3 and 4 are thermodynamic sinks and that the reductive elimination of the olefin is kinetically disfavored. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

Some notable {{examples}} include the Church Lady and Hans and Franz from Saturday Night Live, the Gumbys from Monty Python's Flying Circus, and Bob and Doug McKenzie from SCTV. However, the characters are not always limited to their own sketches. Sometimes, characters from a recurring sketch go on to appear in other sketches, or develop into their own TV shows. For example, when The Carol Burnett Show was <b>canceled</b> the central <b>character</b> of a popular recurring sketch called The Family, Thelma [...] "Mama" [...] Harper, went on to have her own show Mama's Family. Also, recurring characters in sketch comedy shows can go on to have their own movies. This is especially true with Saturday Night Live which has had many recurring characters turn into movies such as Stuart Smalley, Wayne and Garth of Wayne's World, The Blues Brothers, and The Ladies Man. Recurring characters may even revisit shows long after the actor who played them has left the cast, for example, the character Mary Katherine Gallagher was portrayed by Molly Shannon when she hosted Saturday Night Live in 2007, six years after she left the cast. Sometimes a recurring character from one show appears on another show, such as when Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis hosted Saturday Night Live in 1983 and portrayed Bob and Doug MacKenzie, or when Emily Litella (portrayed by Gilda Radner) from Saturday Night Live appeared on The Muppet Show in 1978.

40|$|Michael Meeuwis, Astrid De Wit & Frank Brisard Performatives and (im) {{perfective}} aspect (lecture) {{his paper}} represents the first (methodological) {{step in a}} cross-linguistic study on the relation between performativity and aspect. It starts from the observation that verbs, when used as performatives, are typically inflected with (present) perfective aspect. This can be motivated {{on the basis of}} the indexical quality of performatively used verbs: the activity referred to by performatives (such as I promise to come) can be said to coincide exactly with the act of referring to it. Thus, we may say that the denoted situation (the speech act of promising) is in fact constituted by the speech event (Langacker 2001). As a result, the situation at issue is fully conceptualized at the time of speaking by definition, which would typically trigger perfective aspectual marking: perfective expressions designate situations that are treated as known and closed. Imperfective aspect, in contrast, is associated with construing situations as incomplete and open. For instance, using progressive marking (a kind of imperfective aspect) in an utterance like I’m promising to come has the effect of turning it into a mere description of an ongoing event, thereby <b>canceling</b> its performative <b>character.</b> It is possible, however, that this assumption of a correlation between performativity and perfectivity is biased by a privileging of examples from English, in which performative contexts obligatorily feature the simple present (and the simple present is commonly assumed to have a perfective value; cf. Brinton (1988), Smith (1997 : 110 - 112, 185 - 186), Williams (2002 : 128 - 166) and De Wit et al. (2013)). However, data from Slavic [...] the only language family for which the relation between performativity and aspect has been examined thoroughly (cf. Israeli 2001; Dickey forthcoming) [...] indicate an opposite tendency: most Slavic languages, especially from the eastern branch (such as Russian), almost exclusively allow imperfective verbs in performative contexts. Jaggar (2006) furthermore indicates that performative expressions in Hausa trigger both perfective and imperfective marking. The correlation therefore needs to be checked cross-linguistically, an endeavor that requires a suitable questionnaire offering contexts that are universally accepted as triggering performative uses. Our purpose is to present such a questionnaire and to discuss its methodological potential and limitations. A crucial element will be to elicit and identify performatives without having to resort to aspectual tests, such as in English (present simple vs progressive). By wayof a pilot study, we will also offer our first findings based on native speaker elicitations in Lingala, Turkish and Sranan...|$|R
