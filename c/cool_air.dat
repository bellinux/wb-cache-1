5|$|Kroonland {{began her}} last voyage on the Antwerp route in January 1923, after which she {{underwent}} a refit {{during the first}} half of 1923. The ship was converted to cabin- and third-class passengers only, and was painted white.

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. Heat is {{constantly}} lost from the body. Food products reach {{the heart and}} are processed into new blood, releasing fire during metabolism, which raises the blood temperature too high. That raises the heart temperature, causing lung volume to increase, in turn raising the airflow at the mouth. The <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> brought in through the mouth reduces the heart temperature, so the lung volume accordingly decreases, restoring the temperature to normal.|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} to use Pre-Swirl Nozzles to facilitate getting the turbine blade <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> onboard the rotating disk with minimum pressure loss and reduced temperature. Higher engine OPR's and expanded aircraft operating envelopes have pushed <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperatures {{to the limits}} of current disk materials and are stressing the capability to cool the blade with practical levels of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow. Providing 'Cooled' <b>Cooling</b> <b>Air</b> is one approach being considered to overcome these limitations. This presentation looks at how the introduction of 'Cooled' <b>Cooling</b> <b>Air</b> impacts the design of the Pre-Swirl Nozzles, specifically in relation to the radial location of the nozzles...|$|R
50|$|As air is heated, it expands and {{possesses}} less density (weight {{per unit}} volume) than <b>cooler</b> <b>air.</b> Therefore, the heated air rises and displaces the <b>cooler</b> <b>air</b> (the <b>cooler</b> <b>air</b> descends).

5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} across its path, including in Haiti where precipitation caused devastating mudslides; over 3,000deaths {{were reported in}} the country. Heavy rainfall also occurred during its landfalls on Puerto Rico and Florida, resulting in river flooding. In its strongest landfall, the hurricane produced strong winds across an area earlier affected by Hurricane Frances and, in some locations, by Hurricane Charley. Late in its duration, the combination of moisture from Jeanne and <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> resulted in a tornado outbreak that extended from Georgia through the Mid-Atlantic states.|$|E
40|$|High {{pressure}} {{turbine nozzle}} guide vane of a gas turbine engine, which operates at gas temperatures in excess of 1700 K, employs various cooling techniques to keep the vane within safe operating limits. Even though {{nozzle guide vane}}s are designed using heat transfer co-relations available in published papers and fundamental data, it is required to test the nozzle guide vane to ascertain the surface metal temperature and verify the adequacy of cooling. Adequacy of cooling is quantified by the term cooling effectiveness expressed and as percentage. Cooling effectiveness {{is a function of}} gas temperature, <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature and surface metal temperature. The objective of the current work was to study the effect of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature on <b>cooling</b> effectiveness. Tests were conducted on a high pressure turbine nozzle guide vane. Gas pressure, gas temperature, <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> pressure was kept constant and the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature was varied as a ratio of gas temperature to <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature and its effect on metal temperature studied. It was seen that, over the range of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature tested, <b>cooling</b> effectiveness remained sensibly constant. Such tests also assist in estimating the surface metal temperature of the nozzle guide vane in the engine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIndirect {{evaporative}} cooling system to produce {{cold water and}} indirect {{evaporative cooling}} system to produce <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> are compared in this paper. From the process transformation, to remove the same quantity of indoor heat, the indirect evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> system produces much more cooling energy {{in which more than}} a half is wasted to <b>cool</b> fresh <b>air</b> and also more heat transfer area are used. Also the transportation electricity consumption is much higher when using <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> than using cold water. Two real applications are given, from the field testing data, the system COP of the indirect evaporative cooling system to produce cold water was 4. 6 ∼ 5. 9, which is 1 ∼ 2 higher than the system COP of the system to produce <b>cooling</b> <b>air.</b> Thus, using the indirect evaporative chillers to produce cold water to remove indoor sensible heat is better than using the indirect evaporative air coolers to produce <b>cooling</b> <b>air...</b>|$|R

5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cool</b> <b>air,</b> {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea can usually only occur under somewhat unusual circumstances. Low wind shear and atmospheric instability induced by incursions {{of cold air}} are often required. A majority of medicanes are also accompanied by upper-level troughs, providing energy required for intensifying atmospheric convection—thunderstorms—and heavy precipitation. The baroclinic properties of the Mediterranean region, with high temperature gradients, also provides necessary instability {{for the formation of}} tropical cyclones. Another factor, rising <b>cool</b> <b>air,</b> provides necessary moisture as well. Warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are mostly unnecessary, however, as most medicanes' energy is derived from warmer air temperatures. When these favorable circumstances coincide, the genesis of warm-core Mediterranean tropical cyclones, often from within existing cut-off cold-core lows, is possible in a conducive environment for formation.|$|E
50|$|Cooling {{the leading}} edge of the blade can be difficult, because the {{pressure}} of the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> just inside the cooling hole may not be much different from that of the oncoming gas stream. One solution is to incorporate a cover plate on the disc. This acts as a centrifugal compressor to pressurize the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> before it enters the blade. Another solution is to use an ultra-efficient turbine rim seal to pressurize the area where the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> passes across to the rotating disc.|$|R

5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E

40|$|To reduce {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{emissions}} of road going vehicles, the aerodynamic drag {{is an important}} area to focus on. Reducing aerodynamic drag will lead to reduced fuel consumption and hence decreased CO 2 emissions. A significant element of the aerodynamic drag of a modern passenger car is the cooling drag, which can constitute up to 15 %. Possible solutions to reduce the cooling drag include closing off parts of the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets when {{only a small amount}} of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow is needed. The focus of this study is on the aerodynamic effects closing off the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets have on a modern passenger car. Both full size and scale model experiments were utilized, together with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. Results show that reduction in aerodynamic drag is possible by closing off the lower <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlet and furthermore that this has a noticeable effect on the base pressure. The effect on the base pressure was, however, found to be a little less significant as that caused by completely closing the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets...|$|R
50|$|Recuperative multi-tube coolers {{work with}} {{indirect}} <b>air</b> <b>cooling.</b> That means, {{that there is}} no direct contact between the product to be cooled and the <b>cooling</b> <b>air.</b> The heat is exchanged indirectly via thermal conduction.Ambient air is used as <b>cooling</b> <b>air,</b> which is drawn between the jacket and the tubes. Product and <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> pass through the cooler in counterflow. The product to be cooled falls directly into the product feed housing. By the rotary movement and a little slope of the rotor, the product is conveyed through the cooler. The rotation causes a permanent mixing of the product in the tubes and hence a good heat transfer.|$|R
50|$|The term is {{also used}} to refer to “Cool Power” air intake systems for {{turbocharged}} engines. These systems provide <b>cooler</b> <b>air</b> to the turbocharger and engine, instead of the potentially too-warm air from the engine compartment. <b>Cooler</b> intake <b>air</b> is denser, which means that the engine can produce the same power with less fuel. <b>Cooler</b> <b>air</b> also gives the engine more power for applications such as towing heavy loads up driving up steep grades during the summer. <b>Cooler</b> <b>air</b> drawn into the engine compartment lowers the temperature under the hood, which allows plastic, rubber and electronic parts to last longer. Lastly, cool power systems will supports larger turbochargers by creating additional air flow to the engine.|$|R

25|$|In a {{convection}} heater, {{the heating}} element heats {{the air in}} contact with it by thermal conduction. Hot air is less dense than <b>cool</b> <b>air,</b> so it rises due to buoyancy, allowing more <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> to flow in to take its place. This sets up a convection current of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle. These heaters are sometimes filled with oil. They are ideally suited for heating a closed space. They operate silently and have a lower risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings compared to radiant electric heaters.|$|E
