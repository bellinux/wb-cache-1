30|$|It is {{a natural}} result that both {{inequality}} indices {{turn out to be}} so close to each other.

The observed fact, however, is that <b>capital</b> ownership (and <b>income)</b> is more concentrated than labor income (see, e.g. Piketty 2014, p. 174; Piketty and Saez 2014, p. 839).|$|R
25|$|This effect {{occurred}} during the Great Recession of 2007–2009, when total income going to the bottom 99 percent of Americans declined by 11.6%, but fell by 36.3% for the top 1%.

25|$|According to the CBO, {{the major}} reason for {{observed}} rise in unequal distribution of after-tax income {{was an increase in}} market income, that is household income before taxes and transfers.

Of them, capital gains accounted for 80% of the increase in market income for the households in top 20%, in the 2000–2007 period. Even over the 1991–2000 period, according to the CBO, capital gains accounted for 45% of the market income for the top 20% households.|$|E

25|$|Just as higher-income {{groups are}} more likely to enjoy {{financial}} gains when economic times are good, they are also likely to suffer more significant income losses during economic downturns and recessions when they are compared to lower income groups. Higher-income groups tend to derive relatively more of their income from more volatile sources related to <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> (business income, capital gains, and dividends), as opposed to labor income (wages and salaries). For example, in 2011 the top 1% of income earners derived 37% of their income from labor income, versus 62% for the middle quintile. On the other hand, the top 1% derived 58% of their income from capital as opposed to 4% for the middle quintile.

Like most of north Karnataka, Bagalkot is very rich in black soil which is conducive to the cultivation of cotton. Bagalkot's economy was valued at US$5.6 billion, making it the 12th largest economy in Karnataka. The approximate per <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> is US$360. The chief crops cultivated are rabi and jowar, as well as groundnut, cotton, maize, bajra, wheat, sugarcane and tobacco. Jowar is largely cultivated {{because it can be}} grown during rainy seasons as well as during the winters. The crop also is the chief supply of food for the people. Pulses are also grown in the region, primarily tuvar daal, gram, kulith and mūng daal. Castor oil, linseed and sesamum are also grown in Bagalkot. Water supply for irrigation includes reservoirs such as the Kendur reservoir, which is six miles from Badami and the Muchkundi reservoir, which is 4 miles from Bagalkot. Famine due to lack of adequate rains is quite common in Bagalkot. A famine that struck the region in 1901 inflicted considerable financial loss to the agricultural industry in Bagalkot.

2500|$|After the 1992 {{tax reform}} the {{marginal}} tax rate on labour income was {{much higher than}} the marginal tax rate on <b>capital</b> <b>income.</b> [...] For self-employed, it was profitable to convert labour income to <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> (income shifting). In the 2006 tax reform, the income shifting problem was solved by reducing the top marginal tax rate on labour income and introducing a dividend and capital gains tax on return above the normal return of the capital invested (shareholder model). Company shareholders were exempt from dividend and capital gains tax (exemption method), whilst proprietorships and partnerships were taxed at similar principles as the shareholder model.|$|E

Nonetheless, top marginal tax rate on earned income decreased from 55 % in 1998 to 35 % in 2010. A similar reduction was also observed {{with respect to the}} flat corporate tax rate, which was dropped off from 46 % in 2000 s to 20 % in 2006 and the investment allowance was also abolished in that year. This is the first important step for introduction to pure DIT model, afterwards corporate tax rate should be reduced to 15 % percent, which is equal to tax on <b>capital</b> <b>incomes,</b> thus <b>capital</b> <b>incomes</b> should be exempt from corporate income tax rate and the problems of double taxation of distributed dividends then will be solved. From this it may be concluded that the current personal income tax system in Turkey shares several features with the DIT model.

Following measures aimed to reduce tax evasion, this transfer was estimated to be 6. 7 per cent of GDP in 2006 and 2007. Underlying reasons for tax evasion are the different burdens on labour and <b>capital</b> <b>incomes.</b> According to international experience, either the control of splitting labour and <b>capital</b> <b>incomes</b> or bringing their contribution burdens closer to one another can help in this situation.

50|$|Optimal <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> {{taxation}} is a subarea of optimal tax theory {{which refers}} {{to the study of}} designing a tax on <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> such that a given economic criterion like utility is optimized. Starting from the conceptualization of <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> as future consumption, the taxation of <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> corresponds to a differentiated consumption tax on present and future consumption. Consequently, a <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> tax results in the distortion of individuals' saving and consumption behavior as individuals substitute the more heavily taxed future consumption with current consumption. Due to these distortions, zero taxation of <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> might be optimal, a result postulated by the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem (1976) and the Chamley-Judd zero <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> tax result (1985/1986).

When applied to <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> taxation, the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem argues that since present and future consumption are equally complementary to leisure due to weakly separable preferences (and hence there is no Corlett-Hague motive for <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> taxation), <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> taxes do not alleviate the tax distortions caused by labor income taxation while additionally distorting <b>capital</b> <b>income.</b> Thus, <b>capital</b> <b>income</b> taxation, i.e. differentiated consumption taxation, is more costly (and therefore less optimal) than pure non-linear labor income taxation.|$|E
