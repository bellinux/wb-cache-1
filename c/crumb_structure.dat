French baguettes with different <b>crumb</b> <b>structures</b> were procured from a supermarket or local bakeries (n = 6) or produced in the laboratory via par baking (n = 3). Eight study participants consumed crumb-only and crumb-and-crust samples, and the resulting volatile release was measured in vivo using proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry. A statistical model was then used to examine the contributions of volatile compounds to target ion production (i. e., crumb or crust markers). Utilizing the three laboratory-produced breads, chewing behavior and aroma perception were measured via electromyography and the temporal-dominance of sensations method, respectively. The results revealed that the initial levels of crumb markers as well as crumb firmness affected the crumb markers release. Crust markers were released more quickly than crumb markers, leading to different perception dynamics...|$|R

40|$|In the {{production}} of bakery goods such as bread and pastry, endopeptidase activity is generally undesired. Indeed, gluten protein hydrolysis during dough mixing and fermentation reduces the gas retention capacity of dough. This then ultimately results in impaired <b>crumb</b> <b>structures.</b> Still, some peptidases when used under strictly controlled process conditions can {{have a positive impact}} on crumb softness, and reduce its chewiness and firming in time. We here researched the activity of a thermo-active serine peptidase in the absence or presence of a wheat flour extract at different temperatures and used it in a bread making protocol. The in vitro peptidase activity was lower in the presence of the wheat flour extract than for the control as long as the activity assay was executed at temperatures below 70 °C, showing inhibition of the peptidase by wheat flour endogenous inhibitors. However, at higher temperatures only negligible differences in hydrolytic activity were seen between control and wheat flour containing extracts, hence suggesting release of the inhibitor(s) from the enzyme at such temperatures. From these findings, it was thus concluded that a temperature dependent inhibition of the peptidase is possible due to the presence of (a) specific peptidase inhibitor(s) in wheat flour. When used in bread making, comparison of the molecular weight distribution of gluten proteins from mixed and fermented dough produced with and without peptidase addition showed very comparable profiles. This implies total inactivity of the peptidase at these stages. When extracting gluten from small dough pieces heated at temperatures between 50 – 70 °C, again no differences in molecular weight distribution of the proteins was measured. However, when doughs had been heated to temperatures exceeding 75 °C, hydrolytic activity was obvious for the peptidase containing samples and was more elevated at higher temperatures (up to 95 °C). That this specific peptidase is inactive during mixing and fermentation (which is desirable) but active during baking presents opportunities for different baking industries. Hydrolysis of gluten proteins is avoided at the most crucial points (mixing and fermenting), which avoids the need for strict process control and allows the use of peptidases without the related negative effects such as small volumes, open <b>crumb</b> <b>structures</b> and collapse of dough even before oven rise. This opens opportunities to fully exploit the potential of peptidases to {{have a positive impact on}} crumb texture and firming. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} role of {{structure}} on Young’s modulus of open cell materials of relative densities between 0. 1 and 0. 3. The cellular solid is obtained by generating mixture size of spherical voids using the Random Sequential Addition – RSA algorithm. The relative density of the material is controlled by increasing void number and overlap. Structural effects consider mainly a Gaussian distribution of spherical void size of varying width, distribution centre and void overlap distance. Finite element method {{is used to calculate}} effective Young’s modulus using a regular meshing scheme of 3 D typical cellular solids and Conjugate Gradient solver. It is found that sphere overlap has the largest effect compared to sphere distribution width for a given density. A large scatter in the wall thickness distribution is predicted when overlapping is increased or when the width of sphere size distribution is decreased. Increased rigidity is found to be correlated to particular arrangement of mixture size spheres which is pointed out using the Pair Correlation Function. Experimental evidence of {{the role of}} void overlapping is treated in the case of bread <b>crumbs</b> <b>structures</b> determined using X-ray tomography. The scatter of effective Young’s modulus for a given relative density is sensitive to void overlapping...|$|R

50|$|The {{second step}} is the {{lamination}} process. Lamination {{is necessary to}} produce multilayered dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are two methods for folding fat into dough: the English method and the French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers and three dough layers. After spreading out predough, roll-in fat is ﬂattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over two-thirds of {{the surface of the}} laminated predough. The exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat, while the other end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the French method, one fold results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After spreading out the predough and putting a layer of roll-in fat over the center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated until 16-50 fat layers are obtained. The optimal number of layers can be determined by balancing certain crumb properties with speciﬁc volume. On one hand, a low number of layers yields large speciﬁc heights as well as irregular <b>crumb</b> <b>structure</b> with large voids. On the other hand, a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift.|$|E

40|$|A model product, {{non-reactive}} {{in terms}} of Maillard and caramelization reactions, and with a structure and manufacturing process imitative of a sponge cake, was developed. A rational formulation design was used to identify the functional properties of the ingredients at {{each step of the}} process. Reactive ingredients (i. e. eggs, sucrose and flour proteins) were replaced by cellulose derivatives (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and methylcellulose) to provide the main functionalities of the ingredients removed (foaming, thickening and gelling). Different properties of a real sponge cake were selected as targets to be reproduced in the model product: apparent viscosity, batter density before baking and homogeneity of the <b>crumb</b> cellular <b>structure</b> after baking. The concentrations of cellulose derivatives were determined to reach 1. 4 Pa s at 270 s(- 1), the mixing time was selected in order to incorporate 56 % (w/w) of air in the batter, and the types of cellulose derivatives were chosen to obtain homogeneous cellular structures. The use of HPMC alone led to cellular structures containing chimneys. The addition of a certain proportion of MC was necessary to obtain model cakes with homogeneous and fine <b>crumb</b> cellular <b>structures.</b> The sponge cake density was correlated with the HPMC and MC concentrations and ratios, both being linked to the ability of the batter to trap bubbles and prevent coalescence during baking.

40|$|The {{functional}} properties of cellulose derivatives were studied {{to understand their}} specific and respective roles in the structure formation at {{each step of the}} process of a model sponge cake composed of hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and methylcellulose (MC) and native corn starch. During batter preparation, the shear-thinning behavior and the quantity of air in the final product increased with the HPMC/MC ratio. HPMC controlled the viscosity of the system and limited bubble loss during starch addition. However, the lower the batter density, the higher the inhomogeneity of the final structure. During baking, the MC governed the sol-gel transition but HPMC slightly impeded it, and the gelling temperature decreased along with the HPMC/MC ratio. Because of the cold water binding capacity of starch, the concentration of HPMC/MC increased in the continuous phase during the batter preparation, decreasing the gelling temperature. A compromise in the HPMC/MC ratio giving a gelling temperature of about 54 degrees C was necessary to have a homogeneous final structure. Image analysis of the cellular structure confirmed the results by a classification of the products. The higher the MC concentration, the smaller the cells and the thicker the cell walls. An analysis of the effect of the mixing time after starch addition showed that the density after baking increased along with it. It was possible to obtain different <b>crumb</b> <b>structures</b> from a same composition by only changing the mixing time. Finally, a hypothesis about the structuring mechanisms of a model sponge cake at each step of the process was proposed using a schematic representation of the structure at three different scales and along the process steps...|$|R

Five distinct types of paleosols (pedotypes) are recognized in the Nyakach Formation section at Kaimogool South. The most common paleosols are reddish brown, silty calcareous profiles with blocky structure and large root traces (Ratong pedotype) which are interpreted as soils of well-drained, dry bushland or thicket (nyika). Weakly developed paleosols associated with paleochannels (Dhero pedotype) represent wooded grassland early in the ecological succession from streamside flooding. One of these paleosols has yielded a fossil flora of grasses and small-leaved dicots like those of modern semi-arid wooded grassland. <b>Crumb</b> <b>structured,</b> calcareous paleosols with iron-manganese nodules (Yom pedotype) are interpreted to represent seasonally waterlogged, wooded grassland (dambo or vlei). Thick, red clayey, calcareous paleosols with blocky ped structure and large root traces (Tut pedotype) are interpreted as soils of well-drained dry woodland. Other blocky-structured, gray to brown calcareous paleosols with iron-manganese nodules (Chido pedotype) are interpreted as soils of seasonally waterlogged, riparian dry woodland. Fossil soils, plants and gastropods are evidence of an unusually dry (300 – 500 mm mean annual precipitation) habitat for apes, consisting of a vegetational mosaic dominated by dry woodland, bushland and thickets with few areas of seasonally waterlogged grassland. Fossils of V. macinnesi are rare from Nyakach, but were found in paleosols representative of bushland and thicket habitats (Ratong). Fossils of the ape K. africanus were found within paleosols indicative of dry woodland (Tut).

The effect of four BG addition levels in the wheat flour functional characteristics (WAI, WSI, and pasting properties) and bread quality (physical parameters, <b>crumb</b> grain <b>structure,</b> moisture and hardness) was investigated. The highest levels of BG (1 % and 2 %) decreased the peak viscosity, and increased the stability and setback of the flour. This was due to a lower gelatinization of the starch granules, caused by a competition for water between the hydrocolloid and starch. These changes influenced the bread quality. The loaves added with 1 % and 2 % of BG presented smaller alveoli: this resulted in more compact, hard and less airy crumbs. Nevertheless, the moisture of the samples at 1 % and 2 % of added gum was higher than the control bread.

XT Plus (Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, UK), following the AACC (74 - 09) standard and expressed as crumb firmness (N), stiffness (N. mm- 1) and relative elasticity (%). Our research proved that all selected indicators were significantly influenced by the year of growing and variety. The most soft bread was achieved in Rubiota, whereas bread crumb samples from Altgold and Ostro were the most firm and stiff. Correlation analysis showed strong negative correlation between relative elasticity and bread crumb firmness as well as bread stiffness (- 0. 65 ++, - 0. 66 ++).

40|$|Quantitative {{descriptive}} {{sensory analysis}} was used to evaluate the performance of pregelatinised protein-starch admixture as fat mimetics in bread. In this work, two regimes of total fat replacements consisting of 50 % protein: 50 % starch admixture on one hand and 70 % protein: 30 % starch admixture on the other were compared to another two regimes of partial fat replacements consisting of 50 % fat in composite with the above admixtures with 100 % full fat bread as control to give a total of five treatments. Sensory quality was assessed by 24 trained assessors made up of 12 men and 12 females using attributes such as bread taste, crumb moistness, crust softness, cell <b>structure,</b> <b>crumb</b> and crust colours and overall acceptability. Analysis of variance revealed all treatments to be significantly different (p< 0. 0001). Principal components and cluster analyses confirmed two groupings of treatments. It is concluded that treatments with 50 % fat replacement were tastier and more acceptable and resulted in significant increase (p< 0. 05) in loaf volume...|$|R
