40|$|Demonstrating mesh {{convergence}} for {{a finite}} element analysis requires multiple meshes, but creating high quality meshes is a time-consuming task. Furthermore, estimates {{of the amount of}} error caused by mesh refinement are difficult to make for a sequence of unrelated, unstructured finite element meshes. A solution for both of these problems is to automatically generate a refined mesh by subdividing every element in the original mesh. The resulting refined mesh has a uniform 'mesh refinement ratio' (relative to the original mesh), so established mesh convergence error estimators, such as Roache's Grid <b>Convergence</b> <b>Indicator</b> (GCI), can be applied. This presentation will cover the process of automatically generating a refined mesh, and discuss the Grid <b>Convergence</b> <b>Indicator</b> (GCI) error metric. The GCI will be applied to two models subjected to transient loadings: a simple test problem and a high-fidelity model of an unclassified W 76 component. The mesh convergence exhibited by the analysis code DYNA 3 D will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Most {{existing}} multi-objective evolutionary algorithms experience {{difficulties in}} solving many-objective optimization problems {{due to their}} incapability to balance convergence and diversity in the high-dimensional objective space. In this paper, we propose a novel many-objective evolutionary algorithm using a one-by-one selection strategy. The main idea {{is that in the}} environmental selection, offspring individuals are selected one by one based on a computationally efficient <b>convergence</b> <b>indicator</b> to increase the selection pressure towards the Pareto optimal front. In the one-by-one selection, once an individual is selected, its neighbors are de-emphasized using a niche technique to guarantee the diversity of the population, in which the similarity between individuals is evaluated by means of a distribution indicator. In addition, different methods for calculating the <b>convergence</b> <b>indicator</b> are examined and an angle-based similarity measure is adopted for effective evaluations of the distribution of solutions in the high-dimensional objective space. Moreover, corner solutions are utilized to enhance the spread of the solutions and to deal with scaled optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is empirically compared with eight state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on 90 instances of 16 benchmark problems. The comparative results demonstrate that the overall performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to the compared algorithms on the optimization problems studied in this work...|$|E

The corresponding ingredients η _u and η _λ are only iterative convergence indicators, {{but none of them}} provides an adequate check of the solution accuracy. In particular, since η _u measures, though implicitly, the displacement continuity—a match between u_G and u_Lacross Γ (recall that the traction continuity—a match between λ_C and λ_L on Γ—is, in our case, fulfilled automatically), it is also the indicator of a good “gluing” between the two models.|$|E

The performance of the drug design process depends on the identification of peptides that optimize several molecular properties at the same time.

40|$|In this paper, a {{generalized}} double-shell {{framework for the}} optimal design of systems managed optimally according to different criteria is developed. Optimal design is traditionally carried out by means of minimum capital and management cost formulations and does not typically consider optimized operation. In this paper, the optimized multiobjective management is explicitly considered into the design formulation. The quality of each design solution is indeed defined by the evaluation of operational costs and capital costs. Besides, {{the assessment of the}} operational costs term is deduced by means of the solution of a multiobjective optimization problem. Each design solution is evaluated using the outcomes of a multiobjective optimization run: a Pareto hyper-surface in the n-dimensional space of the operational objectives. In the literature, commonly the evaluation of each design solution is carried out based on an approximate evaluation of the operational costs, not considering the real multiobjective optimized management. In this paper, such assessment is carried out using a suitable <b>convergence</b> <b>indicator</b> typically used for multiobjective optimization algorithms. The application is devoted to the problem of optimal sizing of distributed energy resources in medium voltage or low voltage microgrids. For this problem, the identification of the multiple operational impacts comes along with the solution of the optimal unit commitment of distributed generators.

40|$|Abstract: Convergence may be {{considered}} a central issue of the current economic literature, and not only, concentrating upon income distribution within different economies, but also focusing on different aspects of polarity and inequality that characterize especially the emerging economies. Testing convergence within economies {{may serve as a}} useful instrument for the validation of the economic growth models. While convergence was considered a defining element of the neoclassical growth models, the majority of the new endogenous growth models argue in favour of divergence across different economies. Testing convergence among European Union is even more challenging due to the high degree of heterogeneity that characterizes these economies. The recent accessions with ten new countries in 2004 and with another two in 2007 were considered only the first step towards assuring a sustainable convergence and finally adopting a common currency-the euro. A series of empirical studies concentrated upon testing convergence among EU, using as benchmark the real convergence quantified by the level of GDP/capita as an indicator for the living standards of every economy. The most popular approach rely on Beta and Sigma convergence, the first one being and indicator of the GDP/capita dispersion between different economies, and the later one being an estimator of the reverse relationship between GDP/capita and its initial level. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to test Beta converge among the new EU member states, in order to obtained more information about the fact whether the poor countries are trying to catch-up with the more developed one. Also Beta <b>convergence</b> <b>indicator</b> embodies useful information about conditional and un-conditional convergence, two leading hypothesis within the neoclassical and endogenous growth models. For Beta convergence hypothesis to be valid it should be taken into consideration a ”catch-up” mechanism over a longer period of time and a set of elements that are inter-correlated with the main objective of reducing disparities among economies. However we also have to take into consideration the fact that these elements may be influenced by temporary shocks that may have a decisive impact upon their short time performance...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{growth and}} {{convergence}} {{is one of}} the most discussed fields in economics, as the long-run growth basically determines the welfare of countries. On the basis of neoclassical growth models, countries with lower GDP per capita will tend to grow faster than richer ones. However, convergence is not always confirmed. This means that economies are converging but the steady-state level is not always common, so countries may converge to different / own level of steady-states. At the same time, the term ‘convergence’ can be interpreted by different ways. Therefore, multiple methods have to be applied to measure processes of convergence or divergence in a comprehensive way. In this paper an indicator, called omega is presented in order to calculate convergence/divergence by a new approach. Omega is an adjusted weighted standard deviation of economic development (catching-up), which can be calculated on a single or multivariate basis. The paper is organized as following.

The paper’s main focus is on Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) regions. As a legacy of central planning, in the early ‘Nineties these regions presented significantly above-average specialization and agglomeration. The paper shows that over 1991 - 2011 these features change very little; moreover, while disproportions fall in the other EU members, they rise in CEECs, implying growing divergence among the two groups in real terms, notwithstanding EU emphasis on real <b>convergence.</b> <b>Indicators</b> disaggregated by sectors show that for CEECs specialization/agglomeration change most in agriculture, market services and manufacturing. The paper focuses on the last two sectors. It argues that performance in the service sector is largely due to capital regions catching up on previous underdevelopment in the sector, therefore getting closer to Western regions.
