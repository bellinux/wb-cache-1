5|$|In May 1948, {{while he}} was holding church {{meetings}} throughout Navajo and Apache communities in Arizona, Kimball suffered severe chest pain from a myocardial infarction, {{also known as a}} heart attack, after he had spent an afternoon struggling to lift an automobile out of deep sand. Kimball was physically sluggish {{throughout the rest of the}} trip, and after he had returned to Salt Lake City and undergone an electrocardiogram, his physician prescribed one month of rest from his church duties. Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, on his next assignment, in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return. During the early episodes, Kimball passed the time by discussing his wishes regarding the family's finances and investments with his wife in case he did not survive the infarctions. After receiving a priesthood blessing from church president George Albert Smith, Kimball spent two months on bed rest followed by two weeks resting on the Navajo Nation. At his physician's urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near the seashore in Long Beach, California. A <b>cardiologist</b> that Kimball consulted in California believed that his heart had been weakened by an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever during childhood and instructed Kimball to avoid overwork and gaining unnecessary weight.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the attitudes and performance of <b>cardiologists</b> regarding sexual issues in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Methods: A nationwide survey was conducted in a sample of <b>cardiologists,</b> representative of Iranian <b>cardiologists,</b> in  2015. Main Outcome Measures: Appropriate questionnaires were developed and used to ask participants about their attitudes, performance, and barriers regarding discussing sexual issues with patients with cardiovascular disease. Results: The study population consisted of 202 <b>cardiologists</b> (138 men and 63 women) with a mean age of 44. 25 years (SD = 8. 45). Overall, 93. 15 % of <b>cardiologists</b> agreed with the importance of discussing sexual issues with their patients with cardiovascular diseases. Almost 76. 7 % of <b>cardiologists</b> agreed they had a responsibility to deal with patients' sexual problems, and 79. 9 % of them were aware of the association of cardiovascular disease with sexual problems of cardiac patients, but only 33 % of them were confident in their knowledge and skills in this regard. Only 10. 6 % of <b>cardiologists</b> reported they frequently or always assessed sexual problems with their patients, but 51. 50 % of them stated they were responding to patients' questions about sexual problems. There was a significant association between performance and responsibility. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate a gap between <b>cardiologist's</b> attitudes and their actual performance and that their professional responsibility to address patients' sexual issues is a significant parameter for better performance...|$|R

40|$|Preparticipation {{screening}} for cardiovascular disease in young athletes with electrocardiography is {{endorsed by the}} European Society of Cardiology and several major sporting organizations. One of {{the concerns of the}} ECG as a screening test in young athletes relates to the potential for variation in interpretation. We investigated the degree of variation in ECG interpretation in athletes and its financial impact among <b>cardiologists</b> of differing experience. Eight <b>cardiologists</b> (4 with experience in screening athletes) each reported 400 ECGs of consecutively screened young athletes according to the 2010 European Society of Cardiology recommendations, Seattle criteria, and refined criteria. Cohen κ coefficient was used to calculate interobserver reliability. <b>Cardiologists</b> proposed secondary investigations after ECG interpretation, the costs of which were based on the UK National Health Service tariffs. Inexperienced <b>cardiologists</b> were more likely to classify an ECG as abnormal compared with experienced <b>cardiologists</b> (odds ratio, 1. 44; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 03 - 2. 02). Modification of ECG interpretation criteria improved interobserver reliability for categorizing an ECG as abnormal from poor (2010 European Society of Cardiology recommendations; κ= 0. 15) to moderate (refined criteria; κ= 0. 41) among inexperienced cardiologists; however, interobserver reliability was moderate for all 3 criteria among experienced <b>cardiologists</b> (κ= 0. 40 - 0. 53). Inexperienced <b>cardiologists</b> were more likely to refer athletes for further evaluation compared with experienced <b>cardiologists</b> (odds ratio, 4. 74; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 50 - 6. 43) with poorer interobserver reliability (κ= 0. 22 versus κ= 0. 47). Interobserver reliability for secondary investigations after ECG interpretation ranged from poor to fair among inexperienced <b>cardiologists</b> (κ= 0. 15 - 0. 30) and fair to moderate among experienced <b>cardiologists</b> (κ= 0. 21 - 0. 46). The cost of cardiovascular evaluation per athlete was $ 175 (95 % confidence interval, $ 142 -$ 228) and $ 101 (95 % confidence interval, $ 83 -$ 131) for inexperienced and experienced <b>cardiologists,</b> respectively.

40|$|Objective: Cardiac {{guidelines}} {{recommend that}} the decision to perform coronary angiography (CA) in patients with Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NST-ACS) is based on multiple factors. It is, however, unknown how <b>cardiologists</b> weigh these factors in their decision-making. The aim was to investigate the importance of different clinical characteristics, including information derived from risk scores, in the decision-making of Dutch <b>cardiologists</b> regarding performing CA in patients with suspected NST-ACS. Design: A web-based survey containing clinical vignettes. Setting and participants: Registered Dutch <b>cardiologists</b> were approached to complete the survey, in which they were asked to indicate whether they would perform CA for 8 vignettes describing 7 clinical factors: age, renal function, known coronary artery disease, persistent chest pain, presence of risk factors, ECG findings and troponin levels. <b>Cardiologists</b> were divided into two groups: group 1 received vignettes ‘without’ a risk score present, while group 2 completed vignettes ‘with’ a risk score present. Results: 129 (of 946) <b>cardiologists</b> responded. In both groups, elevated troponin levels and typical ischaemic changes (p< 0. 001) made <b>cardiologists</b> decide more often to perform CA. Severe renal dysfunction (p< 0. 001) made <b>cardiologists</b> more hesitant to decide on CA. Age and risk score could not be assessed independently, as these factors were strongly associated. Inspecting the factors together showed, for example, that <b>cardiologists</b> were more hesitant to perform CA in elderly patients with high-risk scores than in younger patients with intermediate risk scores. Conclusions: When deciding to perform in-hospital CA (≤ 72 hours after patient admission) in patients with suspected NST-ACS, <b>cardiologists</b> tend to rely mostly on troponin levels, ECG changes and renal function. Future research should focus on why CA is less often recommended in patients with severe renal dysfunction, and in elderly patients with high-risk scores. In addition, the impact of age and risk score on decision-making should be further investigated. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Background Since it was {{anticipated}} {{that the need for}} doctors would increase due to demographic changes, the number of positions for medical specialty training programs has increased from the year 2000 onwards. However, the number of permanent positions for young <b>cardiologists</b> did not follow that trend leading to concerns about future employment. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess short-term career perspectives of young <b>cardiologists</b> in the Netherlands. Methods All <b>cardiologists</b> who ended their training between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2014 were invited to fill in a questionnaire about their first employment status and were followed yearly until the participant had a permanent position. The timespan between the end of training and the moment of permanent employment was assessed. Furthermore, the association between professional profile and short-term career perspectives was investigated. Results The observed unemployment was 1. 6 % and lasted less than a year in all cases. Of the participants, 77 % started their career with a temporary contract; within four years this was 7 %. Of young <b>cardiologists,</b> 46 % started their career as a fellow and 24 % as an attending physician. A total of 29 % of male <b>cardiologists</b> started their career with a permanent contract as compared with 12 % of females (p = 0. 01). Within two years this difference was no longer observed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} how the decisions of Dutch <b>cardiologists</b> on surgical treatment for aortic stenosis were influenced by the patient's age, cardiac signs and symptoms, and comorbidity; and to identify groups of <b>cardiologists</b> whose responses to these clinical characteristics were similar. DESIGN: A questionnaire was produced asking <b>cardiologists</b> to indicate on a six point scale whether they would advise cardiac surgery for each of 32 case vignettes describing 10 clinical characteristics. SETTING: Nationwide postal survey among all 530 <b>cardiologists</b> in the Netherlands. RESULTS: 52 % of the <b>cardiologists</b> responded. There was wide variability in the cardiologists' advice for the individual case vignettes. Six groups of <b>cardiologists</b> explained 60 % of the variance. The age of the patient was most important for 41 % of the cardiologists; among these, 50 % had a high and 50 % a low inclination to advise surgery. A further 24 % were influenced equally by the patient's age and by {{the severity of the}} aortic stenosis and its effect on left ventricular function; among these, 62 % had a high and 38 % a low inclination to advise surgery. Finally, 23 % of the <b>cardiologists</b> were mainly influenced by the left ventricular function and 12 % by the aortic valve area. The presence of comorbidity always played a minor role. CONCLUSIONS: There were systematic differences among groups of <b>cardiologists</b> in their inclination to advise aortic valve replacement for elderly patients, {{as well as in the}} way their advice was influenced by the patients' characteristics. These results indicate the need for prospective studies to identify the best treatment for elderly patients according to their clinical profil...|$|R

40|$|SummaryStudy objectivesTo {{assess and}} compare the smoking {{cessation}} practices and smoking behavior of Dutch general practitioners (GPs), <b>cardiologists,</b> and lung physicians. MethodsWe conducted questionnaire surveys among {{a random sample of}} 2000 Dutch GPs, all Dutch <b>cardiologists</b> (N= 594), and all Dutch lung physicians (N= 375). ResultsIn total, 834 GPs (41. 7 %), 300 <b>cardiologists</b> (50. 5 %), and 258 lung physicians (68. 8 %) filled out and returned the questionnaire. The prevalence of current smokers was 8. 2 % among GPs, 4. 3 % among <b>cardiologists,</b> and 3. 5 % among lung physicians. Of the pharmacological aids for smoking cessation, physicians recommended bupropion most frequently, followed by nicotine patches and nicotine gum. More lung physicians recommended the use of these three aids (67. 0 %, 36. 3 % and 18. 2 %, respectively) than GPs (65. 7 %, 18. 7 % and 9. 8 %, respectively), and than <b>cardiologists</b> (31. 6 %, 19. 7 % and 13. 2 %, respectively). A higher proportion of lung physicians (69. 3 %) had referred at least one smoker to a nurse for smoking cessation treatment than <b>cardiologists</b> (25 %), and than GPs (11. 3 %). ConclusionsBased on this national survey, one may conclude that the prevalence of current smoking among Dutch physicians is relatively low and has further decreased since 1988. Dutch GPs, <b>cardiologists,</b> and lung physicians mainly use interventions for smoking cessation that are easy to administer and are not very time consuming. Furthermore, more lung physicians than GPs and <b>cardiologists</b> recommend the use of bupropion, nicotine patch, and nicotine gum. When designing interventions for smoking cessation, one should take into account that physicians are often reluctant to provide interventions which demand much time. Therefore, intensive counseling of smokers who want to quit smoking may be more feasible for trained non-physicians, such as nurses...|$|R
