40|$|We {{recently}} {{presented a}} constructive {{solution to the}} N-representability problem of the two-electron reduced density matrix (2 -RDM) [...] -a systematic approach to constructing complete <b>conditions</b> {{to ensure that the}} 2 -RDM represents a realistic N-electron quantum system [D.

In this paper we provide additional details and derive further N-representability <b>conditions</b> on the 2 -RDM that follow from the constructive solution. The resulting <b>conditions</b> can be classified into a hierarchy of constraints, known as the (2,q) -positivity <b>conditions</b> where the q indicates their derivation from the nonnegativity of q-body operators. In addition to the known T 1 and T 2 <b>conditions,</b> we derive a new class of (2, 3) -positivity <b>conditions.</b> We also derive 3 classes of (2, 4) -positivity <b>conditions,</b> 6 classes of (2, 5) -positivity <b>conditions,</b> and 24 classes of (2, 6) -positivity <b>conditions.</b> The constraints obtained can be divided into two general types: (i) lifting <b>conditions,</b> that is <b>conditions</b> which arise from lifting lower (2,q) -positivity <b>conditions</b> to higher (2,q+ 1) -positivity <b>conditions</b> and (ii) pure <b>conditions,</b> that is <b>conditions</b> which cannot be derived from a simple lifting of the lower <b>conditions.</b> All of the lifting <b>conditions</b> and the pure (2,q) -positivity <b>conditions</b> for q> 3 require tensor decompositions of the coefficients in the model Hamiltonians.

5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage <b>condition</b> {{representing}} an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} <b>condition</b> does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity <b>condition</b> implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity <b>condition</b> in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the <b>condition</b> in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity <b>condition</b> demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E
