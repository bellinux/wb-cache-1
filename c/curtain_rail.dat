50|$|The {{challenge}} of getting {{anything at all}} to space, due to launch constraints, has {{had a profound effect}} on the physical shapes of space architecture. All space habitats to date have used modular architecture design. Payload fairing dimensions (typically the width but also the height) of modern launch vehicles limit the size of rigid components launched into space. This approach to building large scale structures in space involves launching multiple modules separately and then manually assembling them afterward. Modular architecture results in a layout similar to a tunnel system where passage through several modules is often required to reach any particular destination. It also tends to standardize the internal diameter or width of pressurized rooms, with machinery and furniture placed along the circumference. These types of space stations and surface bases can generally only grow by adding additional modules in one or more direction. Finding adequate working and living space is often a major challenge with modular architecture. As a solution, flexible furniture (collapsible tables, <b>curtains</b> on <b>rails,</b> deployable beds) can be used to transform interiors for different functions and change the partitioning between private and group space. For more discussion of the factors that influence shape in space architecture, see the Varieties section.|$|R
40|$|This is the {{official}} version of the thesis and therefore some confidential information has been removed. The aim of this thesis was to conduct a thorough investigation of truck drivers’ needs and desires regarding sun protection and blackout equipment in the cab and thereafter to develop a concept for a new system that met the customers’ and Volvo Truck’s requirements. The current system was evaluated through interviews with 21 truck drivers. The inquiry showed that to suit drivers of different heights the system needs greater adjustment abilities. Other problems included difficulty to reach parts {{of the system and}} gaps where light entered. Many drivers also wished for a bug net in the roof hatch. A benchmark showed that all competitors except for Scania provide different blind systems, although they are often optional in their biggest models. Only Renault’s biggest truck, the Magnum uses the blinds for both sun protection and blackout. In the other models curtains are used for blackout. The new system consists of blinds in the windshield, side window and roof hatch and is supplemented with a pair of curtains to black out the side window. The motorized windshield blind allows manual pull down and its guide rails are hidden and integrated with the A-pillars so that no gaps appear. The blind can be lowered {{all the way down to}} the dashboard thus working as both sun protection and blackout. To avoid the blind being lowered to far a safety button has to be pushed at the same time as the blind control button when activating the blackout position. For the side window the blind is used only for sun protection. On the driver side a manual blind is used but a motorized roller blind is provided as an option. On the passenger side it is possible to choose whether to have sun protection or not. If this is desired the sun protection consists of a motorized roller blind. The blinds are placed in a window cover and visible guide rails are placed on the outside of the cover. To allow the guide rails to follow the inclined shape of the side window a spring system is attached to blind’s hem bar. The roof hatch system consists of two blinds. The upper one is a bug net. It is manually operated and can be either rolled up on the roller tube or drawn out completely. Beneath the bug net is an opaque blind which is manually handled and can be placed in four positions, covering one fourth, one half, three fourths or the entire roof hatch. A motorized roller blind is provided as an option. To complete the system curtains are used to black out the side windows. They are attached to the <b>curtain</b> <b>rails</b> by “click-in” clips.

50|$|In 2008, {{shortly after}} Daykin moved into his grandparents' home, {{he and his}} {{grandfather}} Stanley Daykin set about converting the garage into a bedroom for him. Daykin wanted both a blackout blind and a <b>curtain</b> <b>rail</b> to ensure no light could break into the room. After Daykin and his grandfather broke several fixings and drill bits attempting to hang the <b>curtain</b> <b>rail,</b> {{he went to the}} local DIY store to find a better solution, but could not find anything suitable. That afternoon they both went to the shed, and created the GripIt invention. The fixing was soon successful in mounting a television on the wall, and Daykin spotted a gap in the market. Four years later a patent was granted for GripIt and the invention was taken to market.|$|E
50|$|A curtain rod, <b>curtain</b> <b>rail,</b> or {{traverse}} rod is {{a device}} used to suspend curtains, usually above windows or {{along the edges}} of showers, though also wherever curtains might be used. When found in bathrooms, curtain rods tend to be telescopic and self-fixing, while curtain rods {{in other areas of the}} home are often affixed with decorative brackets or finial.|$|E
50|$|As of December 2016, {{improvements}} include: converting part of {{the huge}} lounge into a reasonably sized eighth bedroom, converting an unused garage into a large ninth bedroom, erecting a greenhouse, erecting a shed, installing a <b>curtain</b> <b>rail</b> and curtains in the lounge, installing shelving in the lounge-kitchen-bedrooms, installing a large raised bed {{in the garden and}} re-building a garden wall.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, Viv and Bob's {{relationship}} experiences {{problems but}} in February, they get married. Carol and Viv strike {{a deal that}} Viv would sell her the Post Office, planning to buy the B&B but Carol goes behind Viv's back and buys the B&B for herself. Furious at her friend's betrayal, Viv throws Carol {{out of the house}} and she responds by hiding a bag of frozen prawns in a <b>curtain</b> <b>rail.</b> Bob's excuses make Viv suspicious and she entraps him into admitting the existence of another wife, Barbara. Viv forgives him, and decides to try and raise some cash for a honeymoon by entering the Naughty Nylons competition organised by Bob's firm. Viv wins and Bob is fired.|$|E
50|$|When Maya returns, {{she turns}} the gas {{on the stove}} on and leaves the kitchen, telling Dev that if he {{believes}} in reincarnation that maybe next time {{he would come back}} as something better and starts a fire in the shop below, leaving them tied up inside a locked room. Soon Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) notice the fire and Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) calls the fire brigade. Dev breaks the window with the <b>curtain</b> <b>rail,</b> attracting the attention of people below. Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy) and Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward) come to the rescue. Dev is released by Ciaran while Charlie rescues Sunita just before the shop explodes. Maya is quite shocked when Dev and Sunita are rescued as she is watching from her car {{at the other end of}} the street and then tries running Dev and Sunita over but misses when Charlie and Ciaran pull them out of the way. She crashes into a wall but gets up and starts the car again, reversing it out to try again but a truck crashes into the back and smashes her into another wall. Maya is alive and goes to the same hospital as Sunita but when Sunita finds out, she leaves immediately as she is worried about her safety until Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay) tells her that Maya is on life support and her hospital room is under police guard. After coming out of intensive care, Maya is remanded in custody to await trial.|$|E
