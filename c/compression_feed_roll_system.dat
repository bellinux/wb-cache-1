50|$|The three {{adjacent}} {{rolls of}} a {{three roll mill}} (called the <b>feed</b> <b>roll,</b> centre roll and apron roll) rotate at progressively higher speeds. Material, usually {{in the form of}} paste, is fed between the <b>feed</b> <b>roll</b> and the center roll. Due to the narrowing space between the rolls, most of the paste initially remains in the feed region. The part that makes it through the first in-running nip experiences very high shear force due to the different rotation speeds of the two rolls. Upon exiting, the material that remains on the center roll moves through the second nip between the center roll and apron roll. This subjects it to an even higher shear force, due to the higher speed of the apron roll and typically, a smaller gap than between the <b>feed</b> and centre <b>rolls.</b> A knife blade then scrapes the processed material off the apron roll and the paste rolls down the apron. This milling cycle can be repeated several times to maximize dispersion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{cold rolling}} process, {{asymmetric}} shape defects {{are still a}} common problem to strip quality. For the mills with inverse symmetry <b>roll</b> shifting <b>system,</b> different <b>roll</b> wear and thermal contour of top <b>roll</b> <b>system</b> and bottom <b>roll</b> <b>system</b> could cause asymmetric shape defects during shifting operation. In this paper, three dimension finite element simulation models of inverse shifting <b>roll</b> <b>system</b> were established to calculate the parameters and to analyze the effects. Based on the idea in the mill engineering that mill style option depended on the product grade, shifting weakness was evaluated and the opinion of limit shifting was suggested. To improve control effect to asymmetric shape defects in cold rolling, shape control system with asymmetric shape control ability is developed, including asymmetric edge drop control at upstream stands and asymmetric flatness control at last stand. The further improvement of asymmetric shape control theory and practice is the key way to reach the higher precision of shape quality in cold strip mills...|$|R

Through {{woodworking}} four-side planer vibration test, {{this article}} studies its dynamic characteristics and dynamic response {{to identify the}} vibration magnitudes law of each <b>feed</b> <b>roll</b> shafts of the four-side feed beam; then finds the natural frequency and damping ratio of the feed beam and lathe bed; obtains the mathematical model of <b>feed</b> <b>roll</b> shaft vibration magnitude changing with the feed rate U under different process thicknesses.

Processed wood products can obtain their exact sizes, cross-sectional shapes and surface finish, and the machine is a typical process centralized multi-joint lathe.

40|$|Issue: Windshields are {{manufactured}} with {{two layers of}} glass with a strong plastic (usually PVC) membrane sandwiched between the panes. This structure limits recyclability dramatically. Plate glass itself is challenging to recycle because of its different chemical composition from container glass. Plate glass and automotive glass can be successfully recycled into construction aggregate or other secondary markets if the glass can {{be separated from the}} film. Separating film plastic from windshield glass requires that the glass be broken adequately to free the film, while keeping the film in large enough pieces that it can be removed without fouling equipment. Best Practice: Systems are now available to crush windshields and screen film plastic residuals in a turnkey system. In one system, <b>compression</b> <b>feed</b> rollers are used to guide windshields through a processing system at a predetermined rate and physical orientation. The system is 70 inches long, 50 inches wide and 56 inches high.

40|$|In today‟s highly {{competitive}} business environment {{it is vital}} to have smart and robust decision making framework for companies to be competitive or even to stay in the business. Profit margin increases is no longer a result of producing and bring more products to the market. Instead it is also a result of reducing cost, in particular tooling cost. In order to succeed with this, industry need to look in to innovative intelligent systems to enhance their process development so that maximum utilisation of tools can be achieved. Tooling is part of a process hence having an optimal process design is one ideal strategy for best utilising of tools. In design optimisation however presence of uncertainty in design variables and in the mathematical model (used for representing the real life process) is inevitable. For reliable design solution to be found this process complexity need to be addressed. The aim of this research is to understand work <b>roll</b> <b>system</b> optimisation and thermal issues within rolling system design, understand uncertainties and sources of uncertainties and develop Genetic Algorithm (GA) based solution frameworks so that a conscious decision, that prolong tool life can be made. The thesis has proposed a framework for generating approximate models from numeric finite element (FE) data. Using the proposed framework a number of quantitative work <b>roll</b> <b>system</b> thermal analysis and optimisation models were generated and used in subsequent optimisation process. In the absence of a suitable multi-pass model that exhibits the features of a multi-stage process; confident decision making will not be possible.
