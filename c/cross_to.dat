5|$|According to Russian {{scholars}} Ivan Yastrebov and Pavel Rovinski, {{the cross}} was originally {{kept in the}} Prečista Krajinska Church, in which Kosara had interred Vladimir. The peak of Islamization of the Krajina region was reached {{at the end of}} 18th century. The church was torn down, though it is uncertain when and by whom, but the cross was preserved by the people of the region. They believed that it could protect against evil and ensure a rich harvest, and kept it as sacred, although they had converted to Islam. The cross was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevići. As they too converted to Islam, they entrusted the <b>cross</b> <b>to</b> the Andrović family—their Orthodox Christian neighbors. The Mrkojevići considered it more appropriate for the <b>cross</b> <b>to</b> be kept in a Christian home, rather than in a Muslim one.|$|E

5|$|To date, no Canadian Victoria Cross {{has been}} conferred; Smokey Smith, {{who died in}} 2005, was the last Canadian {{recipient}} of the then pan-Commonwealth Victoria Cross, receiving it from King George VI in 1945.

The proposal was met with a mixed response from members of the Royal Canadian Legion and Canadian Forces, detractors feeling that the Unknown Soldier should not be elevated above his other fallen comrades. It had also been agreed {{at the time of the}} Unknown Soldier's repatriation that no award or decoration would be bestowed on the remains. No decision was taken about the awarding of the Canadian Victoria <b>Cross</b> <b>to</b> the Canadian Unknown Soldier.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{discharged}} Palatine Theodore Csanád {{and restored}} Julius Kán {{in the second}} half of 1222. The following year, Pope Honorius urged Andrew to launch a new crusade. If the report of the Continuatio Claustroneuburgensis is reliable, Andrew took the <b>cross</b> <b>to</b> show that he intended launch a new crusade, but no other sources mention this event. Andrew planned to arrange a new marriage for his eldest son, Béla, but Pope Honorius mediated a reconciliation between Béla and his wife in the autumn of 1223. This angered Andrew, and Béla fled to Austria. He returned in 1224, after the bishops persuaded Andrew to forgive him.|$|E
