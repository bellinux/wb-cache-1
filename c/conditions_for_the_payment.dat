5000|$|Payment {{orders are}} post-contract {{instruments}} {{often used to}} pay fee agreements to agents and usually contain <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> to be met such as successful completion of contract requirements. Payment orders with [...] "conditions" [...] {{should not be confused}} with [...] "conditional payment orders." [...] Conditional payment orders are pre-contract instruments consisting of a documented fee agreement between the beneficiary and the payer, proof of ability for the payer to pay which is often issued by Swift MT799 to the recipient's bank, and occasionally may include bank instructions for the establishment of a payment order following contract execution. Either payment orders or conditional payment orders are assumed to be irrevocable unless otherwise stated. Payment orders with conditions may be established after signing of a contract and posting of a letter of credit or other financial instrument with the paying bank but are never put in place prior to contract execution because of the risk that the contract will not materialize.|$|E
50|$|The {{reported}} {{causes for}} this conflict were that following the First Punic War against Rome, payment of the mercenaries was delayed {{for over a}} year. When finally arrangements for payment were made, the mistrust between the mercenaries and their employer helped to kindle the war. The native African Libyans, the largest contingent of the 'mercenaries', objected to being paid last while their comrades had been shipped home. Fear had spread {{that this might be}} a Carthaginian trap to exterminate them without payment and save their silver, after having crippled their army of the specialized supportive arms units. The <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> were rejected, although their former commander, Gisco, had provided them with his own person and 500 other nobles as hostages to reassure them of Carthage's sincere and honest intentions. The mercenaries and supporting native insurgents began attacking Carthaginian targets and urging the Libyan natives to rise. According to our sources, the war was conducted in a particularly brutal fashion and ended, after three years, with the total destruction of the mercenary and insurgent forces.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the issue of subsidies, and gives an {{overview}} on their structure and basic programmes offered by the funds, from which it is possible to draw grants and it subsequently informs about the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> of subsidies. There also offers information about accounting and tax aspects. It focuses on the describtion of management of an agricultural entity operating in South Bohemia. The thesis elaborates the most important aspects of the application of exercicing costs reduction in the managment of Agricultural Cooperative in the absence of subsidies. Yet subsidies {{have a significant impact on}} the economic situation of the company. In the absence of any subsidy a Cooperative Entity would surely go bankrupt. This paper evaluates two cases to illustrate such eventuality. The first is maintenance cost analysis of grassed-areas, the second case- finding costs on the unemployed. We come to the conclusion that agricultural businesses today are not in a position to finance its activity only from their own resources and are significantly dependent on the subsidy policy, mainly of the European Union...|$|E
40|$|On February 27, 2003, <b>the</b> <b>Payment</b> Cards Center of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia {{sponsored}} a conference {{to examine a}} variety of new payments options available to consumers paying for goods and services at the point of sale. The conference included diverse representation from <b>the</b> <b>payments</b> industry and Federal Reserve staff.; Conference presentations and discussions focused on current and prospective payments innovations and their implications for payments providers, merchants, and consumers. <b>The</b> need <b>for</b> alignment among these three parties as an essential <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> success of <b>payments</b> innovation was emphasized throughout the conference discussion. This event benefited from the inclusion of merchants’ perspectives, which are sometimes seen to be at odds with <b>the</b> goals of <b>payment</b> networks and institutional providers. Although the conference did not resolve the inherent conflict between organizations that drive payments innovation and merchants, it initiated a useful dialogue between industry sectors with divergent views and provided policymakers with a clearer understanding of the interrelationships inherent in retail payments systems.

To explain landowners’ land-use decisions and determine <b>the</b> appropriate conservation <b>payments,</b> it is necessary to focus on risk associated with agricultural price and yield volatility. A theoretical framework is provided for assessing land-use allocation problems under risk and setting risk-efficient conservation payments when returns are not necessary normally distributed. Stochastic dominance rules are used to derive <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> determining <b>the</b> conservation <b>payments</b> required to guarantee that the environmentally-preferred land use dominates, even when land uses are not considered to be mutually exclusive. An empirical application to shaded-coffee protection in the biologically important El Chocó region of West Ecuador shows that conservation payments required for preserving shaded-coffee areas are much higher than those calculated under the assumption of risk-neutrality. Further, the extant distribution of land has a strong impact on <b>the</b> required conservation <b>payments.</b> risk, conservation payments, land allocation, stochastic dominance, agroforest systems, portfolio diversification...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by the {{prevalence}} of online questionnaires in electronic commerce, and of multiple-choice questions in such questionnaires, we consider the problem of eliciting truthful answers to multiple-choice questions from a knowledgeable respondent. Specifically, each question is a statement regarding an uncertain future event, and is multiple-choice – the responder must select exactly one of the given answers. The principal offers a payment, whose amount {{is a function of}} the answer selected and the true outcome (which the principal will eventually observe). This problem significantly generalizes recent work on truthful elicitation of distribution properties, which itself generalized a long line of work in elicitation of complete distributions. We provide necessary and sufficient <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> existence of <b>payments</b> that induce truthful answers, and give a characterization of those payments. We also study in greater details the common case of questions with ordinal answers, and illustrate our results with several examples of practical interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} thesis {{is dealing with the}} differences in education in Romany families as compared to majority families, the education of the Romany minority, educational opportunities of Romany students and inequalities in the transition to high schools as compared with the majority population. Additionally, it describes the reasons for early drop out of Romany students from secondary schools and the concept of the Support is defined, as well as its changes that had taken place over the years till June 2011. The objective of this thesis is to identify the effectiveness of the Support of socially disadvantaged Romany secondary school students and college students. To obtain the necessary data, the method of qualitative research was chosen, the technique of semi-structured interview supplemented by secondary data analysis. The research group consisted of eight representatives of secondary schools in the South Bohemian Region County who asked for the Support in the past. The research results show that all Romany students apply for the Support at the outset of their studies, most of them repeatedly and separately for each period. If a Romany student meets the conditions for granting the Support, he/she must meet the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> of the Support. The subsidy granted is paid retroactively in December, for the period from September to December, and in June, for the period from January to June. The unused finance is returned to the Ministry of Education. At the same time, the research suggests that completing the application form for the Support is not easy. The number of Romany students who applied for the Support from January 2005 to June 2011 shows a downward trend. The reasons for not using the Support included, in more than half of Romany children, an incorrect estimate of education costs and also a failure to submit the relevant documents for the retroactive payments; in 21 % of the cases the Support was not used due {{to drop out of the}} student, and the rest was due to unexcused absence. It is expected that this thesis could serve as an information source for the general public because the Support, also called positive discrimination, is a powerful motivational tool for socially disadvantaged Romany students for whom it is not easy to continue with their secondary education. At the same time, this thesis could become a source of research for other regions too...|$|E

Cases of provable, systematically effected targeting by the Stasi, and resulting in employment-related losses and/or health damage, can be pursued under a law covering settlement of torts (Unrechtsbereinigungsgesetz, or 2. SED-UnBerG) as claims either for occupational rehabilitation or rehabilitation under administrative law. These overturn certain administrative provisions of GDR institutions and affirm their unconstitutionality. This is a <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> social equalisation <b>payments</b> specified in <b>the</b> Bundesversorgungsgesetz (the war victims relief act of 1950). Equalisation payments of pension damages and for loss of earnings can also be applied for in cases where victimisation continued for at least three years, and where claimants can prove need. The above examples of seeking justice have, however, been hindered by various difficulties victims have experienced, both in providing proof of the Stasi's encroachment into the areas of health, personal assets, education and employment, and in receiving official acknowledgement that the Stasi was responsible for personal damages (including psychic injury) {{as a direct result of}} Zersetzung operations.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} will be {{analysis}} of some problems about health and sickness insurance. Therefore we describe the important problems: advantages and limitations of the use sickness function as compared with other methods, subdivide sickness functions into duration of sickness, some problems of health care. The first part will intend to provide a orientation on the present situation and the objectives of health insurance in the Slovak republic. List the main conceptions used in sickness and health insurance: <b>the</b> fundamental qualifying <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> allocation and <b>payment</b> of benefits, retention of claims for a specified period of time based on a protection peri- od, basic indicators for health care. In part two – a basic probabilistic multistate structure is defined, which provides {{the possibility of a}} systematic modeling for sickness insurance (disability annuities and lump sum). There are some specific applications of the actuarial theory in the solution of problems relating to critical illness. Some of the many approaches {{that can be used for}} calculations in this paper are multiple- state and decrement models. Their advantage is that they make use of stochastic approach <b>for</b> <b>the</b> transitions between the states. This brings with it a more faithful modeling of the real world than does the deterministic model. In the various chapters of this paper attention is directed not only towards the analysis of the existing theory, but also in particular to extending these models so that they can be used more wi- dely in actuarial work in life, sickness and health insurance. Of course, natural developments lead to recurrent premiums, mathematical reserves, expense loadings and profit testing...|$|R
