5|$|As the {{collapse}} <b>continues,</b> <b>the</b> rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator.

The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
