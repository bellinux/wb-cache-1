They disputed the amount of tax they had to pay under the 1976 Finance Act, Section 63 of which said that: [...] The cash equivalent of any benefit <b>chargeable</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> ... is an amount equal to the cost equivalent of the benefit, less so much (if any) of it as is made good by the employee to those providing the benefit ... {{the cost of a}} benefit is the amount of any expense incurred in or in connection with its provision, and (here and in those subsections) includes a proper proportion of any expense". [...] The Inland Revenue, attempting to tax this benefit, argued that the [...] "cost" [...] of the benefit meant an average of the cost of providing it; if there were 100 pupils at a school that cost £1,000,000 a year to run, the [...] "cost" [...] per pupil was £10,000. Hart and his fellow teachers disputed this and argued that it was instead marginal cost, saying that other than food, stationery, laundry and similar there was no cost to the school due to the children's presence that would not be there already. The Special Commissioners (an appellate body for income tax claims), ruling in favour of Hart, noted that not only was the school not full to capacity, with the teachers' children having no impact on waiting lists, but that the [...] "concessionary fee" [...] covered all costs incurred by the school in the course of educating those particular pupils. It was found, however, that during debate on the Finance Act, ministers had made statements in the House of Commons which supported the idea that such [...] "benefits" [...] should be excluded from tax.|$|E

Under Personal Assessment, income <b>chargeable</b> <b>to</b> Property <b>Tax,</b> Salaries Tax and Profits Tax is aggregated and from this total, the followings may be deducted: － business losses incurred {{in the year of}} assessment, － losses brought forward from previous years under Personal Assessment, － approved charitable donations, － interest payments on money borrowed for the purpose of producing property income, and － personal allowances and concessionary deductions. z Tax at marginal rates (the same as those used for Salaries Tax) will then be imposed on the balance.

40|$|Presented at the 59 th International Conference on Mass Properties Engineering, St. Louis, June 5 - 7, 2000. Mass {{properties}} {{engineering is}} today an established field and an indispensable {{part of the}} design process. Detailed bookkeeping schemes {{have been developed to}} track constituent component weights in extreme detail, down to the last rib and rivet. Given this situation, it may be more accurate to refer to this field as empty weights engineering because the focus has always been primarily on management and tracking of vehicle empty weight. Meanwhile, one of the largest weight fractions, fuel weight, is bookkept in a single lump and largely ignored (except inasmuch as it impacts vehicle size and growth factor). It is intuitively obvious that the aerothermodynamic losses due to the engine, airframe systems, and aerodynamic drag of the vehicle are the fundamental drivers on fuel weight and should therefore be expressible as increments in fuel weight <b>chargeable</b> <b>to</b> each loss mechanism. The sum of all chargeable fuel weights is equal to the total fuel weight required to complete a prescribed mission. The intent {{of this paper is to}} formulate a method for quantifying thermodynamic performance in terms of mission fuel <b>chargeable</b> <b>to</b> each thermodynamic loss mechanism. This is then used in conjunction with known vehicle zero fuel weight groups to estimate the gross weight <b>chargeable</b> <b>to</b> each functional component of the vehicle. The results show that chargeable vehicle gross weight can be used as a common figure of merit linking mass properties and performance aspects of vehicle design. This method is then demonstrated for a Northrop F- 5 E aircraft, and the fuel weight breakdown is analytically calculated for the design mission. The results of this analysis show that 37. 3 % of the F- 5 E subsonic mission fuel requirement is due to propulsion system losses, 36. 8 % is <b>chargeable</b> <b>to</b> aerodynamic drag, and 24. 3 % is <b>chargeable</b> <b>to</b> vehicle empty weight. This translates into a chargeable fuel cost of roughly $ 173. 90, $ 171. 76, and $ 113. 53 for each of these three loss mechanisms, respectively. Finally, the usefulness of this technique as a means of technology evaluation is considered. The strengths of this method are that it allows quantification of both weight and performance aspects of technology benefits in a single figure of merit, and also enables one to ascertain the benefits of individual technologies even when applied as part of a suite of technologies...|$|R
