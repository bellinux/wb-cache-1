If the body has a radius greater than about 30 km, the frictional heating is sufficient to melt a path through which the body can fall. If the iron body is liquid (as expected) with a low viscosity, it would penetrate the mantle as a diapir. The problem of an immiscible liquid body melting its way through a solid is solved, and a family of diapir shapes is obtained.

40|$|International audienceThe {{revelation of}} a small 182 W {{terrestrial}} excess relatively to the 182 Hf– 182 W systematics in meteorites has led some authors {{to claim that the}} Earth experienced a rapid accretion and an early differentiation, 30 – 40 Ma after the birth of the solar system at 4. 567 Ga. This interpretation has since been moderated, but the idea of an early <b>segregation</b> of the <b>core</b> is still widely advocated. We challenge this interpretation with quantitative arguments that concern Hf–W, U–Pb and I–Xe systematics on the Earth. The W isotopic composition of the bulk silicate Earth can be explained by an incomplete isotopic re-equilibration between primitive metal and silicate components during the segregation of the Earth's core. We consider that the primitive metal/silicate differentiation in planetesimals and the <b>segregation</b> of <b>cores</b> of planetary bodies occurred during the first million years and that the segregation of the major part of the Earth's core occurred late in respect to the 182 Hf decay. Consequently, the non-equilibrated fraction of primitive silicate material is estimated to be small, between 6 and 14 %, enough however to « open » the 182 Hf– 182 W chronometer as is presently observed. This significant, but incomplete, metal/silicate re-equilibration only slightly affects the U–Pb chronometer. A reappraisal of the Pb isotope composition of the bulk silicate Earth allows us to define {{the mean age of the}} Earth's <b>core's</b> <b>segregation,</b> between 4. 46 Ga and 4. 38 Ga. This evaluation overlaps the time of outgassing of the atmosphere based on the 129 I– 129 Xe systematics, 4. 46 – 4. 43 Ga. We consider that the period around 4. 45 Ga relates to the major primitive differentiation of the Earth. This scenario coherently and quantitatively explains the 182 Hf– 182 W, 235, 238 U– 207, 206 Pb, 129 I– 129 Xe and 146 Sm– 142 Nd terrestrial records and it is compatible with the radiometric constraints for the formation of the Moon and coherent with the not, vert, similar 102 Ma time scale for the accretion of the Earth, as evaluated by current numerical simulations for terrestrial planet formation...|$|R

The energy associated with the accretion of the Earth and the segregation of the core is more than sufficient to melt the entire Earth.

It is found that a magma ocean with a depth of 100 km would have existed as the Earth accreted.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the partitioning {{of a number}} of siderophile and lithophile elements between liquid metal and liquid silicate phases under the high temperature, low pressure conditions at which <b>core</b> <b>segregation</b> is considered to have originated [2]. Oxygen fugacity was varied from 2 to 6 log units below the iron-wüstite (IW) buffer by increasing the Si content of the metallic phase from 100 ppm up to the 8 % proposed by Allègre et al. [8] as being cosmochemically required in the earth's core. We find that Si and S, two of the principal candidates for the light element in the core are mutually exclusive in the metal phase. As oxygen fugacity is reduced, Si becomes increasingly siderophile and S increasingly lithophile. At 8 % Si in the metal, all S, up to at least 1 %, enters the coexisting ultramafic liquid. Thus, Si and S are incompatible during a single-stage low pressure core formation event. Mn and Cr, which are lithophile under oxidising conditions, become slightly siderophile if there is 8 % Si in the metal, corresponding to an oxygen fugacity of about 6 log units below the iron-wüstite (IW) buffer. Ti remains lithophile even under these conditions, only becoming siderophile at about 7 log units below IW. These results demonstrate that the Mn and Cr contents of the core proposed in [8], coupled with lithophile behaviour of Ti, are consistent with <b>core</b> <b>segregation</b> under strongly reducing conditions. Such conditions could not generate a core containing 2 % S, however, and the problem of the high contents of oxidised Fe, Ni, Co and other siderophile elements in the mantle would remain. The only plausible way of introducing S into the core is to add it as part of a late-stage accretion of oxidised material to the earth.

40|$|The massive (13, 000 - 26, 000 M⊙) {{and young}} (15 - 30 Myr) Large Magellanic Cloud star cluster NGC 1818 reveals an {{unexpected}} increasing binary frequency with radius for F-type stars (1. 3 - 2. 2 M⊙). This {{is in contrast}} to many older star clusters that show a decreasing binary frequency with radius. We study this phenomenon with sophisticated N-body modeling, exploring a range of initial conditions, from smooth virialized density distributions to highly substructured and collapsing configurations. We find that many of these models can reproduce the cluster's observed properties, although with a modest preference for substructured initial conditions. Our models produce the observed radial trend in binary frequency through disruption of soft binaries (with semi-major axes, a ≳ 3000 AU), on approximately a crossing time (~ 5. 4 Myr), preferentially in the cluster <b>core.</b> Mass <b>segregation</b> subsequently causes the binaries to sink toward the core. After roughly one initial half-mass relaxation time (trh(0) ~ 340 Myr) the radial binary frequency distribution becomes bimodal, the innermost binaries having already segregated toward the core, leaving a minimum in the radial binary frequency distribution that marches outward with time. After 4 - 6 trh(0), the rising distribution in the halo disappears, leaving a radial distribution that rises only toward the core. Thus, both a radial binary frequency distribution that falls toward the core (as observed for NGC 1818) and one that rises toward the core (as for older star clusters) can arise naturally from the same evolutionary sequence owing to binary disruption and mass segregation in rich star clusters. 10 page(s...|$|R

K {{under conditions of}} constant silicate melt composition with variable amounts of Si in the Fe-rich metallic liquid. Partitioning of Ni, Co, Mo, W and V is sensitive to the Si content of the metal with, in all five cases, increasing Si tending to make the element more lithophile than for conditions where the metal is Si-free. In contrast, metal-silicate partitioning of Cr and Nb is, at constant silicate melt composition, insensitive to the Si content of the metal. The implications of our data are that if, {{as indicated by the}} Si isotopic composition of the silicate Earth (Georg et al., 2007; Fitoussi et al., 2009), the core contains significant amounts of Si, the important siderophile elements Ni, Co, W and Mo were more lithophile during accretion and core formation than previously believed. We use our new data in conjunction with published metal-silicate partitioning results to develop a model of continuous accretion and <b>core</b> <b>segregation</b> taking explicit account of the partitioning of Si (this study) and O (from Ozawa et al., 2008) between metal and silicate and their effects on metal-silicate partitioning of siderophile elements.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of the dynamical friction suffered by a star cluster near the Galactic center {{have been performed}} with a parallelized tree code. Gerhard (2001) has suggested that dynamical friction, which causes a cluster to lose orbital energy and spiral in towards the galactic center, may explain {{the presence of a}} cluster of very young stars in the central parsec, where star formation might be prohibitively difficult owing to strong tidal forces. The clusters modeled in our simulations have an initial total mass of 10 ^ 5 - 10 ^ 6 Msun and initial galactocentric radii of 2. 5 - 30 pc. We have identified a few simulations in which dynamical friction indeed brings a cluster to the central parsec, although this is only possible if the cluster is either very massive (~ 10 ^ 6 Msun), or is formed near the central parsec ( 10 ^ 6 Msun pc- 3). The initial <b>core</b> collapse and <b>segregation</b> of massive stars into the cluster core, which typically happens on a much shorter time scale than that characterizing the dynamical inspiral of the cluster toward the Galactic center, can provide the requisite high density.

40|$|International audienceInterpretation of {{the noble}} gas isotopic {{signature}} in hotspots is still controversial. It suggests that relatively primitive material remains untapped {{in the deepest}} mantle, even while mantle convection and sub-surface melting efficiently erase primordial heterogeneities.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effects of temperature, pressure and metal composition on the metal-silicate partitioning of V, Cr, Ni, Co, Mn, Nb, W, Ga, P and Si in order to refine the 'deep magma ocean' model of core formation. Interactions in the liquid metal were accounted for by using metallurgical data while temperature effects were calculated using free energy data for liquid metals and liquid oxides. This approach enabled us to separate pressure effects {{from those of the}} other two variables. Mantle concentrations of the refractory elements can be well-matched by single-stage <b>core</b> <b>segregation</b> at 3750 K and a pressure of 40 GPa. The calculated temperature is, however, 800 degrees above the peridotite liquidus at 40 GPa, and is therefore physically implausible. The base of the magma ocean, at which metal would pond during accretion must be saturated in crystals and should, therefore lie close to the liquidus. We find that dynamic accretion models, in which pressure increased as the earth grew, do not improve the match to the peridotite liquidus so long as the oxygen fugacity is fixed by the current Fe content of the mantle. If, however, we force temperature to lie on the peridotite liquidus as the earth grew, the mantle concentrations of refractory elements can be matched provided oxygen fugacity increased during accretion. To illustrate this we use accretionary models in which, as the earth grew, the base of the magma ocean was at half the mantle depth and applied gradual or step-changes in oxygen fugacity. If we apply a 2 log unit increase in oxygen fugacity, the siderophile element contents of the mantle are matched, the Si content of the core is about 5 weight per cent and the average <b>core</b> <b>segregation</b> temperature is 2800 K, within the experimental range. Oxidation during accretion is an important component of heterogeneous accretion models, but the mechanisms proposed are generally untestable. Here we propose that an increase in oxidation state is a natural consequence {{of the size of the}} earth. Magnesium silicate perovskite is the principal phase in the earth's lower mantle. This phase forces the disproportionation of ferrous iron into ferric iron plus metal. When perovskite started to grow at the base of the magma ocean, dissolution and reprecipitation acted as an `oxygen pump' injecting oxidized ferric iron into the upper mantle. As the earth continued to grow, infalling metal was oxidized by the ferric iron into ferrous iron, raising the iron content of the magma ocean and the oxygen fugacity of metal-silicate equilibration. This process did not occur to any great extent on Mars because of the limited stability of perovskite in the smaller planet...|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, {{even though}} direct detections of IMBHs are challenging, {{signatures}} {{of the presence}} of an IMBH are imprinted in the phase-space distribution of stars in its immediate surrounding (Bahcall and Wolf 1976). The effects {{of the presence of}} an IMBH on the structural and kinematic properties of the host star clusters have subsequently been explored in detail by means of direct N-body simulations (Baumgardt et al. 2004 a, 2004 b, 2005). In particular, two signatures are at the basis of the observational claims for the detection of IMBHs in Galactic GCs: the detection of a shallow cusp in the surface brightness profile (e.g., see Noyola et al. 2008) and the presence of a rise in the projected velocity dispersion profile towards the centre (e.g., see Anderson and van der Marel 2010; Lützgendorf et al. 2013 b). However, these signatures can also be due to other processes: <b>core</b> collapse, mass <b>segregation,</b> or a population of binaries in the centre also produce a shallow cusp in the brightness profile, as shown with dedicated N-body simulations (Vesperini and Trenti 2010), and the central rise in the velocity dispersion profile is also not unique (Zocchi et al. 2017, 2018). The controversial case of ω Cen is an example of this degeneracy: isotropic spherical models only reproduce the observed rise in the projected velocity dispersion when a central IMBH of mass ∼ 4 × 10 ^ 4 M_ is included (Noyola et al. 2008), while by comparing anisotropic models (with radial anisotropy in the core and tangential anisotropy in the outer parts) to proper motion measurements an upper limit to the IMBH mass of only ∼ 7 × 10 ^ 3 M_ is obtained (van der Marel and Anderson 2010).|$|R

The compositions of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) (+ 0. 03 ± 0. 07 ‰, 2 s. d.) and ultramafic rocks (+ 0. 38 ± 0. 15 ‰, 2 s. d.) are relatively uniform and well resolved, providing evidence of fractionation associated with partial melting. In contrast intraplate and ocean island basalts (OIBs) display significant variability within a single locality from MORB-like to strongly negative (- 0. 56 ‰). The most extreme values measured are for nephelinites from the Cameroon Line and Trinidade, which also have anomalously high Ce/Pb and low Mo/Ce relative to normal oceanic basalts. The observed relationships between delta 98 / 95 Mo and Ce/Pb, U/Pb and Mo/Ce provide evidence that sulphide plays a critical role in retaining Mo in the mantle and fractionating its isotopic composition in basaltic magmas. If residual sulphides are responsible the Mo isotopic composition, Mo budget of the bulk silicate Earth will be misrepresented by values estimated from basalts. On this basis a revised best estimate of the Mo content in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) ranging between 251 to 268 ppb is derived, approximately 6 times higher than previously assumed, and similar to the levels of depletion in refractory siderophile elements such as W, Ni and Co. This significantly ameliorates the argument for Mo removal via late stage sulphide extraction to the core. The Mo isotopic composition of the BSE (0. 35 ‰) is distinct from the delta 98 / 95 Mo values found in primitive and iron meteorites. Although Mo isotopic fractionation varies between different phases within a single iron meteorite, and occurs during fractional crystallization in asteroidal cores, most iron meteorites have ddelta 98 / 95 MoSRM 3134 (- 0. 14 to - 0. 06 ‰) that are similar to ordinary and CI carbonaceous chondrite (- 0. 12 to - 0. 09 ‰). This range of delta 98 / 95 Moo is not only significantly lighter than the BSE, but also enstatite chondrites, which have delta 98 / 95 Mo values of 0. 04 to 0. 13 ‰. Several possible explanations are proposed. (A) Core-mantle differentiation fractionates Mo isotopes. The recently proposed Mo effect of sulphide liquid removal is likely to be minor because this should have generated a light Mo isotope composition for the BSE. However, isotopic fractionation associated with metal-silicate partitioning may be responsible for the heavy Mo in the BSE. (B) A distinct isotopic composition for the late material that contributed Mo to the BSE. Enstatite chondrites (or other putative groups of chondrites with a heavy Mo isotope composition) and sulphur-rich components form the cores of impacting bodies are the most likely candidates that could deliver heavy Mo to Earth. (C) The Mo isotopic composition of the Solar System is heterogeneous in a mass dependent fashion such that heavier Mo isotopes are enriched in the section of the disk from which Earth accreted. There are some difficulties behind each of these models and further work is needed to determine which is correct. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent high {{precision}} (142) Nd isotope measurements showed that global silicate differentiation {{may have occurred}} as early as 30 - 75 Myr after the Solar System formation [Bennett V, et al. (2007) Science 318 : 1907 - 1910]. This time scale is almost contemporaneous with Earth's core formation at approximately 30 Myr [Yin Q, et al. (2002) Nature 418 : 949 - 952]. The (182) Hf-(182) W system provides a powerful complement to the (142) Nd results for early silicate differentiation, because both core formation and silicate differentiation fractionate Hf from W. Here we show that eleven terrestrial samples from diverse tectonic settings, including five early Archean samples from Isua, Greenland, of which three have been previously shown with (142) Nd anomalies, all have a homogeneous W isotopic composition, which is approximately 2 epsilon-unit more radiogenic than the chondritic value. By using a 3 -stage model calculation that describes the isotopic evolution in chondritic reservoir and <b>core</b> <b>segregation,</b> as well as silicate differentiation, we show that the W isotopic composition of terrestrial samples provides the most stringent time constraint for early core formation (27. 5 - 38 Myr) followed by early terrestrial silicate differentiation (38 - 75 Myr) {{that is consistent with}} the terrestrial (142) Nd anomalies...|$|E
40|$|Kelvin {{calculated}} {{the age of}} the Earth to be about 24 million years by assuming conductive cooling from being fully molten to its current state. Although simplistic, his result is interesting {{in the context of the}} dramatic cooling that took place after the putative Moon-forming giant impact, which contributed the final ∼ 10 per cent of the Earth's mass. The rate of accretion and <b>core</b> <b>segregation</b> on Earth as deduced from the U–Pb system is much slower than that obtained from Hf–W systematics and implies substantial accretion after the Moon-forming impact, which occurred 45 ± 5 Myr after the beginning of the Solar System. Here we propose an explanation for the two timescales. We suggest that the Hf–W timescale reflects the principal phase of core-formation before the giant impact. Crystallization of silicate perovskite in the lower mantle during this phase produced Fe³⁺, which was released during the giant impact, and this oxidation resulted in late segregation of sulphur-rich metal into which Pb dissolved readily, setting the younger U–Pb age of the Earth. Separation of the latter metal then occurred 30 ± 10 Myr after the Moon-forming impact. Over this time span, in surprising agreement with Kelvin's result, the Earth cooled by about 4, 000 K in returning from a fully molten to a partially crystalline state. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this study, we {{investigated}} iron–magnesium exchange and transition-metal trace-element partitioning between magnesium silicate perovskite (Mg,Fe) SiO 3 and ferropericlase (Mg,Fe) O synthetised under lower-mantle conditions (up to 115 GPa and 2200 K) in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Recovered samples were thinned to electron transparency by {{focused ion beam}} and characterized by analytical transmission electron microscopy (ATEM) and nanometer-scale secondary ion mass spectroscopy (nanoSIMS). Iron concentrations in both phases were obtained from X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy measurements and nanoSIMS. Our results {{are the first to}} show that recently reported spin-state and phase transitions in the lower mantle directly affect the evolution of Fe–Mg exchange between both phases. Mg-perovskite becomes increasingly iron-depleted above 70 – 80 GPa possibly due to the high spin–low spin transition of iron in ferropericlase. Conversely, the perovskite to post-perovskite transition is accompanied by a strong iron enrichment of the silicate phase, ferropericlase remaining in the Fe-rich phase though. Nanoparticles of metallic iron were observed in the perovskite-bearing runs, suggesting the disproportionation of ferrous iron oxide, but were not observed when the post- perovskite phase was present. Implications on the oxidation state of the Earth and <b>core</b> <b>segregation</b> will be discussed. Transition trace-element (Ni, Mn) concentrations (determined with the nanoSIMS) show similar trends and could thus be used to trace the origin of diamonds generated at depth. This study provides new results likely to improve the geochemical and geophysical models of the Earth's deep interiors...|$|E
40|$|The Pb isotopic {{compositions}} of maskelynite and pyroxene grains {{were measured}} in ALH 84001 and three enriched shergottites (Zagami, Roberts Massif 04262, and Larkman Nunatuk 12011) by secondary ion mass spectrometry. A maskelynite-pyroxene isochron for ALH 84001 defines a crystallization age of 4089 [*]±[*] 73 [*]Ma (2 σ). The initial Pb isotopic composition of each meteorite {{was measured in}} multiple maskelynite grains. ALH 84001 has the least radiogenic initial Pb isotopic composition of any Martian meteorite measured to date (i. e., 206 Pb/ 204 Pb[*]=[*] 10. 07 [*]±[*] 0. 17, 2 σ). Assuming an age of reservoir formation for ALH 84001 and the enriched shergottites of 4513 [*]Ma, a two-stage Pb isotopic model has been constructed. This model links ALH 84001 and the enriched shergottites by their similar μ value (238 U/ 204 Pb) of 4. 1 – 4. 6 from 4. 51 [*]Ga to 4. 1 [*]Ga and 0. 17 [*]Ga, respectively. The model employed here is dependent on a chondritic μ value (~ 1. 2) from 4567 to 4513 [*]Ma, which implies that <b>core</b> <b>segregation</b> had little to {{no effect on the}} μ value(s) of the Martian mantle. The proposed Pb isotopic model here can be used to calculate ages that are in agreement with Rb-Sr, Lu-Hf, and Sm-Nd ages previously determined in the meteorites and confirm the young (~ 170 [*]Ma) ages of the enriched shergottites and ancient, > 4 [*]Ga, age of ALH 84001...|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} metal-silicate partitioning experiments at 2  GPa and 1650 - 2180  °C {{to investigate the}} behaviour of Pb and Tl during terrestrial core formation. The aim was {{to test the hypothesis}} that metal core formation followed by late sulphide addition to the core resulted in the concentrations and isotopic compositions of Pb and Tl in the silicate Earth. We investigated DPbmet/sil and DTLmet/sil as functions of the sulphur content of the metal and measured the equilibrium Tl isotope fractionation between the coexisting phases. Lead is moderately siderophile under the likely conditions (initially reducing [Wade, J., Wood, B. J., Core formation and the oxidation state of the Earth, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 236 (2005) 78 - 95. ]) of <b>core</b> <b>segregation</b> on Earth so that the μ(238 U/ 204 Pb) of the bulk silicate Earth should have increased by a factor of 6. 5 (DPb ∼ 13) as the core separated. In the case of Tl, <b>core</b> <b>segregation</b> should have reduced the Tl concentration of the BSE by about 50 %. Neither the Pb nor Tl isotopic compositions of the bulk silicate Earth can, however, be completely explained by S-free iron core formation. Thallium isotopes were found not to be significantly fractionated by metal or sulphide separation from silicate. Addition of sulphur to the metal greatly increases metal-silicate partition coefficients for both Pb and Tl. DPbmet/sil increases by a factor of 15 and DTLmet/sil by a factor of 45 as S increases from 0 to 35 % in the metal phase. This means that extraction of sulphide from a molten mantle would result in DPbsulph/sil of ∼ 40 and DTLsulph/sil of ∼ 60. We used the latter results to calculate the effects of late sulphide extraction on the Pb and Tl isotopic compositions of the silicate Earth. For a bulk Earth with μ of 0. 7 addition of 1. 6 % sulphide to the core 100 - 140  Myr after the beginning of the solar system is sufficient to displace the Pb-isotopic composition of the silicate Earth into the region indicated by estimates in the literature. The Tl concentration and e{open} 205 Tl of bulk silicate Earth are also consistent with this extent of sulphide addition. Raising μ of the Earth reduces the amount of sulphide addition to the core needed to satisfy the Pb and Tl isotopic constraints but for values of μ above 0. 9 (< 0. 65 % sulphide) the sulphide has insufficient effect. Separation of sulphide from a mixture of silicate crystals and melt would, however, because of the incompatible nature of Pb and Tl amplify the sulphide effect. We show that, for initial μ of 0. 7, as little as 0. 1 % sulphide extraction (at 150 - 200  Myr) from a mixture of 91 % crystals and 9 % melt would be sufficient to displace the isotopic compositions of Pb and Tl of the BSE to the required values. Late volatile loss of Pb and Tl is, therefore, not required by the partitioning and currently available isotopic data. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Fe-Ni {{catalysts}} present high {{activity in}} dry reforming of methane, with high carbon resistance, but suffer from deactivation via sintering and Fe segregation. Enhanced {{control of the}} stability and activity of Fe-Ni/MgAl 2 O 4 was achieved by means of Pd addition. The evolution of the catalyst structure during H- 2 Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) and CO 2 Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) was investigated using time-resolved in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD). During reduction of Fe-Ni-Pd supported on MgAl 2 O 4, a core shell alloy forms at the surface, where Fe-Ni is in the core and Fe-Ni-Pd in the shell. A 0. 2 wt% Pd loading or Ni:Pd molar ratio as high as 75 : 1 showed the best performance {{in terms of both}} activity and stability of the catalyst at 1023 K and total pressure of 101. 3 kPa. Experimental results and DFT calculations showed that Pd addition to bimetallic Fe-Ni reduces the tendency of Fe to segregate {{to the surface of the}} alloy particles under methane dry reforming (DRM) conditions, due to the formation of a thin Fe-Ni-Pd surface layer. The latter acts as a barrier for Fe segregation from the <b>core.</b> <b>Segregation</b> of Fe from the trimetallic shell still occurs, but to a lesser extent as the Fe concentration is lower. This Ni:Pd molar ratio is capable of controlling the carbon formation and hence ensure high catalyst activity of 24. 8 mmol s(- 1) g(metals) (- 1) after 21 h time-on-stream. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.
