Three commonly applied methods are a visual analog scale(VAS), the standard gamble(SG), and the time trade-off(TTO). We studied participants subjective experience using computer implementations these methods using scale we call the VIBE (for Value Instrument Battery [...] Evaluation) that measures four aspects of user acceptance (clarity, difficulty, reasonableness, and comfort level) Studies were performed in two groups: patients with HIV infection (n= 75) and {{a convenience sample of}} the general public(n= 640). In the patient study, VIBE scores appeared reliable (<b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha of <b>0.</b> 739, 0. 826, and 0. 716, for VAS, SG, and TTO ratings, respectively.) Patients acceptance of the VAS the highest, followed by the TTO and the SG method (p< 0. 05 for all comparisons). Despite significant enhancements in computer software for measuring SG preferences, observed differences in acceptance between SG and VAS methods were replicated in the general public study (p< 0. 0001 for differences).

The two factors explained 50. 04 % of the variance (LV = 20. 24 % and FR = 29. 80 %). Inter-item correlations were all significant and the item-total correlations suggested the weakness of one item in the LV scale. <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha was <b>0.</b> 72 (LV) and 0. 79 (FR). Confirmatory factor analysis however provided marginal support for the posited structure. Vigorous types were significantly more alert than languid types across the day and suggested they are less influenced by sleep inertia on waking. Vigorous types also reported needing significantly less sleep. Significant differences in alertness between flexible and rigid types were found between 16 : 00 and 22 : 00 and suggested flexible types are less influenced by circadian and wakefulness factors during these periods. Flexible types also reported significantly less sleep need compared to rigid types. The findings suggested vigorous and flexible types would best cope with shiftwork. It is concluded that the CTI demonstrated good reliability and validity in a working sample. Recommendations for future studies are made...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{validate}} a Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE). METHODS: The SSE {{was completed}} by 40 adult with epilepsy attending an Outpatient Epilepsy Clinic at the University Hospital of UNICAMP, and by 40 people from the community. People were interviewed on an individual basis; a psychologist read the questions to the subjects who wrote the answers in a sheet. The procedure was {{the same for all}} the subjects and completion took around ten minutes. RESULTS: The SSE has 24 items. The internal consistency of the SSE showed alpha <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> coefficient <b>0.</b> 88 for the patients with epilepsy and 0. 81 for the community. The overall mean scores of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy formula were: 46 (SD= 18. 22) for patients and 49 (SD= 13. 25) for the community where a score of 0 would suggest no stigma, and 100 maximum stigma. DISCUSSION: The SSE has satisfactory content validity and high internal consistency. It allows the quantification of the perception of stigma by patients and people from community; this can then be used for interventional studies, such as mass media campaign in minimizing the negative facets of stigma. OBJETIVO: Validar a Escala de Estigma na Epilepsia (EEE). MÉTODO: A EEE foi aplicada em 40 pacientes adultos com o diagnóstico de Epilepsia do Ambulatório de Epilepsia do HC/Unicamp e em 40 pessoas da comunidade em geral. Os sujeitos foram entrevistados individualmente pelas psicólogas, que foram lendo as questões e anotando as respostas na escala. As condições de aplicação foram as mesmas e a aplicação durou cerca de 10 minutos. RESULTADOS: A EEE possui 24 itens. A consistência interna da EEE mostrou alfa de Cronbach, de 0, 88 para os pacientes com epilepsia e 0, 81 para a comunidade. As médias do valor geral de estigma obtido com a fórmula da EEE foram: 46 (DP= 18, 22) para os pacientes e 49 (DP= 13, 25) para a comunidade.

40|$|Background/Purpose. Black {{women have}} lower injury {{prevalence}} after sexual assault and childbirth {{as compared to}} White women. Investigators have also published findings describing similar differences in wound healing and in pressure ulcer formation. Sommers et al. (2008) suggested that differences in injury prevalence may not be related to race or ethnicity, but rather to skin color, and that {{the properties of the}} skin may vary based on skin color. To explicate biomechanical differences that might influence the effects of skin injury versus protection, we chose to investigate the physiological constructs of viscoelasticity and skin color. The study aim was to account for the variability in skin viscoelasticity at four anatomical locations (volar forearm, upper inner arm, inner thigh, and sacrum) as a function of race/ethnicity, skin color, age, body mass index (BMI), recent weight loss, smoking status, sun exposure, and health status in women. ^ Methods. We enrolled 233 healthy adult female participants at a large urban university in this prospective study with a descriptive, cross-sectional design. Study staff collected data regarding health status and demographics via survey. We calculated BMI after obtaining height and weight measurements on-site and measured skin color with a handheld spectrophotometer and skin elasticity with the Cutometer MPA 580. We also developed and used the Sun Exposure Survey Instrument (SESI), which we first evaluated for content validity (S-CVI 0. 944) and internal consistency (<b>Cronbach.</b> <b>s</b> alpha <b>0.</b> 869, 17 items, N= 63) to measure sun exposure. ^ Results. Significant differences were found in viscoelasticity values across anatomic sites for all participants. The most significant predictor variables of skin viscoelasticity were age, recent weight loss, and BMI. R 2 results ranged from 0. 24 - 0. 41. The significance of the relationships between skin color, sun exposure, and race with viscoelasticity varied across sites. ^ Conclusions and Future Work. The association between aging and decreased skin elasticity is well known, but confirmed herein. The findings on BMI and weight loss are novel and require further investigation. While we explained little of the variance in skin elasticity through the skin color and sun exposure variables, we contend that these relationships should be reassessed with a greater number of participants and a more diverse sample. ...|$|R

The numerical simulations were carried out by exciting the fundamental A 0 Lamb mode at metal end in the frequency range of 150 - 225 kHz by varying the adhesive orientation {{in the range of}} 1 in 20 to 900. When <b>S</b> <b>0</b> Lamb mode interacts with adhesive, reflection, transmission and generation of A 0 takes place. The incident <b>S</b> <b>0</b> and generated A 0 modes propagate in the model as <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>S</b> <b>0</b> and <b>S</b> <b>0</b> A 0 modes. The ToF of reflected and transmitted <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>S</b> <b>0</b> and <b>S</b> <b>0</b> A 0 modes at receiving points were calculated analytically and compared with those obtained from numerical simulations.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. While the importance of assessing the occupational consequences of insomnia and other sleep disorders is emphasised in clinical nosologies and research guidelines, there is little consensus on which aspects of occupational performance should be assessed, how such impairment should be measured, and how outcomes should be reported. The research programme described in this thesis aimed to address this issue. Chapter 1 presents a systematic review and methodical critique of studies reporting those aspects of occupational performance most impacted by (or most frequently associated with) insomnia symptoms and degraded sleep quality. Equivocal results, wide variations in reporting conventions, and the overall lack of comparability among studies, strongly indicated {{the need to develop}} a standardised metric able to quantify sleep related occupational performance and serve as an assessment and outcome instrument suitable for use in research and clinical settings. Informed by the literature review, Chapters 2 - 4 describe the development and validation of the Loughborough Occupational Impact of Sleep Scale (LOISS), a unidimensional 19 item questionnaire that captures sleep-related occupational impairment across a number of workplace domains over a 4 -week reference period. Chapters 5 - 7 describe LOISS outcomes from: i) surveys in a random population sample; ii) a representative sample of the UK workforce; and iii) a clinical sample of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (before and after treatment with CPAP). Overall, the scale showed strong internal consistency (<b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha range= <b>0.</b> 84 - 0. 94) and test-retest reliability (r= 0. 77, r 2 = 0. 59, p< 0. 001), high levels of criterion validity (significantly discriminating between good and poor sleepers), and proved an effective outcome measure in OSA. From the survey data reported in Chapters 2 - 7, LOISS score distributions showed no consistent gender difference but did show a significant ageing gradient, with sleep-related occupational impairment declining with increasing age. In conclusion, the work presented here supports the usability, validity and reliability of the LOISS as an assessment and outcome instrument, and also demonstrates the utility of this instrument in exploring the dynamics of sleep-related occupational performanc...|$|R

40|$|Two {{contradictory}} {{results on}} the evolution of SO galaxies now exist in the recent literature; either <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s</b> are old (z_formation> 2) and are evoloving passively or most of them formed at z< 0. 5, as implied by the deficit of <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s</b> in intermediate redshift (z∼ 0. 5) clusters.

40|$|An {{overview}} {{of the results of}} the near-IR <b>S</b> <b>0</b> galaxy survey (NIRS <b>0</b> <b>S)</b> is presented. NIRS <b>0</b> <b>S</b> is a magnitude- (mB⩽ 12. 5 [*]mag) and inclination- (< 65 ∘) limited sample of ̃ 200 nearby galaxies, mainly <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s,</b> but includes also Sa and E galaxies. It uses deep Ks-band images, typically reaching a surface brightness of 23. 5 [*]mag arcsec− 2. Detailed visual and photometric classifications were made, for the first time coding also the lenses in a systematic manner. As a comparison sample, a similar sized spiral galaxy sample with similar image quality was used. Based on our analysis, the Hubble sequence was revisited: following the early idea by van den Bergh we suggested that the <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s</b> are spread throughout the Hubble sequence in parallel tuning forks as spirals (<b>S</b> <b>0</b> a, <b>S</b> <b>0</b> b, <b>S</b> <b>0</b> c, etc.). This is evidenced by our improved bulge-to-total (B/T) flux ratios in the <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s,</b> reaching small values typical to late-type spirals. The properties of bulges and disks in <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s</b> were found to be similar to those in spirals and, also, the masses and scale parameters of the bulges and disks to be coupled. It was estimated that the spiral bulges brighter than − 20 [*]mag in K-band are massive enough to be converted into the bulges of <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s</b> merely by star formation. Bars were found to be fairly robust both in <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s</b> and spirals, but, inspite of that, bars might evolve significantly within the Hubble sequence...|$|R

The theoretical interpretation of the corresponding observables is limited by uncertainties from doubly Cabibbo-suppressed penguin topologies. With continuously increasing experimental precision, it is mandatory {{to get a handle}} on these contributions, which cannot be calculated reliably in QCD. In the case of the measurement of sin 2 β from B d <b>0</b> → J/ψK <b>S</b> <b>0,</b> the U-spin-related decay B <b>s</b> <b>0</b> → J/ψK <b>S</b> <b>0</b> offers a tool to control the penguin effects. As the required measurements are not yet available, we use data for decays with similar dynamics and the SU(3) flavour symmetry to constrain the size of the expected penguin corrections. We predict the CP asymmetries of B <b>s</b> <b>0</b> → J/ψK <b>S</b> <b>0</b> and present a scenario to fully exploit the physics potential of this decay, emphasising also the determination of hadronic parameters and their comparison with theory.

40|$|Context. Recent {{studies have}} argued that galaxy mergers are not {{important}} drivers {{for the evolution of}} <b>S</b> <b>0</b> 's, on the basis that mergers cannot preserve the coupling between the bulge and disk scale-lengths observed in these galaxies and the lack of correlation of their ratio with the <b>S</b> <b>0</b> Hubble type. However, about 70 % of present-day <b>S</b> <b>0</b> 's reside in groups, an environment where mergers and tidal interactions dominate galaxy evolution. Aims. We investigate whether the remnants resulting from collision-less N-body simulations of intermediate and minor mergers onto <b>S</b> <b>0</b> galaxies evolve fulfilling global structural relations observed between the bulges and disks of these galaxies. Methods. Different initial bulge-to-disk ratios of the primary <b>S</b> <b>0</b> have been considered, as well as different satellite densities, mass ratios, and orbits of the encounter. We have analysed the final morphology of the remnants in images simulating the typical observing conditions of <b>S</b> <b>0</b> surveys. We derive bulge+disk decompositions of the final remnants to compare their global bulge-to-disk structure with observations. Results. We show that all remnants present undisturbed <b>S</b> <b>0</b> morphologies according to the prescriptions of specialized surveys. The dry intermediate and minor mergers induce noticeable bulge growth (<b>S</b> <b>0</b> c [...] > <b>S</b> <b>0</b> b and <b>S</b> <b>0</b> b [...] > <b>S</b> <b>0</b> a), but affect negligibly to the bulge and disk scale-lengths. Therefore, if a coupling between these two components exists prior to the merger, the encounter does not break this coupling. This fact provides a simple explanation for the lack of correlation between the ratio of bulge and disk scale-lengths and the <b>S</b> <b>0</b> Hubble type reported by observations. Conclusions. These models prove that dry intermediate and minor mergers can induce global structural evolution within the sequence of <b>S</b> <b>0</b> Hubble types compatible with observations, meaning that these processes should not be discarded from the evolutionary scenarios of <b>S</b> <b>0</b> 's just {{on the basis of the}} strong coupling observed between the bulge and disk scale-lengths in these galaxies...|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} for bimodal stellar age distribution of pseudobulges of <b>S</b> <b>0</b> galaxies as probed by the $D_n(4000) $ index. We do not observe any bimodality in age distribution for pseudobulges in spiral galaxies. Our sample is flux limited and contains 2067 <b>S</b> <b>0</b> and 2630 spiral galaxies {{drawn from the}} Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We identify pseudobulges in <b>S</b> <b>0</b> and spiral galaxies, based on {{the position of the}} bulge on the Kormendy diagram and their central velocity dispersion. Dividing the pseudobulges of <b>S</b> <b>0</b> galaxies into those containing old and young stellar populations, we study the connection between global star formation and pseudobulge age on the $u-r$ color-mass diagram. We find that most old pseudobulges are hosted by passive galaxies while majority of young bulges are hosted by galaxies which are star forming. Dividing our sample of <b>S</b> <b>0</b> galaxies into early-type <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s</b> and <b>S</b> <b>0</b> /a galaxies, we find that old pseudobulges are mainly hosted by early-type <b>S</b> <b>0</b> galaxies while most of the pseudobulges in <b>S</b> <b>0</b> /a galaxies are young. We speculate that morphology plays a strong role in quenching of star formation in the disc of these <b>S</b> <b>0</b> galaxies, which stops the growth of pseudobulges, giving rise to old pseudobulges and the observed age bimodality.

Bar strengths based on the gravitational torque method are derived from 2. 2 micron Ks-band images for a statistical sample of 138 (98 <b>S</b> <b>0,</b> 40 <b>S</b> <b>0</b> /a,Sa) galaxies having a mean total blue magnitude <= 12. 5 and generally inclined less than 65 degrees. We find that <b>S</b> <b>0</b> galaxies have weaker bars on average than spiral galaxies in general, even compared to their closest spiral counterparts, <b>S</b> <b>0</b> /a and Sa galaxies. The differences are significant and cannot be due entirely to uncertainties in the assumed vertical scale-heights or in the assumption of constant mass-to-light ratios. Part of the difference is likely due simply to the dilution of the bar torques by the higher mass bulges seen in <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s.</b> If spiral galaxies accrete external gas, as advocated by Bournaud & Combes, then the fewer strong bars found among <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s</b> imply a lack of gas accretion according to this theory. If <b>S</b> <b>0</b> <b>s</b> are stripped former spirals, or else are evolved from former spirals due to internal secular dynamical processes which deplete the gas as well as grow the bulges, then the weaker bars and the prevalence of lenses in <b>S</b> <b>0</b> galaxies could further indicate that bar evolution continues to proceed during and even after gas depletionComment: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal, September 2010 issue (LaTex, 29 pages + 3 figures, uses aastex. cls...|$|R
