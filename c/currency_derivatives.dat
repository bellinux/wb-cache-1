40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an expected}} utility {{model of a}} multinational firm facing exchange rate risk exposure to a foreign currency cash flow. <b>Currency</b> <b>derivative</b> markets do not exist between the domestic and foreign currencies. There are, however, currency futures and options markets between the domestic currency and a third currency to which the firm has access. Since a triangular parity condition holds among these three currencies, the available, yet incomplete, currency futures and options markets still provide a useful avenue for the firm to indirectly hedge against its foreign exchange risk exposure. This paper offers analytical insights into the optimal cross-hedging strategies of the firm. In particular, the results show the optimality of using options in conjunction with futures {{in the case of}} currency mismatching, even though cash flows appear to be linear. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The information collected included foreign equity assets, foreign currency denominated debt assets and liabilities, expected future foreign currency receipts and payments from trade, the principal value of outstanding <b>currency</b> <b>derivative</b> contracts and policies on hedging foreign currency exposure. The survey was conducted by the ABS at the request of, and with the financial support of, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).

40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} effect of {{corporate}} risk management activities on firm value, using a sample of large UK non-financial firms. Following recent changes in financial reporting standards, {{we are able to}} collect detailed information on risk management activities from audited financial reports. This enables us {{to gain a better understanding}} of risk management practices and to investigate value implications of different types of hedging. Overall 86. 88 % of the firms in the sample use derivatives to manage at least one type of price risk. The hedging premium is statistically and economically significant for foreign <b>currency</b> <b>derivative</b> users, while we provide weak evidence that interest rate hedging increases firm value. The extent of hedging and the hedging horizon have an impact on the hedging premium, whereas operational risk management activities do not significantly influence the market value of the firm...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of an international}} real estate investment can be critically affected by currency fluctuations. While survey work suggests large international investors with multi-asset portfolios tend to hedge their overall currency exposure at portfolio level, smaller and specialist investors {{are more likely to}} hedge individual investments and face considerable specific risk. This presents particular problems in direct real estate investment due to the lengthy holding period. Prior research investigating the issue relies on ex post portfolio measure, understating the risk faced. This paper examines individual risk using a forward-looking simulation approach to model uncertain cashflow. The results suggest that a US investor can greatly reduce the downside currency risk inherent in UK real estate by using a swap structure – but at the expense of dampening upside potential.

40|$|Firm {{managers}} can use financial hedging (real actions) or earnings management (artificial techniques) to buffer economic shocks, such as exchange rate fluctuations, to their firm’s operating performance. This study investigates {{the potential impact}} of foreign <b>currency</b> <b>derivative</b> (FCD) usage and earnings management (EM) on firm value. Using a sample of S&P 500 non-financial firms from 2001 to 2003, we find that there is a significantly positive impact of FCD usage on firm market value. The premium from currency hedging is about 11 % of firm value. On the other hand, the contribution of earnings management on firm value only shows for small firms, which tend to be associated with greater information asymmetry. A further exploration of the value increasing mechanism indicates that FCD usage indeed increases firm value through its hedging effect on firm exchange rate exposure. However, the same conclusion does not apply to earnings management...|$|R
