30|$|In {{order to}} assess whether <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> spatial {{thinking}} predicted <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> mathematics reasoning, we used multiple linear regressions to predict <b>change</b> <b>in</b> math accuracy. Predictors included grade, and pre-post <b>change</b> <b>in</b> spatial task (Make-a-Dice, Paper Folding, Purdue Rotations) accuracy, using the “stats” package in R version 3.1. 2. It {{should be noted that}} <b>change</b> <b>in</b> accuracy on the spatial tests are not correlated: <b>change</b> <b>in</b> Make-A-Dice is not correlated with <b>change</b> <b>in</b> Paper Folding, r(77)[*]=[*] 0.02, p[*]=[*] 0.86, <b>change</b> <b>in</b> Make-A-Dice is not correlated with <b>change</b> <b>in</b> Purdue Rotations, r(75)[*]=[*]− 0.04, p[*]=[*] 0.72, and <b>change</b> <b>in</b> Paper Folding is not correlated with <b>change</b> <b>in</b> Purdue Rotation, r(78)[*]=[*] 0.00, p[*]=[*] 1.00.|$|R

30|$|Another {{regression}} model used <b>change</b> <b>in</b> accuracy {{for the three}} spatial tests (fixed effects) and pre-test math accuracy (fixed effect) to predict <b>change</b> <b>in</b> math accuracy.

In a {{regression model}} with only pre-test math accuracy and <b>change</b> <b>in</b> Paper Folding accuracy, students’ predicted <b>change</b> <b>in</b> math accuracy was equal to 29.07 [*]−[*] 0.43 (pre-test math accuracy)[*]+[*] 0.20 (<b>change</b> <b>in</b> Paper Folding accuracy). <b>Change</b> <b>in</b> Paper Folding accuracy (t[*]=[*] 2.43, p[*]<[*] 0.05) and pre-test math accuracy (t[*]=[*]− 5.26, p[*]<[*] 0.001) were both significant predictors. This model indicates that as pre-test math accuracy increases the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> math accuracy decreases, as there is less opportunity for gains, but as <b>change</b> <b>in</b> Paper Folding accuracy increases <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> math accuracy increases (Fig.  11).|$|R

40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the manifest refractive error (ΔM), the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power (ΔACP) and initial corneal asphericity (Q) in overnight orthokeratology (ortho-K). Methods: One hundred and twenty-eight clinical records of children undergoing ortho-K from a university optometry clinic were reviewed. The refractive and topographical data at baseline and at two-week visit of 58 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and analysed. Results: Significant differences (p < 0. 001) between the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the apical corneal power or the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power (ΔMCP) within the treatment zone were found. Linear regression analysis was used to describe the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power, and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error and the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power, with the equations: ΔM = 0. 91 ΔACP + 0. 57 (r = 0. 78, p < 0. 001) and ΔM = 0. 93 ΔMCP + 0. 01 (r = 0. 79, p < 0. 001) respectively. On average, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power underestimated the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error by 0. 34 ± 0. 57 D; whereas on average, the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power overestimated the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error by 0. 23 ± 0. 57 D (paired-t-tests, p < 0. 001). A low but significant correlation between initial corneal asphericity and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error (Spearman r = - 0. 33, p = 0. 01) was observed. Conclusions: The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power underestimates the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error in ortho-K, whereas the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power overestimates this parameter. Compared with retinoscopy and autorefraction, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power is still useful for estimation of the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error. Although the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power appears to give a closer estimation of the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error than the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power, there is no advantage in the use of maximum corneal power (manually located) instead of apical corneal power (a default given by the topographer) to estimate the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error, as there is {{no significant difference in the}} estimations by either parameter. Initial corneal asphericity measured by the Medmont E 300 corneal topographer has limited usage <b>in</b> predicting the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error in overnight ortho-K.
