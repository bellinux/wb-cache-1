5|$|An f-deck is a {{data file}} that {{contains}} {{a record of the}} fixes of a storm's location and/or intensity. A location fix is any position estimate of the storm center. An intensity fix is any estimate of the storm's intensity.

Various methods that use satellite imagery or other remote sensing can also provide location and intensity fixes.|$|E

5|$|Halides of the {{structure}} PoX2, PoX4 and PoF6 are known. They are soluble in the corresponding hydrogen halides, i.e., PoClX in HCl, PoBrX in HBr and PoI4 in HI. Polonium dihalides are formed by direct reaction of the elements or by reduction of PoCl4 with SO2 and with PoBr4 with H2S at room temperature.

5|$|Very pure lead <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> {{processing}} smelted lead electrolytically {{using the}} Betts process.

5|$|In 1996, German {{mathematician}} Petra Gummelt {{demonstrated that}} a covering (so called to {{distinguish it from}} a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed. The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.|$|E

5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0–7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E
5|$|The joint {{production}} possibilities {{set at the}} extreme right shows {{the total amount of}} both commodities that can be produced by Crusoe and Friday together. It combines the best of both workers. If both of them work to gather coconuts only, the economy will have 144 coconuts in all, 96 from Crusoe and 48 from Friday. (This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> setting F=0 in their respective PPF equations and summing them up). Here the slope of the joint PPF is -1/2.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E

5|$|More complex {{protactinium}} fluorides {{are also}} known such as Pa2F9 and ternary fluorides {{of the types}} MPaF6 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs or NH4), M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb, Cs or NH4) and M3PaF8 (M = Li, Na, Rb, Cs), all being white crystalline solids. The MPaF6 formula can be represented as a combination of MF and PaF5. These compounds <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> evaporating a hydrofluoric acid solution containing these both complexes. For the small alkali cations like Na, the crystal structure is tetragonal, whereas it lowers to orthorphombic for larger cations K+, Rb+, Cs+ or NH4+. A similar variation was observed for the M2PaF7 fluorides, namely the crystal symmetry was dependent on the cation and differed for Cs2PaF7 and M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb or NH4).|$|E
5|$|The {{fluorides}} of tantalum can be {{used for}} its separation from niobium. Tantalum forms halogen compounds in the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3 of the type , , and , although multi-core complexes and substoichiometric compounds are also known. Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF5) is a white solid with a melting point of 97.0°C and tantalum pentachloride (TaCl5) is a white solid with a melting point of 247.4°C. Tantalum pentachloride is hydrolyzed by water and reacts with additional tantalum at elevated temperatures by forming the black and highly hygroscopic tantalum tetrachloride (TaCl4). While the trihalides <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> reduction of the pentahalides with hydrogen, the dihalides do not exist. A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals. Tantalum compounds with oxidation states as low as −1 have been reported in 2008.|$|E
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
