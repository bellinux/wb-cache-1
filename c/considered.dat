5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were <b>considered</b> to be indicators of character and good or bad luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were <b>considered</b> to have good or bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was <b>considered</b> to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were <b>considered</b> representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were <b>considered</b> to show good or bad luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were <b>considered</b> a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E

5|$|Aetosauria {{was first}} named in 1889 by English naturalist Richard Lydekker and {{zoologist}} Henry Alleyne Nicholson. They <b>considered</b> Aetosauria {{to be one}} of three suborders of the order Crocodilia, the other two being Parasuchia (a Triassic group) and Eusuchia (a group including all post-Triassic crocodiles). At the time, Cope <b>considered</b> Aetosauria to belong to Rhynchocephalia, an order of reptiles that includes the living tuatara. He also thought that the tightly fitting osteoderms, which were thought to be fused to the ribs, indicated that aetosaurs were transitional between rhynchocephalians and turtles. Nicholson and Lydekker placed a single family within the suborder, Aëtosauridæ. They <b>considered</b> aetosaurs to be similar to living crocodilians apart from their elongated metatarsals, which were compared to those of dinosaurs. In fact, Marsh <b>considered</b> aetosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs because both had similar metatarsals.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} there was a growing {{movement}} to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were generally <b>considered</b> to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions.

As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists <b>considered</b> Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani <b>considered</b> it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.|$|E
