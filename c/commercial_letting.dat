40|$|Improve rural broadband. Broadband take-up {{in rural}} areas may be higher than urban areas: 65 % vs. 40 - 50 % in urban areas, proving the {{importance}} of broadband {{in rural areas}}. Use HCC’s HPSN (Hampshire Public Services Network) as the platform for delivering a reliable broadband service throughout rural areas. HPSN delivers a reliable and high bandwidth broadband. (25. 7 % of Hampshire postcodes are unable to receive broadband of> 1 Mb/s; 51. 8 % of Hampshire postcodes are unable to receive broadband of> 2 Mb/s. BT recommends that 4 Mb/s is needed for BT Vision. Neither BT 21 CN network nor adoption of ADSL 2 + services will improve available speeds.) HCC has the opportunity now to do this, with the {{negotiation of a contract}} to deliver HPSN 2, to use its public network as a platform to serve the parts of rural Hampshire which are being neglected by telecom companies. Technology has advanced to allow dual access, which was the previous block. Residents in areas with limited broadband should be able to connect to the fibre optic broadband cables being laid to schools by HCC. HCC should investigate developing a joint venture trading company that can provide wholesale broadband services to remote rural locations. In order to make public access to HPSN 2 commercially viable, perhaps tie this in to a broadband service delivery for towns such as Basingstoke. HCC should pressure BT Openreach to provide/improve broadband in areas with poor broadband. Further investment in eHampshire. Follow the example of Government’s urban focussed DC 10 (Digital Cities) in rural Hampshire. Hampshire must invest more money in the provision of ICT to rural communities if they are to prosper and survive. Need better IT for home working. Investigate other sources such as third generation technology. HCC could provide all mobile libraries with internet access – currently only 2 out of 19 have this., HCC could follow the initiative of “Fibremoor”, a community co-operative in Alston, Cumbria, which is aiming to make Alston one of the first villages to offer fibre optic cable access to homes. <b>Commercial</b> <b>letting</b> of redundant agricultural buildings is only really possible if there is broadband.

Five chosen antigens were differentially expressed on the surface or in the cytosol of Salmonella typhimurium SL 3261. A two-step procedure was developed to select optimal Salmonella vaccine strains for each antigen, based on bacterial fitness and antigen expression levels. We show that vaccine strains of Salmonella expressing the novel Leishmania antigens LinJ 08. 1190 and LinJ 23. 0410 significantly reduced visceralisation of L. major and enhanced systemic resistance against L. donovani in susceptible BALB/c mice.

The idea behind the DNS was to allow connectivity to computers with an easy to remember name that was translated by a computer called a domain name server into a specific Internet Protocol (IP) address (e. g. 204. 126. 254. 3) that uniquely pointed to one specific computer. IP address are constructed of four series of numbers each separated by a period. Each series (called an octet) has a possible range from 0 to 255; however, 0 and 255 are not used as these numbers are reserved. Therefore, each octet has 254 possibilities and therefore over 4. 16 billion possible combinations (Cisco, 1997). Johnson (2002) compared IP address to telephone numbers or street addresses {{that are difficult to}} remember. Reducing the IP address to a recognizable name allowed for easy name recognition along a series of predetermined top-level domains (TLDs) that included. edu for educational institutions (Salamon, 2007; Zakon, 2006).

In this work, we present a new prediction module for BaTS that quickly computes accurate approximations to the Pareto set of mixed on-demand and spot instance pools, based on a genetic algorithm (GA). This new approach allows BaTS to react to changing spot instance prices at runtime by re-configuring the instance pool according to the user’s runtime and budget constraints.

Finally, we also discuss methods of suppressing unwanted content (spam). This is necessary in order to enable an efficient performance of the VPA. 0 The retrieval of relevant information from data sources with a very complex structure has become a challenging task since the number of documents in the Internet has reached a level of about multi billions of documents.

The default strategy has been to <b>let</b> <b>commercial</b> interests take the lead in developing and managing this content; libraries then deciding to buy or not buy based on perceived local interest.

The Swedish public service TV broadcasting company, Sveriges Television (SVT) advertises itself as purveyor of free television, without commercial or political interference. A B-level essay, written some years ago, showed that the SVT policies were not always observed throughout the entire organisation. The aim of this essay is, by using quantitative research, to study whether SVT is <b>letting</b> <b>commercial</b> interests have their say in the programmes by exposing brand names and logotypes. Material/method: The study is performed through examining 40 hours of television from SVT and 40 hours from TV 4, as reference. TV 4 is a Swedish commercially funded broadcaster, working under similar legislation as SVT. A quantitative method has been developed for this study. Results: The results of the study shows that while TV 4 stays on a fairly steady level concerning brand exposure, brand exposure in SVT has decreased significantly between 2003 and 2006. The reason for this is beleived to be increased awareness of the issue in the SVT organisation, possibly due to product placement being more debated and acknowledged in recent years.

Lord Palmerston persisted that the scheme was the greatest bubble that ever was imposed upon the credulity and simplicity of the people of this country; the public meetings on its behalf were got up by a pack of foreign projectors; traffic by the railway would always beat traffic by steamer through the canal; it would be a step towards the dismemberment of the Turkish empire; it would tend to dismember our own empire by opening a passage between the Mediterranean and the Indian ocean, which would be at the command of other nations and not at ours. Away, then, with such a sacrifice of the interest of Great Britain to philanthropic schemes and philosophic reveries! So much for the sound practical man. Mr. Gladstone followed. Don't let us, he said, have governments and ex-governments coming down to instruct us here on bubble schemes. As a <b>commercial</b> project, <b>let</b> the Suez Canal stand or fall upon commercial grounds. With close reasoning, he argued against the proposition that the canal would tend to sever Turkey from Egypt. As to possible danger to our own interests, was it not a canal that would fall within the control of the strongest maritime power in Europe? And what could that power be but ourselves? Finally, what could be more unwise than to present ourselves to the world as the opponents of a scheme {{on the face of it}} beneficial to mankind, on no better ground than remote and contingent danger to interests of our own, with the alleged interest of Turkey merely thrust hypocritically in for the purpose of justifying a policy purely narrow-minded and wholly selfish? The majority against the motion was large, as it was in the case of the seven cardinals against Galileo. Still the canal was made, with some very considerable consequences that were not foreseen either by those who favoured it or those who mocked it as a bubble. M. de Lesseps wrote to Mr. Gladstone from Constantinople that the clearness of his speech had enabled him to use it with good effect in his negotiations with the Porte. 'Your eloquent words, the authority of your name, and the consideration that attaches to your character, have already contributed much and will contribute more still to hinder the darkening and complication of a question of itself perfectly clear and simple, and to avoid the troubling of the relations between two countries of which it is the natural mission to hold aloft together the flag of modern civilisation.' ...|$|R
40|$|This paper both {{describes}} the critical public pedagogy of plus-size vloggers, lesbian influencers, and feminist vloggers on YouTube and also shows how they use YouTube’s affordances for cultural resistance. Starting {{from the idea}} that YouTube offers to users a ‘’sense of technical neutrality and progressive openness’’ (Gillespie 2010), this paper investigates {{the ways in which}} YouTube videos can function as communal and connective goods in counter-hegemonic discourse. It seeks to answer the question of how and to what extent YouTube can be used for counter-hegemonic pedagogy. The research presented here aims to demonstrate that vloggers can challenge sociocultural constructions of hegemony, while acknowledging that it might be difficult to completely get rid of these constructions since they inform our behaviour and our capacity for self-reflection. New media platforms prove to be networks of mass-self communication and are used by ‘’institutions of noopower’’ to reinforce hegemonic femininity or create new oppressive norms (Gehl 2013). Hegemonic ideals and stereotypes are often conveyed under the veil of empowering commercials and helpful apps. Such dispersive, improvident content may harm personal development and critical discussion. This paper argues that women’s empowerment organizations should take this into account when they collaborate with <b>commercial</b> institutions or <b>let</b> them use their YouTube channel for promotional purposes. But also that flaming, patronizing acts of superiority or disabling content can sabotage critical public pedagogy. Therefore, YouTube users should be cautious of flaming and of misusing YouTube’s affordances to shut down critical discussion. In addition, vloggers should carefully monitor communication on the platform, since hate speech spreads quickly and the consequences are hard to erase. They must avoid blocking or flagging users with opposing opinions, while striving towards an open, participatory learning space. Critical public pedagogy must invite viewers to step away from their normalized, subjective viewpoints. Critical educators should use personal expression to create identification but take precautions not to misuse their channel for exhibitionistic and restraining ‘’egocasting’’ (Miller 2015). They should try to release recipients from the influence of hegemonic (femininity) structures and from their habitual responses to cultural expressions of femininity. Although parochial thinking might be inevitable, vloggers can remove the oppressive factor of ‘common sense’ reinforced by hegemony. Plus-size, lesbian, and feminist vloggers create awareness of issues concerning hegemonic femininity and challenge gender-normalizing disciplines with ‘’aesthetic stylization of the self,’’ ‘’critical self-awareness,’’ and ‘’ethical self-care’’ (Pringle 2003). Their creative parodies and ‘’political poetics’’ show how constructions of femininity are continually produced and reproduced within the social practices of daily life (Sandlin 2007) ...|$|R
