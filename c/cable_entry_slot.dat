50|$|For routing cables {{which are}} already {{assembled}} with connectors, split <b>cable</b> <b>entry</b> {{systems have been}} developed. The divisibility of these systems provides two advantages. The warranty on pre-terminated cables remains since the connectors don’t have to be cut and soldered again after entering the cables. The other advantage is that assembly can be done subsequently because the split <b>cable</b> <b>entries</b> are usually built around the existing lines.Most split <b>cable</b> <b>entries</b> consist of a split hard frame, made of plastic or sometimes aluminium (e.g. utilised in food industry) and one or several split sealing grommets, usually made of elastomer. The grommet matching the cable diameter is placed around the cable and fixed inside the <b>cable</b> <b>entry</b> frame. Thus allowing strain relief for the cables (in some cases according to EN 50262) as well as ingress protection of up to IP 65/66/67.|$|R

50|$|For routing of {{standard}} cables and other electrical, pneumatic or hydraulic lines through machine, panel or enclosure walls, cable glands, self-sealing grommets or <b>cable</b> <b>entry</b> plates {{can be used}} to seal the cut-outs required for passing the cables through. This protects the inside of an enclosure or machine from dirt, dust or liquids.Cable glands and self-sealing grommets are usually designed for entering single or just a few cables. By utilising a <b>cable</b> <b>entry</b> plate, many <b>cables</b> with different diameters can be routed.
