5|$|In 1825, Talbot {{joined a}} weaving firm {{established}} by {{his older brother}} Charles in Williamsburg, Massachusetts, where he was first employed as a <b>carder</b> and finisher, and quickly rose to become superintendent. His brother moved to Lowell in 1838, selling the Williamsburg mill, and began processing dyewoods in rented space at a local mill, while Thomas remained in western Massachusetts, working in area mills and continuing his education at an academy in Cummington. In 1840, the two brothers established C.P. Talbot & Co., a business partnership that lasted until Charles died in 1884. The business started out processing dyewoods {{for use in the}} textile industry, but expanded into other industrial chemical processing in 1849. The brothers acquired the Concord River water rights of the defunct Middlesex Canal Corporation in 1851, and in 1857 they established Talbot Mills in North Billerica, Massachusetts, in partnership with the Belvidere Mill Company. The business was successful, and the brothers acquired full control of that business in 1862. Thomas focused on the textile business while Charles continued to manage the dye and chemical interests, expanding the facilities in 1870 and again in 1880.|$|E
5|$|One of the project's {{goals is}} to protect, restore and create areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) {{that are likely to}} benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and shrill <b>carder</b> bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E

5000|$|Carding of wool {{can either}} be done [...] "in the grease" [...] or not, {{depending}} on the type of machine and on the spinner's preference. [...] "In the grease" [...] means that the lanolin that naturally comes with the wool has not been washed out, leaving the wool with a slightly greasy feel. The large drum <b>carders</b> do not tend to get along well with lanolin, so most commercial worsted and woollen mills wash the wool before carding. Hand <b>carders</b> (and small drum <b>carders</b> too, though the directions may not recommend it) can be used to card lanolin rich wool.|$|R

25|$|In zoology {{the term}} {{polygyny}} {{is used for}} to a pattern of mating in which a male animal {{has more than one}} female mate in a breeding season. Males get their mates by defending the females directly or holding resources that the females want and need. This is known as resource defense polygyny and males of the bee species Anthidium manicatum (also known as the European wool <b>carder</b> bee) exhibit this behavior. Males claim patches of floral plants, ward off conspecific males and other resource competitors, and mate with the multiple females who forage in their territories. Males of many species attract females to their territory by either gathering in a lek or going out in search of dispersed females. In polygyny relationships in animals, the female is the one who provides most of the parental care for the offspring.|$|E

25|$|Developments in the 20th {{century have}} {{produced}} a marked contrast between the environments {{in the east and}} west of the island. The eastern half of the island is allocated to residential areas, the main public amenities and a small holiday camp and seafront, while the western half of the island is mainly farmland, marshes and industrial areas. The marshes in the west include the 30 hectares known as West Canvey marshes, acquired by the RSPB in 2007, and the Canvey Wick nature reserve. Canvey Wick is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) {{at the site of the}} abandoned and incomplete oil refinery. The foundations of the 100 hectare (0.4 sq mile) site were prepared in the 1970s by laying thousands of tonnes of silt dredged from the Thames; the abandoned and undisturbed area has flourished as a haven for around 1,300 species of wildlife, many of which are endangered or were thought to be extinct; including the shrill <b>carder</b> bee, the emerald damselfly and the weevil hunting wasp.|$|E
500|$|In 2006 the {{bumblebee}} researcher Dave Goulson {{founded a}} registered charity, the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, {{to prevent the}} extinction [...] "of any of the UK's bumblebees." [...] In 2009 and 2010, the Trust attempted to reintroduce the short-haired bumblebee, Bombus subterraneus, which had become extinct in Britain, from the British-derived populations surviving in New Zealand from their introduction there a century earlier. From 2011 the Trust, in partnership with Natural England, Hymettus and the RSPB, has reintroduced short-haired bumblebee queens from Skåne in southern Sweden to restored flower-rich meadows at Dungeness in Kent. The queens were checked for mites and American foulbrood disease. Agri-environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of Romney Marsh {{have been set up}} to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower-rich habitat for the bees. By the summer of 2013, workers of the species were found near the release zone, proving that nests had been established. The restored habitat has produced a revival in at least five [...] "Schedule 41 priority" [...] species: the ruderal bumblebee, Bombus ruderatus; [...] the red-shanked <b>carder</b> bee, Bombus ruderarius; the shrill <b>carder</b> bee, Bombus sylvarum; the brown-banded <b>carder</b> bee, Bombus humilis and the moss <b>carder</b> bee, [...] Bombus muscorum.|$|E

500|$|Brighton & Hove Albion had {{finished}} {{bottom of the}} Third Division South the season before and were struggling financially, yet manager Don Welsh persuaded the directors to break the club transfer record by paying £5,000 for a player yet to make his debut in the Football League, and persuaded McNichol to sign. He made his first appearance in the League on 21 August 1948, {{at the age of}} 23, as Brighton drew with Swindon Town at home. The club finished sixth in the division in McNichol's first season and eighth, despite having no regular goalscorer– McNichol's nine goals made him top scorer– in 1949–50. The next year, McNichol played in all of Brighton's games, the only man so to do, and again finished as top scorer for the season, this time with 14 goals. According to <b>Carder</b> and Harris, he [...] "had a superb season with a brand of play which won him the reputation as the finest inside-forward in the Third Division". Appointed club captain when Billy Lane took over from Welsh as manager, McNichol flourished under Lane's attacking policy. He scored 14 goals in the 1951–52 season as Brighton narrowly failed to mount a successful challenge to Plymouth Argyle for the title, [...] "was again the star of the side", and [...] "was thought {{by many to be the}} most stylish inside-forward to play for the Albion".|$|E

2500|$|The {{subject of}} Jewish {{surnames}} in Yemen {{is a complex}} one. Most surnames are eponymous, meaning, they are derived from {{the name of an}} ancient ancestor, or an ancestor's profession, or an ancestor's place of residence (village or town name). In some cases, surnames are derived from a certain physical characteristic of one's distant ancestor. Some families bear original Spanish surnames, such as Medina and Giyyat. Some names went through additional changes upon returning to the Land of Israel. For example, some who formerly bore the surname of Radha (Judeo-Arabic: רצ'א) have changed their surname to Ratzon (Hebrew: [...] ), the Hebrew being the direct translation of the word's meaning in Arabic, while yet others have simply changed their names to a more Hebraicized sound, such as the surnames of Al-Nadaf (lit. a stuffer of cushions; <b>carder</b> of cotton), which was later changed to Nadav ("generous"), and 'Urqabi (so-named from a locality in Yemen) which was later changed to Argov, or Sheḥib (Judeo-Arabic: שחב), meaning [...] "one whose voice is hoarse," [...] which was changed to Shevach (Hebrew: שבח), meaning [...] "praise." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{could write}} a {{treatise}} of lamentation upon the changes brought about among the cottages of Westmoreland by {{the silence of the}} spinning-wheel. During long winter's nights and wet days, the wheel upon which wool was spun gave employment to a great part of a family. The old man, however infirm, was able to card the wool, as he sate in the corner by the fireside; and often, when a boy, have I admired the cylinders of carded wool which were softly laid upon each other by his side. Two wheels were often at work on the same floor, and others of the family, chiefly the little children, were occupied in teazing and clearing the wool to fit it for the hand of the <b>carder.</b> So that all, except the infants, were contributing to mutual support: Such was the employment that prevailed in the pastoral vales. Where wool was not at hand, in the small rural towns, the wheel for spinning flax was almost in as constant use, if knitting was not preferred; which latter occupation had the advantage (in some cases disadvantage) that not being of necessity stationary, it allowed of gossiping about from house to house, which good housewives reckoned an idle thing.|$|E
