40|$|It {{is known}} that the noise {{generated}} by inverted-velocity-profile coaxial (without <b>center</b> <b>plug)</b> and coannular (with <b>center</b> <b>plug)</b> nozzles should be modeled as the combined contributions of various source regions and noise generation mechanisms. In this paper, an empirical noise-prediction model is described which considers the noise generated by two jet-mixing regions and two potential regions of shock/turbulence interaction. Results calculated from the empirical model are compared with model-scale experimental data for static and simulated flight conditions. These comparisons are made for cases where both streams are subsonic, where the outer stream is supersonic with the inner stream subsonic, and where both streams are supersonic. The cases considered cover a range of inner-to-outer-stream area ratios and include both coaxial and coannular nozzles. It is shown that the model gives reasonable predictions of absolute noise spectra and even better predictions of incremental changes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ~-The nominal 1000 MJ {{yield of}} a Laboratory hlicrofusion Facility (LMF) pellet {{requires}} {{at least a}} 1. 5. meter radius target chamber to contain the blast. A geometry has been identified that uses an annular ion beam with a <b>center</b> <b>plug,</b> has a total transport length of 4 meters, and allows no direct line-of-sight from the target blast to the ion diode. An analytic model for an achromatic, Z-lens system {{that is capable of}} transporting a 30 MV, 1 MA Li ion beam over this dtstance has been developed. The system uses both self-Bn and solenoidal magnetic lenses. The beam microdivergknce requirement is minimized by locating the final solenoidal lens at the target chamber wall. We have verified the analytic model by PIC transport calculations. A realistic coil system has been designed to supply the required 2 Tesla solcnoidal fields.

40|$|Model scale {{jet noise}} data are {{presented}} {{for a variety}} of internal lobed mixer nozzle configurations for take off power settings in a static environment. The results are presented for a 17. 5 cm diameter fan nozzle to show the effect on noise levels caused by changes in geometric shape of the internal, or core flow, nozzle. The geometric variables include the lobe discharge angle, the number of lobes, spacing between the <b>center</b> <b>plug</b> and lobe valley, lobe side wall shape and axial contour of the lobes. An annular plug core flow nozzle was also tested and is used as a baseline for comparative purposes. Comparison of data from the internal lobed configurations showed that for comparative effect, in terms of the effect on full scale perceived noise levels, was caused by a change in the lobe discharge angle. The results showed that increasing the discharge angle caused an increase as large as 7 dB in sound pressure levels in the high frequency portion of the spectra. Changes in the other geometric variables cause negligible effects...|$|R
40|$|Shock-cell {{noise is}} {{identified}} to be a potentially significant problem for advanced supersonic aircraft at takeoff. Therefore NASA conducted fundamental {{studies of the}} phenomena involved and model-scale experiments aimed at developing means of noise reduction. The results {{of a series of}} studies conducted to determine means by which supersonic jet shock noise can be reduced to acceptable levels for advanced supersonic cruise aircraft are reviewed. Theoretical studies were conducted on the shock associated noise of supersonic jets from convergent-divergent (C-D) nozzles. Laboratory studies were conducted on the influence of narrowband shock screech on broadband noise and on means of screech reduction. The usefulness of C-D nozzle passages was investigated at model scale for single-stream and dual-stream nozzles. The effect of off-design pressure ratio was determined under static and simulated flight conditions for jet temperatures up to 960 K. Annular and coannular flow passages with <b>center</b> <b>plugs</b> and multi-element suppressor nozzles were evaluated, and the effect of plug tip geometry was established.

The modification entailed revisions to the thimble, outer top shield <b>plug</b> and <b>center</b> shield <b>plug.</b> and helium sweep system. The modified thimble is provided with inlet actor flow system through the thimble cavity. The coolant in the thimble removes fission heat from the encapsulated samples introduced into the thimble cavity.

A helium purge system was incorporated to remove dissociation gases trapped in the thimble cavity. Four configurations of capsules and capsule baskets were flow tested under conditions simulating operating flow conditions from 2 - to 10 -Mw reactor power. Irradiation capsules are now being satisfactorily operated in the modified thimbles at 2 -Mw reactor power. (auth...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, fabrication {{and testing of}} a new, leak-free, permanently sealable MEMS valve for use in vacuum applications. This device is different from existing MEMS valves {{in that it is}} leak-free in the closed state and has a relatively high flow rate in the open state. This device relies on the surface tension of a molten seal material to establish a permanent seal over its initially-open port upon heating. The sealable port is a through via located {{in the center of a}}n isolated silicon island supported on a thermally-insulating silicon nitride membrane in the center of a die. The through via is surrounded by a moderately high aspect ratio ring of indium solder. To seal the solder over the through via, the island and solder are heated by passing a current through a resistive heater on the back side of the device. Upon thermal actuation, the hollow cylinder of solder reflows into a toroid due to surface tension. For sufficiently high solder aspect ratios, the inner edges of the toroid meet in the <b>center,</b> thereby <b>plugging</b> the via. The heater is then turned off, solidifying the solder and forming a permanent seal. Individual subsystems of the device were first analytically modeled using structural, thermal, electrical and geometrical models to optimize the device features. The sealing and thermal isolation subsystems were then separately fabricated and tested to verify the analytical models and key fabrication processes. The individual subsystems were then combined into the final device. Tests on the final device indicate an open state flow rate of 60 to 400 standard cm³ per minute (sccm), a closed state leak rate not detectable above that of the test jig used (10 -⁴ sccm), and an open-to-closed flow rate ratio of greater than 10 ⁵ to 10 ⁶. by Aalap Dighe.

The Marquardt Company had as its prime task the design and demonstration of a ramjet capable of steady state operating using hydrogen as the regenerative coolant and with fuel flow limited to a theta = 1. Marquardt progressed from shell type combustors to advanced tubular combustion chambers in direct connect test rigs. The first tests were made with water cooled <b>center</b> bodies and <b>plug</b> nozzles using a pebble bed air heater to simulate flight air temperature. Later tests were made on completely H 2 cooled flight weight V/G assemblies direct connected to a SUE burner heater.

Pre-restoration monitoring ended in Fall 2000, and post restoration monitoring began in the Winter/Spring of 2001. The total interior harvest in the 16 bays after harvesting the trees was 19. 6 ha. The margins in the opencanopy, pine savanna margin treatments were thinned. Margins containing areas with immature forested stands (bay 5184 and portions of bay 5011) were thinned using a mechanical shredder in November 2001. Over 126 hectares were included in the study areas (interior + margin). Planting of two tree species and the transplanting of wetland grass species was successful. From field surveys, it was estimated that approximately 2700 Nyssa sylvatica and 1900 Taxodium distichum seedlings were planted in the eight forested bays resulting in an average planting density of ≈ 490 stems ha- 1. One hundred seedlings of each species per bay (where available) were marked to evaluate survivability and growth. Wetland grass species were transplanted from donor sites on SRS to plots that ranged in size from 100 – 300 m 2, depending on wetland size.

Woollard interpreted this anomaly as being caused by high density (3. 2 - 3. 3 g/cc) pipe material extending to within 1 - 2 km of the surface. A more recent analysis (Strange, Woollard, and Rose, p. 381 in this issue) arrives at mu ch the same conclusion. Although the ini-tial intention of the seismic work reported here was to "fan shoot " the plug, as well as to deter-mine its velocity and depth, the over-all diffi-culty of the experiment and higher-than-antici-pated costs dictated that part of the operation be curtailed.
