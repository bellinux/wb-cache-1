25|$|When the United States {{began to}} expand {{to the west}} {{and other parts of the}} country, so did the {{distance}} of businesses to their customers. When businesses were close to those who purchased goods or services from them, it was easy for the merchants to extend credit to them, due to their proximity and the fact that merchants knew their customers personally and knew whether or not they would be able to pay them back. As trading distances increased, merchants no longer personally knew their customers and became leery of extending credit to people who they did not know in fear of them not being able to pay them back. Business owners' hesitation to extend credit to new customers led to the birth of the <b>credit</b> <b>reporting</b> industry.|$|E
