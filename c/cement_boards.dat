Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of cement bonded blue particle boards and cement fibre boards are the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded particle boards have higher capacity than cement fibre boards. Cement particle boards can be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement fibre boards are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. Fibre boards are made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, aluminium stearate and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain board qualities. Typical cement fiber board is made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned aluminium stearate and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in low density boards with quantities between 10-15%.

Trade has been {{historically}} important in Yiwu since {{the surrounding area}} has little arable soil. Even before 1600s, Yiwu men would carry sewing needles, threads, sugar chunks and other small commodities in their bamboo baskets, using a shoulder-pole, and travel to surrounding rural villages in exchange for chicken feathers. Chicken feathers could be either used as a fertilizer for their own lands, or made into feather dusters for exporting. This [...] "Sugar-For-Chicken Feathers" [...] tradition had become part of Yiwu culture. As the trading population grew larger, the earliest wholesale markets emerged in Yiwu around 1700s. After the founding of People's Republic of China in 1949, the free market was once considered capitalistic and hence officially suppressed, forcing Yiwu people to continue their trade secretly.

50|$|Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates met in London in {{the early}} 1990s and {{were part of a}} group of architects, theorists and artists who met {{regularly}} between 1994 and 1995. The group (informally called Papers on architecture) had a common interest in the urban character of London and the work of Alison and Peter Smithson. Among the earliest realised projects by Sergison Bates architects are the public house (pub) in Walsall and the semi-detached house in Stevenage, both of which use motifs of informal architecture. A number of other small scale projects, primarily in London, followed, which also displayed an interest in creating a robust architectural expression through the use of lightweight low-tech construction methods (i.e. thin brick-slip fa√ßade panels on the Studio house in Bethnal Green and <b>cement</b> <b>boards</b> as cladding for a timber panel structure in the self-build housing project in Tilbury). This preoccupation with breathing layered wall constructions culminated in the exhibition project and book ‚ÄúBrick-work: thinking and making‚Äù. The unrealised competition design for a museum on the Danish island Bornholm (included in ‚ÄúBrick-work‚Äù) indicated a shift towards a more heavy and monolithic construction form and spatial expression. Two examples of this change in direction are the Urban housing project in Finsbury Park built with a loadbearing wall of brickwork and precast concrete, and the Centre for the applied arts in Ruthin that adopted structure and pigmented fa√ßade elements made of concrete cast in situ. From 2010 Sergison Bates architects were awarded commissions through design competitions for projects in Flanders (Belgium), Switzerland and Austria. In 2016 the firm completed their most prestigious building to date, the Welcome centre and offices for the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Shanghai (China).|$|E
