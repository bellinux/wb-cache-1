40|$|In this paper, {{the control}} system for a <b>catalytic</b> <b>afterburner</b> in a diesel fuel cell {{auxiliary}} power unit is presented. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>afterburner</b> is used to burn the non-utilised hydrogen and other possible combustible components of the fuel cell anode off-gas. To increase the energy efficiency of the auxiliary power unit, the thermal energy released in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>afterburner</b> is utilised to generate the steam for the fuel processor. For optimal operation of the power unit in all modes of operation including load change, stable steam generation is required and overall energy balance must be kept within design range. To achieve this, the reaction temperature of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>afterburner</b> must be stable in all modes of operation. Therefore, we propose the afterburner temperature control based on mass and thermal balances. Finally, we demonstrate {{the control system}} using the existing prototype of the diesel fuel cell auxiliary power unit...|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of reduction of {{volatile organic compounds}} in exhaust gas from a self-ignition engine was assessed. Theoretically, this efficiency should rise proportionally to engine load and, consequently, to gas temperature. This pattern, however, is disturbed by the formation of products of incomplete combustion in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>afterburner,</b> especially by those of aldehydes, even at high temperature. The efficiency of combustion of individual groups of compounds (aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons) was analyzed. Two treatment systems were tested: a soot filter with Ce–Pt and the same filter with Pt–Ce as active agents. Of these, the Ce–Pt system {{was found to be}} more efficient. The study has revealed that the assessment of the volatile organic com-pounds ’ degradation must include the reduction of the most toxic pollutants. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} testing of a control system for {{reverse-flow}} <b>catalytic</b> <b>afterburners</b> based on a two-variable bifurcation map is focused on. The combustion of lean methane-air mixtures is considered as the test reaction and a bench-scale apparatus, with a special temperature-control system based on dynamic compensation of the thermal losses to achieve adiabatic operation, is used for validation purposes. The aim of the control system is to avoid both catalyst overheating and reaction extinction when the adiabatic temperature increases and the flow rate of the feed changes. Stability maps of the reactor are obtained by means of numerical simulations, showing {{the values of the}} operating parameters (switching time), which allows fulfillment of the operating constraints (catalyst maximum temperature and methane conversion) when the inlet concentration and flow rate change. This system was realized and tested experimentally, mainly for inlet concentration changes, proving to be effective in all cases investigated...|$|R

Abandonment of efforts leading to reduction mainly of carbon dioxide emission by heavy industry, electric power generation based on coal, passenger aviation and wheeled passenger transport will inevitably be leading to deterioration of health condition of our citizens. This article presents an overview of commonly used structural and technological treatments which have impact on reduction of toxic standardized exhaust pollutants in the surface transport, exemplified on SW 400 engine version of L 2 / 3 and its turbocharged version 6 CT 107 2 /L 2.

40|$|In {{this study}} a dynamic {{model of a}} solid oxide fuel cell system has been developed. The work has been {{conducted}} in cooperation with Modelon AB using the Modelica language and the Dymola modeling and simulation tool. Modelica is an equation based, object oriented modeling language, which promotes flexibility and reuse of code. The objective {{of the study is}} to investigate the suitability of the Modelica language for dynamic fuel cell modeling. A cell electrolyte model including ohmic, activation and concentration irreversibilities is implemented and validated against simu-lations and experimental data presented in the open literature. A 1 D solid oxide fuel cell model is created by integrating the electrolyte model and a 1 D fuel flow model, which includes dynamic internal steam reforming of methane and water-gas shift reactions. Several cells are then placed with parallel flow paths and connected thermally and electrically in series. By introducing manifold pressure drop a stack model is created. The stack model is used in a complete system model including an autothermal re-former, a <b>catalytic</b> <b>afterburner</b> and heat recirculation. Four reactions are modeled in the autothermal reformer. Those are two types of methane steam reforming, the water-gas shift reaction and total combustion of methane. The simulation results have been compared with those in the literature and it can be concluded that the models are accurate and that Dymola and Modelica are tools well suited for simulations of the transient fuel cell system behaviour. ...|$|E

50|$|Low-temperature thermal {{desorption}} (LTTD), {{also known as}} low-temperature thermal volatilization, thermal stripping, and soil roasting, is an ex-situ remedial technology that uses heat to physically separate petroleum hydrocarbons from excavated soils. Thermal desorbers are designed to heat soils to temperatures sufficient to cause constituents to volatilize and desorb (physically separate) from the soil. Although they are not designed to decompose organic constituents, thermal desorbers can, depending upon the specific organics present and {{the temperature of the}} desorber system, cause some organic constituents to completely or partially decompose. The vaporized hydrocarbons are generally treated in a secondary treatment unit (e.g., an <b>afterburner,</b> <b>catalytic</b> oxidation chamber, condenser, or carbon adsorption unit) prior to discharge to the atmosphere. Afterburners and oxidizers destroy the organic constituents. Condensers and carbon adsorption units trap organic compounds for subsequent treatment or disposal.|$|R
50|$|When a {{collection}} system is used, the offgas must be cooled to condense {{the bulk of}} the volatilized components into a liquid. The offgas will exit most desorbers in the 350-900 °F range. The offgas is then typically cooled to somewhere between 120 and 40 °F to condense {{the bulk of the}} volatilized water and organic contaminants. Even at 40 °F, there may be measurable amounts of non-condensed organics. For this reason, after the condensation step, further treatment of the offgas is usually required. The cooled offgas may be treated by carbon adsorption, or thermal oxidation. Thermal oxidation can be accomplished using a <b>catalytic</b> oxidizer, an <b>afterburner</b> or by routing the offgas to the combustion heat source for the desorber. The volume of gas requiring treatment for indirect fired desorbers is a fraction of that required for a direct fired desorber. This requires smaller air pollution control trains for the gaseous process vent emissions. Some thermal desorption systems recycle the carrier gas, thereby further reducing the volume of gaseous emissions.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{importance}} of automobile exhaust {{as a source}} of atmospheric pollutants has been recognized for several years. With the control of stationary sources in geographic areas such as Los Angeles County, the automobile has become the major uncontrolled source of air pollution. The three major pollutants emitted by automobiles are unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. Seventy percent of the emissions are from the exhaust. Maximum emission standards of 275 ppm hydrocarbons as n-hexane and 1. 5 mole percent carbon monoxide in automotive exhaust have been enacted in California. Control measures for the oxides of nitrogen may possibly be effective for 1970 model vehicles. Exhaust control devices for hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions submitted to the California Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board for approval have included <b>catalytic</b> converters, direct-flame <b>afterburners,</b> engine modification systems, and secondary air injection at the exhaust port systems. Three of the automobile manufactures may use the fourth system which involves introduction of secondary air into the engine exhaust ports to promote flameless oxidation of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and water. Since this control system introduces air to the high temperature exhaust gases at the exhaust port, the question arises whether oxides of nitrogen might be formed. This would be detrimental from the outlook that oxides of nitrogen must be controlled. The purpose of this work was to determine the effects on the emissions of oxides of nitrogen from a gasoline engine by the installation and operation of an exhaust port secondary air injection system. The engine under test, given to Oregon State University by the Ford Motor Company, was installed in a vehicle and operated on a chassis dynamometer. Measurements of oxides of nitrogen emissions with and without the air injection system in operation were made both during steady state and transient conditions. For transient measurements, the vehicle was operated on the California seven-mode test cycle. Oxides of nitrogen samples were taken by a progressive grab sampling technique and analyzed with an absorption spectrophotom eter built at Oregon State University. Further measurements included unburned hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide analyses with commercial non-dispersive infrared analyzers and total carbon measurement with a commercial hydrogen flame ionization analyzer. These analyses were made for the purpose of determining air dilution factors and correlating data with other work being done in the field. The results of the investigation are summarized as follows: 1) The addition of secondary air at the exhaust ports in creased the oxides of nitrogen emissions during acceleration for both rich and lean mixture operation. As high as 40 percent in crease occurred during operation with the rich carburetor. Appreciable increase also occurred during high speed steady state cruise conditions with the rich carburetor. Weighted average concentrations of NO[subscript x] for operation on the California cycle were not determined. 2) The grab sampling and spectrophotometric analysis methods for the oxides of nitrogen worked well during the testing. However, the time required to take a grab sample, three seconds, was too long to obtain instantaneous analysis. Sampling probes should be located closer to the engine to avoid mixing of exhaust from separate modes in the exhaust pipe prior to analysis. 3) Temperatures in the exhaust manifold were not markedly changed by the injection of secondary air into the exhaust ports. However, temperatures were 50 to 100 ° F higher {{at the end of the}} tailpipe due to increased exhaust mass flow rate. 4) The vehicle with the air system installed met California standards for operation with the rich carburetor, but emitted a higher concentration of unburned hydrocarbons than the standard during operation with the lean carburetor...|$|R
