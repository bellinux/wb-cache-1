5|$|All the same, the <b>conspicuousness</b> {{of motion}} raises the {{question}} of whether and how motion itself could be camouflaged. Several mechanisms are possible.|$|E
5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because <b>conspicuousness</b> evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism, and the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because <b>conspicuousness</b> evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is.|$|E
5|$|Even if without direct predation, {{the giant}} otter must still {{compete with other}} predators for food resources. Duplaix {{documented}} interaction with the neotropical otter. While the two species are sympatric (with overlapping ranges) during certain seasons, {{there appeared to be}} no serious conflict. The smaller neotropical otter is far more shy, less noisy, and less social; at about a third the weight of the giant otter, it is more vulnerable to predation, hence, a lack of <b>conspicuousness</b> is to its advantage. The neotropical otter is active during twilight and darkness, reducing the likelihood of conflict with the diurnal giant otter. Its smaller prey, different denning habits, and different preferred water types also reduce interaction.|$|E
5|$|The {{first line}} of defence {{consists}} in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as camouflage, living underground, or nocturnality. Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in aposematism, by mimicking animals which do possess such defences, by startling the attacker, by signalling to the predator that pursuit is not worthwhile, by distraction, by using defensive structures such as spines, and by living in a group. Members of groups are at reduced risk of predation, despite the increased <b>conspicuousness</b> of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and {{the likelihood that the}} predator will attack some other individual.|$|E
25|$|The elder sibling {{also may}} harm {{the younger one}} by {{controlling}} access to the food delivered by the parents. A-chicks always receive food before B-chicks. Although subordinate chicks beg {{just as much as}} their dominant siblings, the older chicks are able to divert the parents' attention to themselves, as their large size and <b>conspicuousness</b> serve as more effective stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} as {{an effective}} mode of driver communication has been questioned, and researchers have found the ability of drivers to {{communicate with one another}} is about the same as the communication abilities among insects. However, when used as a means of increasing <b>conspicuousness</b> to other drivers, {{as in the case of}} motorcycle high/low beam modulators, it is highly effective.|$|E
25|$|The McCallum Hill Building was {{constructed}} in 1913 {{on the north side}} of the street from the northeast corner of the park. For many years it was the largest private office building in the city and the tallest building in Saskatchewan at ten storeys high, of course only rivaled in height and <b>conspicuousness</b> within the province by the Hotel Saskatchewan in Regina and Saskatoon’s Bessborough Hotel. Real estate developers E.A. McCallum, E. M. McCallum and Walter H.A. Hill began construction of the McCallum-Hill office building in 1912.|$|E
25|$|Upthorpe Mill {{was built}} in 1751. It was {{originally}} built as an open trestle post mill. In 1818 it was moved to its present site. At {{some point in time}} the Common sails were replaced by Double Patent sails, a roundhouse later being added and a fantail fitted to turn the mill into wind automatically. The mill ended its commercial working life on a single pair of sails. It was disused by 1918 and in 1937 was becoming derelict. Rex Wailes inspected the mill on behalf of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and an appeal for funds to restore the mill was launched in 1938. In 1939, millwright Amos Clarke, along with Messrs Hunts of Soham commenced repairs which cost £600. A new side girt was fitted to {{the left side of the}} mill and the roundhouse roof was repaired. The tailstones were removed at this time. The intention was to fit the cast iron windshaft from Great Mill, Wickhambrook in place of the existing wooden windshaft and to add a new pair of sails but this work was not done owing to the outbreak of the Second World War. The mill was painted grey to reduce its <b>conspicuousness</b> as a landmark, as it was close to RAF Shepherds Grove. The mill was worked during the war, but ceased to be used in 1946 as it was unprofitable. By the late 1960s, the mill was again becoming derelict, and the fantail was carefully dismantled by Chris Hullcoop and Philip Lennard. In 1979, emergency repairs were carried out by Suffolk Mills Group and in 1986 the mill was bought by Richard Duke. Restoration work was carried out and the mill was able to grind again in 1990. In 1993, the mill was bought by Peter Dolman and further restoration work was carried out.|$|E
500|$|<b>Conspicuousness</b> and {{toxicity}} may be inversely related, as polymorphic poison dart frogs {{that are}} less conspicuous are more toxic than the brightest and most conspicuous species. [...] Energetic costs of producing toxins and bright color pigments lead to potential trade-offs between toxicity and bright coloration, and prey with strong secondary defenses have less to gain from costly signaling. Therefore, prey populations that are more toxic are predicted to manifest less bright signals, opposing the classical view that increased <b>conspicuousness</b> always evolves with increased toxicity.|$|E
500|$|Widely {{distributed}} and common, {{the fungus}} occurs predominantly in warm temperate areas. It {{has been found}} in Africa (Tunisia), Europe, and the Americas. [...] In the northern part of its range, it occurs in the summer and autumn, but in subtropical areas it can be found year-round. Because of its wide geographical distribution, abundance, and <b>conspicuousness,</b> Coccomyces dentatus is the most often collected species of Coccomyces.|$|E
500|$|Camouflage is {{occasionally}} {{used to make}} buildings less conspicuous: for example, in South Africa, towers carrying cell telephone antennae {{are sometimes}} camouflaged as tall trees with plastic branches, in response to [...] "resistance from the community". Since this method is costly (a figure of three times the normal cost is mentioned), alternative forms of camouflage can include using neutral colours or familiar shapes such as cylinders and flagpoles. <b>Conspicuousness</b> can also be reduced by siting masts near or actually on other structures.|$|E
2500|$|Individual risk {{is lower}} in larger groups due to {{collective}} defense from predators, the dilution effect, and the selfish herd theory. All of these effects provide supplementary protection to {{individuals in the}} middle of the group. [...] To compensate for group <b>conspicuousness,</b> caterpillars minimize movement, reducing their chances of being located by invertebrate predators. This behavior has associated costs because it decreases individual caterpillars’ selectiveness regarding food sources, as they will not be able to work to get better food sources. [...] Ontogenetic changes in caterpillars reduce the risk of predation and as a consequence, predation-related benefits of group foraging decrease with time. Moreover, grouping in later instars has the extra cost of an increased risk of pathogen transmission.|$|E

2500|$|Only {{the monk}} parakeet and five species of lovebirds build nests in trees, and three Australian and New Zealand ground parrots nest on the ground. All other parrots and {{cockatoos}} nest in cavities, either tree hollows or cavities dug into cliffs, banks, or the ground. The use of holes in cliffs {{is more common}} in the Americas. Many species use termite nests, possibly to reduce the <b>conspicuousness</b> of the nesting site or to create a favourable microclimate. In most cases, both parents participate in the nest excavation. The length of the burrow varies with species, but is usually between [...] in length. The nests of cockatoos are often lined with sticks, wood chips, and other plant material. In the larger species of parrots and cockatoos, the availability of nesting hollows may be limited, leading to intense competition for them both within the species and between species, as well as with other bird families. The intensity of this competition can limit breeding success in some cases. Hollows created artificially by arborists have proven successful in boosting breeding rates in these areas. Some species are colonial, with the burrowing parrot nesting in colonies up to 70,000 strong. Coloniality is not as common in parrots as might be expected, possibly because most species adopt old cavities rather than excavate their own.|$|E
