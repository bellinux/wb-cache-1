25|$|In November 2000 {{during the}} election, the Grand-Mere Affair, {{also known as}} the Shawinigate scandal broke. After initial denials, Chrétien {{acknowledged}} having lobbied the Business Development Bank of Canada, owned by the Government of Canada, to grant a $2million loan to Yvon Duhaime. Duhaime was a friend and constituent to whom the Prime Minister stated that he had sold his interest in the Grand-Mère Inn, a local Shawinigan-area hotel and golf resort, eventually providing evidence of the sale—a contract written on a cocktail napkin. Duhaime was a local businessman with an unsavoury reputation and a criminal record, who received a loan from the Business Development Bank that he was ineligible to collect on the account of his criminal record (Duhaime did not mention his record when applying for the loan). The Business Development Bank had turned down the initial loan application, but later approved a $615,000 loan following further lobbying by Chrétien. When the Business Development Bank refused to extend the loan in August 1999 under the grounds that Duhaime was a businessman with a bad reputation with a history for losing money on past business ventures and that he was already behind on his <b>current</b> <b>payments,</b> the president of the bank François Beaudoin was fired by Chrétien in September 1999, which led to a wrongful dismissal suit that Beaudoin was to win in 2004. It was revealed that Chrétien had never been paid for his share in the sale of the adjoining golf course, and criminal charges were laid against Duhaime. The Prime Minister's ethics counsellor Howard Wilson, who was appointed by and reported to the Prime Minister, determined that Prime Minister Chrétien had not violated any conflict-of-interest rules, noting that there were no clear rules on lobbying Crown corporations for making loans to business ventures that the Prime Minister may or may not had a stake in. There was no comment on ethics of Chrétien's lobbying by the ethics counsellor Wilson. The revelation of the Grand-Mere affair did not affect the outcome of the 2000 election. Chrétien and his circle believed that the breaking of the Grand-Mere story during the election was the work of the Martin fraction.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. Global budget per {{calendar}} {{year is a}} traditional method of funding hospitals in Serbia. Diagnose related groups (DGR) is a method of hospital payment based on classification of patients into groups with clinically similar problems and similar utilization of hospital resources. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare current methods of hospital services payment with the projected costs by DRG payment method in urology. Methods. The data were obtained from the information system used in the Clinical Hospital Center “Dr. Dragiša Mišović” - Dedinje in Belgrade, Serbia. The implemented hospital information system was the main criterion for selection of healthcare institutions. The study included 994 randomly selected patients treated surgically and conservatively in 2012. Results. Average costs under the <b>current</b> <b>payment</b> method were slightly higher than those projected by DRG, however, the variability was twice as high (54, 111 ± 69, 789 compared to 53, 434 ± 32, 509, p < 0, 001) respectively. The univariate analysis showed that the highest correlation with the <b>current</b> <b>payment</b> method as well as with the projected one by DRG was observed in relation to the number of days of hospitalization (ρ = 0. 842, p < 0. 001, and ρ = 0. 637, p < 0. 001, respectively). Multivariate regression models confirmed the influence of the number of hospitalization days to costs under the <b>current</b> <b>payment</b> system (β = 0. 843, p < 0. 001) as well as under the projected DRG payment system (β = 0. 737, p < 0. 001). The same predictor was crucial for the difference in the <b>current</b> <b>payment</b> method and the projected DRG payment methods (β = 0. 501, p < 0. 001). Conclusion. Payment under the DRG system is administratively more complex because it requires detailed and standardized coding of diagnoses and procedures, as well as the information on the average consumption of resources (costs) per DRG. Given that aggregate costs of treatment under two hospital payment methods compared in the study are not significantly different, the focus on minor surgeries both under the <b>current</b> hospital <b>payment</b> method and under the introduced DRG system would be far more cost-effective for a hospital as great variations in treatment performance (reduction of days of hospitalization and complications), and consequently invoiced amounts would be reduced...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Because many <b>current</b> <b>payment</b> {{systems are}} poorly implemented, or of incompetence, private data of {{consumers}} such as payment details, addresses and their purchase history can be compromised. Furthermore, <b>current</b> <b>payment</b> systems {{do not offer}} any non-repudiable verification to a completed transaction, which poses risks to all the parties of the transaction – the consumer, the merchant and the financial institution. One {{solution to this problem}} was SET, but it was never really a success because of its complexity and poor reception from consumers. In this paper, we introduce a third party payment system that aims to preserve privacy by severing the link between their purchase and payment records, while providing a traceable transaction that maintains its integrity and is non-repudiable. Our system also removes much of the responsibilities placed on the merchant with regards to securing sensitive data related to customer payment, thus increasing the potential of small businesses to take part in e-commerce without significant investments in computer security. ...|$|R

A sample of 134 economists completed a self-report survey examining the decision process of different decision contexts in life, including pension decisions. Overall, participants showed low motivation to engage in the process of choosing a private pension plan, compared to their motivation to engage in other decision tasks. However, economists invested more in the decision process and showed greater satisfaction from their decision regarding their pension plan when they had a more positive perception of pensions. This perception is represented by higher subjective likelihood of receiving pension allowances for a long period, and by a profitable view of the balance between <b>current</b> <b>payments</b> and expected incomes from pension saving.
