50|$|<b>Crotching</b> {{was quickly}} banned in 1862. Under the {{prohibitive}} rule (the {{first use of}} a balk space), the crotch {{was defined as the}} triangular region found by connecting a line between the points measuring 4½ inches down each rail forming the corner, and in which only three counts could be scored before at least one ball had to be driven away. The no <b>crotching</b> rule is still in place in the official rules for straight rail promulgated by the Billiard Congress of America, the governing body of billiards in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. By {{making the}} {{different}} length and hip ease of sample shorts {{and using the}} fuzzy assessment method, the appearance and comfort of shorts and the optimum value of <b>crotch</b> are studied in this paper. The results show that：the length of fitting shorts is 50 cm, the optimum value of <b>crotch</b> is 1. 5 cm. The length of more fitting shorts is 50 cm, the optimum value of <b>crotch</b> is 1 cm. The length of fitting shorts is 30 cm, the optimum value of <b>crotch</b> is 2. 5 cm. The length of more fitting shorts is 50 cm, the optimum value of <b>crotch</b> is 2 cm. With the increase of the hip ease, the movement ease is increased {{and the value of}} the <b>crotch</b> is decreased. With the length decrease of trousers, the value of <b>crotch</b> needs to increase...|$|R

5000|$|In 1855, {{the first}} public stakes {{straight}} rail match in the U.S. took place in San Francisco. The contestants, Michael Phelan and a Monsieur Damon of Paris battled for seven hours, but the high run, set by Phelan, was just nine points. A technique soon developed, known as <b>crotching,</b> which vastly increased counts. The [...] "crotch" [...] refers to the space near {{the corner of a}} table where the rails meet. By moving the two object balls into the crotch, a player could endlessly score off of them, all the while keeping them immobilized in that corner.|$|E
5000|$|Straight rail, {{sometimes}} referred to as carom billiards, straight billiards, the three-ball game, the carambole game, and the free game in Europe, is thought to date to the 18th century, although no exact time of origin is known. It was known as French caroms, French billiards or the French game in early times, taking those bygone names from the French who popularized it. The object of straight rail is simple: one point, called a [...] "count", is scored each time a player's cue ball makes contact with both object balls (the second cue ball and the third ball) on a single [...] A win is achieved by reaching an agreed upon number of counts.At straight rail's inception there was no restriction on the manner of scoring.

50|$|Next up was The Young Bucks of Matt and Nick Jackson {{defending}} the ROH World Tag Team Championship against previous champions, reDRagon of Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly, who {{were accompanied by}} UFC fighter Tom Lawlor. Before {{the start of the}} match, The Young Bucks crotched Lawlor by kicking the ring ropes as he was exiting the ring. Lawlor later avenged this by <b>crotching</b> Matt Jackson. At the end of the match, The Young Bucks went for their double-team finishing maneuver, the More Bang for Your Buck, but it was blocked by O'Reilly, who then dropped Matt with a brainbuster. reDRagon then hit their own finisher, the Chasing the Dragon, on Matt, after which O'Reilly locked him in the Armageddon submission hold, while Fish held Nick back. Matt submitted to the hold, making reDRagon three-time ROH World Tag Team Champions.|$|E

5000|$|Following his win, Aries {{announced}} that he was not satisfied with being just the X Division Champion, which led to General Manager Hulk Hogan promising him a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but only if he first vacated the X Division Championship. The following week, Aries agreed to Hogan's terms with the caveat that every year before the annual Destination X pay-per-view, future X Division Champions be given the same opportunity. Aries relinquished the X Division Championship two weeks later, ending his record-breaking reign at 298 days. On July 8, Aries defeated Bobby Roode in the main event of Destination X to become the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. On July 17, TNA president Dixie Carter {{announced that}} Aries had signed a new long-term deal with the promotion. Aries and Roode had a non-title rematch on the July 19 episode of Impact, which ended in a no contest, when both competitors were attacked by a group of masked assailants, known only as the [...] "Aces & Eights". On August 12 at Hardcore Justice, Aries successfully defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Roode, with a pre-match stipulation preventing Roode from getting another rematch for the title as long as Aries was champion. During the following weeks, Aries moved from Roode to defending TNA against the Aces & Eights. On the September 20 episode of Impact, after Jeff Hardy had won the 2012 Bound for Glory Series to become Aries' next challenger for the World Heavyweight Championship, Aries began working as a tweener, claiming that he could match anything Hardy had ever done in his career. On October 11, during the final episode of Impact before Bound for Glory, Aries continued his turn into a villainous character, claiming that he worked best when people were against him, before <b>crotching</b> Hardy on the ring ropes and dropping him with a brainbuster. Three days later in the main event of Bound for Glory, TNA's largest annual event, Aries lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Hardy, ending his reign at 98 days.|$|E
50|$|On the January 27 {{episode of}} Impact!, TNA started a tournament to {{determine}} a new number one contender for X Division Champion Kazarian. In the first match of the tournament, Max defeated Amazing Red and Chris Sabin in a three-way match {{to advance to the}} finals at Against All Odds. The following week, Jeremy defeated Douglas Williams and Jay Lethal in another three-way match to also advance to the finals. However, both Max and Jeremy were forced to miss the finals of the tournament at Against All Odds, after failing to get to Florida due to travel issues. The following month at Victory Road, both Max and Jeremy received their shot at the X Division Championship, held by Kazarian, in an Ultimate X match, which also included Robbie E. Prior to the match, the brothers teased dissension, with Max claiming that their goal was to make him the X Division Champion. At the end of the match, Jeremy and Max finally started fighting between themselves, but in the end both of them failed in their attempt to win the X Division Championship, as Kazarian emerged victorious to successfully retain the title. At the March 15 tapings of Xplosion, the Bucks faced each other in a singles match {{for the first time in}} TNA, with Max picking up the win. Max and Jeremy faced each other in a rematch on the March 31 episode of Impact!, where Max was once again victorious. On the April 7 episode of Impact!, Generation Me teamed with Robbie E in a six-man tag team match, where they faced Brian Kendrick, Chris Sabin and Suicide. At the end of the match, Max, thinking Jeremy was trying to steal the spotlight from him, turned on his brother, <b>crotching</b> him at the top rope, before dropping him to the mat with a rope-hung DDT. After Kendrick had pinned Jeremy for the win, Max removed his Generation Me armband and threw it at his brother. On April 17 at Lockdown, Max defeated seven other men, including Jeremy, in an Xscape match to become the number one contender to Kazarian's X Division Championship. On the May 5 episode of Impact!, Generation Me, seemingly once again on the same page as faces, came together with Amazing Red and Brian Kendrick to fight for X Division's future, after the legitimate firing of Jay Lethal. On May 15 at Sacrifice, Max failed in his attempt to win the X Division Championship from Kazarian. At the all X Division pay-per-view Destination X on July 10, Generation Me was defeated by the team of Eric Young and Shark Boy. This was their last match in TNA as the following day Matt announced that he and his brother had requested their release from their contracts with the promotion. Matt and Nick later revealed that the request stemmed from monetary issues, while also venting their frustrations with TNA's booking, noting the storyline with Tara, which went nowhere, and the quickly aborted feud between the brothers. Matt has also stated that after leaving TNA he was ready to quit professional wrestling altogether, before he and his brother decided to instead reinvent themselves and their act.|$|E
