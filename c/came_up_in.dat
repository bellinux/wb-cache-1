5|$|Considering {{the notion}} that positrons were {{electrons}} that were traveling backwards in time, he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, bouncing {{back and forth in}} time. His graduate student, Richard Feynman, found this hard to believe, but the idea that positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated the notion of the reversibility of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
5|$|The English {{hoped to}} avoid sinking their {{opponent}} {{and to prevent}} her from running aground. The damage on Madre de Deus's defences was becoming serious. With her bow rigging all but disabled, Burrough sent Roebuck which then crashed into Madre de Deus, followed by Foresight. Both moved directly under her main guns. The English boarded her in the dark at 10 pm. Golden Dragon, Sampson and Tiger and the repaired Dainty <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> support. The English took the ship after a bloody hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{challenge}} that <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> production was who Monk's new psychiatrist would be. Several ideas included a woman, someone too strict or too nice, someone driven crazy by Monk's compulsions, and even {{someone who would}} give Monk scream therapy. The eventual decision came from writer Jonathan Collier, who suggested a one-armed psychiatrist. Shalhoub liked the idea, but required that they recruit an actual one-armed actor to play Dr. Sorenson. The Screen Actors Guild actually had several actors waiting to audition, and the part was given to Rick Curry.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} Hironobu Sakaguchi {{stated that}} {{the idea for the}} game first <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> February 1997. The original idea for Brave Fencer Musashi was having Miyamoto Musashi fighting in an alternate world from where he belonged. While the game conceptualized as an action oriented, Musashi was originally meant to be a wanderer. However, he was later changed to an itinerant Samaritan in order to have him interacting and helping other characters. During development, the team used an action base which was crucial to the game's fighting mechanics. Director Yoichi Yoshimoto was focused on the game's fully polygonal aspects that were a departure from Square's previous works. The development team prioritized the movement of polygons in real time and how light affected their appearance.|$|E
5|$|In Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier, a {{case that}} started in Missouri's Eastern District went before the United States Supreme Court in 1988, it was held that public school curricular student {{newspapers}} are subject to {{a lower level of}} First Amendment protection. Another First Amendment case in public schools <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1998, when E.D. Mo. heard Beussink v. Woodland R-IV School District. Judge Rodney W. Sippel ruled that the school violated a student's rights by sanctioning him for material he posted on his website. This case has been widely cited in higher courts.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS {{version was}} {{directed}} by Hironori Ishigami and planned and supervised by Tomie, while Hiroyoshi Umetani was the main planner and in charge of game balance, Shin-ichiro Tomie created the scenario and events, Tanaka worked on the presentation and assisted with the scenario, and Masayasu Yamamoto programmed the dungeons. In addition to Sugiyama, the Nintendo DS version's music was worked on by Hayato Matsuo. The idea of developing a Nintendo DS version started when Chunsoft was considering creating a series of Mystery Dungeon games for the Nintendo DS. Previous Mystery Dungeon titles <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> conversation: they considered doing something with the Game Boy games, but decided against it {{as it would have}} required them to redraw all the art, leaving them to decide between working on the Super Famicom or the Nintendo 64 titles; they eventually settled on working on the Super Famicom title Shiren the Wanderer.|$|E

5|$|Though the National Freeway was {{designated}} as US48, as {{the completion of}} the freeway neared, the possibility of the freeway being designated as an Interstate Highway <b>came</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> the 1980s, the project to improve US50 between Washington, D.C., and Annapolis to Interstate Highway standards had been assigned the designation of I-68. MDSHA, however, later concluded that adding additional route shields to the US50 freeway would not be helpful to drivers, since about half the freeway already had two route designations (US50 and US301) and drivers on the freeway were already familiar with the US50 designation. This made the designation to be applied to that freeway more flexible, and so in 1989, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the organization composed of the various state departments of transportation that decides route numbering in the United States, approved MDSHA's request to renumber the US50 freeway from I-68 to I-595. That same year, AASHTO approved changing US48's designation to I-68. This change took effect upon {{the completion of the}} last section of the National Freeway, on August 2, 1991.|$|E
5|$|What {{happened}} when the Spanish galleys came under fire of the English ships differs depending on sources: from one side it is asserted that the San Felipe was nearly battered into submission by Victory's guns and she was only able to escape when the other galleys <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> support drawing Victory's and Hopes fire. On the other hand, it is also claimed that Spinola's galleys succeeded in passing almost unscathed between the English ships by rowing at full strength. Mansell decided on creating as much damage as possible; instead of concentrating on one galley, he ordered his guners to blaze away at anything they saw in the moonlight {{and as a result}} be believed that damage was inflicted on most of the galleys. A number of galleys slaves leapt into the sea from the damaged ships - a few even made it to shore where they were captured and interrogated at Dover Castle. By the time both fleets reached Goodwin Sands the Spanish galleys started to retreat in desperation for the Flemish coast. A gale was now blowing strongly from the West which also hampered Spanish attempts and they were hotly pursued by the English ships and soon the gunfire warnings were signals for the Dutch to engage.|$|E
5|$|While sailing off the Channel Islands on 23 April the British {{squadron}} {{came across}} a French squadron under Commodore Desgareaux consisting of the 36-gun Engageante, the 44-gun Pomone, the 36-gun Résolue and the 24-gun Babet. Warren chased and engaged them, leading the attack in Flora. When the Flora was badly damaged from the combined fire from the French ships, the remaining British ships <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> support, and forced the rear-most French ships, Babet and Pomone, to surrender. Melampus, Nymphe and Concorde gave chase to the fleeing Résolue and Engageante. Strachan in Concorde attempted to damage the rearmost of the French ships, Engageante, before pushing on to chase Résolue, but the Résolue dropped back to support the Engageante, damaging Concordes sails and rigging. With Nymphe and Melampus still too far astern, and unable to catch Résolue himself, Strachan engaged Engageante and after 105 minutes of fighting, forced her to surrender, while Résolue made her escape. The Concorde lost one man killed and 12 wounded in the fighting.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and {{asked him why he}} had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
