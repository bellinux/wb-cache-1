The current challenges in electroless <b>copper</b> <b>deposition</b> include (i) {{high cost of}} Pd-based catalysts, (ii) deterioration of electrical performance of deposited metal at high frequency due to electron scattering at the roughened surface, and (iii) limited adhesion strength of electroless layers to substrates. We investigated an electroless <b>copper</b> <b>deposition</b> procedure composed of a H 2 SO 4 surface pretreatment, two-step Sn/Ag nano-colloidal catalyst seeding, and immersion in a traditional formaldehyde-containing electroless copper bath.

One of the effective ways for preventing and reducing the complications of infections is modification of the surface. Here, the handmade atmospheric plasma spray system is used for accumulating copper as an antibacterial agent on the 316 L stainless steel substrate, which applies to hospital environment and medical equipment. As a durable coating with proper adhesion is needed on the substrate, the effect of stand-off distance (SOD) which is an important parameter of the spray on the microstructure, the hardness and adhesion of the copper coating on the 316 L stainless steel were investigated. The structure and phase composition of <b>copper</b> <b>depositions</b> were investigated using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The adhesion and hardness of depositions are evidenced using the cross cut tester and Vickers hardness tester, respectively. The findings confirm that the voids in the coatings increase with increasing SOD, which leads to decreasing the hardness of coatings and also the adhesion strength between depositions and substrate. In addition, by increasing the SOD, the oxygen content and the size of grains in the lamellae (fine structure) of coatings also increase.|$|R
