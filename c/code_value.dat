25|$|The {{typewriter}} apostrophe (') was inherited {{by computer}} keyboards, {{and is the}} only apostrophe character available in the (7-bit) ASCII character encoding, at <b>code</b> <b>value</b> 0x27 (39). As such, it is a highly overloaded character. In ASCII, it represents a left single quotation mark, right single quotation mark, apostrophe, vertical line or prime (punctuation marks), or an acute accent (modifier letters).|$|E
25|$|When a {{new edition}} was released, the cryptographers were forced to start again. The {{original}} JN-25A system replaced the 'Blue' code (as Americans called it), and used five-digit numbers, each divisible by three (and so usable as a quick, and somewhat reliable, error check, as well {{as something of a}} 'crib' to cryptanalysts), giving a total of 33,334 legal code values. To make it harder to crack a <b>code</b> <b>value,</b> meaningless additives (from a large table or book of five-digit numbers) were added arithmetically to each five-digit cipher element. JN-25B superseded the first release of JN-25 at the start of December 1940. JN-25B had 55,000 valid words, and while it initially used the same additive list, this was soon changed and the cryptanalysts found themselves entirely locked out again.|$|E

40|$|Results are {{established}} for a simulated data fusion architecture featuring a synthetic two-class Gaussian problem, with Bayesian recognisers. The recognisers output posterior probabilities for each class. The probabilities from {{two or more}} recognisers of identical error rate are quantised using the nearest-neighbour coding rule. The <b>coded</b> <b>values</b> are decoded at a fusion centre and fused. A decision is made from the fused probabilities. The performance of the architecture is examined experimentally using <b>code</b> <b>values</b> that are uniformly distributed and <b>code</b> <b>values</b> that are produced using the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) algorithm. Results are produced for two to six sensors and two to 32 <b>code</b> <b>values.</b> These results are compared to fusing probabilities represented using 32 bit floating-point numbers. Using 32 uniform or LBG-produced <b>code</b> <b>values,</b> produces results that are at most only 1 % worse than fusing the uncoded probabilities.

50|$|Unicode defines two mapping methods: the Unicode Transformation Format (UTF) {{encoding}}s, and the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) encodings. An encoding maps (possibly {{a subset}} of) {{the range of}} Unicode code points to sequences of values in some fixed-size range, termed code values. All UTF encodings map all code points (except surrogates) to a unique sequence of bytes. The numbers {{in the names of}} the encodings indicate the number of bits per <b>code</b> <b>value</b> (for UTF encodings) or the number of bytes per <b>code</b> <b>value</b> (for UCS encodings). UTF-8 and UTF-16 are probably the most commonly used encodings. UCS-2 is an obsolete subset of UTF-16; UCS-4 and UTF-32 are functionally equivalent.|$|E
