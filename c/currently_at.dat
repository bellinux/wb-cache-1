Jordan signed a contract with Russian company Rosatom in 2014 for the construction of two $5 billion nuclear reactors which are <b>currently</b> <b>at</b> the planning stage and are expected to start delivering electricity in 2025.|$|E
5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (<b>currently</b> <b>at</b> least 270) in the Electoral College. In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.|$|E

5|$|As the new emperor, Macrinus had to {{deal with}} the major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were <b>currently</b> <b>at</b> war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason for the opening of peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been {{favourable}} for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Edisto Beach, South Carolina {{was changed}} forever by Gracie, due to human efforts to renourish the beach after its passage. Most {{of the shell}} hash beach <b>currently</b> <b>at</b> Edisto was placed there after Gracie. In order to expand the beach, an inland marsh was {{excavated}} {{and moved to the}} shoreline. This created highly desirable beach front property which led to new development along the coast seaward of Palmetto Boulevard, but also created an environmental catastrophe along the nearby ocean floor. A species of isopod which grows in coastal estuaries, the Cyathura Polita, disappeared after the passage of this hurricane from the Ashepoo River in South Carolina. The Kermadec petrel, a bird, was swept to Lookout Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania during Gracie, marking the first time it appeared in North America.|$|E

5|$|In {{his letter}} of 29 October 1862, Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory named yard number 294 as North Carolina and number 295 as Mississippi. In January 1863 the Foreign Secretary, Lord Russell, {{notified}} Bulloch, who had purchased the ships {{in his own}} name, that the ships would be prevented from sailing if they were doing so to form part of the fleet of a nation <b>currently</b> <b>at</b> war. Bulloch therefore transferred ownership to some French bankers in June 1863, nominally {{on behalf of the}} Egyptian government, with the intention of transferring them to the Confederate flag once they were at sea. The Khedive was attempting to acquire warships, so this was superficially plausible. North Carolina, later HMS Scorpion, was given the cover name of El Toussan and Mississippi, later HMS Wivern, received the name of El Monnassir. Lord Russel, prompted by the protests of the U.S. Ambassador, Charles F. Adams queried the Egyptian government directly and confirmed that this was merely a subterfuge to disguise the true ownership of the vessels. The Admiralty was prompted to send a guard ship, , to watch over the newly launched El Toussan after Lairds had made a request to begin sea trials in September. The Liverpool Collector of Customs was instructed not to let the ship leave her graving dock under any circumstances and the Surveyor of Customs finally seized the ships on 9 October.|$|E
5|$|The 1948 Major League Baseball {{season was}} {{predicted}} to {{be a close}} race between the Yankees and Red Sox. In a United Press poll conducted just before the season started, the majority of sportswriters chose the Yankees, who had won last year's World Series, to face the Braves or St. Louis Cardinals that year, while others chose the Red Sox; only one sportswriter chose the Indians to reach the World Series. Most of the American League managers had the Yankees finishing first, followed by the Red Sox, Indians, and Detroit Tigers. Tension and confidence was evident between the teams, as two months into the season, after defeating the Red Sox 7–0, Yankees manager Bucky Harris declared that the Yankees would win the pennant, though they were <b>currently</b> <b>at</b> second place at the time.|$|E
