40|$|<b>City</b> <b>Logistics</b> <b>Centers</b> (CLC) are an {{important}} part of the modern urban logistics system, and the selection of the location of a CLC has become a key problem in logistics and supply chain management. Integrating the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainable development, this paper presents a new evaluation system for the location selection of a CLC from a sustainability perspective. A fuzzy multi-attribute group decision making (FMAGDM) technique based on a linguistic 2 -tuple is used to evaluate potential alternative CLC locations. In this method, the linguistic evaluation values of all the evaluation criteria are transformed into linguistic 2 -tuples. A new 2 -tuple hybrid ordered weighted averaging (THOWA) operator is presented to aggregate the overall evaluation values of all experts into a collective evaluation value for each alternative, which is then used to rank and select alternative CLC locations. An application example is provided to validate the method developed and to highlight the implementation, practicality, and effectiveness by comparing with the fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{publication}} presents {{subject matter}} {{connected with the}} role of seaports as integrated <b>logistics</b> <b>centers</b> in the development of sustainable distribution of goods in urban areas. Seaports as integrated <b>logistics</b> <b>centers</b> and multifunctional socio-economic spaces are the key components of the European and global transport system. They carry out the functions and services necessary for the efficiency of supply chains, and their final elements include the distribution of goods from the places of production to places of consumption. Seaports cover the transport, logistic, distribution and spatial functions, which influence <b>city</b> development, while <b>logistics</b> <b>centers</b> cover the distribution function. The development of seaports is a result of their multifunctionality and multimodality focused on the widening of the range of services, which allows them to meet different demands of the environment. Thus, seaports and <b>logistics</b> <b>centers</b> have become elements of urban transport systems included in the EU policy of sustainable development of transport. Particularly important here is the latest implementation of the objectives of the EU White Paper on the development of resource-efficient and low-carbon transport in ecological urban transport. The publication presents existing solutions and possible directions concerning the activity of seaports as <b>logistics</b> <b>centers</b> in the area of urban logistics...|$|R
40|$|Sponsored Report (for Acquisition Research Program) This {{exploratory}} study provides {{a detailed analysis}} of ground support equipment (GSE) maintenance and operations at the Oklahoma <b>City</b> Air <b>Logistics</b> <b>Center</b> (OC-ALC) to support future contract negotiations. The United States has been engaged in combat operations for over ten years. A key component of these combat operations has been airpower. A high wartime operational tempo and the use of aging airframes, some of which were scheduled to be retired decades ago, have solidified the need for a refined depot-level maintenance system designed to quickly and effectively dismantle, rebuild, and reconstitute combat and support aircraft. A critical part of the foundation that this system is built upon is the management of critical GSE, which is essential to depot-level maintenance operations. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a top-level analysis of current GSE management processes in order to better understand the effectiveness of current contractor logistics support, estimate the operational availability of ten categories of GSE, and provide specific findings and recommendations for the leadership at the OC-ALC.
