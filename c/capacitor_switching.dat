50|$|In {{the legacy}} grid, {{there are three}} primary tools for {{carrying}} out voltage management: Load Tap Changers (LTCs), voltage regulators, and capacitor banks. LTCs and voltage regulators refer to transformers with variable turns ratios that are placed at strategic points in a network and adjusted to raise or lower voltage as is necessary. Capacitor banks manage voltage by “generating” reactive power, and have thus far been the primary tools through which true Volt/VAR control is carried out. These large capacitors {{are connected to the}} grid in shunt configuration through switches which, when closed, allow the capacitors to generate VARs and boost voltage at the point of connection. In the future, further VVC might be carried out by smart inverters and other distributed generation resources, which can also inject reactive power into a distribution network. A VVC application helps the operator mitigate dangerously low or high voltage conditions by suggesting required action plans for all VVC equipment. The plan will give a required tap position and <b>capacitor</b> <b>switching</b> state to ensure the voltage stays close to its nominal value and thus optimize Volt-VAR control function for the utility.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of the new liberalized markets has increased the interest in power-quality (PQ) disturbances due to their economic effect. In particular, {{in the case of}} disturbances caused by a single event (such as a <b>capacitor</b> <b>switching</b> or voltage sag), the waveform assessment can be difficult due to the rapid variations in waveform spectral component characteristics; these difficulties require a suitable choice of signal-processing techniques for spectral analysis and, in particular, the resort to time-frequency representations. In this paper, the adaptive Prony method is proposed to calculate PQ indices based on a time-frequency analysis of waveforms.

40|$|Abstract—The early reset merged <b>capacitor</b> <b>switching</b> {{algorithm}} (EMCS) {{is proposed}} as an energy reducing switching technique for a binary weighted, capacitive successive approximation (SAR) {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC). The method uses the merged <b>capacitor</b> <b>switching</b> (MCS) architecture and optimizes {{the use of}} the VCM level during the SAR conversion. This algorithm can reduce switching power by over 12 % with no additional DAC driver activity when compared to the MCS scheme. The MCS and EMCS approaches are analyzed mathematically and the EMCS energy consumption is shown to be lower than or equal to that of the MCS technique for every digital code. Static linearity improvements for this structure are also shown with the integral non-linearity (INL) reducing by a factor of two due to the utilization of the MCS three level DAC. The EMCS implementation methodology is also described. I...|$|E

40|$|IEEE Abstract — In the {{evolution}} of wide area measurement systems (WAMS) to wide area control systems (WACS), several subsystems can be considered. One such subsystem to be considered under WACS is shunt <b>capacitor</b> <b>switching</b> strategies to provide reactive power support. Many shunt capacitors are operated using local voltage control, but WACS controlled shunt capacitors are operated remotely using a system wide strategy. A WACS control of <b>capacitor</b> <b>switching</b> is proposed based on indices that assess bus voltage magnitude and complex line flows. The switching scheme which produces operationally acceptable bus voltage magnitudes or line power flows, {{or a combination of}} the two phenomena, is used for global control of reactive power support. The differences between WACS and local control are illustrated utilizing the IEEE 57 bus system as a test bed. A strategy based on the grouping of capacitors for WACS control is illustrated and compared to local control. Results show that WACS has better results when the number of bus voltage magnitudes out of range and total system losses are considered as assessment measures of control effectiveness.
