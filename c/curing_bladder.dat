50|$|In the past, {{the fabric}} was built up {{on a flat}} steel drum, with the cords at angles of about +60 and −60 degrees from the {{direction}} of travel, so they criss-crossed over each other. They were called cross ply or bias ply tires. The plies were turned up around the steel wire beads and the combined tread/sidewall applied. The green (uncured) tire was loaded over a <b>curing</b> <b>bladder</b> and shaped into the mold. This shaping process caused the cords in the tire to assume an S-shape from bead to bead. The angle under the tread, the crown angle, stretched down to about 36 degrees. In the sidewall region the angle was 45 degrees, and in the bead it remained at 60 degrees. The low crown angle gave rigidity to support the tread and the high sidewall angle gave comfort. To increase strength, the manufacturer would increase the number of plies, and the heat buildup in the tire.|$|E

The experimental results showed that reducing {{the first and second}} shaping pressure, and increasing hole diameter of N 2 on <b>curing</b> <b>bladder,</b> and extending times of discharged N 2 in shaping process, and reducing pressure of expanded bladder at the moment of closing mold, could reduce RFV of TBR tire and improve uniformity of tire and provide base data of product process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Traditional tire {{vulcanization}} {{technology has}} notable drawbacks,for example,the heat transfer is uneven and uniformity of a tire is low. A {{new type of}} inner mould direct-pressure tire vulcanization technology is introduced. The new technology method can solve probloms in traditional tire vulcanization by utilizing the building drum to replace the <b>curing</b> <b>bladder</b> of the central mechanism and using electromagnetic-induction heating method to heat green tire cavity. This paper mainly illustrates the development process of the inner mould direct-pressure tire vulcanization technology equipment based on the current tire shaping press vulcanizer...|$|E
30|$|Many {{plants of}} genus Abutilon are {{traditionally}} used {{for treatment of}} inflammation, bronchitis, piles, gonorrhea, diabetes and fever. Abutilon hirtum is traditionally used {{to ease the pain}} of kidney gravel, to treat diarrhoea, cough and toothache, to <b>cure</b> <b>bladder</b> inflammations, wounds and ulcers and as an antipyretic, demulcent, diuretic and mouth wash. The aim of the study is to evaluate the anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic and antidiabetic effects of the total ethanolic extract and different fractions of Abutilon hirtum (Lam.)

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study was}} to assess the wastes {{occurring}} because of defect tyres in air tyre manufacturing process in the Loadstar Pvt. Limited. This lost accounts for 37. 75 million during the last five months. In this study a complete statistical analysis about defect tyres were carried out for five tyre types in air tyre manufacturing process by means of Parato diagram. The average run lengths were found for each tyre type. Explanatory statistical analysis revealed that the defect tyre cost is high due to factors such as under <b>cure,</b> <b>bladder</b> pleat, air bubble in, plate damage, air bubble lug, low pressure and less side wall thickness. These statistical analyses are recommended to help manufacturers to identify the exact issues in the manufacturing process and rectify those...|$|R
30|$|Abutilon {{is a large}} genus {{belonging}} to family Malvaceae comprises about 150 annual or perennial herbs, shrubs or even small trees native to the tropical and subtropical countries of America, Africa, Asia and Australia [1, 2]. Traditionally, many Abutilon species are used in treatment of inflammation, piles, gonorrhea, bronchitis, diarrhea, cleaning wounds and ulcers [3]. In Malaysia, Abutilon hirtum {{is used as a}} poultice to ease the pain of kidney gravel and often mixed with glutinous rice and applied to ulcers. In Thailand, the roots are used against cough and toothache and as an antipyretic. The leaves or flowers are applied to abscesses. In Kenya the fruits are eaten raw, while the leaves are browsed by goats and camels. Water extract of the bark is given to ease childbirth in Kenya and Uganda. In India, traditionally the leaves are used as demulcent, diuretic and to treat diarrhoea. The decoction of the leaves is used as mouth wash and to <b>cure</b> <b>bladder</b> inflammations, wounds and ulcers, since alkaloids are reported from the roots of the plant [2, 4, 5].|$|R
40|$|Both resiniferatoxin (RTX) and {{tetrodotoxin}} (TTX) {{have been}} reported to be effective in several clinical trials aiming to <b>cure</b> urinary <b>bladder</b> dysfunction. The goal of this experiment was to study the effect of intravesical administration of RTX and TTX on the chemical coding of paracervical ganglion (PCG) neurons that supply the urinary bladder in pigs. The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the opioid family member Leu 5 -enkephalin (LENK) are both known for their regulatory effects in the function of the porcine genitourinary tract. The PCG neurons innervating the urinary bladder were identified by application of the retrograde tracer Fast Blue (FB), injected into the bladder wall prior to intravesical RTX or TTX administration. Immunocytochemical detection of LENK and VIP expression in the FB-labelled perikarya revealed that in the control group 25. 15...|$|R
40|$|Treatment {{policies}} have been examined in bladder cancer patienls over 75 years old. Twenty out of 31 patients who were treated for bladder cancer {{in the past three}} years were over 75 years old. There were 3 cases of total cystectomy, 3 cases of partial cystectomy, 5 cases of TUR, and 1 case of conservative treatment. In the treatment of elderlies, it is essential to control the nutritive conditions satisfactorily, to improve the circulatory movement, and to take preventive measures against infections. As a method for urinary diversion, tubeless ureterostomy is regarded as the best one because it results in fewer post operative complications. According to our experience, even the elderlies could be <b>cured</b> of <b>bladder</b> cancer using the same treatment policy that is used for younger patients...|$|R
5000|$|John {{begins to}} {{demonstrate}} supernatural powers; he <b>cures</b> Paul's <b>bladder</b> infection, resurrects Mr. Jingles, and heals Melinda Moores, {{wife of the}} prison's chief warden, of a brain tumor. This last affliction he releases into Percy, who under its influence shoots another prisoner, mass murderer William Wharton, dead. Wharton had {{from the moment of}} his arrival been a troublemaker; he assaulted the guards as he was being escorted into the block, made mischief on two occasions later which caused Paul to order him restrained in the block's padded cell, groped Percy, racially insulted John, and revealed psychically to John that he is, in fact, responsible for the crime for which John was condemned. John then reveals the story psychically to Paul, and, when doing so, he also releases his supernatural energy into Paul. Meanwhile, Percy is committed to the insane asylum.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Robot-assisted radical {{cystectomy}} has {{the potential}} to <b>cure</b> patients from <b>bladder</b> cancer while offering the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. We sought to evaluate the learning curve for this technically demanding procedure. Materials and Methods: Robot-assisted radical cystectomy was attempted in 100 consecutive patients. An IRBapproved review of our robot-assisted radical cystectomy database was conducted. Total operative (OR) time, cystectomy time, pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) time, estimated blood loss (EBL), margin positivity, complications, and length of hospital stay were compared among patients divided into 4 cohorts of increasing surgical experience. Scattergrams and continuous curves were plotted to develop a robotic cystectomy learning curve...|$|R
40|$|Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is {{the gold}} {{standard}} treatment for intermediate and high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. BCG therapy is the most successful example of immunotherapy in cancer. Unfortunately, the treatment-related side effects are still relevant. Furthermore, non-responder patients are candidate to radical cystectomy {{in the absence of}} valuable alternative options. These aspects have prompted the search for newer biological response modifiers (BRM) with a better benefit/side effects ratio. The toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 ligand, Helicobacter pylori protein HP-NAP, has been shown to deserve a potential role as BRM. HP-NAP is capable of driving the differentiation of T helper (Th) 1 cells, both in vitro and in vivo, because of its ability to create an IL- 12 -enriched milieu. Herein, we report that local administration of HP-NAP decreases tumour growth by triggering tumour necrosis in a mouse model of bladder cancer implant. The effect is accompanied by a significant accumulation of both CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) IFN-γ-secreting cells, within tumour and regional lymph nodes. Noteworthy, HP-NAP-treated tumours show also a reduced vascularization due to the anti-angiogenic activity of IFN-γ induced by HP-NAP. Our findings strongly indicate that HP-NAP might become a novel therapeutic "bullet" for the <b>cure</b> of <b>bladder</b> tumours...|$|R
30|$|The {{efficacy}} {{of this procedure}} was very high in our initial experience. Both groups, analysed together and separately, showed statistically significant success rates for all the presenting complaints (Tables  3 and 4). Pelvic muscles play {{an important part in}} bladder symptoms; pelvic muscle support of the bladder base and the stretch receptors control symptoms of frequency, urgency, and nocturia. Previous studies have reported a high concomitant <b>cure</b> rate for <b>bladder</b> symptoms [2]. This study confirms previous reports of high rates of improvement in symptoms of prolapse, urgency, nocturia, pelvic pain, and difficulty voiding [6]. In our case series, the cure rates were statistically significant, with a cure rate of 80 % for urgency, 70 % for nocturia, 83.3 % for voiding difficulty, 75 % for stress incontinence, and 83.3 % for urge incontinence.|$|R
5000|$|Recent {{studies have}} been carried out to {{demonstrate}} the efficacy of transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation with the use of external electrodes. Electrodes are applied near to the ankle where the tibial/sural nerve is located. It is believed that the electrical stimulation can penetrate the skin delivering tibial nerve stimulation in the same way, but without the need for a needle electrode. A study carried out by Glasgow Caledonian University reported that based on 7 case series 48-68% of patients treated via transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (external stimulation) saw a marked improvement or <b>cure</b> of their <b>bladder</b> irregularities (varying forms of incontinence). This is in contrast to the 60-80% success rate for treating overactive bladder using the percutaneous method (use of a needle stimulator). [...] The study concludes that transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation has a positive impact and an overall reduction in bladder weakness symptoms, supporting its use as a first line intervention.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{establish}} the effect of intravesical administration of resiniferatoxin (RTX) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) on the chemical coding of paracervical ganglion (PCG) neurons supplying the urinary bladder in the pig. In order to identify the PCG neurons innervating the bladder, retrograde tracer Fast Blue was injected into the bladder wall prior to intravesical RTX or TTX administration. Consequent application of immunocytochemical methods revealed that in the control group 76. 82 % of Fast Blue positive PCG neurons contain nitric oxide synthetase (nNOS), and 66. 92 % contain acetylcholine transferase (ChAT). Intravesical infusion of RTX resulted in a reduction of the nNOS-IR neurons to 57. 74 % and ChAT-IR to 57. 05 %. Alternative administration of TTX induced an increase of nNOS-IR neurons up to 79. 29 % and a reduction of the ChAT-IR population down to 3. 73 % of the Fast Blue positive PCG cells. Our data show that both neurotoxins affect the chemical coding of PCG cells supplying the porcine urinary bladder, but the effects of their action are different. Moreover, these results shed light on the possible involvement of NO-ergic and cholinergic neurons in the mechanisms of therapeutic action exerted by RTX and TTX in <b>curing</b> the overactive <b>bladder</b> disorder...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} carried out to compare ultrasonographic {{findings}} on patients after transobturator tape (TOT) and tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) procedures to evaluate displacement of tapes up to a 2 -year follow-up and to test the correlation between bladder outlet obstruction and the tape position. Forty-nine patients had a transvaginal ultrasonographic evaluation after TOT (n= 31) or TVT (n= 18) procedures. Twenty-one patients from the TOT group and 12 from the TVT group had ultrasonographic evaluation both at 1 and 2 years follow-up. Tape position was evaluated with a complete sagittal view, and {{the width of the}} tape and the distance between the middle of the tape and the bladder neck were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using a t test. After clinical evaluation, stress test, and uroflowmetry with residual measurement, the tapes were compared on ultrasound with regard to clinical and urodynamic results: success in stress incontinence vs failure, bladder outlet obstruction vs no obstruction, and de novo urgencies vs no urgencies. No difference was found between TOT and TVT in the midurethral tape placement. The distance between the middle of the tape and the bladder neck at rest was similar at both 1 and 2 years after both TOT and TVT and was unchanged after coughing or Valsalva. The width of the tape was similar after TOT and TVT at both 1 and 2 years after the procedure. There was no difference in the distance between the middle of the tape and the <b>bladder</b> neck between <b>cured</b> patients, failure, <b>bladder</b> outlet obstruction, and de novo urgencies after both TOT and TVT. Transvaginal ultrasound examination showed {{no significant difference in the}} tape position between TOT and TVT. No correlation was found between ultrasonographic findings and postoperative voiding troubles for both techniques...|$|R
40|$|Radical {{cystectomy}} {{as standard}} treatment of muscle-invasive urothelial {{carcinoma of the}} urinary <b>bladder</b> <b>cures</b> less than 50 % of patients with locally advanced bladder cancer. We compared two adjuvant combination chemotherapies in patients with stage pT 3 a- 4 a and/or pathologic node-positive transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder after radical cystectomy. Patients and Methods A total of 327 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} either adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with three cycles of cisplatin 70 mg/qm 2 on day 1 and methotrexate 40 mg/qm 2 on days 8 and 15 of a 21 -day cycle (CM) or three cycles of methotrexate 30 mg/qm 2 on days 1, 15, and 22, vinblastine 3 mg/qm 2 on days 2, 15, and 22, epirubicin 45 mg/qm 2 on day 2, and cisplatin 70 mg/qm 2 on day 2 of a 28 -day cycle (M-VEC). Results The hazard ratio for progression-free survival as the primary end point was 1. 13 (90 % CI, 0. 86 to 1. 48) for 163 CM patients compared with 164 M-VEC patients whose right-hand limit remained below the upper bound compatible with the noninferiority hypothesis (. 0403). The 5 -year progression-free, tumor-specific, and overall survival rates (point estimates SE) for CM versus M-VEC were 46. 3 % 4. 6 % v 48. 8 % 4. 5 %, 52. 0 % 4. 6 % v 52. 3 % 4. 8 %, and 46. 1 % 4. 3 % v 45. 1 % 4. 6 %, respectively. WHO grade 3 and 4 leukopenia occurred in 7. 0 % of patients treated with CM and 22. 2 % of patients treated with M-VEC (P. 0001). Conclusion CM cannot be considered inferior to M-VEC with regard to progression-free survival of patients with locally advanced bladder cancer after radical cystectomy. Moreover, patients receiving adjuvant CM combination therapy experienced significantly less grade 3 and 4 leukopenia than patients treated with M-VEC.
