2500|$|The port handles around 8 {{million tonnes}} of coal for clients {{such as the}} Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board, Karnataka Power Corporation, cement plants of Tamil Nadu and {{independent}} power producers in northern Tamil Nadu and southern Andhra Pradesh. The coal handling for the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board {{was transferred to the}} Ennore Port. In 2005, as part of pollution-control measure, the port has installed wind curtains made of ultraviolet resistant fabric along the harbour's beachfront for over 1.5km to the east of the coal terminal to prevent wind carrying coal dust into the city at a cost of [...] 3.7 million. In 2008, the port has also installed a semi-mechanised closed <b>coal</b> <b>conveyor</b> system comprising two streams with a capacity of 15 million metric tons/annum and a handling rated capacity of 1,500 metric tons/hour/stream and running for a length of 5km at two berths, namely, Jawahar Dock IV and VI, at a cost of [...] 430 million to transfer the coal to the individual coal plots {{at the southern end of}} the port, from where the cargo will be transported by rail to respective destinations, thus preventing pollution from coal dust and eliminating movement of coal-carrying trucks within the port. The conveyor runs at an elevation of 10–13m and has provision for longitudinal movement along the road to the plots and transverse movement for stacking coal at individual plots. Coal discharged into the hoppers located at the two docks is conveyed to coal plots through conveyors or tripper cars and is equipped with belt weigher. The conveyor system is expected to remain functional for about 5 years, till Ennore Port is ready to handle coal for all the clients.|$|E

The coal powder is delivered pneumatically to boilers and burned to heat water in a steam generator. Superheated steam at 900 psi is initially used to drive a turbine/generator, emerging at 90 psi for distribution to campus buildings through a system of tunnels. Steam condensate is returned from campus to the plant via the same tunnels to be cleaned and reused.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{bearing support}} {{breakage}} of screw <b>coal</b> powder <b>conveyor</b> in power plant boiler went through four stages: axial displacement of shaft sleeve, shaft sleeve wearing by shield ring and by bearing, and {{the wearing of}} skeleton seal rings and dustproof felts by shaft sleeve. By analyzing the wearing characters of each part, the renovation structure was designed. The bearing settled style was changed from using shield ring to using locknut by designing convex sidestep on the shaft sleeve, preventing the axial from drifting. Substituting for the welding assembly, the bolt connecting between the covers and the bearing support body was selected to replace the worn sealing materials easily in dismantling and installing. Good operating effects were achieved after the renovation of the <b>coal</b> powder <b>conveyor</b> bearing support, in the screw coal powder manufacturing line of 100 MW power plant boiler, there was no line vibrating, coal leaking, noising and line locking, having decreased the repairing cost greatly and insuring the safety and stable electric power producing...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{monitoring}} systems (AMS) are required when using air from conveyor belt entries to ventilate working sections in U. S. underground coal mines. AMS technology {{has the potential}} to increase fire safety mine-wide, but {{research is needed to determine}} the detection and response times for fires of a variety of combustible materials. To evaluate the potential of an AMS for fire detection in other areas of a coal mine, a series of full-scale fire experiments were conducted to determine detection and response times from fires of different combustible materials that are found in U. S. underground coal mines, including high- and low-volatility <b>coals,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts, brattice materials, different types of wood, diesel fuel, and a foam sealant. These experiments were conducted in the Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM) of the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) located in Pittsburgh, PA, using a commercially available AMS that is typical of current technology. The results showed that through proper selection of sensors and their locations, a mine-wide AMS can provide sufficient early fire warning times and improve the health and safety of miners.

40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{two most}} often used methods for rolling {{bearings}} condition monitoring are thermographic inspection and vibrodiagnostic. However, analysis of the relevant literature has shown that so far there is no established correlation between rolling bearings surface temperatures and measured radial vibration intensities. These variables also strongly depend on rolling bearing’s service life and it’s environmental operating conditions, especially in case of open pit <b>coal</b> mine <b>conveyor</b> idler’s rolling bearings; where high concentration of debris particles (such as surface dust, dirt and excavated coal) is present. Taking into account previously listed facts; the main goal of the presented research results was to establish statistically significant correlation between listed variables: rolling bearings surface temperatures, radial vibration intensities, service life and concentration level of debris particles in bearing grease. In order to achieve this goal, specific experimental methodology was developed and implemented. Obtained results were then processed using standardized statistical software and appropriate correlation was generated and later verified in praxis. At this moment, developed experimental methodology is applied only to open pit <b>coal</b> mine <b>conveyor</b> idler’s rolling bearings, but its principles are universal, so with minor modifications {{it could be used}} for prediction of any of listed variables for different kinds of rolling bearings, operating in different environments...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to design and build an {{equipment}} which can detect ferrous and non-ferrous objects in conveyed commodities, discriminate between them and locate the object along the belt and on {{the width of the}} belt. The magnetic induction mechanism was used as a means of achieving the objectives of this research. In order to choose the appropriate geometry and size of the induction field source, the field distributions of different source geometries and sizes were studied in detail.
