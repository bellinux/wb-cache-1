25|$|Until 1959, {{when its}} tender was cut down in size, Hercules ran with the <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> raised on blocks of wood {{to match the}} height of the tender.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> is {{reinforced}} {{to take the}} weight of two personnel and has a roof hatch and provision for a machine gun installation over an observer's platform inside the cab. For maintenance the cab can be hydraulically tilted forward 50Â°.|$|E
25|$|The locomotive's two {{cylinders}} {{were inside}} the frame and it was equipped with Stephenson valve gear. Its two feedwater pumps were actuated by the piston crossheads. As built, the engine had an open cab, but a <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> was installed some years later.|$|E

5000|$|Unit Nos. 2649 - 2472 {{initially}} received rounded <b>cab</b> <b>roofs</b> (which, by {{preserving the}} contour {{left over from}} the F-unit roof, were expected to reduce costs [...] - [...] instead, {{it was found that the}} custom-fitted cab doors required by this arrangement were not economical, and many of the units eventually were modified with angled roofs), and Nos. 2471 - 2417 featured angled <b>cab</b> <b>roofs</b> from the onset; ...|$|R
5000|$|The second {{batch of}} locomotives, EF66 21 to EF66 55, {{delivered}} between 1973 and 1975, incorporated {{a number of}} minor changes and improvements. Most noticeable was {{the extension of the}} <b>cab</b> <b>roofs</b> over the windscreens to reduce the deposition of abrasion dust from the pantographs on the windscreens. Some of the first-batch locomotives (EF66 1 to 20) were also subsequently modified with the [...] "sun visor" [...] style <b>cab</b> end <b>roofs.</b>|$|R
25|$|No.42 was rebuilt in 1901 with a cab which {{enclosed}} {{the safety}} valves that now exhausted through the <b>cab</b> <b>roof.</b> The spectacles {{were small and}} round and the cab sides were quite open. This alteration increased the weight by about 1 ton.|$|E
25|$|These are {{the prime}} main-line steam {{locomotives}} of the railway, {{and are in}} high demand for tourist services. Two of them, double headed, are required to scale the steepest grades with a train of any length. Like the other locomotives they are tank engines with large side tanks and a rear coal bunker, under cover of the <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> in this design.|$|E
25|$|The {{designation}} {{also applies}} to five locomotives built by EMD Australian licensee Clyde Engineering, Adelaide for Hamersley Iron. These were shorter than production SD50s, and were equipped with a special double <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> for insulation against the hot Australian desert sun in the Pilbara region. Withdrawn in November 1995, they were sold to National Railway Equipment Company and exported to the U.S. in February 1999 and used in national lease service. They were subsequently sold to the Utah Railway in June 2001, where they remain.|$|E
5000|$|Type 2 had an {{armoured}} <b>cab</b> <b>roofed</b> with {{canvas and}} a separate fully enclosed fighting compartment resembling a small pillbox on the back [...] - [...] communication between driver and crew must have been difficult.|$|R
5000|$|The builder's {{picture of}} the {{locomotive}} shows it without a cab and with only a spectacle plate for crew protection, but in photographs of the locomotives in service, they have <b>cab</b> <b>roofs</b> installed underneath the overhead condensing coils.|$|R
50|$|During the mid 1960s rail blue appeared, {{and white}} <b>cab</b> <b>roofs</b> were {{gradually}} dispensed with and buffer beams became black. Initially the yellow warning panels were expanded {{to cover the}} complete lower front of the driving cabs and later the whole cab fronts became yellow.|$|R
25|$|Southern Pacific road {{switcher}} diesels often had elaborate lighting clusters front and rear, {{with a large}} red Mars Light for emergency signaling, and often two pairs of sealed-beam headlamps, {{one on top of}} the cab and the other below the Mars Light on the nose. Starting in the 1970s SP had cab air conditioning on all new locomotives and the unit is visible on the <b>cab</b> <b>roof.</b> Southern Pacific placed large snowplows on the pilots of their {{road switcher}}s for the heavy snowfall on Donner Pass. Many Southern Pacific road switchers had a Nathan-AirChime model P3 or P5 air horn with chords distinct to Southern Pacific locomotives in the western states.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, the {{locomotive}} was renumbered [...] "1881", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company {{for use in}} the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, {{the locomotive}} was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s. [...] The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers. [...] The number 1293 was also restored to the engine. [...] In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.|$|E
500|$|Originally the {{locomotive}} had a [...] "diamond" [...] smoke stack. It is unknown {{when that was}} changed to a straight [...] "shotgun" [...] stack. Sometime during the early 20th century {{the locomotive}} was converted from coal burning to oil burning and its wooden [...] "cowcatcher" [...] pilot was replaced with a steel pipe pilot. [...] The wooden cab was replaced with an all-steel cab, and its kerosene [...] "box" [...] headlamp was replaced with an electric one. [...] When the engine was relocated from Louisiana to Vermont its steel <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> was removed {{in preparation for the}} ride on a flat car. [...] The roof was later mistaken for scrap metal as a worker at Steamtown cut out a piece for use as a stack cover for the locomotive. [...] In 1970 the train underwent what the Steamtown Historical Study refers to as a [...] "misguided" [...] restoration, and given a diamond-shaped smoke stack and a kerosene [...] "box" [...] headlamp, both of which bearing very little resemblance to the stack and headlamp originally worn by the engine. [...] The restoration thus gave the engine an appearance unlike any form it had assumed during its service life.|$|E
50|$|They were {{delivered}} in an unlined medium shade of Brunswick green with white <b>cab</b> <b>roofs</b> and yellow speed whiskers. The whiskers were replaced {{during the early}} 1960s by split yellow warning panels, one {{either side of the}} central character train describer which remained green.|$|R
50|$|As built, the GE Classes 34-000, 34-400 and 34-900 were {{visually}} {{indistinguishable from}} each other. The ex Iscor Class 34-500 loco&shy;motives could be visually dis&shy;ting&shy;uished {{from the other}} series by the air conditioning units mounted on the <b>cab</b> <b>roofs</b> of most of them and initially, {{when it was still}} a feature unique to them, by their running board-mounted handrails.|$|R
50|$|One {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the P 8 is the large distance between the centre and rear coupled axles. At the outset the P 8 only had a steam dome behind the sandbox; later a forward feed dome was added. Further constructional changes affected, inter alia, the driver's <b>cab</b> <b>roofs,</b> the smoke deflectors and various external assemblies.|$|R
2500|$|A [...] {{reduction}} in height {{from the original}} [...] height was required by the Network Rail OLE regulations, and was achieved by a redesign of the dome and safety valve mountings on the boiler, and by reprofiling of the <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> and chimney.|$|E
2500|$|Being {{produced}} to {{the same}} specification, both GE/ALCO and EMD MRS-1s are very similar in appearance and can easily be mistaken; they are both C-C road-switchers that are very low in profile in order to fit within European loading gauges. [...] The major exterior differences are the peaked <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> and long hood roof on the EMD locomotives, and the radiator intakes {{on the sides of}} the long hood end, which have outside shutters on the Alco locomotives. In addition, the short hood is visibly lower than the long hood, thanks to the long hood's peaked roof; on the ALCO units, the two are the same height. [...] The frame side sills are also different; the Alco's are straight from front to rear, while the EMD's step down towards each end of the locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|As {{locomotives}} {{are being}} restored, some pacific type 4-6-2 locomotive boilers {{show signs of}} having been painted dark green. The soft cover book [...] "Steam Glory 2" [...] by Kalmbach Publications (2007) has an article [...] "Southern Pacific's Painted Ladies" [...] which shows color photos from the 1940s and 1950s revealing {{that a number of}} SP 0-6-0 yard engines, usually assigned to passenger terminals were painted in various combinations with red <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> and cab doors, pale silver smokeboxes and smokebox fronts, dark green boilers, multi colored SP heralds on black cab, green cylinder covers and other details pointed out in color. Some other SP steam passenger locomotives may have been so painted, or at least had dark green boilers. The article indicates that these paint jobs lasted years and were not special paint for a single event.|$|E
50|$|The British Rail Class 26 diesel locomotives, {{also known}} as the BRCW Type 2, were built by the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company (BRCW) at Smethwick in 1958-59. Forty seven {{examples}} were built, and the last were withdrawn from service in 1994. Like their higher-powered sisters, the BRCW Classes 27 and 33, they had all-steel bodies and cab ends with fibreglass <b>cab</b> <b>roofs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand Midland Railway Company ordered five 4-4-0T tank {{locomotives}} from Nasmyth Wilson in 1887 for use {{on their}} planned railway between Nelson, Greymouth and Christchurch. These locomotives were built to a standard Nasmyth Wilson design for export, and had double-skinned <b>cab</b> <b>roofs</b> for work in tropical climates. The first three locomotives were named Reefton, Christchurch and Nelson on entry into service; the other two locomotives never carried names.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was built}} and delivered by Manning Wardle and Company in 1902, with works number 1583. Named Midget, it was designated Type C and numbered 41 on the Cape Government Railways (CGR). The locomotive was delivered {{with an open}} <b>cab,</b> <b>roofed,</b> but not enclosed. To offer better protection to the crew, a spectacle plate and enclosed sides were added at some point soon after it entered service.|$|R
2500|$|Being {{produced}} to {{the same}} specification, both GE/ALCO and EMD MRS-1s are very similar in appearance and can easily be mistaken; they are both C-C road-switchers that are very low in profile in order to fit within European loading gauges and structure gauges. [...] The major exterior differences are the peaked <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> and long hood roof on the EMD locomotives, and the radiator intakes {{on the sides of}} the long hood end, which have outside shutters on the Alco locomotives. In addition, the short hood is visibly lower than the long hood, thanks to the long hood's peaked roof; on the ALCO units, the two are the same height. [...] The frame side sills are also different; the Alco's are straight from front to rear, while the EMD's step down towards each end of the locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|Later, Prescision Scale Models {{produced}} {{a range of}} the engines in both in-service and preserved formats and liveries, including features like the extended coal bunker on preserved engines, name plates and crests as appropriate and other details. 12 units each of coal burners 700, 711, 724, 753 and 769 were released, along with 20 units each of 719 and 748 as oil burners. 30 units of R704 in its Glasgow Exhibition scheme were included, along with [...] "As Preserved" [...] R707 (25 units), R761 (20 units), R766 (25 units, green, with cab window wipers and radio antennae), and five models of R770 in V/Line grey with orange; a wholly fictional locomotive and livery. The instruction manual notes that R761 had black lining added to the smoke deflectors in 1988 and R766 lost is white <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> and that these variants are not modelled.|$|E

50|$|After the Blizzard of 1888 {{the rock}} cut {{filled up with}} snow, leading to a rail {{accident}} that killed five and took a week to clear. One of the locomotive's <b>cab</b> <b>roofs</b> {{was used as an}} animal shelter in a nearby field. The houses were used to treat the wounded. Mary Wheeler defaulted on the mortgage and lost the house in 1897, taking it out of the Wheeler family after almost a century.|$|R
5000|$|Soo #700 {{was built}} {{towards the end}} of the GP30's short {{production}} life between 1961 & 1963. It was one of 948 built by Electro-Motive Division (EMD) of General Motors in La Grange, Illinois. GP (General Purpose) was the beginning of the [...] "second generation" [...] of diesel locomotive power to replace older diesels that led to the demise of steam power. GP30s are recognizable with their higher <b>cab</b> <b>roofs,</b> sometimes called [...] "hump roofs".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>roof</b> extends {{slightly}} {{beyond the}} cab rear {{to accommodate the}} larger electrical cabinet.|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{did have}} the distinctive <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> profile of other locomotives in the EMD family, unlike the completely different rounded <b>cab</b> <b>roof</b> profile of its successful competitor. When the Electro-Motive Sibanye joint venture was dissolved, the locomotive remained {{in the possession of}} Sibanye Trade and Services and was renumbered STS 001. It was later hired or leased to the Khumani iron ore mine in the Northern Cape, where it was renumbered again to LC9-1.|$|E

He has a Texas accent which is {{evidenced}} by the horns on his and his Father's <b>cab</b> <b>roofs.</b> He refers to his friends as his [...] "buddies". In [...] "The Best", it is revealed that he can race best on a dirt track. His catchphrase is [...] "Wa-hoo!" ...|$|R
50|$|The railroads of the United States were nationalized during World War I, from December, 1917 to March, 1920. As part of this, {{locomotives}} built {{during the}} period {{were one of the}} twelve USRA standard designs, which included the Light Mikado. 4003 was one of 625 built by the USRA; another 641 were built after the USRA era, {{making it one of the}} most numerous single locomotive designs of all time. After Frisco received the Mikados, it modified them with boosters on the trailing trucks and raised <b>cab</b> <b>roofs</b> for more headroom.|$|R
50|$|Their large cab {{windows were}} {{designed}} to afford the crew the maximum all-round field of vision, but in South African summer months the sun can cause much discomfort in the cab. It is not unusual to find a locomotive on yard work with the sun-side windows covered with newspaper taped onto the insides. A few Class 36-000 locomotives have been observed at Vereeniging and at Port Elizabeth with home depot-applied modifications to their <b>cab</b> <b>roofs</b> {{in the form of}} sheetmetal roof extensions to the front and rear to serve as sun-shades.|$|R
