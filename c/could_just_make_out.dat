2500|$|After {{the conference}} Chauvel ordered the Australian Mounted Division to {{ride back to}} Karm in the {{afternoon}} to ease the water at Beersheba. The division's horses had had their last proper drink at Khalasa on 30 October, as the water supply at Asluj and Beersheba had been restricted. As all the tents had been pulled down the previous day {{in preparation for a}} move, the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance did dressings outside during the morning. Orders were received a noon and after lunch the field ambulance, {{along with the rest of}} their brigade rode out at 14:00 back to Karm where they arrived at 22:00. It was a [...] "terrible ride in the dust ... direct through Beersheba and Buggar. The dust was so thick you <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the camel ahead and follow on. We lost the Brigade and camped for the night at Karm." [...] The Australian Mounted Divisional Train (less the 5th Mounted Brigade's 38 Coy but with 7th Mounted Brigade Train), reached Karm at 23:00 after leaving Beersheba at 16:00.|$|E

60|$|In a {{very few}} seconds it was done, and looking astern, Augusta <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> {{something}} black that seemed to float {{for a second or}} two upon the water, and then disappear into its depths. It was the shattered hull of the whaler.|$|E
60|$|Bathurst {{stepped out}} and looked up. He <b>could</b> but <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> {{the figure of}} Rabda, {{seemingly}} already higher than {{the top of the}} bungalow. Gradually it became more and more indistinct.|$|R
60|$|Here by {{the statue}} {{we took our}} stand, and waited. Sir Henry and I close together, Umslopogaas some paces off in the darkness, so that I <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> his towering outline leaning on the outline of an axe.|$|R

60|$|Wyllard <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the schooner, {{which had}} {{apparently}} followed them, a blurr of dusky canvas against {{a bank of}} haze, and then, as the boat slid down into a hollow, {{there was nothing but}} the low-hung, lowering sky. It was evident to him that if they were to make a landing it must be done promptly.|$|E
60|$|By the aid {{of their}} sword-bayonets the Franc-tireurs soon pierced the wall, and lying at full length a yard apart, replied to the enemy's fire. Through the smoke they <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the upper line of the wall, and as the Prussians stood up to fire picked them off. Henri Vaucour crept along the line urging the men to fire slowly.|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} {{darkness}} {{appeared to be}} absolutely pitchy, but {{in a few minutes}} our eyes became so far accustomed to it that we <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> each other's presence--very dimly and vaguely, it is true. I could see nothing else in the room--only the black loom of the motionless figures. We were all taking the matter much more seriously than we had ever done before.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} the dam the fox stopped. Sparrer <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> him <b>out</b> {{through the}} tangled screen of brush. For a moment he stood motionless. It seemed to the boy like adding insult to injury. Then with a long graceful leap he landed on the snow of the swamp. A sudden hope caused Sparrer to instinctively tighten his grip on the rifle and catch his breath. Perhaps the fox would come his way! If he should, well, he would at least find a true Scout--he would be prepared.|$|R
60|$|He moved forward. A {{few steps}} {{took him to}} the doorway. The chamber before him was darker than the corridor, so that he <b>could</b> <b>just</b> indistinctly <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the objects in the room. He saw a {{sleeping}} dais near the center, with a darker blotch of something lying on the marble floor beside it. He moved a step farther into the doorway and the scabbard of his sword scraped against the stone frame. To his horror he saw the sleeping silks and furs upon the central dais move. He saw a figure slowly arising to a sitting posture from the death bed of O-Mai the Cruel. His knees shook, but he gathered all his moral forces, and gripping his sword more tightly in his trembling fingers prepared to leap across the chamber upon the horrid apparition. He hesitated just a moment. He felt eyes upon him--ghoulish eyes that bored through the darkness into his withering heart--eyes that he could not see. He gathered himself for the rush--and then there broke from the thing upon the couch an awful shriek, and O-Tar sank senseless to the floor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I went forrard {{and we both}} heard it, {{sometimes}} like a bairn {{crying and}} sometimes like a wench in pain. I've been seventeen years {{to the country and}} I never heard seal, old or young, make a sound like that. As we were standing there on the foc'sle-head the moon came out from behind a cloud, and we both saw a sort of white figure moving across the ice field in the same direction that we had heard the cries. We lost sight of it for a while, but it came back on the port bow, and we <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> it <b>out</b> like a shadow on the ice. I sent a hand aft for the rifles, and M'Leod and I went down on to the pack, thinking that maybe it might be a bear. When we got on the ice I lost sight of M'Leod, but I pushed on in the direction where I could still hear the cries. I followed them for a mile or maybe more, and then running round a hummock I came right on to the top of it standing and waiting for me seemingly. I don't know what it was. It wasn't a bear any way. It was tall and white and straight, and if it wasn't a man nor a woman, I'll stake my davy it was something worse.

I signed articles to do my duty by the ship, and on the ship I'll stay, but you don't catch me on the ice again after sundown." ...|$|R
60|$|The old gentleman, after a moment's hesitation, {{lifted the}} latch {{of the door}} {{somewhat}} nervously. I affected to take no notice of him, so breathless was the haste with which our immense business connection compelled me to finger the keyboard: but, {{looking up at him}} under my eyelashes, I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> he was a peculiarly bland and urbane old person, dressed with the greatest care, and some attention to fashion. His face was smooth; it tended towards portliness.|$|E
60|$|Shaken {{up by the}} {{changing}} moods of passion and tenderness, {{he must have been}} ready for any extravagance of conduct. Knowing the profound silence each night brought to that nook of the country, I could imagine them having the feeling of being the only two people on the wide earth. A row of six or seven lofty elms just across the road opposite the cottage made the night more obscure in that little garden. If these two <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> each other that was all.|$|E
60|$|They {{found the}} hollow under the cliff {{to be less}} than two yards deep and of about the same width. The rocks {{overhead}} hung down so that they touched Dave's head. In front was a small snowdrift, looking over which father and son <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the two bears, as they squatted on the ground between the firs. The beasts did considerable growling and did what they could {{to take care of their}} wounds, yet they showed no disposition to leave that vicinity.|$|E
60|$|As I anticipated, we {{had passed}} {{right through the}} precipice, and were now on the farther side, and {{immediately}} beneath its beetling face. The first thing I noticed was that the cliff is not nearly so high here, not so high I should say by five hundred feet, which proved that {{the bed of the}} lake, or rather of the vast ancient crater in which we stood, was much above the level of the surrounding plain. For the rest, we found ourselves in a huge rock-surrounded cup, not unlike that of the first place where we had sojourned, only ten times the size. Indeed, I <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the frowning line of the opposite cliffs. A great portion of the plain thus enclosed by nature was cultivated, and fenced in with walls of stone placed there to keep the cattle and goats, of which there were large herds about, from breaking into the gardens. Here and there rose great grass mounds, and some miles away towards the centre I thought that I could see the outline of colossal ruins. I had no time to observe anything more at the moment, for we were instantly surrounded by crowds of Amahagger, similar in every particular to those with whom we were already familiar, who, though they spoke little, pressed round us so closely as to obscure the view to a person lying in a hammock. Then all of a sudden a number of armed men arranged in companies, and marshalled by officers who held ivory wands in their hands, came running swiftly towards us, having, so far as I could <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> emerged {{from the face of the}} precipice like ants from their burrows. These men as well as their officers were all robed in addition to the usual leopard skin, and, as I gathered, formed the bodyguard of She herself.|$|R
6000|$|I {{had been}} sitting with him for an hour, perhaps--at any rate I {{know that it was}} getting so dark that I <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> his head lying like a gleam of gold upon the pillow we had extemporised out of a bag covered with a blanket--when {{suddenly}} Billali arrived with an air of great importance, and informed me that She herself had deigned to express a wish to see me--an honour, he added, accorded to but very few. I think that he was a little horrified at my cool way of taking the honour, but the fact was that I did not feel overwhelmed with gratitude at the prospect of seeing some savage, dusky queen, however absolute and mysterious she might be, more especially as my mind was full of dear Leo, for whose life I began to have great fears. However, I rose to follow him, and as I did so I caught sight of something bright lying on the floor, which I picked up. Perhaps the reader will remember that with the potsherd in the casket was a composition scarabæus marked with a round O, a goose, and another curious hieroglyphic, the meaning of which is [...] "Suten se Ra," [...] or [...] "Royal Son of the Sun." [...] The scarab, which is a very small one, Leo had insisted upon having set in a massive gold ring, such as is generally used for signets, and it was this very ring that I now picked up. He had pulled it off in the paroxysm of his fever, at least I suppose so, and flung it down upon the rock-floor. Thinking that if I left it about it might get lost, I slipped it on my own little finger, and then followed Billali, leaving Job and Ustane with Leo.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was on the}} bridge," [...] he said, [...] "about {{four bells}} in the middle watch, just when the night was at its darkest. There {{was a bit of}} a moon, but the clouds were blowing across it so that you couldn't see far from the ship. John M'Leod, the harpooner, came aft from the fo'c'sle-head and {{reported}} a strange noise on the starboard bow. I went forrard and we both heard it, sometimes like a bairn crying and sometimes like a wench in pain. I've been seventeen years to the country and I never heard seal, old or young, make a sound like that.

6000|$|Rangers or a posse of ranchers {{in pursuit}} of a fugitive! The {{knowledge}} gave Duane a strange thrill. Certainly they could not have been hunting him. But the feeling their proximity gave him was identical to what it would have been had he been this particular hunted man. He held his breath; he clenched his teeth; he pressed a quieting hand upon his horse. Suddenly he became aware that these horsemen had halted. They were whispering. He <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> a dark group closely massed. What had made them halt so suspiciously? ...|$|E
60|$|An hour elapsed {{before any}} {{movement}} was visible. Then Francis {{heard the sound}} of footsteps, and <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the figures of persons descending the steps and entering the gondola. Then the boat moved out {{into the middle of the}} canal, where a few boats were still passing to and fro. Francis kept his gondola close by the bank, so as to be in the deep shade of the houses. The boat they were following again passed under the Ponto Maggiore, and for some distance followed the line of the Grand Canal.|$|E
6000|$|Midway up I {{checked and}} looked back across the wide water. The light had grown quite strong by now, and in the east there was a faint pink flush to herald the {{approaching}} sun. Away beyond the river, moving southward, I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the Legate's little cavalcade. And then, for the first time, a question leapt in my mind concerning the litter whose leathern curtains had remained so closely drawn. Whom did it contain? Could it be Giuliana? Had Cosimo spoken the truth {{when he said that}} she had gone to Gambara for shelter? ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was getting}} towards dawn, {{but the night}} was still dark. Looking up, Augusta <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the {{outlines}} of the huge bellying sails, for the Kangaroo was rushing along before the westerly wind under a full head of steam, and with every inch of her canvas set to ease the screw. There was something very exhilarating about the movement, the freshness of the night, and the wild, sweet song of the wind as it sang amongst the rigging. Augusta turned her face toward it, and, being alone, stretched out her arms as though to catch it. The whole scene awoke some answering greatness in her heart; something that slumbers in the bosom of the higher race of human beings, and only stirs--and then but faintly--when the passions move them, or when nature communes with her nobler children. She felt that at that moment she could write as she had never written yet. All sorts of beautiful ideas, all sorts of aspirations after that noble calm, and purity of thought and life for which we pray and long, but are not allowed to reach, came flowing into her heart. She almost thought that she could hear her lost Jeannie's voice calling down the gale, and her strong imagination began to paint her hovering like a sea-bird upon white wings high above the mainmast's taper point, and gazing through the darkness into the soul of her she loved. Then, by those faint and imperceptible degrees with which thoughts fade one into another, from Jeannie her thought got round to Eustace Meeson. She wondered if he had ever called at the lodgings at Birmingham after she left? Somehow, she had an idea that he was not altogether indifferent to her; there had been a look in his eyes she did not quite understand. She almost wished now she had sent him a line or a message. Perhaps she would do so from New Zealand. Just then her meditations were interrupted by a step, and, turning round, she found herself {{face to face with the}} captain.|$|R

60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} I was {{crouched}} in some thick underbrush looking {{up into a}} great spruce, when I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the leader standing by an upright branch in sharp silhouette against the glowing west. I had followed his swift flight, and now lay listening again to his searching call as it went out through the twilight, calling his little flock to the roosting tree. From the swamp and the hillside and far down by the quiet lake they answered, faintly at first, then with clearer call and the whirr of swift wings as they came in.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{week after}} Mr. Kybird's visit to the alley that he went, as usual, for a stroll {{up and down the}} High Street. The evening was deepening, and some of the shops had already lit up, as Mr. Silk, with his face against the window-pane, tried in vain to {{penetrate}} the obscurity of Mr. Kybird's shop. He <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> a dim figure behind the counter, which he believed to be Amelia, when a match was struck and a gas jet threw a sudden light in the shop and revealed Mr. Jack Nugent standing behind the counter with his hand on the lady's shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had already}} ascertained that {{the front door}} was locked and bolted, and that he must {{therefore}} enter through the kitchen. They heard the horse stop in front, a moment later the gate was opened, and through the window they <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the figure of a man leading a horse; then the stable door opened, and they heard a movement, and knew that the horse was being unsaddled; they heard it walk into the stable, the door was shut behind it, and a step approached the back door. It was opened, and a voice said with an oath, [...] "The old fool has forgotten to leave a candle burning;" [...] then he stepped into the kitchen.|$|E

50|$|Another {{advantage}} to a fictional brand {{is that all}} its specifications can be invented. In this sense, an author can invent a model or brand of car, for which he can make up details. That way, he doesn't have to go look up specifications on a car, which would take time and effort- he <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> them up.|$|R
60|$|At a nimbler trot, as if {{the shovel}} over his {{shoulder}} stimulated him by reviving old associations, Mr Boffin ascended the 'serpentining walk', up the Mound which he had described to Silas Wegg {{on the occasion of}} their beginning to decline and fall. On striking into it he turned his lantern off. The two followed him, stooping low, so that their figures might make no mark in relief against the sky when he should turn his lantern on again. Mr Venus took the lead, towing Mr Wegg, in order that his refractory leg might be promptly extricated from any pitfalls it should dig for itself. They <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> that the Golden Dustman stopped to breathe. Of course they stopped too, instantly.|$|E
60|$|At this Charley cast off, and Yellow Handkerchief sent {{one of his}} men {{forward to}} haul in the line. In the {{gathering}} darkness I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the mouth of San Rafael Creek, {{and by the time}} we entered it I could barely see its banks. The Reindeer was fully five minutes astern, and we continued to leave her astern as we beat up the narrow, winding channel. With Charley behind us, it seemed I had little to fear from my five prisoners; but the darkness prevented my keeping a sharp eye on them, so I transferred my revolver from my trousers pocket to the side pocket of my coat, where I could more quickly put my hand on it.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{sufficiently}} embarrassing situation. I {{put on a}} bold front, however, and not deigning to answer, pushed past him and walked with as much leisure as possible along the banquette in the direction which Nick had taken. As I turned the corner I glanced over my shoulder, and in the darkness I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the man standing where I had left him. In great uneasiness I pursued my way, my imagination summing up for Nick all kinds of adventures with disagreeable consequences. I walked for some time--it may have been half an hour--aimlessly, and finally {{decided it would be}} best to go back to Madame Bouvet's and await the issue with as much calmness as possible. He might not, after all, have caught the fellow.|$|E
5000|$|Although their {{previous}} self-titled effort featured dark themes and aggressive musicianship, Dogman was considerably heavier than previous albums and marked a transition in the band's sound.
