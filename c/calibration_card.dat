40|$|The need {{to control}} the power grid in real time has opened a new field of research, today {{researchers}} are trying to design electrical meters that are completely remote controlled, to create an advanced metering infrastructure. One {{of the most important}} processes in the field of measurement is the calibration of measuring instruments. The calibration process of the electrical meters was performed at laboratories. However, the new directives, now, require a regular test of accuracy. Nevertheless, moving each time on site to check the accuracy of a meter can be annoying. To solve this problem our contribution is to propose a new structure of a smart meter that integrates a <b>calibration</b> <b>card,</b> so that, this process is carried out remotely. To be able to calibrate the meter or test its accuracy, we have included an AC-AC converter powered by the electrical grid and that provides a stable voltage independent of the electrical grid in term of frequency and amplitude. The output voltage of the converter is used as the reference signal during calibration or accuracy testing. In this paper, we will present the structure of the <b>calibration</b> <b>card,</b> the study and dimensioning of the converter, as well as the control technique used to eliminate variations of the input voltage. At the end, we will present the results of simulations and experiments...|$|E
40|$|Anaemia is a {{major health}} burden worldwide. Although the finding of conjunctival pallor on {{clinical}} examination is associated with anaemia, inter-observer variability is high, and definitive diagnosis of anaemia requires a blood sample. We aimed to detect anaemia by quantifying conjunctival pallor using digital photographs taken with a consumer camera and a popular smartphone. Our goal {{was to develop a}} non-invasive screening test for anaemia. The conjunctivae of haemato-oncology in- and outpatients were photographed in ambient lighting using a digital camera (Panasonic DMC-LX 5), and the internal rear-facing camera of a smartphone (Apple iPhone 5 S) alongside an in-frame <b>calibration</b> <b>card.</b> Following image calibration, conjunctival erythema index (EI) was calculated and correlated with laboratory-measured haemoglobin concentration. Three clinicians independently evaluated each image for conjunctival pallor. Conjunctival EI was reproducible between images (average coefficient of variation 2. 96 %). EI of the palpebral conjunctiva correlated more strongly with haemoglobin concentration than that of the forniceal conjunctiva. Using the compact camera, palpebral conjunctival EI had a sensitivity of 93 % and 57 % and specificity of 78 % and 83 % for detection of anaemia (haemoglobin < 110 g/L) in training and internal validation sets, respectively. Similar results were found using the iPhone camera, though the EI cut-off value differed. Conjunctival EI analysis compared favourably with clinician assessment, with a higher positive likelihood ratio for prediction of anaemia. Erythema index of the palpebral conjunctiva calculated from images taken with a compact camera or mobile phone correlates with haemoglobin and compares favourably to clinician assessment for prediction of anaemia. If confirmed in further series, this technique may be useful for the non-invasive screening for anaemia...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of tests of 12880 Very Front End (VFE) readout cards for {{the barrel of the}} CMS {{electromagnetic}} calorimeter. A thorough test sequence was applied to each card including power-on test, burn-in and final <b>calibration.</b> <b>Cards</b> failing the tests were at the few per mille level. The results prove the very high quality of the VFE cards...|$|R

The first on board recording devices is analogue tachograph which obligatory to using to introduce in USA in 1939. This paper includes main rules of function of analogue tachograph and digital tachographs system using in road transport in European Union. According to new Commission Regulation (EC) No 1360 / 2002 of 13 June 2002 we present elements of an inspection system for recording data and identification of the system users. The tachograph’s <b>cards,</b> <b>calibration</b> of digital tachograph, running of authorized workshops and the requirements for authorized workshops, had been specified.

40|$|Fibre Bragg Grating based {{strain sensing}} systems have found {{important}} applications in structural health monitoring of civil infrastructures such as bridges, tunnels and buildings. In my thesis research I systematically investigated on various {{factors that affect}} the short-term and long-term performance of fibre Bragg grating strain sensing systems using the Fibre Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FFPI) Tunable Filter (TF) as interrogator. A number of issues concerning the short-term system performance, such as system tuning frequency, signal spectral position shift, electrical nonlinear effect of TF, noise and algorithm efficiency, are identified and investigated. A number of other issues concerning the long-term system performance, such as thermal and electrical polarization effects of TF, and data acquisition (DAQ) <b>card</b> <b>calibration,</b> are identified and investigated as well. Based on the investigation on these factors, related techniques {{have been developed to}} minimise the effects of these factors and enhance system performance. Several techniques are developed to improve the short-term system performance. To eliminate signal position shift and increase system tuning frequency on the short-term performance, a parallelly synchronised operation mode of DAQ card and CPU is proposed. Compared with the traditional serial mode, the parallel mode is more efficient and stable. The electrical nonlinearity of TF is compensated using a correction curve obtained from DC-AC test which determines the TF electrical response. The system induced noise are suppressed by a carefully designed FIR low pass filter which makes fully use of CPU signal processing capability and does not affect system tuning frequency. In order to achieve the best system performance, a proper algorithm to determine the FBG wavelength shift from data points has been selected and optimised. Several techniques are developed to improve the long-term system performance. To suppress the thermal effect of TF on the long-term performance, the relationship between signal wavelength shift and temperature of TF is investigated and determined experimentally. Also the polarisation effect of TF on system performance is tested and a specific duration is required to ensure the polarisation of TF saturated and its effect on system performance minimised...|$|R
