40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{regulations}} on the advertisement of medications aim {{to encourage and}} promote an improved {{health care and the}} rational use of medications. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the influence of three {{regulations on}} the advertisement of medications: the "Export act", published in the United States in 1986; the "WHO's Criteria", published in 1988, and the Resolution 102 / 2000 of the Collegiate Board of Directors of the ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária- Brazilian Sanitary Surveillance Agency), on the advertisement of psychoactive medications. METHOD: We collected advertisements that were published in Brazilian psychiatric journals before and after the regulations were established. The <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> were analyzed according to a program created based on the regulation's demands. RESULTS: In the 118 analyzed issues there were 199 different advertisements on 85 psychotropic drugs. We observed that, regardless the studied medication, the information about restrictions of use, such as adverse drug reactions, interactions, contraindications, warnings and precautions, does not appear very often, and when it does, its print sizes were smaller than that of the information favoring the use, such as indication, presentation and dosage. After the publication of the regulations, only 38. 2 % of the advertisements had all the essential technical information, and 35. 3 % were irregular in some way. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that there was very little influence of the regulations on the advertisement of psychotropic drugs in Brazil. Consequently, other control measures are necessary in addition to the regulations...|$|E

Because mobile advertisements are not controlled by <b>the</b> <b>content</b> rating <b>of</b> apps, unexpected objectionable contents may occur and be harmful to children’s mental health. This study {{is the first to}} explore <b>the</b> <b>content</b> appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-app <b>advertisements</b> on mobile devices from children’s online safety perspective. We find in-app advertisements are common in the free apps designed for children on smart platforms.

My research on <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> arousing <b>advertisements</b> attempts to add clarity to <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> if and why attack advertisements affect memory to a greater degree than non-attacks advertisements.

In the first two decades, <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> were sober and to the point, and included the trademark, company name, molecular formula and therapeutic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medication. The emphasis was on creating a scientific image of reliable symptom control for the therapeutic drug. In doing so, the ethical drug companies tried (successfully) to distinguish themselves from <b>the</b> producers <b>of</b> patent medicines. Once scientific credibility was established, <b>the</b> form and <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> changed significantly. In the late 1920 s and 1930 s drug companies embraced modern advertising techniques, developing a figurative language to address the changing beliefs and practices of Dutch physicians. Instead of promoting therapeutic drugs as safe and scientific, the emphasis was on their effectiveness in comparison to similar drugs. In the process, scientific information was reduced to an indispensable standardized minimum, whereby therapeutic drugs were advertised according to the latest pharmacological taxonomy rather than molecular formulas. <b>The</b> image-making <b>of</b> ‘ethical marketing’ began during the interwar years when marketers applied modern advertising techniques and infotainment strategies. The scanty black and white informational bulletins transitioned into colourful <b>advertisements.</b> <b>The</b> pharmaceutical companies employed the same medical language as used by physicians, so that one word or image in an advertisement would suffice for the physician to recognize a drug and its therapeutic properties. These developments show the changing relationship between the modern ethical pharmaceutical industry and Dutch doctors during the interwar years – from rapprochement towards concerted action. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> {{social context}} in advertisement responses, specifically focusing {{on how the}} interaction between the social identities to which a person ascribes influence {{the manner in which they}} respond to <b>advertisements.</b> <b>The</b> first essay explores how social context and social identity influence perceptions of an advertisement's authenticity. A multi-method, four-study inquiry into perceptions of advertising authenticity combining depth interview, survey, and experimental techniques finds consumer perceptions of authenticity play a key role in attitudes toward advertisements. Findings show consumers naturally assess ads in terms of authenticity and that these perceptions are entwined with self-referencing. In addition, other-referencing is shown to also be linked to authenticity perceptions and ad liking. Finally, a boundary condition on the relationship between authenticity perceptions, self-referencing, and ad liking is discussed, where consumers' reflected appraisals of how they think others will view an <b>advertisement</b> moderates <b>the</b> relationship between self-referencing and attitude towards the ad. The second essay explores, using three experiments, the relationship between reflected appraisals, self-referencing, and ad liking in more detail. Specifically, this essay determines the conditions under which negative reflected appraisals do and not decrease attitude towards the ad. First, this essay shows that when identity and self-referencing are primed, consumers resist negative appraisals about an identity congruent advertisement such that negative appraisals do not decrease ad attitudes. This effect however, does not hold when the target market for an advertisement is external to the social identity and negative appraisals are attributed to out-group members. Here, consumers pay attention to the negative appraisals and decease their attitude toward the ad. This effect, referred to as the dirty laundry effect, occurs because consumers conceptualize identity congruent advertisements as a type of self-presentation. Thus, instead of engaging in defensive behaviors in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> negative appraisals, consumers become concerned with how they think other people will view them based on <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advertisement...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} <b>the</b> configurations <b>of</b> mobile <b>advertisement</b> components {{that lead to}} high performance in terms of commonly used digital marketing metrics. <b>The</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>advertisement</b> is measured by click-through-rate (CTR) and cost-per-click (eCPC) -values. The case company is a global dairy supplier called Dairy Foods. The data is gathered from the company's mobile campaign reports conducted by a third party - the company's media agency Digi Media. The data comprises only advertisements that are produced and displayed in Finnish markets. <b>The</b> academic research <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> mobile marketing has been accumulating rapidly in recent years. However the main {{focus has been on}} examining consumer attitudes and acceptance towards mobile marketing, and there is an obvious lack <b>of</b> studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobile advertising campaigns. Thus, this thesis focuses on exploring the factors that have found to have an effect on consumer attitudes towards mobile advertising and examine if these factors have an influence on <b>the</b> measurable outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advertisements.</b> <b>The</b> objectives <b>of</b> this research are both managerial and methodological. A novel research approach called fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is applied in this study as an approach and a methodology (Ragin, 2000; Rihoux & Ragin, 2009). Most marketing research is focusing on measuring linear causality, even though marketing performance is rarely resulting because of a single factor. Instead, commonly marketing performance is an outcome of multiple different factors occurring simultaneously. The QCA technique enables to uncover different configurations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selected conditions that lead to high or low performance outcomes - this can yield managerially relevant information that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to interpret. Hence, <b>the</b> secondary aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study is to illustrate <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> configurational analysis in studying <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> digital advertising. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this thesis suggest that there cannot be found a direct and simple answer to the research question. The most important contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study is that there can be found several factors explaining <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>advertisement.</b> <b>Content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advertisement</b> seems to be <b>the</b> main determinant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advertisement.</b> Different combinations <b>of</b> advertisement components work better with different products - the main reason behind this might be <b>the</b> target audience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advertised products and the differing behavior in mobile environment. Also, the study reaffirms <b>the</b> suitability <b>of</b> fsQCA in marketing research...|$|R

40|$|In <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{increased}} attention for organizational values and person-organization fit within the recruitment process, we investigate whether organizations utilize value-related {{information in a}} strategic way when communicating to prospective applicants. We analyzed <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> 1768 job <b>advertisements</b> published in two national and two regional Dutch speaking magazines in Belgium. Four independent judges coded all information in the offer section and categorized it into five content categories adopted from Lyons, Duxbury, and Higgins (2006). Since important sectoral distinctions exist in terms of structural-operational as well as value-related characteristics, this study examines how profit and nonprofit organizations portray themselves in <b>the</b> job <b>advertisements</b> they send out. We conclude that, in terms of extrinsic and intrinsic values, <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> job <b>advertisements</b> is not in line with earlier findings on sectoral difference. Nonetheless, the results on the interpersonal, altruistic, and prestige value do correspond to our expectations. Consequently, only part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> information provided in <b>the</b> earliest phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recruitment process reflects the organizational reality and the values and preferences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current employees. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|To our recollection, a {{theoretical}} gap in previous priming research, especially within contextual priming, {{is the failure}} to include fluency as the explaining mechanism behind priming effects. This is a limitation, as fluency theory predicts different effects of priming on elaboration and argument sensitivity, than what has been proposed by e. g. Samuelsen (2004). Moreover, to our knowledge, prior studies have not compared effects of different priming methods. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this study was therefore two-folded: First, we aimed to include fluency theory as the explanation behind priming effects, and see how priming influenced elaboration and advertisement attitude. Second, we {{tried to make a}} methodological contribution, by comparing contextual (editorial) priming and sentence scrambling. A study extending Samuelsen’s (2004) dissertation was therefore conducted. Using the ostensibly unrelated procedure, participants where either primed with an editorial or a sentence scrambling task, making a functional or experiential concept salient. This was done to manipulate level of congruence, resulting from the match between <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prime and <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advertisement.</b> They were then exposed to one of two versions of a functional advertisement for a fictitious shampoo brand, consisting of either strong or weak arguments, and asked to give cognitive responses and attitudes towards <b>the</b> <b>advertisement.</b> Five hypotheses where then tested. Although these were not statistically supported, the findings have important theoretical and practical implications. The most remarkable was that fluency theory only seems applicable for contextual priming, as participants in both the congruent and incongruent conditions were insensitive to the argument quality manipulation. This is likely <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task only requiring a low level of task involvement. For sentence scrambling participants, however, fluency theory is discarded. Here, level of congruence affected elaboration. Participants in the congruent conditions were more likely to elaborate, and as a consequence, they were more sensitive to argument quality manipulations. This resulted in less fortunate advertisement attitudes if weak arguments compared to if strong arguments. This enhanced argument quality sensitivity is probably due to higher task involvement. This finding was in line with Samuelsen’s (2004) reasoning, which is based on <b>the</b> multiple roles <b>of</b> persuasion variables postulate in the ELM: Congruence is likely to facilitate elaboration, as the primed content is both more accessible and applicable to the target - two prerequisites necessary for the priming effect to occur...|$|R
40|$|In {{contemporary}} western society, {{digital and}} social media and advertising are everywhere, making information circulating at <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> light. Although <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> messages is enormous, the ideals –especially regarding beauty- represented within these messages are often very homogeneous and limiting (e. g. regarding skin colour, sexuality, weight, etcetera). Within advertising campaigns, a company not only promotes its products, it also constructs a brand and company identity, and often {{contributes to a}} well-accepted norm within society (Killbourne, 2010). In February 2014, Veet launched the Don’t Risk Dudeness campaign, a collection <b>of</b> <b>advertisements</b> that promoted <b>the</b> brand’s wax strips. <b>The</b> message <b>of</b> these <b>advertisements</b> was downright simple: having <b>the</b> tiniest feel <b>of</b> stubble makes a woman feel and look like a man. The norm that these advertisements underline {{is that it is}} socially acceptable for men to have body hair, but not for women. Or, in other words, the Don’t Risk Dudeness campaign, along with other advertisements and media output, help to construct a specific part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contemporary female gender identity; namely in order to be feminine a hairless body is the norm. Moreover, the message implies that women should feel ashamed and guilty when they fail to achieve this hairless beauty standard (Burke, 2012; Killbourne, 2010; Lesnik-Oberstein, 2006). This article aims to analyse the Don’t Risk Dudeness advertisements of Veet in all of its aspects. Using a textual analysis, embedded with the cultural studies tradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active audience paradigm, <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advertisements</b> is studied, along with <b>the</b> reactions <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> online YouTube audience and the marketing team behind the campaign. A brief historical overview of hair removal shows that in other western and non-western, ancient yet also contemporary contexts <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> hair removal is applied to both genders. However, the body hair removal that is talked about in Veet’s case, is only applied to one gender – feminine- and therefore, {{there is no longer a}} matter of distinction between two or more classes: it is a way of policing women’s bodies. Therefore we argue that “research into women’s personal grooming habits is, in many ways <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> inequality – particularly <b>the</b> internalisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notion that a women’s body is imperfect unless it is somehow modified” (Burke, 2012). status: publishe...|$|R
