5|$|Sharon {{planned for}} Raviv's brigade to {{attack from the}} east, {{diverting}} Egyptian attention away from Deversoir. Erez was tasked with transporting a pre-constructed roller bridge to the <b>crossing</b> <b>area</b> at Deversoir, while one of his tank battalions would {{be attached to the}} paratroopers. Colonel Reshef was given the most critical tasks of all. Accordingly, his brigade was heavily reinforced to incorporate four armored and three mechanized infantry battalions, in addition to the division's reconnaissance battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Yaov Brom. His brigade would conduct a turning maneuver at 6:00 AM on October 15 south of Akavish Road, move through the sand dunes to reach Fort Lakekan, before heading north to occupy Fort Matzmed. Reshef's brigade would then split up to clear the Akavish and Titur Roads and seize the Chinese Farm, while occupying the <b>crossing</b> <b>area</b> and awaiting Matt's brigade. Matt's paratrooper brigade, containing an additional tank company and the armored battalion, would move south-west via Akavish to reach Fort Matzmed. From there, it would continue on to the Yard and cross the canal at 11:00 PM, using rubber dinghies and rafts for the tanks.|$|E
500|$|Matt {{had been}} {{informed}} that the <b>crossing</b> <b>area</b> and its environs were clear of Egyptian forces, but out of caution, ordered his tank company to deploy at the Lexicon-Tirtur junction to confront any Egyptian movements towards the crossing site, just [...] south of the crossroads. The entire company was wiped out after it was ambushed by Egyptian infantry of the 16th Brigade. The company commander was killed {{and most of his}} men were casualties, unbeknownst to Matt. Meanwhile, Israeli artillery batteries opened fire on the landing site on the west bank, delivering around 70 tons of shells and ordnance. In fact, the opposite bank was completely clear of Egyptian troops. The crossing finally got underway at 1:35 AM, over five hours behind schedule. By 9:00 AM, 2,000 paratroopers had crossed, along with a battalion of thirty tanks. The Israelis sent raiding parties attacking Egyptian SAMs on the west bank, while securing a [...] without facing resistance.|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} advance, a beach {{maintenance}} area was prepared at a beach {{at the mouth}} of the Kalueng River, which involved removing underwater and landward obstacles. So that the tanks and jeeps could immediately support the advance, a bridge was required over the Kalueng River. A preliminary operation by the 22nd Infantry Battalion on 3 December 1943 secured a <b>crossing</b> <b>area</b> and a log bridge was constructed. The operation jumped off on 5 December, with the 29th/46th Infantry Battalion passing through the bridgehead established by the 22nd. It soon came under sporadic enemy fire, and a tank was disabled by a land mine. In the face of mounting opposition, the advance was halted near the lagoon. It resumed the next day, and the Japanese withdrew after an artillery bombardment, their orders being [...] "while avoiding any decisive engagement" [...] to [...] "carry out successful resistance to try to delay the enemy advance". This became the pattern, with the Japanese preferring to withdraw rather than suffer heavy casualties. On 10 December, Edgar brought all three of his battalions into the line and by 14 December they were closing in on Lakona, a key position on the 20th Division's retreat route.|$|E
50|$|There are 28 {{areas in}} the Irish Red Cross (The Red Cross in Northern Ireland {{is part of the}} British Red <b>Cross).</b> <b>Areas</b> are {{normally}} divided up to match county borders i.e. the Clare Red <b>Cross</b> <b>area</b> has the same geographical bounders as county Clare itself. In this way the Red Cross differs from other organisations like the Civil Defence which is divided according to local council areas.

Lang, {{consisting}} of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, 2/6th Field Company, and detachments from the 7th Division Signals, 2/5th Field Ambulance and ANGAU, with 760 native carriers, set out from Tsili Tsili on 2 September. Most of the force moved overland, reaching Kirkland's Crossing on 4 September, where it rendezvoused with B Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion. That night, a party of engineers and pioneers set out from Tsili Tsili in 20 small craft, sailed and paddled down the Watut and Markham Rivers to join Lang's force at Kirkland's Crossing. The small river-borne task force included 10 British 5-ton folding assault boats and Hoehn military folboats. which met up with 2/6 Independent Commandos who had reconnoitered the proposed <b>crossing</b> <b>area</b> with 8 of these folboats the day before. While neither river was deep, both were fast flowing, with shoals and hidden s. Three boats were lost with their equipment and one man drowned. On the morning of 5 September, Lang's force was treated {{to the sight of}} the air force passing overhead. At this point, the Markham River formed three arms, separated by broad sand bars. Two were fordable but the other was deep and flowing at [...] Using the folding boats and local timber, they constructed a pontoon bridge, allowing the whole force to cross the river safely with all their equipment. That evening, they reached the Americans' position.|$|E

40|$|Color Doppler {{methodology}} {{to assess}} the vessel blood flow rate {{is based on the}} time averaged velocity of the blood measured in the longitudinal plane and the <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area</b> measurement taken either in the longitudinal plane, by assuming circular <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area,</b> or in the transversal plane. The measurement option in longitudinal plane {{is based on the assumption}} of circular <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area,</b> while the transversal one needs to evaluate both time-averaged velocity and <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area</b> in the same vessel point. A precise and validated assessment methodology is still lacking. Four healthy volunteers underwent internal jugular vein colour Doppler scanning. The <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area</b> was assessed by means of B-mode imaging in the transversal plane all along the vessel cervical course. During this assessment, <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area,</b> major and minor axis of the vessel were measured and recorded. The distance between the internal jugular vein wall and the skin surface were measured together with the intra-luminal diameter and statistically correlated with the <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area</b> data. The internal jugular vein <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area</b> measured on the transversal plane were significantly different from the <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area</b> calculated using the assumption of circular shape. The intra-luminal distance showed high correlation with the measured <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area.</b> The proper anatomical point in the <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area</b> transversal measurement can be identified by using the internal jugular vein intra-luminal distance as landmark...|$|R

Number of nuts to trunk <b>cross</b> sectional <b>area</b> and number of nuts to scaffold <b>cross</b> <b>area</b> were 1. 68 (nuts/cm 2) and 19. 43 (nuts/m 2), respectively.
