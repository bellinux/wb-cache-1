40|$|Cold {{cracking}} is {{a potentially}} <b>catastrophic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in direct chill (DC) casting of 7 xxx series aluminum alloys {{that leads to}} safety hazards and loss of production. The relatively low thermal conductivity and wide solidification temperature range in these alloys results in accumulation of residual thermal stress under nonuniform cooling conditions of the billets. In addition, such alloys show a severe loss in ductility below a critical temperature of 573 K (300 C). This brit-tleness along with high stress concentration at the tips of voids and microcracks can lead to catastrophic failure. Casting process parameters affect the magnitude and distribution of stresses in the billet and increase the susceptibility of the material to cold cracking. In order to investi-gate the effect of casting process parameters such as casting speed, billet size, and water flow rate, thermomechanical simulations were applied using ALSIM 5 casting simulation software. Among the studied casting process parameters, the increased billet size and high casting speed resulted in the most dramatic increase in residual stress level. Critical crack sizes that led to catastrophic failure were also calculated and are reported against process parameters...|$|R

30|$|In addition, if CNT {{emitters}} are operated at a {{high voltage}} or {{at a high}} electric field, electrical arcing (or vacuum breakdown) can occur. Arcing can be initiated by the removed CNTs[17], impurities on the CNTs or substrates[18, 19], protrusion of CNTs[10], low operating vacuum[10], and a very high electric field[20 – 23]. Since arcing is accompanied with a very high current flow and it can produce a plasma channel near the emitter, CNTs are seriously damaged or sometimes CNTs are almost completely removed from the substrate by the arcing events[17, 20]. Detachment of CNTs from a substrate is an irreversible <b>catastrophic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> for a device operation[14]. In addition to the detachment of CNTs, arcing induces a sudden voltage drop, and thus, device operation is stopped. Therefore, for a stable operation of a device using CNT emitters, arcing should be prevented. Particularly, CNT emitters on small metal tips (diameter < 1 mm) are necessary for miniature X-ray tubes[1 – 4] and micro-focus X-ray tubes[6, 7]. Small metal tips produce much higher electric field than flat substrates at the same applied voltage due to their sharp geometry. As a consequence, CNT emitters on small metal tips can suffer from much serious and frequent arcing, and hence, stable operation of the CNT emitters against arcing is a big issue[4, 14].|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Recently, {{there is}} {{tremendous}} {{interest in the}} research of two-stage switches. Unlike input-buffered switches, two-stage switches {{do not need to}} find matchings between inputs and outputs. As such, they are much easier to scale and much simpler to implement. However, twostage switches usually suffer from the out-of-sequence problem. Though there are several methods proposed in the literature to solve such a problem, these proposed methods require either complex scheduling or additional hardware, which defeats the purpose of design simplicity. To design a simple and high performance switch using the two-stage architecture, we address three buffer design problems in this paper: re-sequencing buffers, central buffers and input buffers. We show that the size of the re-sequencing buffer needs to be proportional {{to the size of the}} central buffer to ensure that no packets are lost due to re-sequencing. Via simulations, we find that a moderate size of central buffer yields good throughput when traffic is not bursty. However, when the traffic is bursty, one needs to address the head-of-line blocking (HOL) problem at the input. We also find that using the round-robin service policy for multiple virtual output queues (VOQ) at inputs may exhibit a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> called a non-ergodic mode. When a switch is trapped in a nonergodic mode, its throughput is sharply reduced. To solve such a problem in input buffers, we show that one may introduce “randomness ” into a switch to jump out of a non-ergodic mode...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDielectric {{breakdown}} {{constitutes an}} important limitation {{in the use}} of insulating materials under high-voltage since it can lead to the local fusion and sublimation of the insulator. The role of electrical charge transport and trapping in alumina ceramics on their resistance to this <b>catastrophic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is studied in this work. In polycrystalline materials, the interfaces between the various phases play a main role because they constitute potential sites for the trapping of electrical charges. The density and the nature of these interfaces can be controlled by the way of the microstructure parameters. So, the aim of the present paper is to highlight the influence of average grain size and intergranular phase crystallization rate on the ability of polycrystalline alumina materials to resist to dielectric breakdown. Thus, it is shown that the control of the process conditions (sintering aids content, powder grain size and thermal cycle) makes it possible to change not only the density (by the average grain size) but also the nature (by the crystallization or not of anorthite) of the grain boundaries. On one hand, at room temperature a high density of interfaces, due to low grain size and highly crystallized intergranular phase, leads to a high dielectric strength. On the other hand, at higher temperature (250 degrees C), the presence of vitreous intergranular phase makes it possible to delay breakdown. That behaviour is explained thanks to charge transport and trapping characterizations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved...|$|R
