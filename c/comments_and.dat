5|$|Australia's manager Frank Farina criticised the {{qualification}} {{format and}} questioned {{the need for}} these kind of matches. Archie Thompson, who scored a record-setting 13 goals, was delighted with his record, but he also agreed with Farina's comments. FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper agreed with both <b>comments</b> <b>and</b> suggested {{a change in the}} qualification format, with the smaller teams entering a preliminary round. However, Oceania Football Confederation chairman Basil Scarsella, opposed both <b>comments</b> <b>and</b> claimed that the smaller teams have the right to face Australia and New Zealand, similar to Australia having the rights to face stronger opponents such as Brazil and France.|$|E

5|$|After US President Richard Nixon {{made his}} famous 1972 visit to China, {{a wave of}} exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a {{delegation}} of the American Institute of Architects in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive <b>comments,</b> <b>and</b> a series of lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Leigh and Laurence Olivier {{performed}} {{two plays}} about Cleopatra, William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra and George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a {{season at the}} Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his <b>comments</b> <b>and</b> ignored the positive reviews of other critics.|$|E
5|$|In October 1995, Sirivudh {{talked about}} his desire to assassinate Hun Sen during an {{interview}} with So Naro, who was the secretary-general of the Khmer Journalists Association. A few days later Ung Phan, a FUNCINPEC minister who had close ties with Hun Sen, called Sirivudh and accused him of getting involved in receiving kickbacks for printing Cambodian passports. Sirivudh angrily denied the accusations and threatened to kill Hun Sen over the phone. The phone conversation was recorded, and Ung Phan passed the recorded phone conversation to CPP co-minister of the interior Sar Kheng. Hun Sen learnt of the conversation and became enraged at Sirivudh's <b>comments,</b> <b>and</b> pressured Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC ministers to strip his parliamentary immunity {{so that he could}} be arrested. Sirivudh was arrested and briefly placed in detention, but subsequently exiled to France when Sihanouk intervened in the case.|$|E

40|$|The {{line between}} <b>comment</b> <b>and</b> opinion is {{increasingly}} becoming blurred in newspapers. Some critics {{are concerned that}} the public cannot distinguish between <b>comment</b> <b>and</b> reporting. <b>Comment</b> may even be pushing out space traditionally reserved for news, for example, in reporting on Parliament. The correction of errors of fact in opinion pieces needs addressing. Measures are needed to improve the standard of <b>comment</b> <b>and</b> to disentangle it from factual reporting. More diversity of opinion and the use of outside authorities and experts to provide it is one suggestion. A greater emphasis on fact-checking would help. Improved public literacy about the media and education via the school system to teach people how to read and interpret the media are other suggestions...|$|R
