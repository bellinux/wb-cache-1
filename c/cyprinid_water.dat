40|$|RIVM {{recommends}} a standard maximum temperature for the Good Ecological Status for Dutch rivers of 25 degrees C. For springtime a lower maximum temperature is recommended, viz. 20 degrees C, to ensure reproduction {{and growth of}} plants and animals. The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires member states to bring or keep their natural waters in Good Ecological Status (GES), being the status required in terms {{of plant and animal}} species. The biological standards for the GES have already been determined. In addition, standards for supporting physico-chemical parameters have to be derived, including for temperature. A standard for temperature in the Dutch large rivers was not determined yet. The maximum temperature recommended here is lower than the current standard of 28 degrees C, which {{does not take into account}} the demands of the WFD. The current advice is based on literature and measurement data for benthic invertebrate fauna and fish. This data was used to calculate the boundary between Good and Moderate Ecological Status. The WFD also distinguishes protected areas with specific demands. Surface water used for drinking water production should not be warmer than 25 degrees C. RIVM recommends that the maximum temperature increase of 3 degrees C for <b>cyprinid</b> <b>waters</b> and 1. 5 degreees C for salmonid waters, which stems from the Fish Water Directive, remains in use, but further investigation of the maximum increase in temperature is recommended. Other research recommendations were identified. The maximum temperature standard recommended here, applies to the GES for natural waters. A standard for non-natural waters (such as the Dutch large rivers) will be derived, using the recommendation for GES as a starting point...|$|R
50|$|The common roach is very {{adaptable}} and can {{be found}} in any fresh-water body from small ponds, to the largest rivers and lakes. It will feed happily at any depth, although its favourite food sources would tend to be in shallower water. It tolerates organic pollution {{and is one of the}} last species to disappear in polluted waters, but is also often the most numerous <b>cyprinid</b> in nutrient-poor <b>waters.</b> It also tolerates brackish water. The Roach will survive in temperatures from close to freezing 4 °C (39 °F) up to around 31 °C (88 °F).|$|R
25|$|The river Ryton {{supports}} {{various types}} of fish. In 2006, very few lived in the upper reaches, including the Anston Brook, because the water was only of moderate quality. A number of small streams contribute to the improvement of water quality, so that wild brown trout thrive as far as Worksop. Some trout and {{various types of}} <b>cyprinids</b> inhabit the <b>water</b> below Worksop, although abstraction of water results in spawning grounds and the habitats where the young fry live drying out during most summers, which {{has resulted in a}} decline in their numbers. Nevertheless, the lower reaches are still used for organised angling, and are {{the only part of the}} River Idle system where this activity takes place.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} {{environmental}} parameters {{on changes in}} the structure of fish assemblages were studied in the Elbe and the Odra river basin. Research was done at 819 sites that were surveyed in the field during the period between 1993 and 2007. The impact of 46 factors derived from the maps through a geographic information system was tested as well as the impact of 10 factors recognized in the field. To evaluate the influence of these factors the indirect (Detrended Correspondence Analysis, DCA) and direct (Canonical Correspondence Analysis, CCA) multivariate cluster analysis were used. Analyses were performed with data on presence-absence and relative abundance of each species. DCA well reflects changes in assemblages in the longitudinal profile of streams. CCA refers to a significant influence of regional and temporal variability and influence of individual factors. The fish assemblages are best characterized by the analyzed factors of distance from the source location, stream slope, altitude of locality, representation of arable land in the basin, number of ponds in the sub-basin above the locality, type of <b>waters</b> (salmonid or <b>cyprinid),</b> and <b>water</b> temperature (the only of the parameters of the field).

40|$|Status/Trends/Threats (narrative) : Young longfin dace {{are most}} common along stream banks and in shallow eddies, and occur mostly on flat, sand bottoms in shallow pools (Barber and Minckley 1966). The nesting areas of longfin dace are {{periodically}} dried, especially when ranchers have operational irrigation diversions upstream (Minckley and Barber 1971). Predation by piscivorous {{birds and mammals}} is high on populations of longfin dace caught in drying stream channels, and is also high in periods of normal stream flow because longfin dace tend to remain in open, shallow areas {{throughout much of the}} day (Minckley 1973). In smaller pools, many longfin dace become entangled by water-net algae (Hydrodictyon), when algae becomes abundant in the late summer (Minckley and Barber 1971). The Yaqui River ichthyofauna within the U. S. has suffered three extinctions (including the Yaqui catfish as native), two of which have occurred in very recent years and maybe attributed directly to modifications in habitat and/or drought and perhaps over-use of water supplies by domesticlivestock (McNatt 1974). Longfin dace are the most common and highly adapted native southwestern <b>cyprinid,</b> occupying <b>waters</b> in low hot deserts through mid elevation, canyon-bound streams to upper elevation, clear, cool creeks in the conifer zone (Minckley 1973).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to study the toxicity of copper to carp (Cyprinus carpio, Linnaeus, 1758). This biological material is used in order {{to contribute to the}} knowledge of the copper toxicity to cyprinids and thus to clarify fundamental aspects related to an important category of fish. On the other hand, carp is a species with significant commercial value, easily obtained and well adapted to laboratory condistions. Simultaneously, it was intend to focus the study ona an organism that can be considered as a reference for metals toxicity, given its excahenge surfaces with water (skin, gill surface and digestive tract) and its osmo-regulation mechanisms. The importance of copper to the aquatic environment is examined and results of acute intoxication assays are prsented, which led to the evaluation of LC 50 - 48 h at different as the results from chronic intoxication using different LC 50 fractions. This form of contamination, which aims to simulate more realistically the situations which typically occur in polluted environments, was carried out at constant doses and at progressively increasing doses in order to enalble the evaluation of organisms adaptation. Ecotoxicological response was followed through bioaccumulated copper dosage in several tissues. Concentration and pollution factors, as well as concentrtion index were estimated. The study of histological, histochemical and microanalytical localization of copper in several organs (skin, gill surface and digestive tract) was also performed, envisaging metal detection at the pathways of intake, transport, storage and elimination. Based on the results presented in this study, it is possible to propose values for acceptable copper concentrations in <b>cyprinid</b> <b>waters,</b> depending on water characteristics, such as hardness and pH, the organism's survival and pathology. Results have shown that the tolerance of the carp to copper is higher than most of the salmonids, varying with the type of intoxication and the characteristics of the water, organism's tolerance to copper is increased with water hardness, although leading to higher metal concentrations in the tissues and to more important damage. The response of organisms leads to the conclusion that their tolerance depends not only on the toxic dose but also on the exposure period, and a significant adaptation capacity was also demonstrated. It was observed that the liveris the organ with the highest accumulation of copper which is admitted {{as a consequence of the}} formation of metallothioneins, and the lowest values were found in the muscle. On the basis of the histological study it is concluded that histopathological response of the organs in contact with water is mainly shown by stress reactions (muco-secretion and 'alarm substances'), with tissue structure modifications ocurring from 0. 2 LC 50 - 48 h. Through the histochemical study it was possible to demonstrate copper penetartion into the tissues, which was confirmed with microanalyses, particularly in the gills, during acute intoxicationAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} and flow regulation are significant {{factors related to}} the decline and extinction of freshwater biota. Pelagic-broadcast spawning <b>cyprinids</b> require moving <b>water</b> and some length of unfragmented stream to complete their life cycle. However, it is unknown how discharge and habitat features interact at multiple spatial scales to alter the transport of semi-buoyant fish eggs. Our objective {{was to assess the}} relationship between downstream drift of semi-buoyant egg surrogates (gellan beads) and discharge and habitat complexity. We quantified transport time of a known quantity of beads using 2 – 3 sampling devices at each of seven locations on the North Canadian and Canadian rivers. Transport time was assessed based on median capture time (time at which 50 % of beads were captured) and sampling period (time period when 2. 5 % and 97. 5 % of beads were captured). Habitat complexity was assessed by calculating width:depth ratios at each site, and several habitat metrics determined using analyses of aerial photographs. Median time of egg capture was negatively correlated to site discharge. The temporal extent of the sampling period at each site was negatively correlated to both site discharge and habitat-patch dispersion. Our results highlight the role of discharge in driving transport times, but also indicate that higher dispersion of habitat patches relates to increased retention of beads within the river. These results could be used to target restoration activities or prioritize water use to create and maintain habitat complexity within large...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2013. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisors: Vaughan Voller, Miki Hondzo. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvi, 210 pages. The {{objective of this}} research was to investigate the ability of bubble curtain deterrent systems to inhibit the movement of invasive fish. Bubble curtains, which consist of a wall of bubbles (e. g. produced by forcing air through perforated pipes), fall into the category of behavioral deterrent systems that rely on aversive stimuli (e. g. sound and light) to guide fish in taxon specific manners. These systems provide advantages over physical/mechanical screens because they do not restrict fluid flow or negatively impact navigation. Bubble curtains are particularly appealing, because they are less expensive than other electrical or sonic barriers, are easily maintained, safe, and produce complex acoustic and hydrodynamic stimuli which may be optimized to deter fish movement. However, few studies have examined whether or how bubble curtains might work. In three studies, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), a <b>cyprinid</b> responsible for <b>water</b> quality degradation in shallow water ecosystems, was used to investigate how bubble curtains influence fish behavior and might be optimized. First, through a laboratory experiment, two different bubble curtains were shown to reduce passage of common carp by 75 - 80 % in both up- and down-stream directions. These findings also suggested that avoidance behaviors were attributed to fluid motion and sound stimuli. Second, a field test demonstrated that the performance of a bubble curtain under natural conditions was consistent with laboratory results, blocking 57 ± 12 % of downstream swimming carp, versus 75 - 80 % in the laboratory. Third, a fish movement model based on diffusion theory and phonotaxic response was derived. In a novel application, a stability analysis of the fish movement model demonstrated that acoustic stimuli produced by the bubble curtains can be sufficient to disrupt movement (i. e. deter passage) of common carp. Overall, I have shown through rigorous experimental and holistic quantitative analysis that bubble curtains can indeed deter common carp movement, but improvements must be identified in order for bubble curtains to remain a viable management tool in the future...|$|R
