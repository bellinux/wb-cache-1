The <b>carbonation</b> <b>depth</b> of the UPM with polymer-binder ratio of 2  % and SF content of 0  % (2.2  mm) decreased about 68  % smaller than that of the unmodified mortar (6.8  mm), and about 37  % smaller than that of the unmodified mortar in case of polymer-binder ratio of 0  % and SF content of 6  % (4.3  mm). The highest value of the <b>carbonation</b> <b>depth</b> of the UPM was obtained for the mortar which used both EVA and silica fume. The UPM with polymer-binder ratio of 2  % and SF content of 6  % (1.3  mm) decreased about 81  % smaller than that of the unmodified mortar. The <b>carbonation</b> <b>depth</b> of the UPM was reduced about 1 / 5 level of the unmodified mortar. This tendency is explained by the tough polymer films formed as seen in Photo 1, and the largest pore volume peak position in the pore size distributions generally move toward the position of pore radii of not more than 14  nm as shown in Fig.  1. The effect of filling and sealing with polymer in polymer-modified mortar is reflected in the reduced transmission of such gases as air, carbon dioxide (CO 2), oxygen (O 2) and water vapor, and increases water. The reduction of <b>carbonation</b> <b>depth</b> is due to the effect of the high pozzolanic activity and void filling ability of SF.

However, {{it has been shown}} that ageing and coupled deterioration mechanisms, like carbonation or leaching, alter the frost resistance.

With the natural energy (solar light) alone, various photocatalytic functions, such as air purification, can be realized. Extensive research has spurred the practical application of photocatalytic construction materials on a global scale. However, several challenges still limit their broader applications. Among them, a normally high cost and an impaired photocatalytic efficiency caused by encapsulation of TiO₂ by the cement hydration products stand out. Commonly, a trade-off {{has to be made}} between a high efficiency and a low cost. Therefore, achievement of good photocatalytic efficiencies with low amounts of TiO₂ implies considerable cost savings. In this study, two novel methods have been developed to better incorporate nano-TiO₂ into two types of cementitious materials (namely self-compacting architectural mortar and concrete surface layers of eco-blocks). Recycled glasses derived from post-consumer beverage glass bottles were used as fine aggregates to replace natural river sand. The advantages of samples prepared by these new methods over those prepared by the traditional intermixing method were demonstrated in terms of photocatalytic degradation of various substances under various conditions. For the architectural mortars, the traditional intermixing method was first adopted to combine TiO₂ with recycled glass for the purpose of enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency in terms of NOx removal. The mechanical and durability properties of architectural mortars prepared with varying dosages of TiO₂ and recycled glass were also examined. It was found that the light transmittance property of recycled glass was responsible for the highest photocatalytic NOx removal efficiency observed on the samples prepared with 100 % recycled glass as aggregate and a dosage of 5 % TiO₂. Adding more glass contents, coupled with increasing TiO₂ dosages, led to a slight reduction in both the compressive strength and flexural strength (due to the formation of agglomerates) and an increase in both the ASR expansions and <b>carbonation</b> <b>depths</b> (but all the ASR expansions were below the permissible limit). To fulfil the goal of increasing photocatalytic efficiencies while lowering the cost, an alternative strategy of applying a TiO₂ containing paint (PC-S 7) on the surface of architectural mortars was investigated. The superior photocatalytic efficiency of the PC-S 7 -coated samples over the 5 % TiO₂-intermixed counterparts was reflected by a wide range of photocatalytic activities. For example, the PC-S 7 -coated architectural mortars had both a significantly higher NOx and xylene degradation performance in comparison with the 5 % TiO₂-intermixed counterparts which achieved a much lower NOx removal rate and failed to degrade xylene. In addition, the PC-S 7 -coated architectural mortars delivered a total inactivation of E. coli after 120 min of UVA irradiation, contrasting with a negligible E. coli killing activity by the 5 % TiO₂-intermixed samples. Moreover, the PC-S 7 -coated samples also garnered a robust weathering-resistant ability, reflected by an almost unchanged ability to photocatalytic degrade RhB after exposure to either a facade weathering process or an accelerated carbonation process. Investigation on the photocatalytic architectural mortars gave rise to an intriguing finding that white cement (WC) was superior to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in boosting the photocatalytic NOx removal activity. It was found that OPC displayed a much higher light absorption ability relative to WC. As a result, less light would be reflected to the surrounding TiO₂ surface, and thereby fewer electron-hole pairs will be generated. Even if the same amount of light does strike on the TiO₂ surface, a stronger charge transfer resistance of OPC makes the electron-hole pairs difficult to separate, and instead, more prone to recombination. These two adverse effects combine to impart an inferior photocatalytic NOx performance to the OPC/TiO₂ mixtures. Overall, the main culprit seems to be a relative abundance of Fe₂O₃ in OPC. As for the concrete surface layers, a simple and effective method (spray method) was developed to obtain a high photocatalytic efficiency with less amounts of nano-TiO₂. Its advantages over the conventional intermixing and dip-coating methods were well demonstrated. Moreover, the effects of various experimental and environmental factors on the photocatalytic NOx removal efficiency of the concrete surface layers fabricated by the new method were examined and compared with that of the samples fabricated by the intermixing method. It was found that the samples prepared by the spray method outperformed the intermix counterparts under all circumstances, demonstrating that the products produced using the new method hold great promise for practical applications in the construction sector.

40|$|AbstractPortland cement {{can play}} a major role in {{providing}} cost-effective, long-term zonal isolation for CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) used to mitigate climate change. However, achieving zonal isolation with Portland cement under supercritical CO 2 environment for the required 1, 000 year trapping period may be challenging. Some laboratory researchers report that Portland cement disintegrates when exposed to CO 2, leading to potential leakage into the atmosphere or other to underground zones. Other researchers cite Portland cement samples from 30 – 50 year old CO 2 EOR wells where sealing integrity was maintained, even though carbonation was found. In this paper we will discuss reasons likely for this disparity between research lab test results and actual well performance data. Carbonation of Portland cement is a thermodynamically favorable process and therefore difficult to avoid. But the effects can be minimized by various reactive chemical components optimized for the specific thermodynamic conditions. Our research shows partial carbonation of Portland cement is not detrimental unless the mechanical integrity is insufficient to provide effective zonal isolation. For these studies we have developed CO 2 treatment test cells capable of producing conditions up to 200  °F and 2, 000 psi. In addition, various analytical instruments including x-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and mechanical properties measurement devices have been used for this study. In this paper we will discuss the importance of understanding the percentage of <b>carbonation</b> and <b>depth</b> of CO 2 penetration, and how to control these factors by optimizing the cement blend. Interestingly, we found the amount of Portlandite { Ca(OH) 2 } that forms due to cement hydration and the cement-to-water ratio dictates the depth of penetration as well as percentage carbonation. The implications of this in relation to the long term chemical integrity of the cement sheath under downhole CCS conditions is discussed. This paper also includes the results of recent studies on the changes in mechanical properties of a properly optimized Portland cement blend for a period of up to one year. During this period, measurements were made at different time intervals to examine cement specimen treated with CO 2 at 200  °F and 2, 000 psi in the presence of water. The results show carbonation without any sign of loss of mechanical or sealing integrity that could lead to zonal isolation failure. Results from a separate set of experiments show the following: (1) Carbonation could be minimized by reducing the Portland cement content by adding Pozzolanic materials and by reducing the permeability and (2) Carbonation could help heal micro-cracks that may be caused by various well operations or ageing. However, such carbonation-induced healing is limited only to a certain width of cracks. In summary of this research, it is recommend that: (1) a high quality primary cement job be performed in adherence to all industry best practices; (2) the cement blend be properly optimized to minimize long-term CO 2 corrosion; and (3) the sheath be designed for long-term mechanical integrity. This paper will discuss a comprehensive approach that may be taken to help ensure longer-term effective zonal isolation in new CO 2 wells and remedial solutions for old wells and for plugging and abandoning wells...|$|R
