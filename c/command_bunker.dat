5|$|After the British had withdrawn, the Germans reoccupied {{the battery}} position. Steiner {{was unable to}} see Sword from his <b>command</b> <b>bunker,</b> so {{even though he was}} able to get two of his guns back in action, he was unable to direct {{accurate}} fire onto the landings. However, observers with the 736th Infantry Regiment, holding out at La Brèche, were able to direct his guns until that position was neutralised.|$|E
5|$|Steiner was {{not present}} during the bombing, but at a <b>command</b> <b>bunker</b> in Franceville-Plage. After the raid, he {{set out for the}} battery, but was unable to gain entry due to the volume of fire from the British paratroopers. At the same time, a {{reconnaissance}} patrol from an army Flak unit with a half-track mounting a large anti-aircraft gun arrived. The crew had intended to seek cover at the position, but instead used the gun to engage the paratroopers.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, as General William C. Westmoreland {{learned of}} the North Vietnamese attack on Lang Vei and Lownd’s refusal to send a relief force, he ordered the U.S. Marines to supply enough {{helicopters}} to airlift a 50-man strike force {{with the aim of}} rescuing the survivors. Subsequently, Colonel Jonathan F. Ladd—commanding officer of the 5th Special Forces Group — and Major General Norman J. Anderson, commander of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing — were directed to formulate a rescue plan. While Willoughby and his men waited for help in the <b>command</b> <b>bunker,</b> Ashley and his Laotian contingent cautiously entered the Special Forces Camp.|$|E

5|$|By 01:10 hours, {{the western}} {{flank of the}} Mousetrap had fallen to Viet Minh bombardment. By 01:30, the {{garrison}} was informed that weather conditions prevented air support, and by 02:30 the Viet Minh forces launched successive assault waves which overran Teullier and his men, including attacks which flanked the position using the nearby sandbanks. At the same time, Alpha was overrun by Viet Minh forces, and by 03:50 no more firing was heard from the Mousetrap. Alpha survived {{the remainder of the}} night and was seen fighting by French aircraft at 09:00 that morning. C-47 transport aircraft returned to resume supply drops, however by 12:00 the Tricolor and the Laotian flag had been removed from Pi’s <b>command</b> <b>bunker.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because his Nung {{soldiers}} were exhausted, with their ammunition and water supplies running low, White believed {{they could not}} defend the Ngok Tavak garrison in case the VC launched another major attack. At 10:45, White requested permission to evacuate the garrison, but {{he was told to}} stay and wait for the arrival of reinforcements. However, both White and Makowski knew that reinforcement was unlikely, because the two downed helicopters would prevent the insertion of additional soldiers, and the road between Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức was likely to be covered by the opposing forces waiting in ambush positions. White then decided to evacuate Ngok Tavak and withdraw his troops to safety. As part of the evacuation plan, any type of equipment that could not be taken or was considered to be of value to the opponent was dumped into the <b>command</b> <b>bunker</b> and set alight using captured enemy flamethrowers. The Marines were ordered to fire their last remaining shells, about nine rounds in total, after their ammunition storage was set ablaze by the VC, and disable their 105mm guns.|$|E
5|$|Plaman Mapu {{was a tiny}} Malaysian village {{only half}} a mile behind {{the western part of}} the border between Sarawak and Kalimantan. There the British had {{established}} a base for 'B' Company of the Parachute Regiment. Apart from the two 3-inch mortars stationed there, the place had little strategic value beyond being a lookout point for the British to detect Indonesian raids over the border. By the low standards of the makeshift British jungle bases, it was fairly well defended, equipped with aforementioned mortars, an interconnected trench network, and a <b>command</b> <b>bunker,</b> with supporting artillery weapons within range of the base to supply cover. The defenders of the base, by contrast, were wholly unprepared for combat. The undermanned 'B' Company had recently been supplied with a platoon of inexperienced troopers who had pitiful experience in jungle warfare. Due to the intensity of recent fighting, the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Ted Eberhardie, had only been able to spare a few of the new men for a training course in such combat at Singapore, but one of those was Sergeant Major John Williams, who would play a crucial role in the coming battle.|$|E

5|$|At Goerdeler's insistence, Stauffenberg {{is ordered}} to assassinate both Hitler and SS head Himmler at the Führer's <b>command</b> <b>bunker,</b> the Wolf's Lair. At a final briefing, Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim instructs the {{committee}} {{members in the}} use of pencil detonators. Stauffenberg also persuades General Fellgiebel, who controls all communications at Wolf's Lair, to cut off communications after the bomb blast. On July15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at Wolf's Lair with the bomb in his briefcase, but with Himmler not present at the meeting, Stauffenberg does not get the go-ahead from the committee leaders, and by the time von Quirnheim defies the others and tells him to do it anyway, the meeting is over. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht, unbeknownst to Fromm, to stand by. With no action taken, Stauffenberg safely extracts himself and the bomb from the bunker, and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down, believing that the mobilization was a drill. Back in Berlin, Olbricht and Stauffenberg are threatened by Fromm that if they try to control the reserve army again he will personally have them arrested; Stauffenberg goes to the committee to protest their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler, who has been selected to be chancellor after the coup. When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved, Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest, and that he must leave the country immediately.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{artillery}} fire continued to rain {{down on the}} camp, wounding several men and sending the defenders into disarray. Sergeant-Major Williams rushed to the headquarters to order the artillery officer to bombard the taken positions before attempting to organise a counterattack himself. Whilst under heavy Indonesian fire, Williams gathered a section of defenders who had taken refuge in a slit trench and led them towards the captured outer positions. A shell landed among the group and wounded half of them, but Williams and the remainder engaged at least thirty Indonesian infantry who had been firing into the base from the trench in vicious hand-to-hand combat and managed to push them from it with minor casualties. Williams them looked to secure the perimeter, but seeing that the Indonesians were massing for a second attack, {{he sat down in}} a vacated machine gun nest and sprayed the new wave of attackers, who attempted to seize the <b>command</b> <b>bunker,</b> with fire. This was not without cost, and Williams was fortunate to have escaped with a single head wound, which nevertheless blinded him in one eye, though he did not notice this in the heat of battle. Williams then began to receive supporting rifle fire from other British troops in nearby trenches, as well bombardment from the single remaining mortar and some 105mm artillery emplacements from a nearby camp.|$|E

50|$|In November 1942 Bräuer {{replaced}} General Alexander Andrae {{as commander}} on Crete. On 25 March, Greek National Day, he released 100 Cretan prisoners from jail. One prisoner, Constantinos Mitsotakis, later became Prime Minister of Greece. After German failures at Stalingrad and El Alamein, Bräuer ordered {{the construction of}} underground <b>command</b> <b>bunkers,</b> more defenses around Suda Bay and increased ammunition stocks. Bräuer was replaced by General Friedrich-Wilhelm Müller in 1944.|$|R
50|$|Adolf Hitler {{exercised}} a {{tight control}} over the German war-effort, spending {{much of his time}} in his <b>command</b> <b>bunkers</b> (most notably at Rastenburg in East Prussia, at Vinnitsa in Ukraine, and under the garden of the Reich Chancellery in Berlin). At crucial periods in the war he held daily situation conferences at which he used his remarkable talent for public speaking to overwhelm opposition from his generals and the OKW staff with rhetoric.|$|R

The <b>command</b> <b>bunker</b> featured an aperture overlooking Con Thien and C-2 and documents found in the bunker indicated that the NVA had been observing and reporting the movement of helicopters, tanks, and trucks entering and leaving Con Thien and C-2.|$|E
25|$|The Warsaw Ghetto Memorial was {{unveiled}} on April 19, 1948—the fifth {{anniversary of the}} outbreak of the Warsaw ghetto Uprising. It was constructed out of bronze and granite that the Nazis used for a monument honoring German victory over Poland and it was designed by Natan Rappaport. The Memorial is located where the Warsaw Ghetto used to be, at the site of one <b>command</b> <b>bunker</b> of the Jewish Combat Organization.|$|E

5000|$|Additionally, ROTOR re-arranged the {{existing}} RAF Fighter Command structure into six [...] "Sector Operational Commands" [...] (SOC) {{with their own}} <b>command</b> <b>bunkers</b> (three level 'R4' protected accommodation). Only four of these were built. Additional [...] "Anti-Aircraft Operations Rooms" [...] were built to coordinate the British Army's AA defences in the same overall system. The entire network of bunkers, radars, fighter control and command centres used up 350,000 tons of concrete, 20,000 tons of steel and {{thousands of miles of}} telephone and telex connections.|$|R
25|$|Hardened bunkers {{were part}} of a {{national}} plan to ensure the continuation of the United States government in the event of nuclear attack.

25|$|On 17 March, as BC 610A and the 141st PAVN Regiment {{exchanged}} {{heavy weapons}} fire, five Communist T-34 tanks and four {{armored personnel carriers}} burst onto the Sam Thong airstrip. Dodging artillery fire being called in by a Raven Forward Air Controller overhead, the T-34's overwhelmed the Royalists' inadequate anti-tank defenses. Although {{one of the two}} T-34s that lumbered atop Royalist bunkers was destroyed by hand grenades, the other struck the battalion's <b>command</b> <b>bunker.</b> As BC 610A retreated, the Communists turned captured howitzers on Skyline Ridge despite being struck by four flights of tactical air.|$|E
50|$|The K-W {{line was}} not a massive {{fortification}} line with modern forts sheltering the artillery, like the French Maginot Line. There were no permanent fortress garrisons occupying it. In case of war, regular infantry divisions had to entrench themselves along the line after having been withdrawn from the Albert Canal-Meuse covering line. Construction work was aimed at preparing this entrenchment by providing a pre-existing infrastructure, consisting of a telephone network, <b>command</b> <b>bunkers,</b> pillboxes for the machine guns, antitank-obstacles and inundations. Little {{was done in the}} way of digging trenches, placing barbed wire entanglements or laying minefields beforehand.|$|R
5000|$|The EC {{weapons were}} quickly {{replaced}} with Mk 17 Mod 0 and Mk 24 Mod 0 bombs in October and November 1954. Those weapons included a 64 ft parachute {{to allow the}} delivery aircraft to escape. With the addition of IFI of the Primary capsule to prevent a nuclear explosion {{in case of an}} accident, the weapons were upgraded to the Mod 1 standard. The inclusion of a contact fuze upgraded some bombs to the Mod 2 version, allowing the bombs to be used against [...] "soft" [...] targets (air burst), or buried targets such as <b>command</b> <b>bunkers</b> (contact burst).|$|R

Other buildings on the site included a <b>command</b> <b>bunker,</b> a building to accommodate the men, and ammunition magazines. During a visit on 6March1944, to inspect the defences, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel ordered the builders to work faster, and by May1944, the last two casemates were completed.|$|E
500|$|Back in Lang Vei, the North Vietnamese {{continued}} to harass the small force of soldiers still {{trapped in the}} <b>command</b> <b>bunker</b> with hand grenades, explosives and bursts of gunfire down the stairwell that led into the bunker. Shortly after 06:00am, the North Vietnamese threw several fragmentation grenades and tear gas grenades down the stairwell, causing panic amongst the defenders. Then, a voice called down the stairwell in Vietnamese, demanding the American-led forces give up at once. Following a quick discussion with his CIDG soldiers, the South Vietnamese special forces commander led his troops up the stairwell to surrender but were killed by North Vietnamese soldiers, [...] leaving behind their American counterparts. After the South Vietnamese had gone up, there was another short verbal exchange between the Americans in the bunker and the North Vietnamese in English, which was followed by another fire-fight when the Americans refused surrender. At 06:30am, the North Vietnamese successfully blasted a hole on the northern wall, gaining direct access into the <b>command</b> <b>bunker.</b> However, instead of launching a direct attack on the last American stronghold, the North Vietnamese {{continued to}} throw grenades through the wall.|$|E
500|$|In {{that battle}} the 198th Tank Battalion {{failed to reach}} the battle on time because its tank crews {{struggled}} to navigate their tank equipment through the rough local terrain. However, {{as soon as the}} PT-76 tanks of the 198th Tank Battalion turned up at Bane Houei Sane, the Laotian soldiers and their families panicked and retreated into South Vietnam. After Bane Houei Sane was captured, the 24th Regiment prepared for another attack which targeted the U.S. Special Forces Camp at Lang Vei, manned by Detachment A-101 of the 5th Special Forces Group. On 6 February, the North Vietnamese 24th Regiment, again supported by the 198th Tank Battalion, launched their assault on Lang Vei. Despite fighting with air and artillery support, the U.S.-led forces conceded ground and the North Vietnamese quickly dominated their positions. By the early hours of 7 February the <b>command</b> <b>bunker</b> was the only position still held by allied forces, but they were besieged by North Vietnamese soldiers above ground. During the entire ordeal, U.S. and indigenous Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) forces trapped inside the <b>command</b> <b>bunker</b> had to endure North Vietnamese harassment, which {{came in the form of}} fragmentation and tear gas grenades. To rescue the American survivors inside the Lang Vei Camp, a counter-attack was mounted, but the Laotian soldiers, who formed the bulk of the attack formation, refused to fight the North Vietnamese. Later on, U.S. Special Forces personnel were able to escape from the camp, and were rescued by a U.S. Marine task force.|$|E
