5|$|After {{the success}} of the {{nomination}} speech, Howe and Roosevelt planned that the latter would run for Governor of New York in 1932 and President in 1936. However, Governor Smith was named the Democratic presidential candidate in 1928, and persuaded the state convention to draft Roosevelt. Howe predicted disaster, feeling that a Republican challenger was sure to beat Roosevelt in what was expected to be nationally a Republican year. Though Howe remained Roosevelt's unofficial <b>campaign</b> <b>manager,</b> he was technically subordinate to a state <b>campaign</b> <b>manager</b> selected by Smith, as well as Smith's personal <b>campaign</b> <b>manager,</b> Belle Moskowitz, with whom Howe frequently clashed. In the fall election, Roosevelt won the governorship by a small margin, though Smith was defeated by Herbert Hoover both nationally and in New York State.|$|E

Senator Nixon endorsed Holt over State Senator Jack Tenney, and Chotiner asked Nixon to supply him with Tenney's House Un-American Activities Committee file—the state senator had once had communist leanings, though he had long renounced them. Nixon arranged for Chotiner to get the file, {{which was supposed to}} be for Congressional use only, though he apparently made no public use of the file in the campaign.
