5000|$|Nawa {{describes}} {{the story of}} Darya, a 12-year-old opium bride in the Ghoryan district given by her father to a creditor 34 years her senior to liquidate his opium debts. The girl is initially resistant to the marriage, telling Nawa, [...] "I {{do not want to}} go with this man. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> help me?" [...] She ultimately concedes to her father's wishes and marries the smuggler who lives hours away. After several months of no contact between Darya and the family, her mother beseeches Nawa to search for her.

I thought it was my job as an outsider from the West to rescue her." [...] But ultimately, she must give up because of danger from the child's husband and because the search takes her to the Helmand Province, a perilous place. Nawa believes that Darya will save herself by standing up to her husband, escaping him, or discovering how to cope with her situation. She writes, [...] "Darya offers hope for change. I will always {{want to know what happened}} to her, and perhaps someday I will." ...|$|E
50|$|Collins {{also claimed}} that Bell Pottinger had been {{involved}} in David Cameron raising a matter with the Chinese government on behalf of a Bell Pottinger client, saying: …Just as a final example just for you... I'm not saying we can always do this but just as an example of what we can sometimes do. Three weeks ago, we were rung up at 2.30 on a Friday afternoon by one of our clients, Dyson... They rang up and they said look, we've got a huge issue, and that {{is that a lot of}} our products are being completely ripped off in China, to the point where they're not just completely duplicating the product... (The) Chinese government won't take it seriously, it's half past two on a Friday afternoon. On Saturday, the Chinese Prime Minister is coming in for a UK visit - <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> get the UK to raise it?...And I'm pleased to say that on the Saturday, David Cameron raised it with the Chinese Prime Minister and showed him the photos of the products. I'm not saying we can do that all the time but that is an illustration of what, if you have the right message - David Cameron, yes he was doing it for Dyson, yes he was doing it because we asked him to do it, he was doing this also because he thought this was also in the UK wider national interest. This was something where there would be a UK proper interest. But in terms of very fast turnaround and getting things done right at the top of government, if you've got the right message, yes, we can do it.|$|E
5000|$|... "That {{actually}} happened to me. In {{the seventh grade}} I had a counselor who came into class and passed around {{a little piece of}} marijuana. He lit it so everyone could see how it smelled like, and then it disappeared. And he was like, 'Where is it now? Who has it now? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> pass it back to the front.' But it was like, gone. So I just wrote down that experience, which became that scene." [...] Trey Parker [...] "Ike's Wee Wee" [...] was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. The scene where Mr. Mackey loses the marijuana cigarette in class was inspired by a real event from Parker's life, where a counselor came into his class in seventh grade, and passed around a lit piece of marijuana, which then disappeared. At {{the beginning and end of}} the episode, there are scenes where the kids imitate Mr. Mackey's voice to him, while he is oblivious to the fact that he is being made fun of. Parker and his classmates used to do the same thing to their counselor in junior high school, who was the basis for Mr. Mackey's character. Parker said that he was especially proud of Chef's line, [...] "There's a time and a place for everything, and it's called college", which is something Parker believes in, noting that if he had a child, he would tell him: [...] "Do whatever you want, just wait till college because you don't know what the fuck's up right now." [...] Chef's sentence would later return in the season four episode [...] "The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000".|$|E
