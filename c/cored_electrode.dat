5000|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) {{is a common}} arc welding process. The first patent on the {{submerged-arc}} welding (SAW) process was taken out in 1935 and covered an electric arc beneath a bed of granulated flux. Originally developed and patented by Jones, Kennedy and Rothermund, the process requires a continuously fed consumable solid or tubular (metal <b>cored)</b> <b>electrode.</b> The molten weld and the arc zone are protected from atmospheric contamination by being [...] "submerged" [...] under a blanket of granular fusible flux consisting of lime, silica, manganese oxide, calcium fluoride, and other compounds. When molten, the flux becomes conductive, and provides a current path between the electrode and the work. This thick layer of flux completely covers the molten metal thus preventing spatter and sparks as well as suppressing the intense ultraviolet radiation and fumes that {{are a part of}} the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Mathematical models have been devised expressing the levels of controllable welding factors {{as a function of}} the joint geometry, such that acceptable weld beads are produced. Weld beads were required to be both geometrically acceptable and mechanically sound despite changes in the root face thickness (0. 5 mm - 2. 5 mm) and root gap (0 - 1. 5 mm). The equations are intended to form part of an adaptively controlled robotic arc welding system. Simulation was used to develop the adaptive expressions. The study was applied to the root weld bead of the closing seam of railway bogie side frames fabricated from structural steel. The self shielding flux <b>cored</b> <b>electrode</b> arc welding process was used to weld single J preparations orientated in the horizontal-vertical position. Single sided full penetration welds with underbeads were required. The weld bead geometry was defined in terms of ten responses. Mathematical models derived from factorially designed experiments were used to relate the weld bead geometry, incidence of porosity and the occurrence of electrode stubbing to a function of upto seven factors. A data base of almost 1000 test welds was generated, in which each test was characterised by 76 pieces of information. Analysis of variance was used to determine which factors most influenced each of the responses. Multiple regression enabled an expression for each response to be derived {{as a function of the}} welding factor levels. The weld bead geometry model consisted of ten equations, each a function of upto six factors, whilst the soundness model related the optimum welding voltage to a function of three factors so that porosity and electrode stubbing would not be encountered...|$|E

The hybrid heterostructures such as core-shell nanowires tend to improve the properties of the nanowires in the application of high-temperature sensing [4] and high-performance field-effect transistors [5] and the enhancement of hydrogen generation efficiency in visible photocatalytic processes [6]. SiC nanostructures are well known for their superior mechanical properties, high thermal conductivity, low thermal-expansion coefficient, good thermal-shock resistance, chemical stability, and electron affinity which make them excellent candidates for work in harsh environments [7, 8].

40|$|Robotic Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) {{is used in}} fatigue loaded {{structures}} where {{demands on}} weld quality are very high. Bead dimensions of a weld such as penetration bead thickness and toe radius can reveal whether a weld can reach high fatigue life. However, several welding parameters have high impact on these dimensions. From previous research it has been indicated that geometrical parameters such as torch angle, weld position, push or pull direction etc. are the most influential ones concerning quality of a weld with solid wires. Welding technology offers solid or metal cored wires for robotic GMAW. Even though metal cored wires depict several advantages compared to solid, a lot of skepticism is faced among industries due to its higher cost. Response parameters of a fillet weld by robotized GMAW using metal cored wire were investigated {{as a function of}} welding geometry parameters. The goal is to reveal the optimal settings aiming at as high productivity as possible. Iteration of welding tests using solid wire has been made in order to depict repeatability of previous test results with the same settings. Next step consisted of several series of experiments varying geometrical parameters using metal <b>cored</b> <b>electrode.</b> Repetition of this series for different values of wire feed rate has been carried out and comparisons are made. In order to reveal higher possible productivity, a few tests were carried out for the optimal welds from previous steps for different welding speeds and with pulsed welding. Specimens were cut, grinded and etched. Measurement of weld dimensions was performed via Lumenera software. Analysis of the results was made with JMP 11 software by SAS. Results indicated that for metal cored wire the majority of high quality welds were performed in push direction, PA position and gun angle of 35 o. Correlation analysis showed the nature of the relationships between input and output parameters. Prediction models were constructed for all weld dimensions using regression analysis. Tests with higher welding speeds suggest that there are possibilities for productivity improvement. Pulsed welding revealed that only a trade-off between values of bead thickness and penetration can create a quality weld.

The substrate steel hardfaced with flux <b>cored</b> wire <b>electrode</b> resulted in high microhardness as compare to solid wire electrode.

Ductile erosion behavior is observed in the case when the substrate steels is hardfaced with solid wire whereas brittle erosion behavior is observed when the substrate steels is hardfaced with flux cored wire. At a low angle of impingement, the abrasive type cutting is the dominating factor for material removal, and at a higher angle of impingement, impact-type as well as abrasive-type cutting actions play critical roles.

30|$|The other {{drawback}} of {{the above}} system is the loosely distributed CdS array on the CF surface, possessing large pores, which allows for polymer to penetrate deeply into the CdS nanobrush structure (see insert in Fig.  3) and to contact with the CF electrode and thus to contribute to undesirable current leakage. This drawback is clearly seen upon comparison of performance of solar cells prepared on the CF and on the flat ITO electrode. The latter geometry provides tighter CdS layer and better solution of the shortcutting problem which is particularly important in cells where the polymer layer (SSPSSC and ISC) or a liquid contact (DSSC) is used. As a result, {{a significant increase in}} the open-circuit voltage can be achieved (Table  2). Therefore, deposition of a tighter CdS shell layer around the CF <b>core</b> <b>electrode</b> is necessary to solve the above problem. Finally, there is a problem with the reliable contact between the organic layer and the top PEDOT:PSS electrode. We have revealed that casting of the PEDOT:PSS electrode from a solution leads to shortcutting problem, but the mechanically pressed PEDOT:PSS film onto the top of the assembly does not provide a tight contact.

Structural analysis of the nanocomposite electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The electrochemical performances of the prepared supercapacitor were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1. 0 M Na 2 SO 3 and 1. 0 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solutions, respectively. The experimental results showed that the highest specific capacitance of 43 F/g is achieved with a fairly low Fe 3 O 4 nanomaterials loading (4 wt. %) in 1 M Na 2 SO 3. It is clear that the low concentration of nanostructured Fe 3 O 4 has improved the capacitive performance of the composite via pseudocapacitance charge storage mechanism as well as the enhancement on the specific surface areas of the electrode. However, further increasing of the Fe 3 O 4 content in the electrode is found to distort the capacitive performance and deteriorate the specific surface area of the electrode, mainly due to the aggregation of the Fe 3 O 4 particles within the composite. Additionally, the CV results showed that the Fe 3 O 4 /AC nanocomposite electrode in Na 2 SO 3 electrolyte exhibits a better charge storage performance if compared with Na 2 SO 4 solution.

Impedance measurement, neurophysiological recording, and cyclic voltammetric release stimulus (- 0. 9 V to 0. 6 V, 1 V/s, 20 cycles) was performed daily to all channels. On the 11 th day, histology was performed to quantitatively characterize inflammatory tissue response using OX 42 (microglia) and GFAP (astroglia). Equivalent circuit analysis was performed to assist the interpretation of impedance data. Our results indicated that the MWCNT/PEDOT-coated gold macroelectrodes released double the amount of dexamethasone using passive release followed by CV stimulation (10 sets of 20 cycles) compared to passive release alone. Coatings applied to Pt/Ir microelectrodes reduced 1 kHz impedance in PBS by approximately 38 %.

Use of the commercially available flowmeter body, which includes the magnetic coils, <b>core,</b> and signal <b>electrodes,</b> provided a relatively economical means of fabricating the transient flowmeter. A transient flow calibration facility consisting of a free-falling water column was also designed and built. Results of the calibrations are presented and show that the flowmeter can accurately measure transient flows up to the maximum observed acceleration of approximately 1 g...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} electrode diaphragms consisting of an ion exchange material forming a <b>core</b> area and <b>electrodes</b> for fuel cells or electrolyzers contacting said material on both sides, whereby the ion exchange material is formed of soluble homopolymers or copolymers or mixtures {{of them in}} solvents. The polymer must {{have at least a}} residue which can be dissociated into ions. The electrode material is bonded to the ion exchange material {{on both sides of the}} core area so that there is an intimate contact between the electrode and ion exchange materials on the diaphragm side and the external sides are made of pure electrode material...|$|R
