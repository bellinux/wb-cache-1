Echolocation, DNA sequencing and parasitic lice {{have all been}} used to establish relationships, but some problems, such as {{the placement of the}} Papuan swiftlet are not fully resolved.

5|$|The bat'leth is {{considered}} an iconic image of the Star Trek universe. Replicas are widespread and are considered collectibles by some {{and a part of}} Klingon costume. A number of outlets, including replica merchants, weapons dealers and pawn shops sell them. Ronald D. Moore, who has worked on Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica, displays one in his office. However, due to the dangers that real bat'leths <b>can</b> <b>pose,</b> no officially licensed replicas of the weapon are available from either Curry or Paramount Pictures.|$|E

5|$|Mutation {{analysis}} of the ATP7B gene, {{as well as other}} genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, it is possible to screen family members for the disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling. Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson's disease are important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries like the USA or United Kingdom <b>can</b> <b>pose</b> problems as they tend to have more mixed populations.|$|E
5|$|When Fortress mode is selected, {{the player}} {{is given the}} option to choose the embark {{location}} in the world. The player can consider the environment, elevations, biome, soil types and mineral concentrations which <b>can</b> <b>pose</b> significant challenges to the development or survival of the fortress. Customizing the colony's supplies, domestic animals and skills are available, but each dwarf's mental and physical attributes are randomly generated. The game describes in detail each dwarf's physical appearance, like hair and facial features. The mental abilities, individual preferences and desires are also randomly generated. Each dwarf's relationships with others and the deities they worship can be viewed.|$|E
5|$|Livestock {{depredation}} {{has been}} one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and <b>can</b> <b>pose</b> a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance. Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well. Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation. The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America). The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.|$|E
25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} are flammable or highly flammable, {{depending on}} their volatility. Exceptions are some chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane and chloroform. Mixtures of solvent vapors and air can explode. Solvent vapors are heavier than air; they will sink {{to the bottom and}} can travel large distances nearly undiluted. Solvent vapors can also be found in supposedly empty drums and <b>cans,</b> <b>posing</b> a flash fire hazard; hence empty containers of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of volcanic eruptions and associated activity: phreatic eruptions (steam-generated eruptions), explosive eruption of high-silica lava (e.g., rhyolite), effusive eruption of low-silica lava (e.g., basalt), pyroclastic flows, lahars (debris flow) and carbon dioxide emission. All of these activities <b>can</b> <b>pose</b> a hazard to humans. Earthquakes, hot springs, fumaroles, mud pots and geysers often accompany volcanic activity.|$|E
