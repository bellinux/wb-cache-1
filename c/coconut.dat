5|$|Adult <b>coconut</b> crabs have {{no known}} predators {{apart from other}} <b>coconut</b> crabs and humans. Its large size {{and the quality of}} its meat means that the <b>coconut</b> crab is {{extensively}} hunted and is very rare on islands with a human population. The <b>coconut</b> crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While the <b>coconut</b> crab itself is not innately poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of <b>coconut</b> crab poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango Cerbera manghas by the <b>coconut</b> crab may make the <b>coconut</b> crab toxic due to the presence of cardiac cardenolides.|$|E

Chopped mint leaves are used in some versions. It can be served hot or chilled. Salt and pepper can be used to season the dish, and nutmeg is sometimes used as a seasoning.

5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the <b>coconut</b> is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} <b>coconut.</b> Once the pores are visible, the <b>coconut</b> crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the <b>coconut.</b> Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard <b>coconut</b> into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E

5|$|<b>Coconut</b> crabs {{live in the}} Indian Ocean and {{the central}} Pacific Ocean, with a {{distribution}} that closely matches that of the <b>coconut</b> palm. The western limit {{of the range of}} B. latro is Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania, while the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn mark the northern and southern limits, respectively, with very few population in the subtropics, such as the Ryukyu Islands. There is evidence that the <b>coconut</b> crab once lived on the mainlands of Australia and Madagascar and on the island of Mauritius, but it no longer occurs in any of these places. As they cannot swim as adults, <b>coconut</b> crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae.|$|E

5|$|The <b>coconut</b> crab has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as <b>coconut</b> crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and the <b>coconut</b> crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. <b>Coconut</b> crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The smells of rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. Research has shown that the olfactory system in the <b>coconut</b> crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E

5|$|The <b>coconut</b> crab is {{the only}} species of the genus Birgus, and {{is related to the}} {{terrestrial}} hermit crabs of the genus Coenobita. It shows a number of adaptations to life on land. Like hermit crabs, juvenile <b>coconut</b> crabs use empty gastropod shells for protection, but the adults develop a tough exoskeleton on their abdomen and stop carrying a shell. <b>Coconut</b> crabs have organs known as branchiostegal lungs, which are used instead of the vestigial gills for breathing and they will drown if immersed in water for long. They have an acute sense of smell, which has developed convergently with that of insects, and which they use to find potential food sources.|$|E
5|$|The diet of <b>coconut</b> crabs {{consists}} {{primarily of}} fleshy fruits (particularly Ochrosia ackeringae, Arenga listeri, Pandanus elatus, P. christmatensis); nuts (Aleurites moluccanus), drupes (Cocos nucifera) and seeds (Annona reticulata); and the pith of fallen trees. However, {{as they are}} omnivores, they will consume other organic materials such as tortoise hatchlings and dead animals. They have been observed to prey upon crabs like Gecarcoidea natalis and Discoplax hirtipes, as well as scavenge on the carcasses of other <b>coconut</b> crabs. During a tagging experiment, one <b>coconut</b> crab was observed killing and eating a Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans). In 2016, a large <b>coconut</b> crab was observed climbing a tree in order to disable and consume a red-footed booby on the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E

Agriculture saw extensive losses with nearly the entire taro crop devastated and more than 75% of the food crop was ruined. Roughly 23% of the <b>coconut</b> trees were destroyed and 45% were damaged. It took approximately two years for the <b>coconut</b> crop to return to normal.

5|$|<b>Coconut</b> crabs mate {{frequently}} and quickly {{on dry land}} in the period from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Male <b>coconut</b> crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the abdomen of the female; the abdomen opens {{at the base of}} the third pereiopods, and fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of the abdomen as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass. The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. Shortly thereafter, the female lays her eggs and glues them to the underside of her abdomen, carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female <b>coconut</b> crab releases the eggs into the ocean. This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high tide. The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Mangalorean Catholic diet was {{completely}} vegetarian. This changed during the 20th century, when {{with the advent}} of Westernisation, meat came to be consumed increasingly in the community, especially amongst the elite. <b>Coconut</b> and curry leaves are common ingredients to most curries. Sanna-Dukra Maas (Sanna is idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas is pork) {{is one of the most}} popular dishes of the Mangalorean Catholic community. Rosachi Kadi (Ros Curry), a fish curry made with <b>coconut</b> milk (ros), is a traditional curry served during the Ros ceremony. Patrode, a dish of colocasia leaves stuffed with rice, dal, jaggery, <b>coconut,</b> and spices is popular. Kuswar are sweet delicacies prepared during Christmas and include around 22 varieties of sweets. Fish and rice form the staple diet of most Mangalorean Catholics. Par-boiled rice, known as red rice, is the traditional rice eaten and is preferred over raw rice.|$|E
50|$|The Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club is {{well known}} to parade-goers for {{throwing}} <b>coconuts,</b> to the crowd. In the early 1900s, other parading organizations threw fancy handmade glass necklaces that were expensive. The working men of Zulu could not afford such expensive throws but still wanted to give a special prize to lucky parade-goers. The men decided to purchase <b>coconuts</b> from the French Market because they were different and inexpensive. Painted and adorned <b>coconuts</b> became popular with the club starting in the late 1940s. In 1987, the organization was unable to renew its insurance coverage and lawsuits stemming from coconut-related injuries forced {{a halt to the}} long-standing tradition of throwing <b>coconuts.</b> In 1988 Governor Edwin W.
