5|$|The caracal {{is often}} {{confused}} with the lynx, as both cats have tufted ears. However, a notable point of {{difference between the two}} is that the lynx is spotted and blotched, while the caracal shows no such markings on the coat. The African golden cat has a similar build as the caracal's, but is darker and lacks the ear tufts. The sympatric serval <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> apart from the caracal by the former's lack of ear tufts, white spots behind the ears, spotted coat, longer legs, longer tail and smaller footprints.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the {{four-horned antelope}}. Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the hog deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a gazelle, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
5|$|With {{its form}} and {{structure}} in consideration, Rescued by Rover shows a growing understanding among directors of how stories <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> on film; that is, {{the belief that}} the audience does not need to see the family return to their home, but will instead assume this occurred while the beggar woman was returning to her hovel. While the duration of the shot does not correspond with the time necessary for the father and the family dog to travel back, it also does not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E

5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come across one other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach each other they charge one another's scarves. They cannot {{communicate with each}} other beyond patterns of singing. Players can help each other by activating strips of cloth or showing paths, but cannot hinder each other and are not necessary for completing any level. When two players finish a section {{at the same time they}} remain together into the next one; otherwise they are connected to new players when they move on. While all of the figures generally look the same, without distinguishing characteristics, individual players <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times. The entire game takes about two to three hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|The golden white-eye {{differs from}} the other {{white-eyes}} in having large eyes and an outermost primary wing feather that is not reduced (as {{it is in the}} other species). It is a large white-eye, 14cm (5.5in) long and weighing around 20g (0.7oz). The species has bright, unmistakable plumage, with: an orange-yellow head coupled with a pale eye-ring; a yellow-green back, wings, and tail; and golden orange undersides. The bill and legs are also orange. The plumage of both sexes is similar; the males <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> from the females only when examined in the hand, since the males have longer wings than the females. The juveniles have similar plumage, though duller than the adults', with brownish patches on the face and neck and brown-yellow streaks on the breast. Juveniles also have dusky bills and dull legs.|$|E
5|$|P. sibiricus is {{the largest}} known species of Psittacosaurus. The skull of the type {{specimen}} is 20.7centimetres long (8.25in), and the femur is 22.3cm (8.75in) in length. It is also distinguished by its neck frill, which is longer than any other species, at 15 to 18% of skull length. A very striking feature of P. sibiricus {{is the number of}} 'horns' around the eyes, with three prominences on each postorbital, and one in front of each eye, on the palpebral bones. Similar horns found on the postorbital of P. sinensis are not as pronounced but may be homologous. The jugal has extremely prominent 'horns' and may contact the premaxilla, both features also seen in the possibly related P. sinensis. There is a flange on the dentary of the lower jaw, similar to P. mongoliensis, P. meileyingensis, and P. sattayaraki. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> apart from the other species of Psittacosaurus by a combination of 32 anatomical features, including six that are unique to the species. Most of these are skull details, but one unusual feature is the presence of 23 vertebrae between the skull and pelvis, unlike the 21 or 22 in the other species where the vertebrae are known.|$|E
5000|$|Another way of {{classifying}} softmodems is {{by means}} of their communication interface with the host computer: on desktop systems the most common option is an internal PCI or ISA expansion card, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> easily <b>be</b> <b>told</b> apart from an internal [...] "hardware" [...] modem by the significantly reduced size and component count.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{those of}} Mimosa, Albizia flowers {{have many more}} than 10 stamens. Albizia <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>told</b> apart from another large related genus, Acacia, by its stamens, which are joined at the bases instead of separate.|$|R
50|$|Birds in this genus {{have mostly}} drab {{coloration}} and display secretive behavior, keeping ensconced in vegetation {{most of the}} time. Species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> difficult to distinguish from one another {{on the basis of}} their similar plumage; however, they <b>can</b> often <b>be</b> <b>told</b> apart by their vocalizations, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> quite distinctive.|$|R
25|$|The lichen-rich sand heaths <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> {{apart from}} the other types of {{heathland}} {{by the presence of}} various cup lichens (Cladonia), ciliated fringewort (Ptilidium ciliare) and juniper haircap (Polytrichum juniperinum). They occur frequently on dry, south-facing slopes. This type of heath is found west of Niederhaverbeck and near Sundermühlen.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{philosophical}} languages of the 17th–18th centuries could be regarded as proto-auxlangs, as they were intended by their creators to serve as bridges among people of different languages {{as well as to}} disambiguate and clarify thought. However, most or all of these languages were, as far as <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> from the surviving publications about them, too incomplete and unfinished to serve as auxlangs (or for any other practical purpose). The first fully developed constructed languages we know of, as well as the first constructed languages devised primarily as auxlangs, originated in the 19th century; Solresol by François Sudre (1787–1862), a language based on musical notes, was the first to gain widespread attention although not, apparently, fluent speakers.|$|E
25|$|Once wasps {{emerge as}} mature adults, they spend the first 2–3 {{days on the}} nest doing very little. After the first 3 idle days, workers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> from non-workers because workers stay on the nest longer. A wasp that leaves the nest for any reason {{immediately}} after those 3 days is considered a non-worker. Lifetime in the nest, then, seems directly dependent on ones role: queens lived an average of 61 days, workers lived about 31 days, non-workers survived for about 5 days, and males only survived about 4.8 days. This is considered evidence that the caste system determines the individual wasp’s life course. Note that these numbers are based entirely {{on the number of}} days that a wasp is seen in the nest. In some cases, including males, the wasps live the majority of their lives outside of the nest.|$|E

500|$|Commanding Hewie is an {{integral}} part of Haunting Grounds gameplay. At the beginning of the game, he won't be completely friendly and obey all of Fiona's commands. The player will have to build a friendship and gain his trust in order to survive the game. Hewie <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> to sniff out items, check suspicious areas or items, attack an enemy, or called back to Fiona's side. The player can praise Hewie by petting and feeding him, both which can heal his vitality. Likewise, he can be scolded when he won't listen to commands. He <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> to [...] "stand ready" [...] before attacking, which will increase his attack power.|$|E
500|$|Herman {{wrote the}} book for an American {{audience}} which {{may not have been}} very familiar with Scottish history. He provides a historical overview and short biographies of the most prominent Scots. The historical approach uses the Great Man Theory, that a historical narrative <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> through the lives of a few prominent figures. Regarding this approach Michael Lynch of The Globe and Mail wrote, the biographies [...] "reveal subtle but important links between these figures and their ideas, which Herman seeks to characterize, with some success, as a coherent body of distinctively 'Scottish' thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Wired and The New York Times {{suggested}} that Myst {{was evidence that}} video games could in fact evolve into an art form. Entertainment Weekly reported that some players considered Mysts [...] "virtual morality" [...] a religious experience. Aarhus University professor Søren Pold pointed to Myst as {{an excellent example of}} how stories <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> using objects rather than people. Laura Evenson, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, pointed to adult-oriented games like Myst as evidence the video game industry was emerging from its [...] "adolescent" [...] phase.|$|E

50|$|Some breeds {{of sheep}} and goats look similar, but they <b>can</b> usually <b>be</b> <b>told</b> apart because goat tails are short and usually point up, whereas sheep tails hang down and are usually longer and bigger - though some (like those of Northern European short-tailed sheep) are short, and longer ones are often docked.|$|R

A Lectionary of before 1164 from Cologne unusually shows Jesse dead in a tomb or coffin, from which the tree grows. [...] Romanesque depictions usually show Jesse asleep on open ground or on a simple couch - all that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> from the Bible about his circumstances is that he had sheep, which David herded. By the Gothic period small Trees are found in many types of manuscript, and Jesse is often more comfortably accommodated in a large bed.|$|E
