50|$|The Briquet is {{a passionate}} hunter with stamina and fortitude. It {{should be able}} to pick up a <b>cold</b> <b>trail</b> as well as a hot one. Like its close {{relations}} the other vendeen hounds, the Briquet relishes its time outdoors with its family. While they are not high-strung, they are lively and enthusiastic dogs. Bred to work in packs as well as on their own, they get along well with other dogs and are not overly possessive about anything. They are fine companion for children.|$|R

5000|$|The Southern Hound {{seems to}} have fallen out of favour during the 18th century as the fashion for shorter hunts led to the {{development}} of the faster Foxhound. Youatt wrote that there were still packs in use in Devon in the 19th century and that the Southern Hound was sometimes used in conjunction with Foxhound packs to help pick up the <b>cold</b> <b>trail</b> when the pack lost the scent. Some were employed in Wales on polecat hunts (that could last several days), and they appear to have been used to hunt otter before being employed as breeding stock for the development of the Otterhound.|$|R

5000|$|Having {{failed in}} their search for Stoddard, {{increasingly}} the prime suspect in the case, the police hired Mary Handley, making her a detective to the chief of police, paying her a stipend of $2 per day for 40 days. Handley had revealed to the police that she was an [...] "intimate friend" [...] of Kings, and had approached the police to assist in searching for her. At first, she dealt with a <b>cold</b> <b>trail</b> as had the other detectives on the case, but after a public tip [...] "relating to the former haunts of Kate Stoddard" [...] was given to the chief, Handley was [...] "put on the track". She made trips to Glens Falls, Gloversville and Albany, but none were productive.|$|R
50|$|On 12 September 1986, {{wealthy and}} {{respected}} Santa Teresa doctor Dowan Purcell disappeared. Nine weeks later, {{with the police}} investigation apparently stalled, Kinsey is hired to find some answers, though slightly oddly it's his first wife Fiona, rather than current wife, Crystal, who is doing the hiring. Fiona, somewhat embittered by the breakdown of her marriage, is convinced that Dow has engineered his own disappearance, as she alleges Crystal is having an affair and admits that Dow has gone AWOL {{a couple of times}} before; in support of this, his passport and thirty thousand dollars seem to be missing. In contrast, Crystal, a former stripper Dow met on a trip to Las Vegas, is convinced he is dead. Not impressed either with Fiona's haughty personality or the chances of turning up something on a <b>cold</b> <b>trail,</b> Kinsey accepts the case with some misgivings.|$|R

50|$|As {{part of his}} 2012 {{resolution}} to learn 12 new skills, Duneier learned how to knit. His first project was the covering of a 40-foot tall eucalyptus tree, 2.6 miles up the <b>Cold</b> Spring <b>Trail</b> in Santa Barbara, California. It required 450 square feet of knitted material. The installation remained for just 9 days and all material used was donated to Warm Up America, a charity in North Carolina.|$|R
50|$|Bowdrie {{is portrayed}} as a {{hardened}} Texas Ranger, with a reputation as being good with a gun, and who is feared and respected by outlaws and lawmen alike. He is described by L'Amour {{as a man who}} could have easily ridden as an outlaw or gunfighter, but was instead recruited by the Rangers, who preferred having him on their side rather than against them. He is smart, and an expert at tracking, and speaks German, French, Comanche, some Spanish and English. The two novels in which L'Amour uses Bowdrie as his central character include: Bowdrie, with 8 short stories: Bowdrie Rides A Coyote Trail, A Job For A Ranger, Bowdrie Follows A <b>Cold</b> <b>Trail,</b> Bowdrie Passes Through, A Trail To The West, More Brains Than Bullets, Too Tough To Brand, The Killer From The Pecos; the second novel Bowdrie's Law, includes 10 short stories: McNelly Knows A Ranger, Where Buzzards Fly, Case Closed-No Prisoners, Down Sonora Way, The Road To Casa Piedras, A Ranger Rides To Town, South Of Deadwood, The Outlaws Of Poplar Creek, Rain On The Mountain Fork, and Strange Pursuit.|$|R

She has been hired by Royce Fowler, who wants her to delve into the past to exonerate his son of the murder of Jean Timberlake, seventeen years before. Bailey, who had been a teen tearaway, pleaded guilty to killing Jean, his sometime girlfriend, but escaped from prison soon afterwards. He's apparently been living the life of a model citizen under an assumed name but has just been recaptured and is claiming his innocence. Kinsey heads to Floral Beach, a tiny local community, to pursue the <b>cold</b> <b>trail,</b> and stays with the Fowler family at their motel. Royce is dying of cancer, his wife Oribelle is sick with diabetes and their daughter, Ann, Bailey's senior by 5 years, has taken leave of absence from her job as a counsellor at the local high school to provide care.|$|R

Aiken Lava Bed from the lower end for 6 miles to the Round the Mountain <b>Trail.</b> The <b>Cold</b> Springs <b>Trail</b> #72 follows the western edge for 4 miles. Other trails in the area include the Gotchen Trail #40, Morrison Creek Trail #39, and Pineway Trail #71.|$|R
5000|$|Mar Y Cel or, more correctly, Mar i Cel (Catalan: [...] "Sea and Sky") is an {{open space}} {{preserve}} conserved by the Land Trust for Santa Barbara County, in Santa Barbara County, California, USA. Located in the Santa Ynez Mountains foothills above Montecito, Mar Y Cel is a 350 acre estate. It includes the notable [...] "Tea Gardens", {{as well as the}} West Fork of <b>Cold</b> Springs <b>Trail,</b> a well used hiking trail.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2000, Cima del Mundo LLC, an {{environmental}} investment group, offered to donate a conservation easement on {{a portion of}} Mar Y Cel: the northern 150 acre. This eliminated the possibility of future residential development while ensuring the protection of both wildlife habitat and the property's scenic beauty. In addition, the company granted a [...]5 mi easement to the Land Trust ensuring that {{a portion of the}} <b>Cold</b> Spring <b>Trail</b> is open for public use.|$|R
6000|$|After {{waiting a}} while we {{returned}} to our horses, and presently Edd {{came back with the}} pack. [...] "Big bear, but <b>cold</b> <b>trail.</b> Called them off," [...] was all he said. We mounted and rode across the mouth of Horton Thicket round to the juniper slopes, which I had occasion to remember. I even saw the pine tree which I had so ignominiously climbed. How we ridicule and scorn some of our perfectly natural actions--afterwards! Edd had brought three of the pups that day, two-year-olds as full of mischief as pups could be. They jumped a bunch of deer and chased them out on the hard red cedar covered ridges. We had a merry chase to head them off. Edd gave them a tongue-lashing and thrashing at one and the same time. I felt sorry for the pups. They had been so full of frolic and fight. How crestfallen they appeared after Edd got through! [...] "Whaddaye mean," [...] yelled Edd, in conclusion. [...] "Chasin' deer!... Do you think you're a lot of rabbit dogs?" [...] From the way the pups eyed Edd so sheepishly and adoringly, I made certain they understood him perfectly, and humbly confessed their error.|$|R
5|$|A {{series of}} strong low {{pressure}} systems formed across the southern Great Plains on February 4, contributing to record warmth on February 4 and 5 {{in the southern}} Plains and lower Mississippi River Valley. High temperatures across many areas reached the 70s°F (21–26°C), and in Alabama temperatures reached the low 80s°F (27°C) with dew points in the middle 60s° (17–20°C). Dewpoints in the mid 60s°F were recorded {{as far north as}} Memphis. A strong <b>cold</b> front <b>trailing</b> the low pressure area approached the region from the west.|$|R
50|$|At age twenty-one Bowdrie became {{mixed up}} with the wrong crowd and ended up getting {{involved}} in a gunfight. Bowdrie was shot {{three times in the}} fight but was able to ride off. He was able to survive long enough to arrive at the cattle ranch of Noah Wipple. Noah and his family took him in, nursed him back to health and gave him a job. Only a few months later, Noah Wipple was murdered in the local town of Miller's Crossing. Bowdrie then went into town to pursue the man who had killed his friend and employer. When he arrived in town he saw a Help Wanted poster that was advertising a job for the Texas Rangers. Bowdrie thought he would be better equipped to catch Wipple's killer if he was {{on the right side of}} the law. He joined the Texas Rangers and was sworn in by Capt. Leander McNelly himself. From there Bowdrie remained riding for the law. From the eighteen short stories by Louis L'Amour, we know that during his career as a Ranger, Bowdrie has been responsible for multiple outlaws killed or captured. He has survived ten gunshot wounds and has been documented to have survived at least thirty-three gunfights. Bowdrie was twenty-five years old during the story Strange Pursuit, the last story written, so Browdrie's career and adventures as a ranger took place over the course of approximately four years. The sixth story written, Bowdrie Follows a <b>Cold</b> <b>Trail</b> takes place in the year 1885.|$|R
5000|$|The {{precipitation}} pattern of Nor'easters {{is similar to}} other mature extratropical storms. Nor'easters can cause heavy rain or snow, either within their comma-head {{precipitation pattern}} or along their <b>trailing</b> <b>cold</b> or stationary front. Nor'easters can occur {{at any time of}} the year but are mostly known for their presence in the winter season. [...] Severe European windstorms are often characterized by heavy precipitation as well.|$|R
50|$|The game is {{expected}} to play as a traditional JRPG with turn-based battles, similar to <b>Trails</b> of <b>Cold</b> Steel and <b>Trails</b> of <b>Cold</b> Steel II. An emphasis on speeding up battles is being made as well, including making transitions into battle scenes more seamless, {{and being able to}} map out more battle commands to specific buttons rather than various menus, though the battles will still be primarily menu-based.|$|R
50|$|The {{synoptic}} situation on June 22 was conducive {{to a major}} severe weather event in southern Manitoba. A low pressure system came in from Saskatchewan through the day, and then moved over southern Manitoba throughout the evening. A warm front was positioned north of Elie {{for much of the}} day with a <b>trailing</b> <b>cold</b> front residing west of Elie near the Lake Manitoba basin southwest through southeast Saskatchewan. A lake breeze boundary was also present south of Lake Manitoba.|$|R
50|$|With the <b>trail</b> <b>cold</b> and the blackmailer's {{deadline}} near, Gabriel goes to Lancaster in London {{where the}} blackmail demand finally arrives: 10 million euros and, surprisingly, Gabriel {{to deliver the}} money. The money and the girl both check out, but the handoff is set up {{in such a way}} that Gabriel watches the car Madeline's in explode (as he watched his ex-wife and son die before the events of the series) rather than saves her and loses the money too.|$|R
5000|$|The park {{is in the}} Driftless Area, {{noted for}} its karst topography, which {{includes}} sinkholes and caves. The park is about 5 mi from Mystery Cave and occupies approximately 3170 acre, with camping, interpretive programs, and hiking, horseback, cross-country skiing <b>trails,</b> <b>cold</b> water streams and excellent trout fishing.

500|$|From Circle, it is [...] to the {{checkpoint}} in Central. Mushers follow Birch Creek south {{until just before}} Circle Hot Springs. This area, along with the Fortymile stretch, is considered among the <b>coldest</b> on the <b>trail,</b> and mushers are advised to prepare for [...] temperatures. Turning west, they travel through frozen swamps before reaching the Steese Roadhouse checkpoint in Central. In Central during even years, mushers {{have the option of}} taking their four-hour rest here or at Mile 101. If they choose to, the three minute start difference will be subtracted from their rest time.|$|R
60|$|Such a good hunting-ground cannot long remain {{hidden from}} other prowlers in the wilderness; and Wayeeses, who was keeping his {{discovery}} to himself, would soon cross {{the trail of}} a certain old fox returning day after day to the same good covers. No two foxes, nor mice, nor men, nor any other two animals for that matter, ever leave the same scent,--any old hound, which will hold steadily to one fox though a dozen others cross or cover his trail, will show you that plainly in a day's hunting,--and the wolf would soon know surely that the same fox was poaching every night on his own preserves while he was away. To a casual, wandering hunter he paid no attention; but this cunning poacher must be laid by the heels, else {{there would not be}} a single rabbit left in the cover. So Wayeeses, instead of hunting himself at twilight when the rabbits are stirring, would wait till midday, when the sun is warm and foxes are sleepy, and then come back to find the poacher's trail and follow it to where Eleemos was resting for the day in a sunny opening in the scrub. There Wayeeses would steal upon him from behind {{and put an end to}} his poaching; or else, if the fox used the same nest daily, as is often the case when he is not disturbed, the wolf would circle the scrub warily to find the path by which Eleemos usually came out on his night's hunting. When he found that out Wayeeses would dart away in the long, rolling gallop that carries a wolf swiftly over the roughest country without fatigue. In an hour or two he would be back again with another wolf. Then Eleemos, dozing away in the winter sunshine, would hear an unusual racket in the scrub behind him,--some heavy animal brushing about heedlessly and sniffing loudly at a <b>cold</b> <b>trail.</b> No wolf certainly, for a wolf makes no noise. So Eleemos would get down from his warm rock and slip away, stopping to look back and listen jauntily to the clumsy brute behind him, till he ran plump into the jaws of the other wolf that was watching alert and silent beside the runway.|$|R
50|$|A strong mid-level shortwave trough {{developed}} into a closed low-pressure area as the system occluded over the central High Plains on April 27, 2014. An associated surface cyclone reached peak intensity while a <b>trailing</b> <b>cold</b> front moved eastward across eastern Kansas, eastern Oklahoma and northern Texas. There were two areas where severe weather was expected, morning pre-frontal convection from Kansas and Oklahoma into Missouri and Iowa and warm sector supercell development across southeast Oklahoma and northeast Texas into Arkansas. The Storm Prediction Center indicated this system for 6 days in advance on its 4-8 day outlook.|$|R

500|$|ITV <b>trailed</b> <b>Cold</b> Feet between 3 and 12 November. The trailer {{featured}} {{clips from}} the pilot episode, including the scene where Adam sings with a rose clenched between his buttocks. Six people complained to the Independent Television Commission (ITC), the commercial television regulator, about the scene being inappropriate. Their complaints were not upheld; the ITC ruled that the trailer did not breach the programming code, as [...] "the humour of the piece was apparent from the outset". A 96 Sheet billboard advertising campaign also preceded broadcast, featuring the strapline [...] "A comedy about life & all that". The broadcast was sponsored by Cockburn's Port.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the basis of initial training {{is to make the}} experience enjoyable for the puppy or young hound, to keep its enthusiasm high. Whitney preferred waiting till the hound is 18 months old, to start training, but others start as young as possible, say three months. Training can be started by running short trails on a family member whom the puppy sees walk away, at first remaining visible, and later going out of sight. Even though familiar with the scent of the ‘runner’, it can be given a scent-article to sniff, and given the command to follow. It can also be introduced to the tracking harness, which is put on just before the trail starts, and removed as soon as it is finished. On reaching the runner the puppy is given lavish praise and perhaps a reward. Generally in training the handler must know exactly where the runner went, so that he does not encourage the hound when it is wrong, or ‘correct’ it when it is on the scent, but he should not be too ready with his corrections if the hound goes astray, or it may come to rely on him. He should give the hound time to realise its mistake and put itself right, if possible. As training progresses the handler learns to ‘read’ his hound’s behaviour. The hound must trust its nose and the handler must trust the hound. From early hot trails on a familiar person, the young hound progresses to <b>colder</b> <b>trails</b> on the scents of strangers. Later training can be designed to teach particular lessons: crossing trails with false scents, having the runner start out with a companion, who leaves him somewhere along the trail, laying a trail on ground frequented by wild animals. This will teach the hound not to change on to other humans, or riot on animal scents (known as ‘staying clean’ , or ‘freedom from change’ [...] ). It also needs to work over a variety of ground and learn to cope with distractions of many kinds, as well as being introduced to 'negative trails': given a scent article which has not been handled by anyone in the area, so that it will learn to indicate to a handler that the required scent is not there. If it is becoming discouraged it can revert to simpler tasks to recover enthusiasm.|$|R
