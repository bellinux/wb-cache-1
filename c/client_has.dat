25|$|Collaboration systems {{utilizing}} Operational Transformations typically use replicated document storage, {{where each}} <b>client</b> <b>has</b> their own {{copy of the}} document; clients operate on their local copies in a lock-free, non-blocking manner, and the changes are then propagated {{to the rest of}} the clients; this ensures the client high responsiveness in an otherwise high-latency environment such as the Internet. When a client receives the changes propagated from another client, it typically transforms the changes before executing them; the transformation ensures that application-dependent consistency criteria (invariants) are maintained by all sites. This mode of operation results in a system particularly suited for implementing collaboration features, like simultaneous document editing, in a high-latency environment such as the web.|$|E
25|$|However, {{police were}} not able to develop any {{evidence}} from this material that might have helped them locate Bethany. Roldan later stopped cooperating with the investigation; he has subsequently been described by law enforcement as a person of interest. Emile Decker later obtained a divorce from his missing wife. It has since been reported that he will no longer talk with investigators unless his lawyer, who says his <b>client</b> <b>has</b> nothing to hide, is also present. No record was ever found suggesting that Bethany had given birth by her expected due date later that summer, although Loudoun County police distributed to the public pictures of what she might look like near the end of a pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|A {{vulnerability}} of the renegotiation procedure was discovered in August 2009 {{that can lead to}} plaintext injection attacks against SSL 3.0 and all current versions of TLS. For example, it allows an attacker who can hijack an https connection to splice their own requests into the beginning of the conversation the <b>client</b> <b>has</b> with the web server. The attacker can't actually decrypt the client-server communication, so it is different from a typical man-in-the-middle attack. A short-term fix is for web servers to stop allowing renegotiation, which typically will not require other changes unless client certificate authentication is used. To fix the vulnerability, a renegotiation indication extension was proposed for TLS. It will require the client and server to include and verify information about previous handshakes in any renegotiation handshakes. This extension has become a proposed standard and has been assigned the number RFC 5746. The RFC has been implemented by several libraries.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the earlobe with alcohol and puts a mark on the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement of the needle after the piercing process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The <b>client</b> <b>has</b> to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can be put off. After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again.|$|E

500|$|In December 2010 Hodgson was {{returned}} to prison awaiting trial over new and unconnected allegations of rape and sexual assault of a 22-year-old woman with learning difficulties at a care home in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, in August 2010. On 3March 2011, Hodgson pleaded guilty at Durham Crown Court to sexual touching but denied rape. David Crook, prosecuting, {{said that he would}} offer no evidence on the rape charge, which was withdrawn. Hodgson's solicitor, Julian Young, said: [...] "The wrongful imprisonment for 27 years of my <b>client</b> <b>has</b> had a devastating effect on his life since he was cleared of the murder he did not commit [...] has been gripped by a number of personal difficulties, including a degree of alcohol abuse." [...] The judge, Mr.Justice Prince, requested the preparation of pre-sentence reports {{to address the issue of}} Hodgson's dangerousness, and Hodgson was remanded in custody. On 13May 2011 he was sentenced to a three-year community order. The judge said that the total of 156 days Hodgson had been remanded in custody prior to sentence would be taken into account, and told Hodgson he [...] "could walk free should he agree to complete a psychiatric order imposed by the court, but his barrister Martin Heslop QC, said his client 'clearly bears a great resentment against a criminal justice system which has deprived him of 27 years of liberty'" [...] and rejected the option.|$|E

2500|$|Many co-counsellors {{take the}} view, often quite strongly, that co-counselling is not psychotherapy.

[...] A similar view is taken by some non-RC co-counsellors who regard psychotherapy as involving specialist techniques used by a therapist on a client and is therefore not peer and the <b>client</b> <b>has</b> little or no control over the process.|$|E
