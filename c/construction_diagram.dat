40|$|State diagram based {{approach}} has been proposed as {{an effective way to}} model resource constraints in traditional instruction scheduling and software pipelining methods. However, the constructed state diagram for software pipelining method (i) is very large and (ii) contains significant amount of replicated, and hence redundant, information on legal latency sequences. As a result, the <b>construction</b> of state <b>diagrams</b> can take very large computation time. In this paper, we propose two methods for the efficient <b>construction</b> of state <b>diagrams.</b> In the first method, we relate the <b>construction</b> of state <b>diagram</b> to a well-known problem in graph theory, namely the enumeration of maximal independent sets of a graph. This facilitates the use of an existing algorithm as a direct method for constructing distinct latency sequences.

Biographical Note: Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic) in 1896, Norbert Troller served as a soldier in World War I, spending time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1981. updatedDigital imag...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} twenty nine cone {{penetrometer}} test (CPT) pushes {{in three weeks}} were conducted for vadose zone characterization of the Miscellaneous Chemical Basin (MCB) waste unit at the Savannah River Site. The shallow, unlined basin received liquid chemical wastes over an 18 year period beginning in 1956. This characterization was initiated to determine the vertical and lateral extent of contamination in the vadose zone and to install vadose zone wells for remediation by barometric pumping or active vapor extraction to help prevent further contamination of groundwater. The CPT locations within the waste site were selected based on results from previous shallow soil gas surveys, groundwater contamination data, and the suspected basin center. Geophysical data and soil gas samples were collected at twenty five locations and twenty five vadose zone wells were installed. The wells were screened to target the clay zones and areas of higher soil gas concentrations. The well <b>construction</b> <b>diagrams</b> are provided in Appendix B.
