50|$|It was a <b>conical</b> <b>casing</b> {{enclosing}} a shaped {{charge and}} containing 562 grams of TNT, {{fitted with a}} percussion fuse and four cloth ribbons to provide stability in flight after throwing. It could penetrate approximately 100 millimeters of armour. The RPG-6 had a fragmentation radius of 20 metres {{from the point of}} detonation, and proved useful against infantry as well as tanks.|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{a listing of}} the {{different}} studies conducted by the Institute in May thru August of 1921. The aerodynamical section studied: the aerodynamical characteristics of a very thick concave-convex wing; the disturbance caused in a tunnel {{by the presence of}} a disk, placed in relation with a transversely infinite barrier; vertical pressure in a wing of low head resistance; the drag caused by two small doors in the sides of the fuselage. Some other studies conducted by the Institute included: depressions in the interior of the model of a wing; the influence of a <b>conical</b> <b>casing</b> fitted with helicoidal flanges centered on the hub of the propeller; the influence of the velocity of translation on the aerodynamical effects of the propeller; and the influence of a honeycomb placed in the tunnel...|$|E
