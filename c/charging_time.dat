25|$|A strobe {{without a}} {{capacitor}} storage device simply discharges mains voltages across the tube once it's fired. This type of strobe requires no <b>charging</b> <b>time</b> {{and allows for}} much quicker flash rates, but drastically reduces the lifetime of the flash tube if powered for significant periods of time. Such strobes require a form of current limiting, because as mentioned above, an arc acts {{as a kind of}} short circuit. If this current limiting were to be eliminated, the flash tube would attempt to draw high currents from the electricity source, potentially tripping electrical breakers or causing voltage drops in the power supply line.|$|E

2500|$|Stearic acid is {{also used}} as a {{negative}} plate additive {{in the manufacture of}} lead-acid batteries. It is added at the rate of 0.6 g per kg of the oxide while preparing the paste. [...] It is believed to enhance the hydrophobicity of the negative plate, particularly during dry-charging process. [...] It also reduces the extension of oxidation of the freshly formed lead (negative active material) when the plates are kept for drying in the open atmosphere after the process of tank formation. [...] As a consequence, the <b>charging</b> <b>time</b> of a dry uncharged battery during initial filling and charging (IFC) is comparatively lower, as compared to a battery assembled with plates which do not contain stearic acid additive.|$|E

Heat transfer characteristics of the storage tank in this system have a key effect on the system’s efficiency and cost.

2500|$|Capacitors {{made with}} {{any type of}} {{dielectric}} material show some level of [...] "dielectric absorption" [...] or [...] "soakage". On discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it, after a short time it may develop a voltage due to hysteresis in the dielectric. This effect is objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits. The level of absorption depends on many factors, from design considerations to <b>charging</b> <b>time,</b> since the absorption is a time-dependent process. However, the primary factor {{is the type of}} dielectric material. Capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or polysulfone film exhibit relatively high absorption, while polystyrene or Teflon allow very small levels of absorption. In some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist, such as in flashtubes, television sets, and defibrillators, the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged. Any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous, while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal. A capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20% of its original charge {{over a period of several}} minutes, allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous.|$|E
