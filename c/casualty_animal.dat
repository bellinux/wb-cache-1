50|$|War {{memorials}} {{are defined}} as any tangible object which has been erected or dedicated to commemorate war, conflict, victory or peace; or casualties who served in, were affected by or killed {{as a result of}} war, conflict or peacekeeping; or those who {{died as a result of}} accident or disease whilst engaged in military service. This includes memorials to civilian <b>casualties</b> and <b>animals.</b> While most memorials commemorate the First and Second World Wars, all conflicts are covered, from the Roman conquest of Britain to current-day actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|R
25|$|Between 19 and 30 September the 4th Light Horse Brigade had {{suffered}} 73 horses killed (61 by the 11th LHR – probably at Samakh) three light draught horses, 12 rides and two camels destroyed, 14 rides two light draught horses wounded and eight evacuated <b>animal</b> <b>casualties.</b> They captured 24 officers and 421 other ranks at Quneitra.|$|R
60|$|The {{descent from}} the top of the pass was much steeper and more severe than the ascent had been, and the train of mules was a very long time making its way to the bottom. Every animal that fell, every load which shifted, brought the whole line to a standstill. However, {{patience}} and care will effect wonders; and we got to the foot of the steep portion without a <b>casualty</b> among the <b>animals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Austrian-South African {{immunologist}} Max Sterne (1905-1997) {{developed an}} attenuated live animal vaccine in 1935 {{that is still}} employed and derivatives of his strain account for almost all veterinary anthrax vaccines used in the world today. Beginning in 1934 at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Research Institute, north of Pretoria, he prepared an attenuated anthrax vaccine, using the method developed by Pasteur. A persistent problem with Pasteur's vaccine was achieving the correct balance between virulence and immunogenicity during preparation. This notoriously difficult procedure regularly produced <b>casualties</b> among vaccinated <b>animals.</b> With little help from colleagues, Sterne performed small-scale experiments which isolated the [...] "Sterne strain" [...] (34F2) of anthrax which became, and remains today, the basis {{of most of the}} improved livestock anthrax vaccines throughout the world.|$|R
50|$|About {{half the}} burnt {{woodlands}} {{should be able}} to recover because they are mature pine forests. The other half, are low in regenerative capacity due to repeated burning.Countless animals have perished in the fires, tortoises being the most easily visible, due to their burnt-out shells. Birds and faster-moving animals can flee, but will now over-burden nearby eco-systems. Surviving animals may suffer from burns and smoke inhalation. Re-colonisation of burnt areas will be slow, commencing with insects, lizards and birds, with hares, partridges and foxes only arriving after the first rain has led to new growth. Lack of forest cover {{will make it easier for}} predators to locate certain prey species.The Association for the Protection and Welfare of Wildlife (Anima) operate a 24-hour call centre at telephone: 210-951-0075 or 6972 664 675 (www.wild-anima.gr) for <b>animal</b> <b>casualties.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the year}} 1783 a fissure {{eruption}} from Laki {{in the southern}} part of Iceland produced a large amount of volcanic gases during a period of eight months. The volcanic gases and aerosols spread across the northern hem sphere due to ideal weather conditions and had a substantial impact on the environment, human health and also climate effects. This, so called dry fog, caused severe health problems, which led to death <b>casualties,</b> killing <b>animals,</b> crops and other vegetation. The consequence was a widespread famine which was aggravated by a hard and long winter in 1783 / 84. Analysis shows that the Icelandic volcanoes are the primary risk to produce dry fog that can affect Sweden. The fog will most likely cause severe health effects, such as respiratory and cardiovascular problems. It will also cause damage to the vegetation, especially coniferous trees, and it may affect the water by acid chock. The fog may have great impact on the critical infrastructure in Sweden, depending on magnitude and duration. These types of volcanic hazards are difficult to predict and evaluate due to their sporadic nature and the sparse amount of data that is available. It is therefore important to focus on the consequences and develop the Swedish community preparedness on a general basis to handle this type of event...|$|R
40|$|Lanchester's {{models of}} {{attrition}} describe casualty rates during battles between groups as {{functions of the}} numbers of individuals and their fighting abilities. Originally developed to describe human warfare, Lanchester's square law has been hypothesized to apply broadly to social animals as well, with important consequences for their aggressive behaviour and social structure. According to the square law, the fighting ability of a group {{is proportional to the}} square of the number of individuals, but rises only linearly with fighting ability of individuals within the group. By analyzing mortality rates of fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) fighting in different numerical ratios, we provide the first quantitative test of Lanchester's model for a non-human <b>animal.</b> <b>Casualty</b> rates of fire ants were not consistent with the square law; instead, group fighting ability was an approximately linear function of group size. This implies that the relative numbers of casualties incurred by two fighting groups are not strongly affected by relative group sizes and that battles do not disproportionately favour group size over individual prowess...|$|R
40|$|Between 1999 and 2004, 160 badger {{carcasses}} (mainly road <b>casualties</b> and culled <b>animals)</b> {{were collected}} in a 600 -km 2 rural area of Western Switzerland (Broye region). Body and fur inspections indicated that 88. 4 % of the animals were infested {{with at least one}} of the following ectoparasite categories: lice (76. 0 %), ticks (57. 5 %) and fleas (19. 7 %). Nevertheless, the number of parasites was low, in average 2. 6 fleas, 4. 8 ticks and/or 17. 1 lice per infested animal. No significant intersexual and age-related differences (adults vs subadults, adults vs young) were found as concerns prevalence and abundance of ectoparasites. The lower, and more constant infection by fleas in the course of the year, is concordant with the hypothesis which proposes that badgers frequently switch sleeping places in order to avoid a build up of ectoparasites in the nest material. It remains unclear whether the low loads of ticks and lice recorded in both low and high density badger populations are due to the efficiency of auto- and allo-grooming in this species, to frequent replacement or aeration of the bedding material by individual badgers, or to another, yet to be discovered mechanism. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these results are therefore indicative of a limited role of Eurasian badgers as a potential reservoir of diseases transmitted by ectoparasites...|$|R
50|$|A Missouri Osage {{tradition}} {{tells the}} story of an incursion by a diverse group of monsters into the area. The monsters marched along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers from the east. Their arrival infuriated the local wildlife, who grew so violent that the natives were afraid to go out hunting. The animals and monsters waged a colossal war in a valley near a bluff called Rocky Ridge. After the fighting ended, the monsters continued their journey west. Other battles in the war between the animals and monsters occurred at the Pomme de Terre and Osage Rivers. When the fighting concluded the Osage people offered many of the <b>animal</b> <b>casualties</b> as a burnt offerings to the Great Spirit, who buried some of the carcasses in the Osage and Big Bone Rivers. This tale was commemorated by annual offerings performed at a table rock overlooking the Big Bone River. This story reflects the locals' interpretations of the abundant remains of animals like giant beavers, horses, mastodons, oxen, and giant ground sloths found in Missouri's river valleys. The details in the story about the remains being burnt or buried in the river reflects their preservation. Some of the fossils were burnt and others {{can be found on the}} river bed. One site later excavated by Albert Koch had burned bones associated with ashes. Lignite has lent some of the local fossils a black color which would give such specimens a burnt appearance.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to report data on wildlife-vehicle {{collisions}} (WVC) in Wallonia, southern Belgium, characterised by one of the densest road network worldwide. With the collaboration of police we identified 3965 accidents involving “free ranging animal” between 2003 and 2011. We observed that these accidents with free ranging animals result in 13 % of cases in injuries for the drivers or passengers, and in less than 1 % of cases in fatalities (death). 78 % of these <b>casualties</b> involve wild <b>animals,</b> among which wild boar take the largest part (39 %). During the covered period we observed an annual increase of WVC of 21 %. For wild boar and red deer, this increase was significantly correlated with hunting statistics, used as an index of population density. The temporal analysis demonstrated an increase of WVC during night time with peak of accidents at dusk and dawn. Monthly distribution revealed the role of breeding, dispersal and hunting in shaping temporal patterns of accidents. Spatial analysis, focusing on wild boar, roe deer, red deer and red fox demonstrated clustering of accidents for all these species, until scale between 20 to 70 km. Mapping of accidents via Kernel density analysis permitted us to highlight areas with high risk of WVC risk. Our study suggests that the problem of car accidents due to wildlife is an increasing concern in Wallonia but results on spatial and temporal patterns should help for setting up mitigation measures in the most sensible areas. Moreover we suggest that police data source should be used for nationwide analysis and for comparison between countries...|$|R
