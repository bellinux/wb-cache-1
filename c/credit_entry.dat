2500|$|When medieval Europe moved {{towards a}} {{monetary}} {{economy in the}} 13th century, sedentary merchants depended on bookkeeping to oversee multiple simultaneous transactions financed by bank loans. One important breakthrough took place around that time: the introduction of double-entry bookkeeping, which is defined as any bookkeeping system {{in which there was}} a debit and <b>credit</b> <b>entry</b> for each transaction, or for which the majority of transactions were intended to be of this form. The historical origin of the use of the words [...] "debit" [...] and [...] "credit" [...] in accounting goes {{back to the days of}} single-entry bookkeeping, which had as its chief objective keeping track of amounts owed by customers (debtors) and amounts owed to creditors. Debit in Latin means [...] "he owes" [...] and credit in Latin means [...] "he trusts".|$|E

50|$|In double entry bookkeeping, debits and credits (abbreviated Dr and Cr, respectively) are entries made in account ledgers {{to record}} changes in value {{resulting}} from business transactions. Generally speaking, the source {{account for the}} transaction is credited (that is, an entry is made {{on the right side}} of the account's ledger) and the destination account is debited (that is, an entry is made on the left side). Total debits must equal total credits for each transaction; individual transactions may require multiple debit and <b>credit</b> <b>entries</b> to record.|$|R

5000|$|Double-entry {{bookkeeping}}, in accounting, is {{a system}} of bookkeeping so named because every entry to an account requires a corresponding and opposite entry to a different account. For instance, recording earnings of $100 would require making two entries: a debit entry of $100 to an account named [...] "Cash" [...] and a <b>credit</b> <b>entry</b> of $100 to an account named [...] "Revenue." ...|$|E
50|$|An {{error of}} {{original}} entry is when {{both sides of}} a transaction include the wrong amount. For example, if a purchase invoice for £21 is entered as £12, this will result in an incorrect debit entry (to purchases), and an incorrect <b>credit</b> <b>entry</b> (to the relevant creditor account), both for £9 less, so the total of both columns will be £9 less, and will thus balance.|$|E
50|$|A bank counts a {{nostro account}} with a debit balance as a cash asset in its balance sheet. Conversely, a vostro account {{with a credit}} balance (i.e. a deposit) is a liability, and a vostro with a debit balance (a loan) is an asset. Thus in many banks a <b>credit</b> <b>entry</b> on an account ("CR") is {{regarded}} as negative movement, and a debit ("DR") is positive - the reverse of usual commercial accounting conventions.|$|E
50|$|In an {{electronic}} settlement system, electronic settlement takes place between participants. If a non-participant wishes to settle its interests, it {{must do so}} through a participant acting as a custodian. The interests of participants are recorded by <b>credit</b> <b>entries</b> in securities accounts maintained in their names by the operator of the system. It permits both quick and efficient settlement by removing the need for paperwork, and the simultaneous delivery of securities with the payment of a corresponding cash sum (called delivery versus payment, or DVP) in the agreed upon currency.|$|R

25|$|In double entry bookkeeping, debits and credits (abbreviated Dr and Cr, respectively) are entries made in account ledgers {{to record}} changes in value {{resulting}} from business transactions. Generally speaking, the sources for spending money in transaction account is credit (that is, an entry is {{made on the}} right side of the account's ledger) and what the money obtained with the credits is destined as debit in transaction accounts (that is, an entry is made on the left side). The credits here could be share capital, revenues, etc. and The debits here could be assests, dividends, etc. From a technical point of view the sides refer to the balance sheet placement of accounts. Total debits must equal total credits for each transaction; individual transactions may require multiple debit and <b>credit</b> <b>entries</b> to record.|$|R

Unlike today's lotteries, people would not accept the lottery sponsors making large profits.|$|E

50|$|These {{are some}} simple examples, {{but even the}} most {{complicated}} transactions can be recorded in a similar way. This equation is behind debits, <b>credits,</b> and journal <b>entries.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{a certain}} period, {{typically}} a month, each column in each journal is totalled {{to give a}} summary for that period. Using the rules of double-entry, these journal summaries are then transferred to their respective accounts in the ledger, or account book. For example, the entries in the Sales Journal are taken and a debit entry is made in each customer's account (showing that the customer now owes us money), and a <b>credit</b> <b>entry</b> might {{be made in the}} account for [...] "Sale of class 2 widgets" [...] (showing that this activity has generated revenue for us). This process of transferring summaries or individual transactions to the ledger is called posting. Once the posting process is complete, accounts kept using the [...] "T" [...] format undergo balancing, which is simply a process to arrive at the balance of the account.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{financial}} transaction is recorded {{in at least}} two different nominal ledger accounts within the financial accounting system, so that the total debits equals the total credits in the General Ledger, i.e. the accounts balance. This is a partial check that each and every transaction has been correctly recorded. The transaction is recorded as a [...] "debit entry" [...] (Dr) in one account, and a [...] "credit entry" [...] (Cr) in a second account. The debit entry will be recorded on the debit side (left-hand side) of a General ledger account, and the <b>credit</b> <b>entry</b> will be recorded on the credit side (right-hand side) of a General ledger account. If the total of the entries on the debit side of one account is greater than the total on the credit side of the same nominal account, that account is said to have a debit balance.|$|E
5000|$|A bank {{transaction}} tax {{is a tax}} levied on debit (and/or credit) entries on bank accounts. In 1989, at the Buenos Aires {{meetings of}} the International Institute of Public Finance, University of Wisconsin-Madison Professor of Economics Edgar L. Feige proposed extending the tax reform ideas of John Maynard Keynes, James Tobin [...] and Lawrence Summers, [...] to their logical conclusion, namely to tax all transactions.. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax (APT tax) proposed taxing the broadest possible tax base at the lowest possible tax rate[...] [...] Since all transactions must ultimately {{be paid for by}} a final means of payment, namely via a transfer from a bank account or by settlement with currency, Feige proposed collecting his tax by levying the tax automatically on the debit and credit entries to bank accounts thereby splitting the tax between the buyer and seller of every transaction. The APT tax is a uniform flat rate tax on all transactions, assessed and collected automatically whenever there is a debit or <b>credit</b> <b>entry</b> to a bank account. As such, it is {{can be viewed as a}} bank transaction tax. Since financial transactions account for the greatest component of the APT tax base, and since all financial transactions are taxed, the proposal eliminates substitution possibilities for evasion and avoidance. The goal of the APT tax is to significantly improve economic efficiency, enhance stability in financial markets, and reduce to a minimum the costs of tax administration (assessment, collection, and compliance costs). The Automated Payment Transaction tax proposal was presented to the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform in 2005. It can be automatically collected by a central counterparty in the clearing or settlement process.|$|E
