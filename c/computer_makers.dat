25|$|In July 2007, the European Commission accused Intel of {{anti-competitive}} practices, mostly against AMD. The allegations, {{going back}} to 2003, include giving preferential prices to <b>computer</b> <b>makers</b> buying {{most or all of}} their chips from Intel, paying <b>computer</b> <b>makers</b> to delay or cancel the launch of products using AMD chips, and providing chips at below standard cost to governments and educational institutions. Intel responded that the allegations were unfounded and instead qualified its market behavior as consumer-friendly. General counsel Bruce Sewell responded that the Commission had misunderstood some factual assumptions as to pricing and manufacturing costs.|$|E

25|$|The {{continued}} {{rise and}} increasing {{sophistication of the}} graphics processing unit were crucial to this decade, and 3D rendering capabilities became a standard feature as 3D-graphics GPUs became considered a necessity for desktop <b>computer</b> <b>makers</b> to offer. The Nvidia GeForce line of graphics cards dominated {{the market in the}} early decade with occasional significant competing presence from ATI. As the decade progressed, even low-end machines usually contained a 3D-capable GPU of some kind as Nvidia and AMD both introduced low-priced chipsets and continued to dominate the market. Shaders which had been introduced in the 1980s to perform specialized processing on the GPU would {{by the end of the}} decade become supported on most consumer hardware, speeding up graphics considerably and allowing for greatly improved texture and shading in computer graphics via the widespread adoption of normal mapping, bump mapping, and a variety of other techniques allowing the simulation of a great amount of detail.|$|E
