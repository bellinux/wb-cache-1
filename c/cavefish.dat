5|$|Understanding {{the changes}} that have {{occurred}} during an organism's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body, genes which may be involved in human genetic disorders. For example, the Mexican tetra is an albino <b>cavefish</b> that lost its eyesight during evolution. Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves. This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation.|$|E

The more than 200 scientifically {{described}} species of obligate <b>cavefish</b> are found on all continents, except Antarctica. Although widespread as a group, many <b>cavefish</b> species have very small ranges and are seriously threatened. <b>Cavefish</b> are members of a wide range of families and do not form a monophyletic group. Typical adaptations found in <b>cavefish</b> are reduced eyes and pigmentation.|$|E
25|$|Caves in {{some parts}} of the world have been protected, which can {{safeguard}} the <b>cavefish.</b> In a few cases such as the Omani blind <b>cavefish</b> (Oman garra), zoos have initiated breeding programs as a safeguard. In contrast to the rarer species, the cave form of the Mexican tetra is easily bred in captivity and widely available to aquarists. This is the most studied <b>cavefish</b> species and likely also the most studied cave organism overall. As of 2006, only six other <b>cavefish</b> species have been bred in captivity, typically by scientists.|$|E

40|$|Caves {{and other}} {{subterranean}} habitats represent {{one of the}} most challenging environments on the planet. Other than salamanders, bony fishes are the only vertebrate group that has successfully colonized and are completely restricted to those habitats. Despite being known to science for over 150 years, only recently have <b>cavefishes</b> become model systems for evolutionary studies. Several <b>cavefishes,</b> such as the Mexican characid Astyanax mexicanus, have provided valuable insights into how fishes have evolved to cope with life in perpetual darkness and often-limited food resources. Much less is known about the biology of other <b>cavefishes</b> and their sensory modalities. Here, we summarize the current understanding of nonvisual sensory modalities in <b>cavefishes.</b> Enhancement of mechanosensation appears to be the most common adaptive strategy, but little is known of other sensory modalities in these fishes. Only comparative studies nested within well-resolved phylogenies will clarify the sensory adaptation of fishes to subterranean habitats...|$|R
40|$|AbSTRACT Troglobitic <b>cavefishes</b> of {{the genus}} Typhleotris, endemic to coastal southwestern Mada-gascar, are taxonomically {{reviewed}} and a new darkly pigmented species, Typhleotris mara-rybe, is described from an isolated karst sinkhole on the coastal plain below the Mahafaly Plateau. The new species, known only from Grotte de Vitane (Vitany) {{near the town of}} Itampolo, is unique among blind <b>cavefishes</b> in being uniformly darkly pigmented, rather than fully depigmented or exceptionally light in coloration. In addition to its dark coloration (vs. depigmented, translucent white body in congeners), the new species can be distinguished from its two congeners, Typhleotris madagascariensis and T. pauliani, by the sculpted, bony (vs. fleshy) appearance of its head with strongly protruding lateral ethmoid, sphenotic, and pterotic bones, and an elevated vertebral count...|$|R
25|$|The {{more than}} 200 scientifically {{described}} obligate <b>cavefish</b> species {{are found in}} most continents, but there are strong geographic patterns and the species richness varies. The vast majority of species {{are found in the}} tropics or subtropics. <b>Cavefish</b> are strongly linked to regions with karst, which commonly result in underground sinkholes and subterranean rivers.|$|E

5000|$|Subterranean fauna {{is found}} {{worldwide}} and includes representatives of many animal groups, mostly arthropods and other invertebrates.

40|$|The {{constant}} {{darkness of}} caves and other subterranean habitats imposes sensory constraints {{that offer a}} unique opportunity to examine evolution of sensory modalities. Hearing in <b>cavefishes</b> has not been well explored, and here we show that <b>cavefishes</b> in the family Amblyopsidae are not only blind but have also lost a significant portion of their hearing range. Our results showed that cave and surface amblyopsids shared the same audiogram profile at low frequencies but only surface amblyopsids were able to hear frequencies higher than 800 Hz and up to 2 kHz. We measured ambient noise in aquatic cave and surface habitats and found high intensity peaks near 1 kHz for streams underground, suggesting no adaptive advantage in hearing in those frequencies. In addition, cave amblyopsids had lower hair cell densities compared with their surface relative. These traits may have evolved in response to the loud high-frequency background noise found in subterranean pools and streams. This study represents the first report of auditory regression in a subterranean organism...|$|R
50|$|As a {{graduate}} student at the University of Miami, Romero specialized on the study of the evolution, behavior, and ecology of <b>cavefishes.</b> Through these studies he was the first to propose that colonization of cave environments was an active process via behavioral adaptations preceding morphological ones (e.g. blindness and depigmentation). Later he proposed a new hypothesis aimed at explaining the mechanisms leading towards the loss of eyes and pigmentation among these and other cave animals. He suggested that the mechanism behind this phenomenon was a little understood biological process at the time called phenotypic plasticity. This challenged the typological view of all cave creatures as completely differentiated from a genetic viewpoint from their surface (epigean) ancestors. According to Romero all what was needed for the evolution of drastically morphologically distinct cave species were just a few changes in the genes controlling the development of features such as eyes and pigmentation. These and other ideas were summarized in a book.|$|R
25|$|There {{are about}} 100 species of {{freshwater}} fish in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic. Among the endemic, the cave-dwelling Somali blind barb and the Somali <b>cavefish</b> can be found.|$|E
25|$|In {{the dark}} habitat, {{certain types of}} {{displays}} are reduced in <b>cavefish,</b> but in other cases they have become stronger, shifting from displays that are aimed at being seen to displays aimed at being felt via water movement. For example, during the courtship of the cave form of the Mexican tetra the pair produce turbulence through exaggerated gill and mouth movements, allowing them to detect each other. Breeding behaviors among <b>cavefish</b> vary extensively, and there are both species that are egg-layers and ovoviparous species that give birth to live young. Uniquely among fish, the genus Amblyopsis brood their eggs in the gill chambers (somewhat like mouthbrooders).|$|E
25|$|Blind <b>cavefish</b> {{are rarely}} {{seen in the}} larger of Wyandotte Caves, as it is very dry in modern times. Little Wyandotte Cave, however, is much wetter than the {{historic}} cave, but still contains no fish. The only living aquatic life found is bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Gobies {{are spread}} {{all over the world}} in {{tropical}} and temperate near shore-marine, brackish and freshwater environments. Their range extends from the Old World coral reefs to the seas of the New World, and includes the rivers and near-shore habitats of Europe and Asia. Gobies are generally bottom-dwellers. Although many live in borrows, a few species (in genera Caecogobius, Glossogobius and Luciogobius) are true <b>cavefish.</b> On coral reefs, gobies constitute 35% {{of the total number of}} fishes and 20% of the species diversity.|$|E
25|$|With {{more than}} 120 {{described}} species, {{by far the}} greatest diversity is in Asia, followed by more than 30 species in South America and about 30 species in North America. In contrast, only 9 species are known from Africa, 5 from Oceania, and 1 from Europe. On a country level, China has the greatest diversity with more than 80 species, followed by Brazil with more than 20 species. India, Mexico, Thailand and the United States of America each have 9â€“12 species. No other country has more than 4 <b>cavefish</b> species.|$|E

500|$|Each {{criterion}} has exceptions. Tuna, swordfish, {{and some}} species of sharks show some warm-blooded adaptationsâ€”they can heat their bodies significantly above ambient water temperature. Streamlining and swimming performance varies from fish such as tuna, salmon, and jacks that can cover 10â€“20 body-lengths per second to {{species such as}} eels and rays that swim no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second. Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air {{as well as from}} the water using a variety of different structures. Lungfish have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, gouramis have a structure called the labyrinth organ that performs a similar function, while many catfish, such as Corydoras extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach. Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable, covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as seahorses, pufferfish, anglerfish, and gulpers. Similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked (as in moray eels), or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as placoid (typical of sharks and rays), cosmoid (fossil lungfish and coelacanths), ganoid (various fossil fish but also living gars and bichirs), cycloid, and ctenoid (these last two are found on most bony fish). There are even fish that live mostly on land or lay their eggs on land near water. Mudskippers feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows. A single, an undescribed species of Phreatobius, has been called a true [...] "land fish" [...] as this worm-like catfish strictly lives among waterlogged leaf litter. Many species live in underground lakes, underground rivers or aquifers and are popularly known as <b>cavefish.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Being underground, {{many places}} where <b>cavefish</b> may live {{have not been}} {{thoroughly}} surveyed. New <b>cavefish</b> species are described with some regularity and undescribed species are known. As a consequence, the number of known <b>cavefish</b> species has risen rapidly in recent decades. In the early 1990s only about 50 species were known, in 2010 about 170 species were known, and by 2015 this had surpassed 200 species. It {{has been estimated that}} the final number might be around 250 obligate <b>cavefish</b> species. For example, the first <b>cavefish</b> in Europe, a Barbatula stone loach, was only discovered in 2015 in Southern Germany. Conversely, their unusual appearance means that some <b>cavefish</b> already attracted attention in ancient times. The oldest known description of an obligate <b>cavefish,</b> involving Sinocyclocheilus hyalinus, [...] is almost 500 years old.|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>cavefish</b> as a {{group are}} found {{throughout}} {{large parts of the}} world, many <b>cavefish</b> species have tiny ranges (often restricted to a single cave or cave system) and are seriously threatened. For example, the Alabama <b>cavefish</b> is only found in the Key Cave and the entire population has been estimated at less than 100 individuals, while the golden cave catfish only is found in the Aigamas cave in Namibia and has an estimated population of less than 400 individuals. The Haditha <b>cavefish</b> from Iraq and the Oaxaca cave sleeper from Mexico may already be extinct, as recent surveys have failed to find them. In some other cases, such as the Brazilian blind characid which went unrecorded by ichthyologists from 1962 to 2004, the apparent [...] "rarity" [...] was likely {{because of a lack of}} surveys in its range and habitat, as locals considered it relatively common until the early 1990s (more recently, this species appears to truly have declined significantly). Living in very stable environments, <b>cavefish</b> are likely more vulnerable to changes in the water (for example, temperature or oxygen) than fish of aboveground habitats which naturally experience greater variations. The main threats to <b>cavefish</b> are typically changes in the water level (mainly through water extraction or drought), habitat degradation and pollution, but in some cases introduced species and collection for the aquarium trade also present a threat. <b>Cavefish</b> often show little fear of humans and can sometimes be caught with the bare hands. Most <b>cavefish</b> lack natural predators, although larger <b>cavefish</b> may feed on smaller individuals, and cave-living crayfish, crabs, giant water bugs and spiders have been recorded feeding on a few species of <b>cavefish.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cavefish</b> {{are quite}} small with most species being less than [...] long {{and very few}} able to surpass [...] At up to about , the blind cave eel is the longest known <b>cavefish.</b> The very limited food {{resources}} in the habitat likely prevents larger <b>cavefish</b> species from existing and also means that <b>cavefish</b> in general are opportunistic feeders, taking whatever is available. In their habitat, <b>cavefish</b> are often the top predators, feeding on smaller cave-living invertebrates, or are detritivores without enemies. <b>Cavefish</b> typically have low metabolic rates and {{may be able to}} survive long periods of starvation. A captive Phreatobius cisternarum did not feed for a year, but remained in good condition. The cave form of the Mexican tetra can build up unusually large fat reserves by [...] "binge eating" [...] in periods where food is available, which then (together with its low metabolic rate) allows it to survive without food for months, much longer than the aboveground form of the species.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{aboveground}} fish {{may enter}} caves on occasion, but obligate <b>cavefish</b> (fish that require underground habitats) are extremophiles {{with a number}} of unusual adaptations known as troglomorphism. In some species, notably the Mexican tetra, shortfin molly, Oman garra, Indoreonectes evezardi and a few catfish, both [...] "normal" [...] aboveground and <b>cavefish</b> forms exist. Many adaptions seen in <b>cavefish</b> are aimed at surviving in a habitat with little food. Living in darkness, pigmentation and eyes are useless, or an actual disadvantage because of their energy requirements, and therefore typically reduced in <b>cavefish.</b> Other examples of adaptations are larger fins for more energy-efficient swimming, and a loss of scales and swim bladder. The loss can be complete or only partial, for example resulting in small or incomplete (but still existing) eyes, and eyes can be present in the earliest life stages but degenerated by the adult stage. In some cases, [...] "blind" [...] <b>cavefish</b> may still be able to see: Juvenile Mexican tetras of the cave form are able to sense light via certain cells in the pineal gland (pineal eye), and Congo blind barbs are photophobic, despite only having retinas and optical nerves that are rudimentary and located deep inside the head, and completely lacking a lens. In the most extreme cases, the lack of light has changed the circadian rhythm (24-hour internal body clock) of the <b>cavefish.</b> In the Mexican tetra of the cave form and in Phreatichthys andruzzii the circadian rhythm lasts 30 hours and 47 hours, respectively. This may help them to save energy. Without sight, other senses are used and these may be enhanced. Examples include the lateral line for sensing vibrations, mouth suction to sense nearby obstacles (comparable to echolocation), and chemoreception (via smell and taste buds). Although there are <b>cavefish</b> in groups known to have electroreception (catfish and South American knifefish), there is no published evidence that this is enhanced in the cave-dwellers. The level of specialized adaptations in a <b>cavefish</b> is generally considered to be directly correlated to the amount of time it has been restricted to the underground habitat, with species that recently arrived showing few adaptations and species with the largest number of adaptations likely being the ones restricted to the habitat for the longest time.|$|E
2500|$|Although many <b>cavefish</b> {{species are}} {{restricted}} to underground lakes, pools or rivers in actual caves, some are found in aquifers and may only be detected by humans when artificial wells are dug into this layer. Most live in areas with low (essentially static) or moderate water current, {{but there are also}} species in places with very strong [...] current, such as the waterfall climbing <b>cavefish.</b> Underground waters are often very stable environments with limited variations in temperature (typically near the annual average of the surrounding region), nutrient levels and other factors. Organic compounds generally only occur in low levels and rely on outside sources, such as contained in water that enters the underground habitat from outside, aboveground animals that find their way into caves (deliberately or by mistake) and guano from bats that roost in caves. <b>Cavefish</b> are primarily restricted to freshwater. A few species, notably the cave-dwelling brotulas, Luciogobius gobies, Milyeringa sleeper gobies and the blind cave eel, live in anchialine caves and several of these tolerate various salinities.|$|E

2500|$|Obligate <b>cavefish</b> {{are known}} {{from a wide}} range of {{families}}: Characidae (characids), Balitoridae (hillstream loaches), Cobitidae (true loaches), Cyprinidae (carps and allies), Nemacheilidae (stone loaches), Amblycipitidae (torrent catfishes), Astroblepidae (naked sucker-mouth catfishes), Callichthyidae (armored catfishes), Clariidae (airbreathing catfishes), Heptapteridae (heptapterid catfishes), Ictaluridae (ictalurid catfishes), Kryptoglanidae (kryptoglanid catfish), Loricariidae (loricariid catfishes), Phreatobiidae (phreatobiid catfishes), Trichomycteridae (pencil catfishes), Sternopygidae (glass knifefishes), Amblyopsidae (U.S. cavefishes), Bythitidae (brotulas), Poeciliidae (live-bearers), Synbranchidae (swamp eels), Cottidae (true sculpins), Eleotridae (sleeper gobies) and Gobiidae (gobies). Many of these families are only very distantly related and do not form a monophyletic group, showing that adaptations to a life in caves has happened numerous times among fish. As such, the descriptive term [...] "cavefish" [...] is an example of folk taxonomy rather than scientific taxonomy. Strictly speaking some Cyprinodontidae (pupfish) are also known from sinkhole caves, famously including the Devils Hole pupfish, but these lack the adaptations (e.g., reduced eyes and pigmentation) typically associated with <b>cavefish.</b> Additionally, species from a few families such as Chaudhuriidae (earthworm eels), Glanapteryginae and Sarcoglanidinae live buried in the bottom of aboveground waters, and can show adaptions similar to traditional underground-living (troglobitic) fish. It has been argued that such species should be recognized as a part of the group of troglobitic fish.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} aquatic life, the Congo River Basin {{has a very}} high species richness, and among the highest known {{concentrations}} of endemics. Until now, almost 700 fish species have been recorded from the Congo River Basin, and large sections remain virtually unstudied. This {{is by far the}} highest diversity of any African river system (in comparison, the next richest are the Niger, Volta and Nile with about 210, 140 and 130 fish species, respectively). Due to this and the great ecological differences between the regions in the Congo basin, it is often divided into multiple ecoregions (instead of treating it as a single ecoregion). Among these ecoregions, the Lower Congo Rapids alone has more than 300 fish species, including approximately 80 endemics while the southwestern part (Kasai Basin) alone has more than 200 fish species, of which about a quarter are endemic. The dominant fish families â€“ at least in parts of the river â€“ are Cyprinidae (carp/cyprinids, such as Labeo simpsoni), Mormyridae (elephantfishes), Alestidae (African tetras), Mochokidae (squeaker catfishes), and Cichlidae (cichlids). Among the natives in the river is the huge, highly carnivorous giant tigerfish. Three of the more unusual endemics are the whitish (non-pigmented) and blind Lamprologus lethops, which is believed to live as deep as [...] below the surface, Heterochromis multidens, which appears to be more closely related to cichlids of the Americas than other African cichlids, and Caecobarbus geertsii, the only known <b>cavefish</b> in Central Africa.
