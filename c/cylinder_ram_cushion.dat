40|$|This {{report was}} written {{as a result}} of a Bachelor Degree Project, {{together}} with Swepart Transmission AB. The report contains the construction of a hydraulic press for the assembly operation. The project started with a new construction of a hydraulic press for the bearings’ assembly. The goal within the thesis work was to fit the three bearings to the housing by only one press motion. This operation should be very safety because of the sensitive tolerance at the bearings and housing. Construction of the <b>cylinders,</b> <b>rams</b> and bolster were the most important parts at this project because this parts’ functions are very important for this assembly. The next step of this thesis was to calculate the hydraulic press components’ parameters and then choose the suitable components. The focus was to choose more useful and reliable components. The hydraulic press was modeled in the CAD program Solid Works and 2 D technical drawing was drawn in the Autocad. The frame material was chosen and the frame was analysised in the Solid Works...|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic rams BOPs were in {{use by the}} 1940s. Hydraulically {{actuated}} blowout preventers {{had many}} potential advantages.

Relatively rapid actuation and remote control were facilitated, and hydraulic rams were well-suited to high pressure wells.|$|R
30|$|For {{the static}} bending test, a {{universal}} testing machine of 200 -kN capacity (made by Tokyokoki Seizosho Ltd.) {{was used for the}} 100 -kN range. Third-point loading was applied with a total span of 360  cm. The total span deflection of green round timber was measured using the CDP- 100 displacement gauge with 10 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The displacement gauge was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection. The targeted duration of testing was 5  min. The apparent Young’s modulus was obtained based on the total span deflection, and calculated at the middle circumference of the round timber. The bending strength was calculated at the circumference of a failure part from the ratio of the mid-length circumference to the circumference at the loading point. However, 9 of the 40 green round timbers did not show failure, even at the extension limit of the testing machine’s <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder.</b> For these specimens, load at the extension limit of the test machine’s <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder</b> was considered the maximum load. For the air-dried round timber, the total span deflection was measured using the rolled-in type DP- 500 E displacement gauge with 50 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The displacement gauge was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection of air-dried round timber. All air-dried round timbers failed within the extension limit of the <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R

Entirely at his own expense, he commissioned this machine from the Leeds firm of Greenwood & Batley, closely supervising its production. Aggrieved over the slow rate of manufacture, after fifteen months he had it delivered to London still unfinished, in September 1865. The testing machine is 47 feet 7 inches long, weighs some 116 tons, and was designed to work horizontally, the load applied by a hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> and <b>ram.</b> The machine is still held in working order at the Kirkaldy Museum in Southwark.|$|R
5000|$|A coolpower setup {{in a truck}} engine uses an {{aftercooler}} on {{the cylinder}} head and a tip turbine fan to draw heat away from the <b>cylinder</b> head and <b>ram</b> air over the aftercooler. Large Mack trucks from the 1970s such as the Mack R-600 used coolpower systems. Some coolpower systems used vertical bar shutters that could be opened and shut {{in front of the}} radiator to maintain proper operating temperature.|$|R
5000|$|The opened valves port high {{pressure}} hydraulic fluid to the ″Hydraulic Ram Cylinder″ in the Slide behind the tray. The <b>Ram</b> <b>Cylinder</b> {{is connected to}} the [...] "Rammer Cross Head". (The white horizontal bar behind the Spade in the picture.) The Cross Head supports the Rammer Spade as it moves in the tray. When the cylinder is pressurized, the Cross Head and Spade are driven forward in the Tray.|$|R

As it approaches breech, the Cross Head pushes through a spring latch that locks it there. At the same time, the Cross Head trips another lever connected to the Rammer Controller, and the Controller releases the hydraulic pressure to the <b>Ram</b> <b>Cylinder.</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} a new drawing technology, {{based on}} a synchronized Movement of <b>ram</b> and <b>cushion</b> with multiple bending operations in alternating directions called "bi-directional deep drawing (BDD). " The goal is to avoid local thinning by strengthening the weak point using local hardening. BDD operations are realized before the conventional deep drawing process. This results in a local strain hardening at the weak point of the workpiece, which is usually located at the bottom punch radius. Two major aspects have to be given attention due to {{the high number of}} process parameters. On the one hand, for process design, it is helpful to have a tool by means of which it is possible to simultaneously create both the machine program for the servo press and the initial configuration for the process simulation. From the authors' point of view, this complexity can only be represented by a numerical analysis method, on the other hand. Consequently, both aspects are given attention in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{systems are}} widely used {{in a variety of}} {{military}} applications including ground vehicles, aircraft, and weapon systems. The impact of corrosion on hydraulic systems and its components is well understood; however, the protection provided by different hydraulic fluids is not equal 1. Review of military vehicle hydraulic systems identified the most common occurrences of critical corrosion are found in hoses, hose end fittings, actuator arms, pistons, <b>cylinders,</b> and <b>rams</b> 1. To prevent corrosion in hydraulic systems, the U. S. Army has specified the use of hydraulic fluids with corrosion preventing and rust inhibiting characteristics for ground vehicles. Currently, the Army uses three different types of fluids in the hydraulic systems of military ground vehicles and equipment; MIL-PRF- 46170, MIL-PRF- 6083, and MIL-PRF- 2104.

40|$|Current {{sheet metal}} {{hydroforming}} processes require special {{equipment such as}} a hydroforming press with an external high pressure generator. This holds the barriers for entering the market high, especially for small and medium companies that cannot invest such an amount of money. In this article a method and tool design is presented that allows setting up a sheet metal hydroforming process on single action presses without using special hydroforming equipment. The inner pressure for forming the part is generated by tool integrated pistons and results from the difference between <b>ram</b> and <b>cushion</b> force {{in relation to the}} part's projected surface. To explore the limits of the process, a tryout tool was manufactured for producing test samples of medical parts in DX 54 D and AlMg 3 0. 6 mm. After the experiments, the parts were measured and analyzed to investigate the accuracy of the process, in comparison with the simulation done beforehand. This work will enable small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to produce small series hydroformed parts in a cost efficient way on their conventional presses...|$|R
40|$|The {{main reason}} for using {{mechanical}} servo presses is to improve productivity. The angular velocity of the drive shaft is adjusted between two points out of workpiece contact, i. e. bottom dead center and tool touch point which is 330 ° of crank angle. For example, the impact shock can be reduced with soft touch. The following paper shows numerical and experimental results of new deep drawing technologies with low-frequency pulsation of <b>ram</b> and <b>cushion.</b> The pulsation is superimposed during workpiece contact between tool touch point and bottom dead center. For materials with less hardening e. g. mild steel or some aluminum alloys the Cushion-Ram-Pulsation (CRP) is used to increase the drawing depth. The CRP process leads to a lower drawing force while opening the flange during the pulsation. Other kinematics called Bi-Directional Deep Drawing (BDD) induces work hardening {{at the beginning of}} the deep drawing process. Thus the strengthened area can resist higher drawing forces. The BDD process is suitable for materials with large hardening e. g. high strength or austenitic steels...|$|R
30|$|The load {{feedback}} {{function in}} the 250  t press is less favorable during high-temperature data collection; the sample height may change because of the uniaxial nature of the opposed anvil devices, as the hydraulic ram compresses the HPXMT module along the vertical axis. This results in blurry tomography images. We have implemented a precision linear-voltage displacement transducer and added an option for feedback on {{the position of the}} hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This option keeps the sample cell vertical movement to a minimum throughout the tomography data collection.|$|R
40|$|Retrofits of {{hydraulic}} {{and mechanical}} deep drawing presses often {{stop with the}} exchange of the electrical and the hydraulic parts. But that is only half the job. The use of high definition control electronics, faster CPUs and more dynamic hydraulic actuators, offers the opportunity of redesigning the already existing control concepts of the press. In this paper we present how {{the performance of the}} press, i. e. the control quality, can be increased for hydraulic <b>ram</b> and <b>cushion</b> axes. The improvement in control quality is achieved through the use of intelligent closed-loop and open-loopcontrol algorithms. Therefore, creasing and crack formation can be reduced, since enhancements in control quality have direct influence {{on the quality of the}} forming process. Results will be shown for hydraulic drawing cushion control, i. e. pressure control, as well as for hydraulic ram control, i. e. position, velocity and parallelism control. We present findings for hydraulic cushion control of a mechanical press type Arisa S- 4 - 1600 - 470 - 230 -LDE (link-drive press with 10 hydraulic cushions) and for ram- / cushion-control of hydraulic press type Müller-Weingarten ZE 2100 (multi-curve press with 8 -point cushion) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{testing machine}} is 47 ft long and weighs some [...] It works horizontally, the load applied by a {{hydraulic}} <b>cylinder</b> and <b>ram.</b> The working fluid is water not oil. The load {{is measured by}} a weighing system consisting {{of a number of}} levers with the final one carrying a jockey weight. The operator lets water into the hydraulic cylinder and as the pressure and hence load on the test piece increases the jockey weight is wound along to balance the hydraulic load. As it is wound it moves along a graduated scale and when the object under test fails the number on this scale is noted and multiplied by the weight to give the failure load. The weight can be varied in increments of 50 lb using slotted plates on a hanger. On the lower scale this reads up to 150 lb, and up to 1000 lb can be put onto the hanger. A separate jockey weight system above this one allowed the machine to measure loads of up to 1000000 lb.|$|R
5000|$|To {{inspect the}} engine, {{it can be}} {{manually}} [...] "barred over" [...] with a lever, but manual engine rotation is slow and inefficient. In some applications manually barring the engine over can be difficult or impossible. The preferred tool for engine rotation is an electrically powered, hydraulically operated [...] "turning jack". The turning jack uses a hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> and <b>ram</b> assembly that automatically advances to engage {{a hole in the}} flywheel. When the ram reaches its limit, it automatically retracts and advances again to engage another hole. The engine is then progressively rotated through its cycle and can be rotated in either direction by installing the jack {{on either side of the}} engine. Not only is a turning jack faster and more efficient, it is also safer since there is no risk of a barring lever coming loose and causing injury or damage. Also, with a turning jack, there is no need for the mechanic to be in physical contact with the engine at any point during the inspection process.|$|R
50|$|A jigger {{works like}} a pulley block, but in reverse. Rather than turning an easy pull on a rope into a {{powerful}} lift, the jigger uses the powerful force of a hydraulic ram, but limited in how far it can travel, to pull a long length of chain. The chain is looped several times lengthwise around the <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder,</b> running {{over a number of}} pulleys at each end. When the cylinder moves, the pull {{on the end of the}} chain is multiplied by the number of loops. The force of the jigger's pull is reduced similarly, according to how many times the chain was looped. As the cylinder had adequate power to begin with, and could simply be made larger in diameter when needed, this was not a significant limit on the jigger's force.|$|R
50|$|Each pendant {{has its own}} engine {{systems that}} absorb and dispel the {{energies}} developed when a landing aircraft is arrested. Carriers use hydro-pneumatic systems, each weighing 43 tons, wherein oil fluid is forced out of a <b>cylinder</b> by a <b>ram</b> (that {{is connected to the}} purchase cable) through a control valve. A major development in arresting gear was the constant runout control valve, which controls the fluid flow from the engine cylinder to the accumulator and is designed to stop all aircraft with the same amount of runout regardless of the weight and speed. The aircraft's weight is set by the arresting gear engine operator. The operator is given the weight of the aircraft by the air officer in Primary Flight Control. The operator then sets the Constant Runout Control Valve to the appropriate weight setting for that aircraft. The pressure setting for the arresting gear engine remains at a constant pressure of about 400 pounds per square inch. The constant runout valve (CROV) stops the aircraft (as opposed to hydraulic pressure).|$|R
40|$|Forming {{processes}} can {{be flexible}} adjusted on modern servo presses. So far, the ad-vantages {{lead to an}} increase in the productivity. For example, with servo presses once can make the idle stroke faster while the forming process is slower with soft touch of the forming tools onto the workpiece. Recent developments deal with the optimized movement of the <b>ram</b> and the <b>cushion</b> during the forming process to locally influence part properties or to extend forming limits. The tool design and interpretation of the processes can be supported by a systematic analysis of the influence of the parameter on the forming process. Within the present project advanced process models were developed, which consider the elastic characteristics of the machine during a sensitivity analysis of sheet metal forming processes. The advanced process models improve the prognosis of deep drawing process with variable motion paths. The developed sensitivity analysis based on current planning methods. The simulation tools were updated and automated to work with variable motion paths. Metamodels can be generated {{as a result of the}} sensitivity analysis, which approximate the system behavior of the process and the press machine for the selected configuration. Then optimal setting parameters for the process can be derived from the metamodel...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{upgrades}} {{available for the}} ProMaster. One upgrade that must be bought immediately is a bottom line setup, {{the most popular of}} these being an on/off valve style ASA (Air Source Adaptor) with a macroline hose. Any 45 style grips will fit it and all Autococker/Intimidator barrels will work as well. The feedneck is threaded into the body and can be replaced with any Bushmaster-style feed neck, such as the feednecks manufactured by AKALMP, CCM and ICDU. Another very popular upgrade among ProMaster users is the Indian Creek Designs Underground Cylinder Assembly. It consists of a new <b>cylinder</b> and <b>ram</b> unit as well as a Quick Exhaust Valve, or QEV and hose barb. The low pressure regulator pressure can be dropped significantly after this upgrade. This increases the ProMaster's air efficiency and cycle speed as well as reducing the amount of recoil felt when firing. Another advantage to adding the ICDU cylinder is the hammer can be removed {{out of the back of}} the gun, resulting in an easier maintenance process for the user. Other popular upgrades are replacement high pressure regulators, low pressure regulators and valves that offer higher air flow and consistency, resulting in higher paintball velocities at lower air pressures, thus increasing the ProMaster's efficiency. Aftermarket Micro-processor circuit boards are available from NOX, Kila Products and Vaporworks. The ProMaster shares the same circuit board type as the newer ICD Freestyles. Yet another popular upgrade is widely available on www.ebay.com. It is a delrin bolt link pin, which links the bolt to the ram hammer. It is very popular because it is light in weight, prevents scratching of the body and, is very inexpensive compared to most other upgrades available for the ProMaster. Delrin bolts are also available, however the stock bolt has proven to be a strong point of the gun because it is also made of delrin and no evidence of performance gains has been shown with the use of an upgraded bolt. New high flow solenoid valves are also available from ICDU website as well as Airsoldier.com ...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} propulsion and pyrotechnic {{test program}} has been in progress at the NASA White Sands Test Facility since 1995. This program created the capabilities to: accurately measure and characterize pyrovalve combustion product blow-by into propellant systems; characterize valve operation using a Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector (VISAR); and evaluate hydrazine and monomethylhydrazine thermal decomposition initiated by blow-by. These capabilities were further utilized and refined this year. Low blow-by pyrovalves manufactured by Conax Florida Corporation continued to be evaluated as a potential corrective measure for blow-by induced propellant explosions. Development and testing of various advanced pyrovalves and investigation of explosion mechanisms also continued. Current and near-term testing includes: evaluation of 3 / 8 in. Conax pyrovalves and other commercially available valves; development and testing of advanced pyrovalve subcomponent technologies including a zero blow-by pyrovalve ram, composite overwrapped <b>ram</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and a zero particulate generating poppet; investigation of non-destructive evaluation techniques to evaluate pyrovalve ram seals; and testing and modeling of pyrotechnically induced explosive hydrazine decomposition. Evaluation of 3 / 8 in. Conax valves will include operational margin testing to be accomplished at NASA Langley Research Center. The test program also seeks to compile and format significant amounts of data from this and other pyrovalve test programs to generate a pyrovalve applications handbook. The handbook will facilitate formation of standards that ensure safe spacecraft applications. Current data and future plans are discussed, and community interaction is encouraged...|$|R
