40|$|Land {{function}} {{change has}} been the focus of scientific research and policy making worldwide. Agricultural development and land use demand at present in China shared common characteristics with the countries such as Japan, South Korea, USA, and European developed countries, which have undergone <b>cultivated</b> land function transition. Whether <b>cultivated</b> land function transition occurred is of significance for land change science and <b>cultivated</b> land protection in China. However, there has been no explicit methodology for <b>cultivated</b> land function change research. This paper firstly presents a methodology by integrating policy development analysis based on the normative connotation of <b>cultivated</b> land function or termed <b>cultivated</b> land function demand and quantitative assessment based on the positive connotation of <b>cultivated</b> land function or termed <b>cultivated</b> land function supply. Then, <b>cultivated</b> land function transition is diagnosed by analyzing <b>cultivated</b> land function change in 1949 - 2012. Results show that <b>cultivated</b> land function transition overall occurred in 2006. Specifically, the normative <b>cultivated</b> land function or <b>cultivated</b> land function demand fragmented into seven types in 1985 and upgraded in 2004. Total value of the positive <b>cultivated</b> land function or <b>cultivated</b> land function supply turned to rise with an increase from 2. 40 to 2. 45 as the coefficients of variability (CV) of the value of the seven functions decreased from 2. 94 to 2. 29 in 2006 - 2012. The two-year gap between these two aspects of transition mainly resulted from the time lag effects of policy implementation. In the process of the transition, co-ordination and malposition of supply and demand of <b>cultivated</b> land function coexisted with supply lag and function morphology distortion. Considering the transition experiences in the developed countries mentioned above, suggestions on multifunctional <b>cultivated</b> land management are proposed. Moreover, route of land use transition research is discussed...|$|R

According to relevant data of <b>cultivated</b> land of Kunming City in 2006, taking the minimum per capita <b>cultivated</b> land and index model of <b>cultivated</b> land pressure, and combining with two conditions of per capita grain demand which are 300 kg and 400 kg, the comparative research method {{was used to}} calculate and analyze the minimum per capita <b>cultivated</b> land and index model of <b>cultivated</b> land pressure. The results show that when per capita grain demand-Gr is 300 kg, the per capita <b>cultivated</b> land in Kunming City has regional differences, reflects different regular patterns of spatial distribution, and presents obvious and typical radial distribution. Urban area of Kunming has the lowest point and be taken as the center, per capita <b>cultivated</b> land decreases progressively from suburban to the periphery; when per capita grain demand-Gr is 400 kg, under the same consumption level, <b>cultivated</b> land pressures of each county in Kunming City are different, {{and so are the}} driven factors; when per capita grain demand-Gr is 300 kg or 400 kg, the indexes of <b>cultivated</b> land pressure in Kunming are all greater than 1, <b>cultivated</b> land pressure is enormous, the indexes of <b>cultivated</b> land pressure of each county (district) have two conditionsâ€”greater than 1 and less than 2, and the reasons differ from one another.
