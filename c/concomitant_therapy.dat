The eradication rates according to intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were 93. 7 % (299 / 319) and 96. 4 % (297 / 308), respectively.

40|$|Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT 2) inhibitors are an {{attractive}} novel therapeutic {{option for the}} treatment of type 2 diabetes. They block the reabsorption of filtered glucose in kidneys, mainly in proximal renal tubules, resulting in increased urinary glucose excretion and correction of the diabetes-related hyperglycemia. Beyond improving glucose control, SGLT 2 inhibitors offer potential benefits by reducing body weight and blood pressure. On the basis of the efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials, SGLT 2 inhibitors are recommended as second- or third-line agents for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. Beneficial effects on kidney disease progression, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure have also been demonstrated with one SGLT 2 inhibitor (empagliflozin).

However, {{little is known about}} whether CQ could enhance the efficacy of cisplatin (DDP) in the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). In this study, we explore the efficacy and mechanism by which CQ affects DDP sensitivity in human ACC in vitro and in vivo. Methods: The autophagic gene Beclin- 1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the protein levels were analyzed using immunoblotting assays of ACC tissues and normal adrenal cortex tissues. The ACC SW 13 cells were treated with DDP and/or CQ. The cell viability assay was performed using the MTT method. Qualitative autophagy detection was performed by monodansylcadaverine staining of autophagic vacuoles. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining was used to count cell apoptosis by flow cytometry. The autophagy-related protein (Beclin- 1, LC 3, and p 62) and apoptosis relative protein (Bax and Bcl- 2) levels were evaluated with Western blot analysis. Furthermore, a murine model of nude BALB/c mice bearing SW 13 cell xenografts was established to evaluate the efficacy of <b>concomitant</b> <b>therapy.</b> Results: The expression of the autophagic gene Beclin- 1 was significantly downregulated in ACC tissues compared to normal adrenal cortex tissues. The Beclin- 1 protein level in ACC tissues was lower than that in normal adrenal cortex tissues (P< 0. 05). In vitro <b>concomitant</b> <b>therapy</b> (DDP and CQ) was more effective in restraining SW 13 cell proliferation. DDP could promote cell apoptosis and induce autophagy in SW 13 cells. <b>Concomitant</b> <b>therapy</b> further promoted cell apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy. In vivo, we found that <b>concomitant</b> <b>therapy</b> was more potent than DDP monotherapy in inhibiting the growth of xenografted tumors and prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing mice.

Aim: To evaluate {{the effectiveness of}} sequential and concomitant 4 -drug non-bismuth therapies for eradication of Helicobacter pylori in a prospective, randomized, clinical trial conducted in Palestine. Patients and Methods: Patients who underwent upper endoscopy for a clinical indication and tested positive for rapid urease test were included. Subjects randomly allocated into two groups: One received a modified sequential therapy: esomeprazole 40 mg OD and amoxicillin 1 g BID for 5 days then esomeprazole 40 mg OD, clarithromycin 500 mg BID and tinidazole 500 mg BID for another 5 days. The other group received <b>concomitant</b> <b>therapy</b> in which the same 4 drugs and doses were all given daily for 10 days. Stool antigen was tested 4 weeks after completion of treatment.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{clinical}} {{effects of}} mucolytics {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are discussed controversially. Cineole is the main constituent of eucalyptus oil and mainly used in inflammatory airway diseases as a mucolytic agent. We hypothesised that its known mucolytic, bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects as <b>concomitant</b> <b>therapy</b> would reduce the exacerbation rate and show benefits on pulmonary function tests as well as quality of life in patients with COPD. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center-study we randomly assigned 242 patients with stable COPD to receive 200 mg of cineole or placebo 3 times daily as <b>concomitant</b> <b>therapy</b> for 6 months during winter-time. The frequency, duration and severity of exacerbations were combined as primary outcome measures for testing as multiple criteria. Secondary outcome measures included changes of lung function, respiratory symptoms and quality of life as well as the single parameters of the exacerbations. Results Baseline demographics, lung function and standard medication of both groups were comparable. During the treatment period of 6 months the multiple criteria frequency, severity and duration of exacerbations were significantly lower in the group treated with cineole in comparison to placebo. Secondary outcome measures validated these findings. Improvement of lung function, dyspnea and quality of life as multiple criteria were statistically significant relative to placebo. Adverse events were comparable in both groups. Conclusion <b>Concomitant</b> <b>therapy</b> with cineole reduces exacerbations as well as dyspnea and improves lung function and health status.

Aim: To critically review evidence on the role of non-bismuth quadruple therapy (proton pump inhibitor-clarithromycin-amoxicillin-nitroimidazole) in the treatment of H. pylori infection. Methods: Bibliographical searches were performed in MEDLINE and relevant congresses up to December 2011. We performed a meta-analysis of the studies evaluating the <b>concomitant</b> <b>therapy,</b> and of the randomized controlled trials comparing the concomitant and the standard triple therapy. Results: A meta-analysis of 19 studies (2070 patients) revealed a mean H. pylori cure rate (intention-to-treat) of 88 % (95 % confidence interval from 85 % to 91 %) for non-bismuth quadruple therapy. We performed a meta-analysis of the randomized controlled studies comparing the concomitant (481 patients) and the standard triple therapy (503 patients). The former was more effective than the latter: 90 % versus 78 % (intention-to-treat analysis). Results were homogeneous (I 2 = 0 %). The odds ratio for this comparison was 2. 36 (95 % confidence interval from 1. 67 to 3. 34). A tendency toward better results with longer treatments (7 &ndash; 10 days versus 3 &ndash; 5 days) has been observed, so it seems reasonable to recommend the length of treatment achieving the highest cure rates (10 days). Clarithromycin resistance may reduce the efficacy of non-bismuth quadruple therapy, although the decrease in eradication rates seems to be far lower than in standard triple therapy. Experience with the non-bismuth quadruple therapy in patients with metronidazole-resistant strains is still very limited. Conclusion: Non-bismuth quadruple (<b>concomitant)</b> <b>therapy</b> appears to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated alternative to triple therapy and is less complex than sequential therapy.
