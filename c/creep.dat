5|$|Several {{strands of}} the SAF {{in the eastern}} region of the San Francisco Bay Area are the Hayward–Rodgers Creek and Calaveras Faults. The Hayward Fault {{exhibits}} fault <b>creep,</b> {{but it also has}} potential for large earthquakes, like the 1868 Hayward earthquake that occurred on its southern segment. The northern Calaveras Fault meets the Hayward Fault near the Calaveras Reservoir and can also produce large earthquakes. Except for a ~M6.5 shock that occurred in 1911, the central and southern segments might only produce smaller events and fault <b>creep.</b>|$|E

Turrets are capable of interfering with and slowing down <b>creeps,</b> in addition to damaging them.

In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support by attacking the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle or if he or she came close to dying.|$|E

It is similar to other treecreepers, and has a curved bill, patterned brown upperparts, whitish underparts, and long stiff tail feathers which help it <b>creep</b> up tree trunks.

5|$|The {{metropolitan}} areas of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach {{are located on}} a rise in elevation along the eastern coast of Florida, called the Eastern Coastal Ridge, that was formed as waves compressed ooids into a single formation.

This slight rise in elevation {{on both sides of}} the Everglades creates a basin, and forces water that overflows Lake Okeechobee to <b>creep</b> toward the southwest.|$|E

25|$|The {{temperature}} range in which <b>creep</b> deformation may occur differs in various materials. For example, tungsten requires a {{temperature in the}} thousands of degrees before <b>creep</b> deformation can occur, while ice will <b>creep</b> at temperatures near 0°C (32°F). As a general guideline, the effects of <b>creep</b> deformation generally become noticeable at approximately 35% of the melting point (as measured on a thermodynamic temperature scale such as Kelvin or Rankine) for metals, and at 45% of melting point for ceramics. Virtually any material will <b>creep</b> upon approaching its melting temperature. Since the <b>creep</b> minimum temperature {{is related to the}} melting point, <b>creep</b> can be seen at relatively low temperatures for some materials. Plastics and low-melting-temperature metals, including many solders, can begin to <b>creep</b> at room temperature, as can be seen markedly in old lead hot-water pipes. Glacier flow is an example of <b>creep</b> processes in ice.|$|E

25|$|Harper–Dorn <b>creep</b> is a climb-controlled {{dislocation}} mechanism at low {{stresses that}} has been observed in aluminum, lead, and tin systems, in addition to nonmetal systems such as ceramics and ice. It is characterized by two principal phenomena: a linear relationship between the steady-state strain rate and applied stress at a constant temperature, and an independent relationship between the steady-state strain rate and grain size for a provided temperature and applied stress. The latter observation implies that Harper–Dorn <b>creep</b> is controlled by dislocation movement; namely, since <b>creep</b> can occur by vacancy diffusion (Nabarro–Herring <b>creep,</b> Coble <b>creep),</b> grain boundary sliding, and/or dislocation movement, and since the first two mechanisms are grain-size dependent, Harper–Dorn <b>creep</b> must therefore be dislocation-motion dependent.|$|E
25|$|Polymers show <b>creep</b> {{basically}} {{in two different}} ways.

The variability in the speed of <b>creeping</b> decreases in proportion to the logarithm of the gravitational effect.

25|$|Viscoelastic <b>creep</b> {{data can}} be {{presented}} {{in one of two}} ways. Total strain can be plotted as a function of time for a given temperature or temperatures. Below a critical value of applied stress, a material may exhibit linear viscoelasticity. Above this critical stress, the <b>creep</b> rate grows disproportionately faster. The second way of graphically presenting viscoelastic <b>creep</b> in a material is by plotting the <b>creep</b> modulus (constant applied stress divided by total strain at a particular time) as a function of time. Below its critical stress, the viscoelastic <b>creep</b> modulus is independent of stress applied. A family of curves describing strain versus time response to various applied stress may be represented by a single viscoelastic <b>creep</b> modulus versus time curve if the applied stresses are below the material's critical stress value.|$|E
25|$|In Nabarro–Herring <b>creep,</b> k {{is related}} to the {{diffusion}} coefficient of atoms through the lattice, Q = Q (self diffusion), m = 1, and b = 2. Therefore, Nabarro–Herring <b>creep</b> has a weak stress dependence and a moderate grain size dependence, with the <b>creep</b> rate decreasing as grain size is increased.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{molecular}} {{weight of the}} polymer of interest is known to affect its <b>creep</b> behavior. The effect of increasing molecular weight tends to promote secondary bonding between polymer chains and thus make the polymer more <b>creep</b> resistant. Similarly, aromatic polymers are even more <b>creep</b> resistant due to the added stiffness from the rings. Both molecular weight and aromatic rings add to polymers' thermal stability, increasing the <b>creep</b> resistance of a polymer.|$|E
