40|$|It {{has been}} argued in the {{technical}} literature, and widely reported in the popular press, that <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers</b> (CRASs) can initiate lightning via a mechanism known as relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA), where large numbers of high-energy and low-energy electrons can, somehow, cause the local atmosphere in a thundercloud to transition to a conducting state. In response to this claim, other researchers have published simulations showing that the electron density produced by RREA is far {{too small to be}} able to affect the conductivity in the cloud sufficiently to initiate lightning. In this paper, we compare 74 days of <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>shower</b> data collected in north central Florida during 2013 - 2015, the recorded CRASs having primary energies on the order of 10 (16) eV to 10 (18) eV and zenith angles less than 38 degrees, with Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) data, and we show that {{there is no evidence that}} the detected <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers</b> initiated lightning. Furthermore, we show that the average probability of any of our detected <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers</b> to initiate a lightning flash can be no more than 5 %. If all lightning flashes were initiated by <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers,</b> then about 1. 6 % of detected CRASs would initiate lightning; therefore, we do not have enough data to exclude the possibility that lightning flashes could be initiated by <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers...</b>|$|R

50|$|G. Askaryan {{also showed}} that <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> <b>showers</b> emit {{electromagnetic}} radiation, thus giving yet another way for their detection. Before him it was commonly assumed that electron-photon showers do not emit electromagnetic radiation since the electrons and positrons are created in pairs. Askaryan’s analysis led {{to the conclusion that}} in an electron-photon shower there is an excess of negative charge (excess of electrons). These excess electrons are knocked out from atoms either by photoeffect or by shower electrons and positrons (ionization). At the same time, due to the annihilation process the number of positrons decreases. Thus, there is an electric current created by the excess electrons associated with shower. This variable current is the source of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, every shower is the source of electromagnetic radiation. These studies opened new perspectives for distant registration of <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> <b>showers.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} detection of ultra high energy (> 10 ^ 18 eV) cosmic rays requires a detailed {{knowledge of the}} fluorescence light emission from nitrogen molecules, which are excited by the <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> <b>shower</b> particles along their path in the atmosphere. We have made a precise measurement of the fluorescence light spectrum excited by MeV electrons in dry air. We measured the relative intensities of 34 fluorescence bands in the wavelength range from 284 to 429 nm with a high resolution spectrograph. The pressure dependence of the fluorescence spectrum was also measured from a few hPa up to atmospheric pressure. Relative intensities and collisional quenching reference pressures for bands due to transitions from a common upper level were found in agreement with theoretical expectations. The presence of argon in air {{was found to have}} a negligible effect on the fluorescence yield.

40|$|Aims. The {{capability}} of radio antenna arrays to measure <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers</b> with very large zenith angles is explored. This is important, since a possible neutrino detection has to fulfill two requirements. First: antennas {{should be able}} to detect very inclined <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers,</b> and second: {{it should be possible to}} estimate the distance to the shower maximum, since neutrinos are most likely to travel far through the Earth's atmosphere without interaction and induce air showers close to the ground. Methods: LOPES (LOFAR PrototypE Station; LOFAR - LOw Frequency ARray), an array of dipole antennas, is used for the detection of inclined <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers.</b> LOPES is co-located and triggered by the KASCADE (KArlsruhe Shower Core and Array DEtector) experiment, which also provides information on air shower properties such as electron and muon numbers on the ground, as well as the arrival direction. Radio emission of nearly vertical <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers</b> has been detected by LOPES. Results: LOPES- 10 (the first phase of LOPES, consisting of 10 antennas) detected a significant number of <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers</b> with a zenith angle larger than 50 °, and many of these have very high radio field strengths. The most inclined event that has been detected with LOPES- 10 has a zenith angle of almost 80 °. This is proof that the new technique is also applicable for <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers</b> with high inclinations, which in the case that they are initiated close to the ground, can be a signature of neutrino events. Conclusions:. Our results indicate that arrays of simple radio antennas can be used for the detection of highly inclined air showers, which might be triggered by neutrinos. In addition, we found that the radio pulse height (normalized with the muon number) for highly inclined events increases with the geomagnetic angle, which confirms the geomagnetic origin of radio emission in <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> air <b>showers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The array AIROBICC samples the Cerenkov light {{produced}} by a <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> <b>shower</b> at core distances r ! 150 m. According to a detailed simulation of cosmic ray showers in the range 10 - 1000 TeV, the lateral distribution of the Cerenkov light allows us to measure the depth of maximum development with an error lower than 30 g/cm 2 and the electromagnetic energy of the shower with an error of about 7 % for 100 TeV incident particles. By using an appropiate correction based on the height of maximum development, an accurate measure of the primary hadron energy can be achieved independently of the nucleus nature. We predict an energy resolution of about 20 % at 100 TeV. 1 Introduction The primary energy of a <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> <b>shower</b> E 0 has been traditionally determined from the shower size N e or/and the number of muons N at observation level.
