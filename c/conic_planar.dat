If maps were projected as in light shining through a globe onto a developable surface, then the spacing of parallels would follow a very limited set of possibilities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general and rigorous transformation method to tailor <b>planar</b> <b>conic</b> reflectors. The proposed method enables the designed reflectors to scatter or reflect incident {{light in the}} same manner as a conic reflector while the whole device as well as the reflector would maintain planar profiles. In order to reduce the overall size, especially the aperture of the reflector, we further apply a set of compressed and folded spatial mapping to the planar reflectors. Planar reflectors with reduced sizes are finally obtained which may be useful in several optical and electromagnetic applications.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown {{how to use}} {{corresponding}} conics in two images to estimate the epipolar geometry, the fundamental/essential matrix and reconstruct the scene. The corresponding conics can be images of either a <b>planar</b> <b>conic</b> or silhouettes of a quadric. It is shown that one conic correspondence gives two constraints on the fundamental matrix and a method to estimate the fundamental matrix from four (or more) corresponding conics is presented. Furthermore, {{a new type of}} fundamental matrix for describing conic correspondences is presented. Finally, it is shown that the problem of estimating the fundamental matrix from 5 point correspondences and 1 conic correspondence in general has 10 different solutions. A method to calculate these solutions is also given together with an experimental validation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown how {{corresponding}} conics in two {{images can be}} used to estimate the epipolar geometry in terms of the fundamental/essential matrix. The corresponding conics can be images of either <b>planar</b> <b>conics</b> or silhouettes of quadrics. It is shown that one conic correspondence gives two independent constraints on the fundamental matrix and a method to estimate the fundamental matrix from at least four corresponding conics is presented. Furthermore, a new type of fundamental matrix for describing conic correspondences is introduced. Finally, it is shown that the problem of estimating the fundamental matrix from 5 point correspondences and 1 conic correspondence in general has 10 dioeerent solutions. A method to calculate these solutions is also given together with an experimental validation. 1 Introduction During the last years there has been an intense research on multiple view geometry, especially concentrated on using point correspondences to estimate either the epipol [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Segmentation and {{labeling}} of X-ray medical images are untrivial tasks. These images are complex with low contrast and low {{signal to noise}} ratio (S/N). Hence, edge detectors produce oversegmented elements. Grouping and organization of these elements is not straightforward especially for deformable objects. Elastic models have been successfully used for matching slightly deformable objects. Their performance and precision can be heavily compromised when the disparity between the model and the image is large and when the image contrast is weak and variable. In this paper, we present a new approach to matching free form deformable models with X-ray images. Unlike elastic models, free forms (or wire-frame models) do not bias the boundary detection toward the initial state. We assume that objects can be assembled using a set of elementary 3 -D free-forms (subobjects) : <b>planar,</b> <b>conic</b> and cylindric. Multiple deformable curves (simple closed curves) are used to model the 2 -D semitransparent pr [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} several {{results on}} images of various configurations of conics. We extract {{information about the}} plane from single and multiple views of known and unknown <b>conics,</b> based on <b>planar</b> homography and <b>conic</b> correspondences. We show that a single conic section cannot provide sufficient information. Metric rectification of the plane can be performed from a single view if two conics can be identified to be images of circles without knowing their centers or radii. The homography between two views of a planar scene can be computed if two arbitrary conics are identified in them without knowing anything specific about them. The scene can be reconstructed from a single view if images {{of a pair of}} circles can be identified in two planes. Our results are simpler and require less information from the images than previously known results. The results presented here involve univariate polynomial equations of degree 4 or 8 and always have solutions. Applications to metric rectification, homography calculation, 3 D reconstruction, and projective OCR are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of our scheme...|$|R
40|$|The General Optical Systems Evaluation Program, GENOPTICS, was {{developed}} {{as an aid}} for the analysis and evaluation of optical systems that employ lenses, mirrors, diffraction gratings, and other geometrical surfaces. The GENOPTICS evaluation is performed by means of geometrical ray tracing based upon Snell's law. The GENOPTICS program can provide for the exact ray tracing {{of as many as}} 800 rays through as many as 40 surfaces. These surfaces may be <b>planar,</b> <b>conic,</b> toric, or polynomial shaped lenses, mirrors, and diffraction gratings. Each surface may be tilted about as many as three axes and may be decentered. Surfaces having bilateral symmetry may also be analyzed. GENOPTICS provides for user-oriented input and {{for a wide range of}} output for the evaluation of the optical system being analyzed. GENOPTICS provides a wide range of features for the optical system analyst. GENOPTICS performs axial ray tracing and computation of the third order aberrations including aspheric contribution. The program includes a quasi-automatic ray-surface intersection selection option. Graphical output can be generated for spot diagrams, radial energy distributions, and modulation transfer functions, for each object point and each color. Sag tables may be generated for any rotationally symmetric surface, with options to obtain the sag differences from a reference sphere in units of lengths or wavelengths. Statistics and plots of ray intercepts with any surface in the system may be obtained for use in vignetting analysis and beam distribution analysis. Afocal systems can be examined with image statistics generated in terms of tangents of angles with respect to the optical axis. For exact ray tracing, a ray pattern at the entrance pupil can be specified as a rectangular or polar grid, where each ray samples an equal amount of area, or as a pattern where each ray samples an equal amount of solid angle for a finite object. This latter pattern is useful in radiometric work. Input to GENOPTICS includes program control statements, system definition data, surface data, and task data. Multiple cases may be examined in a single run. Output includes printed and graphical results. The user can specify which portions of an analysis are to be printed. Optional printout includes system data, surface-to-surface printout of each ray, modulation transfer function values, radial energy distribution values, and paraxial ray data including aberrations. GENOPTICS is coded to generate plotted output for a ZETA plotting system but should be readily adapted to other plotting systems. The GENOPTICS program is written in FORTRAN 77 and has been implemented on an IBM 370 series and DEC VAX series computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 220 K of 8 bit bytes. GENOPTICS {{was developed}} in the mid 1970 's and last updated in 1984...|$|R
