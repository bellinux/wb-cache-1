Typically {{the criminal law}} definition refers to an operation in which the customer is sold what {{is supposed to be a}} derivative interest in a security or <b>commodity</b> <b>future,</b> but there is no transaction made on any exchange. The transaction goes [...] "in the bucket" [...] and is never executed. Because no trading of actual securities occurs, the customer is essentially betting against the bucket shop operator in a game based on abstract security prices. While trading in a legitimate exchange also provides a similar game or wagering aspect, the one distinctive characteristic of a bucket shop is the mimicry of trading securities when no actual securities are traded. The bucket shop's exchange is a fiction, which the parties agree to imagine as following the events occurring in a real exchange.

Financial traders reduced their net long positions during the crisis in response to market distress, whereas hedgers facilitated this by reducing their net short positions as prices fell.

40|$|The close {{relationship}} between <b>commodity</b> <b>future</b> and cash prices is critical for the effectiveness of risk management and the functioning of price discovery. However, in recent years, commodity futures prices, across the board, have appeared increasingly detached from prices on physical markets. This paper argues that while various factors, identified in previous literature, which introduced limits to arbitrage have facilitated non-convergence, the actual extent of non-convergence in these markets is caused by essential differences in the mechanisms of price formation on physical and derivative markets.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{macroeconomic}} determinants of {{the volatility of}} <b>commodity</b> <b>futures</b> (including agricultural <b>commodity</b> <b>futures,</b> metal futures and oil futures) in two emerging commodity markets – China and India. The macroeconomic variables used include both domestic and international macroeconomic variables that gauge economic environment, monetary policy and financial market information. We use a recently proposed GARCH-MIDAS model which jointly incorporates the daily price volatility and low-frequency macroeconomic variables. The model decomposes the volatility series into short- and long-run components, thereby enabling us to test whether the macroeconomic variables can determine the long-run variance. We find that there exists a long-run volatility component in the <b>commodity</b> <b>futures,</b> {{and most of the}} tested low-frequency macroeconomic variables are positively related to the long-run variance of <b>commodity</b> <b>futures.</b> Our results suggest that both domestic and international macroeconomic information {{plays an important role in}} determining the price volatility of the emerging <b>commodity</b> <b>futures.</b> Griffith Business School, Department of Accounting, Finance and EconomicsNo Full Tex...|$|R
