40|$|Anglophone African {{countries}} have been implementing reform and modernization initiatives in their Customs administrations. This paper outlines the progression of key reform and modernization initiatives in these countries since the early 1990 s, and assesses the gap between these reforms and those of more modern Customs agencies. The review suggests that Customs administration reform and modernization initiatives in Anglophone African countries generally lag behind international good practice and {{it is necessary to}} speed up implementation if revenue, trade facilitation, and trade chain security objectives are to be achieved. The findings also have implications on the design of reform programs and focus of potential technical assistance for the outstanding reform agenda.

30|$|Until version 6.x, {{official}} Android releases did {{not provide}} any efficient tools to manage permissions. Many <b>custom</b> <b>releases</b> or applications give users a way to better control permissions (such as Privacy Guard Manager, Permission Master, XPrivacy, or DonkeyGuard). Our study will concentrate only on Privacy Guard Manager (PGM) from CyanogenMod 6 since all other applications have the same drawback. PGM {{is available in the}} settings menu of CyanogenMod and presents all installed applications. For each application, there is the list of its permissions. Users have the choice to select ON or OFF for each application to allow or deny the permission. An option also exists to ask users to decide at the first time the permission is requested. Thus, the interface is very easy to master and requires no technical skills: only a simple action on the device for each permission.|$|R

50|$|Unlike DS flashcards, {{which may}} also {{work in the}} Nintendo 3DS and allow DS ROM backups to run on these consoles, there are also 3DS-exclusive storage devices, which allow 3DS ROM backups and perhaps also 3DS homebrew to run on these consoles. Gateway-3DS is the first true 3DS flashcard for Nintendo 3DS. Its clones include 3DS Link, MT Card, R4i 3DS, and more. They {{currently}} work on 4.1-9.2 version firmware. The Gateway 3DS emulation plugin of the Supercard DSTWO Plus may {{also be seen as}} belonging to this category. There is also the Sky3DS, which works with all version up to and including the latest 11.0.0 update, and all consoles in the Nintendo 3DS line. Its clones include R5SDHC 3DS, QQ3DS, and more. However there are several 3DS <b>custom</b> firmware <b>releases</b> which discredit flashcards if the 3DS system is running a lower version of the software. Typically these <b>custom</b> firmware <b>releases</b> are moderately difficult to install. Previously, downgrading was necessary to install custom firmware, which increased the chances of bricking the 3DS, making it unusable. This is no longer necessary. On the latest firmware, the 3DS requires either a second 3DS or a modification to the hardware to use the custom firmware.|$|R
