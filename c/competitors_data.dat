40|$|Data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) is {{a methodology}} for identifying the efficient frontier {{of decision making}} units (DMUs). Context-dependent DEA refers to a DEA approach where a set of DMUs are evaluated against a particular evaluation context. Each evaluation context represents an efficient frontier composed by DMUs in a specific performance level. The context-dependent DEA measures (i) the attractiveness when DMUs exhibiting poorer performance are chosen as the evaluation context, and (ii) the progress when DMUs exhibiting better performance are chosen as the evaluation context. The current paper extends the context-dependent DEA by incorporating value judgment into the attractiveness and progress measures. The method is applied to measuring the attractiveness of 32 computer printers. It is shown that the attractive measure helps (i) customers to select the best option, and (ii) printer manufacturers to identify the potential <b>competitors.</b> <b>Data</b> envelopment analysis (DEA) Attractiveness Progress Efficient Product Value judgment...|$|E

So, if it is done optimally, the information about <b>competitors</b> <b>data</b> can then be achieved and the company can make a decision related to the information. In reality great scale company, which is the object of the research, implement marketing intelligence based on intelligence system to face existing industrial competition and be able to apply it as the procedure. The result show that: 1) The marketing intelligence employed by great scale companies uses competitive advantage planning and customer value analysis in observing its competitor. 2) The marketing intelligence source employed by grat scale companies uses twi sources, company environment (internal) and outside environment of the company (external). 3) Marketing intelligence factor employed by great scale companies uses 3 factors. First, the observation of 6 main competitor data including competitor’s products, price, promotion, strategy, sale, and other data. Second, competitive advantage factor emphasizing on information processing related to competitor’s innovation such as product quality.

The main aim is to describe the relationship between the marketing activities in the retail outlets of two subjects (1) beer manufacturer and (2) his competitors. This aim is deducted from the presumption that more than two thirds of shopping decisions are made directly in the store. The manufacturer therefore has to be visible in the retail outlet and perform better than his <b>competitors.</b> <b>Data</b> were observed in the multinational retail chains once a month during one year. The observation was focused on one specific product category – beer. The competitors were observed as one group for the purpose of comparison. Three criteria were included in this study (1) a presence of products’ secondary position, (2) a presence of point-of-purchase materials in the main product category area and (3) a presence of point-of-purchase materials outside the main product category area.

40|$|A given man’s {{phenotype}} embodies cues of his ancestral {{ability to}} effectively defend {{himself and his}} kin from harm, to survive adverse conditions, and to acquire status and mating opportunities. In this review, we explore the hypothesis that a man’s phenotype also embodies cues to fertility, or the probability that an ejaculate will fertilize ova. Female mate choice depends {{on the ability to}} discern the quality of a male reproductive partner through his phenotype, and male fertility may be among the traits that females have evolved to detect. A female who selects as mates males that deliver higher quality ejaculates will, on average, be more fecund than her <b>competitors.</b> <b>Data</b> on several non-human species demonstrate correlations between ejaculate quality and secondary sexual characteristics that inform female mate choice, suggesting that females may select mates in part on the basis of fertility. While the non-human literature on this topic has advanced, the human literature remains limited in scope and there is no clear consensus on appropriate methodologies or theoretical positions. We provide a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of this literature, and conclude by proposing solutions to the many issues that impede progress in the field. In the process, we hope to encourage interest and insight from investigators in other areas of human mating and reproductive biology...|$|E
40|$|Throwing {{events have}} been an {{integral}} part of the track and field program in both Olympic and Commonwealth Games since their inception. Most scientific studies of these events have concentrated on biomechanical analysis or the physical capacity requirements of the athletes. This paper examines and compares the trends over time of the gold medal results of three throwing events in the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games for male <b>competitors.</b> <b>Data</b> was collected from the ‘Athletic’s Almanac’ web-site, for the period since inception of these games until the present day. The data was examined to identify the linear trends that exist for all three events. Similarities between results in the shot-put and hammer of a steady increase in distances thrown over time were evident. Whereas, the discus records showed a steeper positive relationship over time. In addition, critical world-wide incidents, trends in social expectations and increase in sports science and technical knowledge were concluded to have an effect on the results of these athletic pursuits in terms of acceleration periods and plateaus of results. In summary, trends in general for records in these throwing events showed a steady rise from the outset of competition until the late 1960 s to early 1970 s. Since this period, there has been considerable tapering off of improvements in distances achieved. These trends were seen in both the Olympic Games and the Commonwealth Games...|$|E

40|$|Data Integration is {{currently}} {{an important and}} complex topic for many companies, because having a good and working Data Integration solution can bring multiple advantages over <b>competitors.</b> <b>Data</b> Integration is usually being executed in a form of a project, which might easily turn into failure. In order to decrease risks and negative impact of a failed Data Integration project, {{there needs to be}} good project management, Data Integration knowledge and the right technology in place. This thesis provides a framework for setting up a good Data Integration solution. The framework is developed based on the current theory, currently available Data Integration tools and opinions provided by experts working in the field for a minimum of 7 + years and have proven their skills with a successful Data Integration project. This thesis does not guarantee the development of the right Data Integration solution, but it does provide guidance how to deal with a Data Integration project in a large enterprise. This thesis is structured into seven chapters. The first chapter brings an overview about this thesis such as scope, goals, assumptions and expected value. The second chapter describes Data Management and basic Data Integration theory in order to distinguish these two topics and to explain the relationship between them. The third chapter is focused purely on Data Integration theory which should be known by everyone who participates in a Data Integration project. The fourth chapter analyses features of the current Data Integration solutions available on the market and provides an overview of the most common and necessary functionalities. Chapter five focuses on the practical part of this thesis, where the Data Integration framework is designed based on findings from previous chapters and interviews with experts in this field. Chapter six then applies the framework to a real working (anonymized) Data Integration solution, highlights the gap between the framework and the solution and provides guidance {{how to deal with the}} gaps.

40|$|The {{locus of}} {{innovation}} {{is not the}} individual firm anymore but increasingly the network in which the firm is embedded. Hence, in this paper innovation is investigated in the broader context of networks and applied to the traditional food sector. Networking refers to a process of identifying and acting on complementary interests with or without formal means of cooperation and {{plays an important role}} for the diffusion and adoption of innovations, because they increase the flow of information. Two main types of networks exist. Vertical networks relate to cooperation of partners belonging to the same chain. Meanwhile, horizontal networks refer to coopereation among firms which are primarily <b>competitors.</b> <b>Data</b> were collected during focus groups and in-depths interviews in three European contries: Belgium, Hungary, and Italy. In each country, data are collected from retailers/wholesalers, food manufacturers and suppliers in the beer, hard and half hard cheese, ham, sausage, or white paprika chain. In the investigated countries both vertical and horizontal networks exist. However, the intensity of using the network differs. On the one hand vertical networks are well developed based on quality assurance schemes and traceability, though these networks often face difficulties due to high lack of trust. On the other hand, horizontal networks are well developed when a producer consortium is involved. However, these networks can be inhibited through strong competition. The partners in traditional food networks focus mainly on innovation related to product characteristics such as new size, form and packaging without changing the traditional character of the product. The main barriers for innovation in the traditional food networks are the lack of understanding the benefits of networking activities for innovation, the lack of trust, the lack of knowledge of appropriate methods and skills, and the lack of financial and physical resources. Our study points out that successful SMEs use their networks to overcome lacks of knowledge and information and to create possibilities of joint use of resources. </span...|$|E
40|$|SDM is {{a process}} model, based on service {{marketing}} components, to position a service while concurrently being a service delivery management tool improving serviceen counter processes. Added to a service script, SDM can increase customer satisfaction, quality perception, voice levels and repurchase intentions in a general service encounter scenario as well as during episodes which include a failure. Addressing mishaps requires particular attention, since Consumer Complaint Behaviour research shows that most customers prefer to switch suppliers, rather than offer constructive feedback. This means that many service failures go unnoticed, with {{a large proportion of}} customers defecting. Since most services are performed in real time by service personnel, consistent quality output is a challenge. Therefore, occasional service failures are inevitable. Present research recognises this by offering suggestions, but does not present an integrated framework like SDM, using the presence of a customer during a service encounter as an unique opportunity to resolve issues on the spot. An elicitation process is used as a first step, attempting to improve voice and minimising lost feedback. Step two is a specific service recovery process, adapted to the failure type. SDM processes can also lead to a general increase of satisfaction and quality perception, {{regardless of whether or not}} there was a service failure. With satisfaction generally being regarded as an actual repurchase behaviour indicator, this may lead to increased sales turnover, while a higher quality perception may lead to a larger price premium tolerance and therefore higher profits. Higher service quality perceptions can also be used as a marketing positioning tool to differentiate a service from <b>competitors.</b> <b>Data</b> collected supported all hypotheses put forward in this thesis, showing statistically significant improvements on all key variables, including a satisfaction rating increase of 24 percent when SDM was applied. In academic terms, the process model tested did not only link separate literature streams, but offered an integrated, proactive tool which is capable of operating in real time. Traditionally, academic models and their processes analyse results after an episode concludes, while SDM allows a provider to positively influence or manage satisfaction levels during the service delivery...|$|E

40|$|A Probabilistic Information Processing System (PIP) uses men and {{machines}} {{in a novel}} way to perform diagnostic information processing. Men estimate likelihood ratios for each datum and each pair of hypotheses under consideration or a sufficient subset of these pairs. A computer aggregates these estimates by means of Bayes' theorem of probability theory into a posterior distribution that reflects the impact of all available data on all hypotheses being considered. Such a system circumvents human conservatism in information processing, the inability of men to aggregate information {{in such a way}} as to modify their opinions as much as the available data justify. It also fragments the job of evaluating diagnostic information into small separable tasks. The posterior distributions that are a PIP's output may be used as a guide to human decision making or may be combined with a payoff matrix to make decisions by means of the principle of maximizing expected value. A large simulation-type experiment compared a PIP with three other information processing systems in a simulated strategic war setting of the 1970 's. The difference between PIP and its competitors was that in PIP the information was aggregated by computer, while in the other three systems, the operators aggregated the information in their heads.
