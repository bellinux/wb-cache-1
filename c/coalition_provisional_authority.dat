5|$|Some {{commentators}} {{consider that}} the United States was a de facto member of OPEC during its formal occupation of Iraq, due to its leadership of the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority</b> in 2003–2004.

50|$|Following the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, senior British figures criticized {{the refusal of}} the US Government to heed British advice regarding post-war plans for Iraq, specifically the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority's</b> de-Ba'athification policy and the critical importance of preventing the power vacuum in which the insurgency subsequently developed. British defence secretary Geoff Hoon later stated that the United Kingdom 'lost the argument' with the Bush administration over rebuilding Iraq.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}}'s head {{of government}} was Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and his deputy was the influential and charismatic Barham Salih. The ceremonial head of state was President Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer. They were all sworn in at a second and more public ceremony on June 28, 2004, shortly after the small private one at which L.

5|$|In March 2003, Carney {{joined the}} staff of Lt. Gen.

Upon arrival in Baghdad, he became critical of the plan set out by CPA, making clear that Iraq czar Paul Bremer's ideological vision was impeding progress that could have been made to stabilize Iraq. He left Baghdad two months after arriving in April 2003, disillusioned by an inability to execute a more pragmatic plan for Iraq's reconstruction. Carney returned to Washington where he made known his disagreement with the Bremer plan. In 2007,Under a significant reorganization of the Iraq reconstruction effort by the Bush administration that witnessed other policy dissenters return to Baghdad, Carney was asked by the State Department to return to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to oversee the overall U.S. effort to rebuild Iraq.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority’s</b> attempts to stabilize and reform Iraq’s economy along market lines. It argues that while security concerns remain serious, Iraq’s economy {{has not been}} crippled by violence. However, sustained economic growth will depend on whether Iraq’s future leaders pursue the pro-market approaches the Coalition has advocated. If the Iraqi economy is to reach its potential, it will need to go even farther than the Coalition did, implementing reforms the Coalition did not pursue because of security concerns.

50|$|The Transitional National Assembly, {{which was}} elected in January 2005 {{pursuant}} to the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority's</b> Transitional Administrative Law, appointed a Constitutional Committee {{for the purpose of}} preparing a draft constitution by August 15, 2005. The Committee was initially made up of 55 members, all of whom were drawn from the Transitional National Assembly, but its membership was eventually expanded beyond the Assembly's numbers, in order to allow representatives from the Sunni Arab community to participate (given that the latter had boycotted the elections that gave rise to the Transitional National Assembly).|$|R

50|$|The {{last book}} argues that {{consistent}} with the literature on state building, failed states, and foreign assistance, budgeting is a core state function that {{is necessary for the}} operations of a functional government. Employing an historical institutionalist approach, the book first explores the Ottoman, British, and Ba'athist origins of Iraq's budgetary institutions. The book next examines American prewar planning, the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority's</b> rule making and budgeting following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the mixed success of the American-led Coalition's capacity building programs initiated throughout the occupation.|$|R
50|$|A {{member of}} Ahmad Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress, he was {{appointed}} Governor of Al-Qādisiyyah Governorate in 2003 and then as Iraq's Defence Minister from June 2004 until May 2005 under the Iraqi Interim Government of Ayad Allawi.

25|$|The United States and the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority,</b> run by Jay Garner {{and three}} deputies, {{including}} Tim Cross, opposed allowing democratic elections at this time, preferring instead to eventually hand over power to an unelected group of Iraqis. More insurgents stepped up their activities. The two most turbulent centers were {{the area around}} Fallujah and the poor Shia sections of cities from Baghdad to Basra in the south.|$|E
25|$|The violent {{insurgency}} began {{shortly after}} the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and increased during the occupation. Originally, the insurgents targeted the coalition force (a majority of whom are from the United States and the United Kingdom) and the interim government (e.g., the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority)</b> formed under the occupation. The insurgency grew during the period between the invasion of Iraq {{and the establishment of}} a new Iraqi government.|$|E
5000|$|The current {{regulator}} is the Iraqi Communications and Media Commission, [...] {{and the public}} broadcaster is the Iraqi Media Network, successor to the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority's</b> and several other radio and television stations. The Iraqi Media Network currently operates the Radio of the Republic of Iraq and the government supported al-Iraqiya TV station. Many private TV stations are also available, such as the popular Al Sharqiya. Up to 97% of homes have a satellite dish {{and there are more}} than 30 Iraq-facing satellite networks. Iraqi radio stations showcase the diversity of popular opinion, from hard-line Islamic fundamentalism to Radio Sawa, politically oriented stations, and stations featuring content appealing to Kurdish listeners. In the northern autonomous Kurdish enclaves, rival political factions operate their own media.|$|R
40|$|It is a {{delicate}} and pretentious endeavour to examine Iraq in current times. It is delicate {{in the sense that}} new facts and consequences of the Coalition’s presence in Iraq are broadcast on a daily basis and discussed worldwide. Yet it is also pretentious because of the impressive volume of academic work about Iraq that has appeared during the last four years. There is now a solid body of scholarship on issues such as the Coalition’s interpretation and misuse of occupation law, the legality of the use of force, Western imperialistic aspirations over Iraq, and successes and failures of the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority’s</b> administration of Iraq in 2003 and 2004. Keeping those concerns in mind, this paper establishes a discursive trajectory across all these topics. I will argue that the modern evolution of occupation law is intertwined with the Coalition’s misinterpretation and misuse of their obligations under international law, and examine how a radical interpretation of occupation law has affected the prospects of democracy and stability in Iraq...|$|R
50|$|The next {{sections}} of the law detail the composition and qualifications {{of the members of}} the Commission, and the purposes of the Commission. The stated goal of the Commission is similar to the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority's</b> (CPA) goal of eliminating any and all traces of Ba'ath Party ideology, in any manifestation, from the political, social, and economic life of Iraq. Additionally, the Commission has the duty of compiling the names and information about members to be maintained in archives that document the Ba'athist period in Iraqi history. Iraqis allowed to return to work in the government are those who held low level positions in the Ba'ath Party are allowed to return to work in some public sector jobs. However, several key positions and ministries are still barred from these individuals. Additionally, anyone who profited from being a member of the Ba'ath Party, is barred from additional posts in the public sector. There is also the possibility that certain individuals will be eligible for pensions, and the law also creates an appeals process for those deemed subject to its penalties. Finally, the end of the law provides the Commission’s composition, and the justifications for the law.|$|R
25|$|Militia leader Muqtada al-Sadr {{used his}} grass-roots {{organization}} and Mahdi Militia of {{over a thousand}} armed men {{to take control of}} the streets of Baghdad.

25|$|A {{military}} occupation was established {{and run by}} the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority</b> (CPA), which later appointed and granted limited powers to an Iraq Interim Governing Council.

Each of the city's four major ethnic groups was invited to send a 39-member delegation from which they would be allowed to select six to sit on the City Council. Another six council members were selected from among 144 delegates to represent independents social groups such as teachers, lawyers, religious leaders and artists.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{measured}} {{three aspects}} of the <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority's</b> macroeconomic reforms for transitioning Postwar Iraq; the degree of Central Bank independence; {{the success of the}} currency exchange; and whether the program of shock therapy weakened macroeconomic reforms. The premise behind implementing liberal economic reforms in Iraq was that creating a market-oriented economy would increase internal stability and would integrate Iraq into the global economy. Moreover, an integrated Iraqi government {{would be less likely to}} engage in hostile action against its own population or its neighbors. This thesis scored the actual degree of Central Bank independence at. 64 according to the most widely accepted measure established by Cukierman, Webb, and Neyapti. This thesis also proved the CBI effectiveness at targeting inflation, which is another indicator of central bank independence. The CPA's program of dinar consolidation unified Iraq's dual monetary system and helped erase Saddam's legacy of economic incompetence. The goal of shock therapy was to avoid the obstruction and interference that might have accompanied a protracted step-by-step approach. Rather than being rejected by a popular backlash or overturned by the Iraqi government, the CPS's macroeconomic reforms remain vital. Although these reforms did not resolve all the structural hurdles in the economy, this research finds that the CPA's neoliberal economic policies have created the necessary groundwork for the further development of independent macroeconomic institutions.
