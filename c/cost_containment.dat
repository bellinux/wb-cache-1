30|$|In {{the light}} of serious <b>cost</b> <b>containments</b> and an {{increased}} competition {{with the introduction of}} the DRG-based payment system, Swiss hospitals are more than ever in need of ways to operate effectively. Process management has repeatedly been named as an effectual approach for improving quality while reducing costs and resources. In this study, we presented a theoretically grounded staged CMM for process management in hospitals based on empirical data. While the model portrays evolution patterns empirically observed in a number of hospitals at a certain point in time and is thus basically descriptive in nature, a first empirical evaluation, however, revealed that it also offers normative advice. The four evaluation partners positively valued its comprehensiveness as relates to content and the possibility to determine the own institution’s position. Additional benefits may be attainable by including ‘best practice’ guidance and conducting organisation-spanning assessments so as to enable a well-founded benchmarking.|$|R

40|$|Objective Incontinence is an {{important}} health problem. Effectively treating incontinence could lead to important health gains in patients and caregivers. Management of incontinence is currently suboptimal, especially in elderly patients. To optimise the provision of incontinence care a global optimum continence service specification (OCSS) was developed. The current study evaluates the costs and effects of implementing this OCSS for community-dwelling patients older than 65 years with four or more chronic diseases in the Netherlands. #### Method A decision analytic model was developed comparing the current care pathway for urinary incontinence in the Netherlands with the pathway {{as described in the}} OCSS. The new care strategy was operationalised as the appointment of a continence nurse specialist (NS) located with the general practitioner (GP). This was assumed to increase case detection and to include initial assessment and treatment by the NS. The analysis used a societal perspective, including medical <b>costs,</b> <b>containment</b> products (out-of-pocket and paid by insurer), home care, informal care, and implementation costs. #### Results With the new care strategy a QALY gain of 0. 005 per patient is achieved while saving € 402 per patient over a 3 year period from a societal perspective. In interpreting these findings it is important to realise that many patients are undetected, even in the new care situation (36...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{escalation}} {{in health}} care costs has demonstrated a need to control costs in general and hospital costs in particular. In New York State, efforts at control have followed one of several paths, including reduction of Medicaid program expenditures, elimination of hospital beds, and prospective reimbursement of hospital costs.

Under this system community hospital plans in the Rochester region would be integrated and a cap imposed on both revenues and expenses for acute hospital care. The principal advantage of the MAXICAP is that it offers a mechanism for linking hospital planning with payment functions on a regional basis.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the role of}} pharmaceutical outcome evaluations in mental health care. The first section {{discusses the}} importance of pharmaceutical outcome evaluations. The second section describes techniques used in economic evaluations of pharmaceuticals (i. e., pharmacoeconomic methods). The final section discusses how mental health care outcomes data {{may be used in}} practice. WHY OUTCOMES? The idea that outcomes associated with the provision of health care are important is not new. In the 1960 s Avedis Donabedian (1) presented health outcomes as changes in health status that were attributable to antecedent health care. For many years, however, evaluations of health care focused on the structure or process of care. As health care moves into the new millennium, financing of health care is evolving from individual providers being solely responsible for patient outcomes to an environment where payers, institutions, and providers are being held accountable for quality and cost of care. As financing of health care has moved to a more centralized locus of control, evaluation of outcomes has become more feasible and desirable. In a book titled Who Shall Live, Victor Fuchs (2) discussed three factors that can be balanced in our health care system: costs, quality, and access. Over time the pendulum swings from one to another of these dimensions. If <b>costs</b> <b>containment</b> goes too far, then quality or access may suffer. Likewise, i...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{efficiency}} {{and quality of}} care in nursing homes. By means of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), the efficiency of 40 nursing homes that deliver their services in the north-western area of the Lombardy Region was assessed over a 3 -year period (2005 - 2007). Lombardy is a very peculiar setting, {{since it is the}} only Region in Italy where the healthcare industry is organised as a quasi-market, in which the public authority buys health and nursing services from independent providers-establishing a reimbursement system for this purpose. The analysis is conducted by generating bootstrapped DEA efficiency scores for each nursing home (stage one), then regressing those scores on explanatory variables (stage two). Our DEA model employed two input (i. e. costs for health and nursing services and costs for residential services) and three output variables (case mix, extra nursing hours and residential charges). In the second-stage analysis, Tobit regressions and the Kruskall-Wallis tests of hypothesis to the efficiency scores were applied to define what are the factors that affect efficiency: (a) the ownership (private nursing houses outperform their public counterparts); and (b) the capability to implement strategies for labour cost and nursing <b>costs</b> <b>containment,</b> since the efficiency heavily depends upon the alignment of the costs to the public reimbursement system. Lastly, even though the public institutions are less efficient than the private ones, the results suggest that public nursing homes are moving towards their private counterparts, and thus competition is benefiting efficiency...|$|R
30|$|Answers {{are in the}} {{following}} presented in a summarised form. All four respondents valued the overview functionality of the model positively. Having just recently been confronted with process management as a possible answer to the increased <b>cost</b> <b>containments,</b> they appreciated the possibility to quickly obtain a grasp of what capability areas are crucial and how hospitals evolve in implementing process management. While the model was considered complete {{as it relates to}} content on the given level of granularity all interviewees remarked that a second, more detailed level would provide additional benefits. Regarding the self-assessment, all interviewees were quickly able to locate their respective hospital based on the model. Interestingly, assessments of the respective clinical and administrative managers did not differentiate much. Due {{to the fact that the}} model represents an empirically validated ‘journey’ towards process management, interviewees remarked that they felt able to identify necessary improvement steps based on the difference between their current position and the final stage of maturity. Thus, they attributed the model a normative character. With respect to utility, especially the two clinical managers remarked that—apart from the ‘gap analysis’ based on the maturity stages—they would appreciate additional guidance. Moreover, extending the model towards a tool for hospital-spanning assessments would be highly valuable, as one of the interviewees remarked, since the introduction of DRG also leads to a higher degree of specialisation, which again requires cooperation between hospitals. One evaluation criterion for selecting a cooperation partner may then be his level of competence with regard to process management.|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), {{other federal}} agencies, state agencies, {{and the private}} sector {{pursuing}} environmental remediation programs are considering developing stewardship programs at contaminated sites that might not be remediated to the point of allowing unrestricted land use in the immediate future. Deciding to develop, implement, and monitor a stewardship program requires addressing the risks and costs inherent in such programs. A process that lays out the decision points and information and technology needs associated with these risks and costs would assist site managers, regulators, and members of the interested public in making decisions about full remediation versus stewardship programs and the management of such programs. Development of such a process {{is the subject of this}} report. The goals for development and use of this decisional process are twofold. The first goal is to help decision makers determine whether a stewardship program would be appropriate for a site and, if so, how to design it. The term ''decision makers'' is used in a very broad sense to include everyone with an interest in the site, even though they have varying degrees of authority and responsibility for decisions regarding the site. Site decision makers can include personnel responsible for sites, federal and state regulators, and interested members of the public.
