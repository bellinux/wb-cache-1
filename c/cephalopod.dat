5|$|Two {{possible}} extant <b>cephalopod</b> phylogenies, {{based on}} genetics studies by Strugnell et al. 2007, {{are shown in}} the possible cladograms.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} <b>cephalopod,</b> echinoderm, and bivalve genera {{exhibited}} significant diminution after the K–Pg boundary. Most species of brachiopods, a small phylum of marine invertebrates, survived the K–Pg extinction event and diversified {{during the early}} Paleocene.|$|E
5|$|Spirals {{are common}} in plants and in some animals, notably molluscs. For example, in the nautilus, a <b>cephalopod</b> mollusc, each chamber of its shell is an {{approximate}} copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a logarithmic spiral. Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral {{can be seen as}} a special case of self-similarity.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cephalopods</b> {{are caught}} mainly as {{by-catch}} {{in the bottom}} trawl and due to the growing demand for <b>cephalopods</b> in the international market, they are exploited all along the Indian coast. In Maharashtra, <b>cephalopods</b> are mainly exploited by shrimp trawlers and stand second in the alll India production. The main fish landing centres for <b>cephalopods</b> at Mumbai are New Ferry Wharf (NFW) and Sassoon Docks. <b>Cephalopods</b> contribute 10. 6...|$|R
40|$|Chambered nautilus, cuttlefishes, squids and octopus are {{the four}} major groups of <b>cephalopods,</b> which belong to the highly evolved class of phylum Mollusca. <b>Cephalopods</b> are the third largest {{molluscan}} class after bivalves and gastropods and consist of more than 800 species (Lindgren et al. 2004). The fossil record contains about 17, 000 named species of <b>cephalopods.</b> Although the diversity of <b>cephalopods</b> is very much reduced in the modern era, <b>cephalopods</b> are found to occur in all the oceans of {{the world from the}} tropics to the polar seas and at all depths ranging from the surface to below 5000 m. <b>Cephalopods</b> were dominant predators millions of years before fish appeared. The earliest <b>cephalopods</b> were primitive shelled nautiloids which evolved in the Late Cambrian period. The living <b>cephalopods</b> range in size from 25 mm (Southern pygmy squid, Idiosepius notoides) to more than 12 m (Colossal squid, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni) in length...|$|R
50|$|All <b>cephalopods</b> {{are sexually}} dimorphic and {{reproduce}} by laying eggs. Most <b>cephalopods</b> have semi-internal fertilization, {{in which the}} male places his gametes inside the female's mantle cavity or pallial cavity to fertilize the ova found in the female's single ovary. Likewise, male <b>cephalopods</b> have only a single testicle. In the female of most <b>cephalopods</b> the nidamental glands aid in development of the egg.|$|R
5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the open sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and <b>cephalopod</b> molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, squid such as the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Octopus macropus), and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). Deimatic <b>cephalopod</b> displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|The skins of {{cephalopods}} {{such as the}} octopus contain complex units, each {{consisting of}} a chromatophore with surrounding muscle and nerve cells. The <b>cephalopod</b> chromatophore has all its pigment grains in a small elastic sac, which can be stretched or allowed to relax {{under the control of}} the brain to vary its opacity. By controlling chromatophores of different colours, cephalopods can rapidly change their skin patterns and colours.|$|E
5000|$|Schlotheimiidae is an extinct {{family of}} <b>cephalopods</b> {{belonging}} to the Ammonite subclass. These <b>cephalopods</b> existed in the Jurassic period.|$|R
2500|$|The {{classification}} presented here, {{for recent}} <b>cephalopods,</b> follows largely from [...] (May 2001), for fossil <b>cephalopods</b> takes from Arkell et al. 1957, Teichert and Moore 1964, [...] Teichert 1988, and others. [...] The three subclasses are traditional, {{corresponding to the}} three orders of <b>cephalopods</b> recognized by Bather.|$|R
50|$|Another {{interpretation}} (Engeser, 1997-1998) {{suggests that}} nautiloids, and indeed <b>cephalopods</b> in general, {{fall into two}} main groups, Palcephalopoda (including all the nautiloids except Orthocerida and Ascocerida) and Neocephalopoda (the rest of the <b>cephalopods).</b> However, a more recent phylogenetic study by Lindgren et al. (2004) supports the monophyly of <b>cephalopods,</b> with Nautiloidea being a sister group to Coleoidea.|$|R
5|$|Aquarists also {{propagate}} animals {{behind the}} scenes for the aquarium’s exhibits. Since 1985, the aquarium has been deeply involved in jellyfish propagation, creating three temporary exhibitions and one permanent aquarium gallery within the Open Sea wing. In August 2016, aquarists cultured comb jellies {{for the first time}} in a laboratory, which may allow them to become a model organism. For the aquarium's temporary exhibition that opened in 2014, the aquarium cultured many cephalopods because of their short life cycles. A display in the exhibition showcased how aquarists rear different species of cephalopods, including the bigfin reef squid. In partnership with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at least two deep-sea <b>cephalopod</b> species have been displayed in the exhibition, including flapjack octopuses and the vampire squid.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} {{and without a}} counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather like that of an arthropod but its body, with {{what seemed to be}} fins along its back and belly, looked rather like of a chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, some very good, and reconstructed it as a <b>cephalopod,</b> and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later cephalopods it had only two arms, and its eyes seem mounted on stalks. But it had a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a Spanish {{research}} vessel {{conducted a study}} of the <b>cephalopod</b> population off the coast of Mozambique. The study found populations of V. togata across the entire study area, which ran most of the coast of Mozambique, with especially high concentrations at the very southern end of the Mozambiquan coast, in the waters near the city of Maputo. The study performed trawls in four depth groups, 200–400, 400–500, 500–600, and 600–700 meters below sea level. While V. togata was found in all four depth ranges, they were most abundant between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. The study also noted that males were most common in the shallower two groups, while females were more common in the deeper two groups.|$|E
25|$|While most <b>cephalopods</b> float (i.e. are {{neutrally}} buoyant {{or nearly}} so; in fact most <b>cephalopods</b> are about 2–3% denser than seawater), they achieve this in different ways.|$|R
50|$|The Ellesmerocerids {{were the}} only shelled <b>cephalopods</b> that survived the end-Cambrian extinction, and all {{subsequent}} <b>cephalopods,</b> which diversified throughout the Ordovician period, are thus thought {{to be derived from}} these forms.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>cephalopods</b> feel pain, {{there are}} ethical and animal welfare {{implications}} including {{the consequences of}} exposure to pollutants, practices involving commercial, aquaculture and for <b>cephalopods</b> used in scientific research or which are eaten. Because {{of the possibility that}} <b>cephalopods</b> are capable of perceiving pain, {{it has been suggested that}} [...] "precautionary principles" [...] should be followed with respect to human interactions and consideration of these invertebrates.|$|R
5|$|Molluscs are {{the largest}} marine phylum, {{comprising}} about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. <b>Cephalopod</b> molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, {{are among the most}} neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total.|$|E
5|$|When <b>cephalopod</b> {{molluscs}} like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E
5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} is an active, generalist predator that feeds on both bottom-dwelling and free-swimming organisms. Its diet {{is dominated by}} decapods, krill, bony fishes (including lanternfishes, bristlemouths, dragonfishes, and moras), and cephalopods. The most significant prey species generally reflect what is most available in the environment, for example the shrimps Calocaris macandreae and Pasiphaea multidentata off southern France and the prawns Sergestes arcticus and Sergia robusta off the Iberian Peninsula. Juveniles consume a greater amount and variety of crustaceans than adults, including smaller types such as mysids and hyperiid amphipods. Adults favor relatively large fish prey and {{have been known to}} take other sharks and rays and smaller members of the same species. The importance of <b>cephalopod</b> prey across ages differs between regions. The stomachs of some {{blackmouth catshark}}s have found to contain pieces of animals too large for a single shark to overwhelm, suggesting that it may sometimes attack in groups. Scavenging has been infrequently documented, including of human refuse.|$|E

5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and <b>cephalopod</b> molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times {{in different parts of the}} embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to listing digenetic trematodes found in <b>cephalopods,</b> we provide descriptions of adults of Derogenes varicus and larvae of Lecithochirium microstomum, Lecithochirium sp., Elytrophallus sp., Monilicaecum sp., and Stephanochasmus sp. Only the first had been described previously from <b>cephalopods,</b> {{and the last}} represents the first record of a nonpiscine second intermediate host for a species of Stephanochasmus.

Many early records of trematodes in <b>cephalopods</b> are actually reports of Monogenea, Cestoda, or reproductive organs of <b>cephalopods,</b> and these are reviewed. Our records suggest that <b>cephalopods</b> may serve as second intermediate or final hosts for trematodes such as Stephanochasmus sp. and D. varicus, respectively. More usually, <b>cephalopods</b> act as paratenic hosts capable of being important and, presumably, sometimes vital links in the completion of life cycles of some Digenea. In this way, they fulfill the role of piscine hosts with equivalent food preferences and parasites. Adults of all the worms discussed are parasites of fishes...|$|R

25|$|A {{well known}} {{response}} of cephalopods when threatened is to release {{large volumes of}} ink.

25|$|Cephalopods, such as squid and octopuses, have {{prominent}} {{heads and}} a set of arms (tentacles) modified from the primitive foot of molluscs. All cephalopods are sexually dimorphic. However, they lack external sexual characteristics, so they use colour communication. A courting male approaches a likely looking mate flashing his brightest colours, often in rippling displays. If the other <b>cephalopod</b> is female and receptive, her skin will change colour to become pale, and mating will occur. If the other <b>cephalopod</b> remains brightly coloured, it is taken as a warning.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{study reveals}} the food {{composition}} of pelagic fishes {{living in the}} southwestern Atlantic Ocean. As such more common pelagic species {{are considered to be}} top predators, the study proposes to know what constitutes their main food. Fish are not commonly found within their stomach contents, but instead, <b>cephalopods</b> are their most common food. As can be observed, Teuthida <b>cephalopods</b> compose their principal diet. The stomach contents of specimens of Xiphias gladius, Thunnus albacares, T. obesus, T. alalunga, Isurus oxyrinchus and Alopias superciliosus caught during July 2007 to June 2009 by using tuna longliners were studied. Teuthida <b>cephalopods</b> constitute the main food item for the three tuna species, while X. gladius feeds mainly on Ommastrephidae <b>cephalopods.</b> Though the differences among the kinds of <b>cephalopods</b> exist, they constitute the principal resource these fish use to live at least in the southern Atlantic Ocean...|$|R
