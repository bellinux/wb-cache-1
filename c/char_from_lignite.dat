The initial <b>chars</b> <b>from</b> pitch and <b>lignite</b> are of low and high reactivity respectively. The experiments were carried out in a symmetrical thermobalance under pressure ranging up to 5 MPa of hydrogen and 950 °C.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of this quarter {{focuses on the}} rates of NO reactions with chars in various gaseous environments. The results have revealed significant insights into the NO reduction mechanisms on char surface, particularly when the oxidants, O{sub 2 } and CO{sub 2 }, are introduced into the feed. Indeed, evidences suggest that the formation of stable oxygen complexes is the major cause of differences in NO reactivity on chars of different origins. The oxidants retard the reactivity of char derived fro the bituminous coal more seriously than they affect the <b>char</b> derived <b>from</b> <b>lignite.</b> Furthermore, additions of these oxidants into the reacting stream produce additional yields of CO and CO{sub 2 } during NO reaction with lignite char, suggesting gasification of carbon <b>from</b> <b>lignite</b> <b>char.</b> No excess CO and CO{sub 2 } were observed when the bituminous coal char was used. These yields of CO and CO{sub 2 } also imply that desorption of stable surface oxygen complex is a rate-limiting step which may be catalyzed by the mineral matters during reactions involving lignite char. Surface area evaluated by CO{sub 2 } and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) equation is not a normalization factor of char reactivity during reburning. In the absence of oxidants, the bituminous coal char shows drastic increase in activation energy at about 950 {degrees}C indicating transition of desorption to adsorption controlled mechanisms. When CO{sub 2 } is introduced, the transition temperature increases. When oxygen is also added, no such transition is observed up to 1100 {degrees}C. Lignite char reactivity increases smoothly over the temperature range 800 to 1100 {degrees}C. It is also observed that char reactivity decreases with increasing pyrolysis temperature which {{may be caused by}} closure of pores due to graphitization. The rate of NO reduction on the Pittsburgh {number_sign} 8 coal char is then in good accord with that of a West Virginia coal char reported by De Soete (1980) ...|$|R
40|$|There are a {{large number}} of factors {{affecting}} the gasification reactivity of chars, including physical structure (e. g. surface area and pore structure), catalytically-active mineral matter, and chemical structure which includes the extent of crystallinity of the carbonaceous matrix and also the nature of the functional groups that comprise the char structure. This work focuses on the latter, using Raman spectroscopy to investigate the relationships between intrinsic reactivity and char chemical structure. An Australian bituminous coal char and a Chinese lignite char were characterised in terms of their intrinsic reactivities with CO 2 and H 2 O (separately), under conditions where chemical processes control the observed reaction rates (Regime I). Unreacted and partially-reacted chars were characterised using Raman spectroscopy and gas adsorption for determination of chemical structure indicators and surface area respectively. Raman spectra suggested that the ratio of small to large aromatic rings decreased with increasing carbon conversion, and for the bituminous coal char, this seemed to be linked to the reactivity behaviour of <b>chars</b> made <b>from</b> the bituminous coal. The intrinsic reactivity of <b>chars</b> made <b>from</b> the <b>lignite</b> seemed to have a less significant correlation with Raman features, possibly due to the relative influence of catalytic activity of inorganic species...|$|R

40|$|Emissions of {{the gaseous}} {{pollutants}} NO and NO 2 (collectively known as NO x) {{are subject to}} increasingly stringent controls. The following reaction scheme has been proposed {{as a method of}} reacting the toxic gases NO and CO: 3 NO + 2 Fe ® Fe 2 O 3 + 3 / 2 N 2   (VII); 3 CO + Fe 2 O 3 ® 2 Fe + 3 CO 2. The net effect of these reactions is CO + NO ® CO 2 + ½ N 2. Reaction (VII), above, has been studied in detail in a very sensitive balance, a differential reactor and a laboratory scale fluidised bed. Kinetic parameters for reaction (VII), along with associated activation energies, were measured using the balance. The reaction was found to be marginally slower in the balance than in the differential reactor. The rate of reaction was found to be substantially faster (by a factor of up to ten) in a fluidised bed. The proposed explanation for the large difference in the rate of reaction measured in the balance or differential reactor and in the fluidised bed depends on the attrition of a weakly adherent oxide from the surfaces of iron particles in the fluidised bed. The latter stages of the reaction were also studied in the balance. It was found that after a thick layer of oxide had built up on the surface of a particle of Fe, the rate became almost independent of [NO] in the surrounding gas. This behaviour was ascribed to a solid-state diffusion-mechanism controlling the rate of reaction. Solid-state diffusion coefficients were measured, along with associated activation energies. Particles were also examined in an electron microscope both before and after reaction. Those particles which had been reacted in the balance were found to be very different in appearance from particles which had been reacted in the fluidised bed. In a separate study, the rates of oxidation of coal-chars in a fluidised bed which was contained in a quartz tube were measured. Three coal-chars of differing ranks were studied. The dependence of the rate of reaction on [O 2] and temperature were examined for each coal-char; rate constants were derived, along with activation energies. <b>Chars</b> <b>from</b> Cynheidre (high rank) and Reitspruit (middle rank) appeared to obey a similar rate law, the mechanistic implications of which are here studied in detail. <b>Char</b> <b>from</b> a <b>lignite</b> appeared to obey a very different rate law; a mechanism is also proposed for reaction of this char. A study of the method of addition of the char to the bed was also conducted. This concluded that the method for adding char to the bed was very important when considering the formation of NO x during combustion of the char; the method of addition had less effect on the rate of formation of CO and CO 2. It was also found that a stainless-steel heat-shield which prevented direct radiative heating of the upper surface of the fluidised bed and the freeboard above it had a marked effect on the rate of reaction of the coal-chars.

40|$|The {{gasification}} {{reactivity of}} the <b>chars</b> <b>from</b> both raw and torrefied wood, grape marc, and macroalgae {{has been investigated}} in this paper. The variations in char gasification reactivity were explained using further investigation of the physicochemical characteristics of the char that can influence the gasification reactivity, i. e., specific surface area, uniformity of the carbonaceous structure, and concentration of alkali metals (Na and K). It {{was found that the}} influence of the torrefaction process on the char gasification reactivity strongly depends upon the solid fuel properties and pyrolysis conditions. For a pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C, the gasification reactivity of the <b>chars</b> <b>from</b> both the torrefied grape marc and the torrefied macroalgae was lower than that of the <b>chars</b> <b>from</b> their corresponding raw fuels. This is mainly due to a lower specific surface area and a lower content of alkali metals (Na and/or K) in the <b>chars</b> produced <b>from</b> both the torrefied grape marc and the torrefied macroalgae than for those <b>chars</b> produced <b>from</b> their corresponding raw fuels. However, the opposite influence of torrefaction was found for the macroalgae char when the pyrolysis temperature was increased to 1000 °C. This is attributed mostly to the higher Na content and the more amorphous carbonaceous structure for the torrefied macroalgae char than for the raw macroalgae char. Peijun Guo, Woei L.
