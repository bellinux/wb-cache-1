40|$|<b>Collateral</b> <b>markets</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} important as demand for collateral assets has increased in recent years, driven by changing market practices and an evolving regulatory landscape. This report explores whether and how the design of central banks' operational frameworks influences private <b>collateral</b> <b>markets,</b> including <b>collateral</b> availability, pricing, related market practices, and market performance under stress. It studies these issues by reviewing available information {{from a range of}} sources, including central bank case studies as well as surveys and interviews with private sector participants in <b>collateral</b> <b>markets.</b> Central banks influence <b>markets</b> for <b>collateral</b> through either the supply of assets available for use as collateral (a scarcity channel), the pledgeability of assets in private transactions (a structural channel), or both. They therefore have a variety of design choices at their disposal to influence <b>collateral</b> <b>markets</b> as well as to fine-tune the effects of their operations on these markets. While central bank operating frameworks are not usually the most important factor influencing <b>collateral</b> <b>markets,</b> the evidence presented in this report indicates that the influence of central banks may at times be significant, in particular during crisis times. This highlights the importance of carefully monitoring the effects of central bank operations on <b>collateral</b> <b>markets,</b> as well as the need for central banks to examine their operational frameworks to ensure preparedness for any future crisis response...|$|R

Haircuts are solved to target credit risk measurements, including probability of default, expected loss or unexpected loss criteria.

Deleveraging has two components [...] shrinking of balance sheets due to increased haircuts/shedding of assets, and the reduction in the interconnectedness of the financial system.

We find that both the collateral and its associated velocity are not rebounding as of end- 2011 and still about $ 4 - 5 trillion lower than the peak of $ 10 trillion as of end- 2007.

40|$|The {{paper by}} Manmohan Singh covers {{a lot of}} ground, and lays {{out a number of}} very {{interesting}} issues {{about the nature of the}} shadow banking sector, and the extent to which the activities of banks and non-banks are interrelated. In particular, it points out that, in addition to deposits, a significant share of bank lending is ultimately funded by non-banks. This funding can be described as ‘indirect ’ deposits managed by ‘asset managers’. Banks and non-banks are also linked through the process of collateral intermediation, which is a major form of shadow banking activity. The paper highlights the importance of collateral for the financial system, and its money-like properties. The analogy between collateral and money is drawn out by comparing the haircut in a collateralised transaction to a reserve ratio, and the amount of rehypothecation of collateral to the money multiplier. The paper shows that the ‘velocity ’ of collateral, defined as the value of collateral transactions divided by the stock of collateral, has decreased by one-third since 2007. The paper goes on to suggest that one way of satisfying the increasing demand for high-quality collateral could be to increase collateral velocity rather than expand the issuance of collateral assets by either the private sector or the government.

40|$|In its {{capacity}} as debt issuer, {{the state has}} played a growing role in financial life over the last 30 years.

The repo trinity connected financial stability with liquid government bond markets and free repo markets. It further reinforced the dominance of the US government bond market as institutional template for states adjusting to a world of independent central banks, market-based financing and global competition for liquidity. Central banks and the Financial Stability Board recognized the impossible nature of the trinity after 2008, attributing cyclical leverage (financial instability) and elusive liquidity in <b>collateral</b> <b>markets</b> to deregulated repo markets, markets systemic to shadow banking.

40|$|Quantitative easing à la ECB has {{produced}} so far {{an impact on}} long-term nominal rates through ex ante channels: signalling channels, term duration channels, and risk premia channels. The term duration channel will also lead to a lengthening of the average maturity of government debts, with possible implications for fiscal policy. The ECB’s determination to buy government bonds in a fragmented market with a low net supply may also produce an ex post impact, during the actual asset purchases, but less on nominal rates and more on financial plumbing, as recent volatility suggests. As the effects of scarce supply in <b>collateral</b> <b>markets</b> are felt, repo rates remain well below zero. Lower supply and limited re-usability of high quality collateral, capped by regulatory requirements, is a constraint on market liquidity and compresses dealers’ balance sheets. By keeping a depressed yield curve and asset prices high, QE may also accelerate the consolidation of both traditional and capital-market based (dealer) bank business models. What is less clear is how these changing business models will interact with the sharp rise of the asset management industry {{in the aftermath of}} the crisis, which raises questions about the implications for global collateral flows and deposit-like funding channels...|$|R
