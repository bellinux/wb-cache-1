Therefore, the airspace covert communication algorithm based on spread-spectrum communication technology well achieves safe transmission of information and has good application prospect...|$|R
30|$|The {{blacklist}} effectively {{reduces the}} false negative rate, since some malware {{in order to}} hide the communication behavior, they used <b>covert</b> channel <b>technology.</b> The traditional network covert channel mainly uses the redundant fields of the transport layer and the network layer protocol to transmit information. However, due to the protocol firewall, the information constructed of the redundant fields can be easily detected. To meet certain convenience or to break the firewall barrier, modern network <b>covert</b> channel <b>technology</b> would encapsulate in a specific protocol format of steal data. The common protocols of covert tunnels include IRC protocol, DNS protocol, HTTP protocol, and so on.|$|R
40|$|Packaging is the coordinated {{system that}} {{encloses}} and protects the dosage form. Counterfeit drugs {{are the major}} cause of morbidity, mortality, and failure of public interest in the healthcare system. High price and well-known brands make the pharma market most vulnerable, which accounts for top priority cardiovascular, obesity, and antihyperlipidemic drugs and drugs like sildenafil. Packaging includes overt and <b>covert</b> <b>technologies</b> like barcodes, holograms, sealing tapes, and radio frequency identification devices to preserve {{the integrity of the}} pharmaceutical product. But till date all the available techniques are synthetic and although provide considerable protection against counterfeiting, have certain limitations which can be overcome by the application of natural approaches and utilization of the principles of nanotechnology...|$|R

5000|$|The {{story is}} narrated by the protagonist, Henry Amadeus Meat, a wayward print {{journalist}} from Auckland who stumbles into a mystery {{when he is}} assigned {{to report on the}} controversial and highly publicised deaths of human research subjects at a dream research clinic in Los Angeles. When he begins to learn about the development of a <b>covert</b> dream <b>technology</b> involving voyages to the afterlife, Meat is propelled into a chain of events where green eyed vixens and anonymous phone calls lead him deeper into the heart of a secret he labels [...] "The Grand Deception." [...] While writing The Numinous Place, Staufer also developed and wrote a screenplay with Crowe about US comedian Bill Hicks who died of pancreatic cancer at age 32. Staufer travelled the US, speaking to the late comedians' family and friends to research the script. The biopic, Love, Laughter & Truth, will begin production in 2013 with Crowe making his directorial debut.|$|R

The U.S. government has never officially acknowledged its existence, and {{little is known}} about the technologies and techniques it employs. The sole inside account of SCS comes from a Canadian, Mike Frost, whose 1994 book Spyworld revealed that the program was known to insiders at the time as [...] "College Park". As of 2008, the SCS is reported to target for recruitment key foreign communications personnel such as database managers, systems administrators, and information technology specialists.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{a covert}} {{communication}} applying the vector quantization based information hiding algorithm and the Public Switching Telephone Network (PSTN) is implemented. The system aims at offering good {{security of the}} secret binary image message and the real-time performance {{that is very important}} for the speech calling of the telephone service. Therefore, we adopt a simple and effective encryption method for the secret binary image message prior to the embedding process. The embedding position is also protected by using a secret key. By using these methods, the requirement of short-term protection in the bursting phone call communication for the secret binary image message and the real-time encryption are both fulfilled. Furthermore, an information hiding algorithm based on vector quantization is proposed and the advantage of it is discussed. We evaluate the system with the ITU-T G. 729 a standard speech codec in StegoPhone, which is our platform for research on <b>covert</b> communication <b>technology</b> via PSTN. The experimental results show that our method has negligible hearing effects on the conversation speech and meet the requirement of the real-time calling conversation communication via PSTN...|$|R

From this Khrushchev was able to openly embarrass the Eisenhower administration by exposing the attempted cover-up.Yet despite Khrushchev's May 7 political trap, the Soviet premier still attempted to allow Eisenhower to save face, possibly to salvage the peace summit to some degree. Khrushchev specifically laid the blame for the U-2 not on Eisenhower himself, but on DCI Allen Dulles and the CIA. Khrushchev said that anyone wishing to understand the U-2's mission should [...] "seek a reply from Allen Dulles, at whose instructions the American aircraft flew over the Soviet Union." [...] On May 9, the Soviet premier told US ambassador Thompson that he [...] "could not help but suspect that someone had launched this operation with the deliberate intent of spoiling the summit meeting." [...] Thompson also wrote in his diplomatic cable that Khrushchev suspected it was Allen Dulles, and that Khrushchev had heard about Senator Mansfield's remarks that Eisenhower did not control his own administration.|$|R
30|$|In {{the digital}} era, {{copyright}} protection of multimedia data (e.g., images, audios, and videos) {{is an important}} issue for content owners and service providers. Digital watermarking technology has received considerable attention owing to its potential application to the protection of intellectual property rights, content authentication, fingerprinting, and <b>covert</b> communications. Watermarking <b>technology</b> generally takes four factors (i.e., imperceptibility, security, robustness, and capacity) into consideration [1, 2]. An ideal watermarking algorithm minimizes perceptual distortion due to signal alteration while embedding a sufficient quantity of information within a host signal to ensure resistance against malicious attacks. The fact that the requirements of capacity, robustness, and imperceptibility are contradictory necessitates a tradeoff in the design of various watermarking schemes. For example, medical information systems are primarily intended to provide security and ensure the integrity of information, whereas payload capacity is of paramount importance in air traffic control systems. The annotation watermarking of music products emphasizes imperceptibility and robustness.|$|R

40|$|Information and {{communication}} technology (ICT) developments and trends {{in recent years}} have had great impact on the banking sector worldwide. In many developed and developing countries, the use of disruptive innovation technologies has accelerated change in the way banking business is conducted, consumers being swept along with such change. However, in many countries, such as Oman, there are deep routed cultural and religious factors that cause consumers to question the acceptance of such changes. Through the use of a theoretical framework built on technology acceptance frameworks and models, and empirical evidence from key market segments of the Omani banking market, the research explores the factors that influence Omani consumer acceptance of on-line banking. The findings are significant in that trust, usability and perceived quality are deemed key drivers. This is probably not unexpected, however, what is interesting is that the market profile is skewed to middle aged users, with social standing and “herd” mentality does not affect the adoption of the technology. This, combined with the emerging mobile savvy younger generation poses an interesting challenge {{for the future of the}} banking sector in Oman and implies a need for the sector to rethink the strategic use of, and approach to, implementation of on-line banking in a way that is complementary to the cultural and ethological dimension of the market. In effect, the banking sector will need to manage the <b>covert</b> tension between <b>technology</b> driving “fast time”, and the Omani culture, religion and tradition demanding face to face “slow time”...|$|R
