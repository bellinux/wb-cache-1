40|$|A key {{question}} in categorisation is {{to what extent}} people categorise in the same way, or differently. This paper examines <b>categorisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body in Punjabi, an Indo-European language spoken in Pakistan and India. First, an inventory of body part terms is presented, illustrating how Punjabi speakers segment and categorise the body. There are some noteworthy terms in the inventory, which illustrate categories in Punjabi that are unusual {{when compared to other}} languages presented in this volume. Second, Punjabi speakers’ conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between body parts is explored. While some body part terms are viewed as being partonomically related, others are viewed as being in a locative relationship. It is suggested that there may be key ways in which languages differ in both <b>the</b> <b>categorisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body into parts, and in how these parts are related to one another...|$|R

The images used were a set of different hand postures; open, gripped, and pointing. Various forms of image processing were experimented with including a simulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retina.
