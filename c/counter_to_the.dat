Seen as emergency or extraordinary sessions, they relied on majority voting {{to speed up the}} discussions and ensure a legislative outcome. Many royal election sejms were confederated, {{as well as some of}} the normal sejm walny (general sejm) sessions.|$|E
5|$|Cowan and Hook {{suggest that}} Lucullus would have {{deployed}} the Romans in a simplex acies, {{that is to}} say a single line, so making the frontage of the army as wide as possible as a <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cavalry. He took several of his troops downriver, where the river was the easiest to ford, and at one moment, Tigranes believed that this move meant Lucullus was withdrawing from the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{was in a}} rare {{position}} for many reasons. Although she was of common birth, a woman and unmarried, she rose {{to a position of}} high status, running a large business enterprise. By mid-life she was an independently wealthy woman, connected across England to rich and powerful men in government and the court. Her network of services were in high demand, <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> religious and social morals of the day.|$|E

5|$|Ross said {{he wanted}} the piece to exude organic forms, drawn {{from the city and}} its surroundings. The choice of magenta and yellow paint for the jets was a move to offset the city's stereotypical {{overcast}} skies. The choice of jets was a reference to the city's aviation history; its use of a non-aggressive and bird-like arrangement (itself a reference to the city bird, the Blue heron) was a <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inherent aggressiveness of jets as a symbol.|$|E
5|$|After Rio de Janeiro was {{purchased}} by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

5|$|After his expulsion, Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Surakarta and studied Western history and {{political}} literature, {{which led to}} an interest in socialism. Some figure that affected him besides Karl Marx were Ortega y Gasset and Jan Romein. While in Surakarta he also worked at his father's hospital. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Soedjatmoko was asked to become Deputy Head of the Foreign Press Department in the Ministry of Information. In 1946, {{at the request of}} Prime Minister Sjahrir, he and two friends established a Dutch-language weekly, Het Inzicht (Inside), as a <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dutch-sponsored Het Uίtzicht (Outlook). The next year, they launched a socialist-oriented journal, Siasat (Tactics), which was published weekly. During this period Soedjatmoko dropped the name Mangoendiningrat, as it reminded him of the feudal aspects of Indonesian culture.|$|E
5|$|As CGS, Duigan {{proved to}} be an undistinguished {{appointment}} and was not particularly well regarded by the politicians of the day. He implemented several organisational changes, one of which was the disestablishment of the GOC position and its replacement with an army board to control the military. When the board was established in November 1937, it included Fred Jones, the Minister of Defence, and Duigan as first military member. Duigan offered little <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> favouring of the fledgling Royal New Zealand Air Force by the New Zealand Government of the time, and this affected morale within the army.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 {{psychiatric}} hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 {{psychiatric hospitals}} and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric {{beds in the}} Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|E

5|$|In his youth, Cẩn was a {{follower}} of the nationalist Phan Bội Châu. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he worked to organise support for Diệm as various Vietnamese groups and international powers sought to stamp their authority over Vietnam. Cẩn, who succeeded in eliminating alternative nationalist opposition in central Vietnam, became the warlord of the region when his brother {{became president of the}} southern half of the partitioned nation in 1955. He became notorious for his involvement in smuggling and corruption, as well as his autocratic rule. Cẩn was regarded as an effective leader against the Viet Cong communist insurgency, which was much weaker in central Vietnam than in other parts of South Vietnam. His Popular Force militia was regarded by US officials in central Vietnam as a successful <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> communists.|$|E
5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed to run <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although {{he was not an}} abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E

5|$|On 24 January 2000, after SMU chaired a {{technical}} workshop to obtain feedback on three alternative proposals, a well-known architect named Tay Kheng Soon {{held a press}} conference at The Substation to unveil his unofficial SMU masterplan. URA was invited to the presentation but did not show up. His proposal entailed re-routing the tunnel to save the National Library building. A week later, Tay wrote to the Prime Minister's Office regarding his proposal which was referred to the MND. Many members of the public wrote in publicly either in support of Tay's plans or argue for heritage conservation in general. A few articles and letters highlighted that the adamant official response to public dissent ran <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spirit of the Government's S21 Vision, which expressed a desire to foster civic participation and active citizenry.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian Muslims' {{dissatisfaction with}} the Ustaše rule of the NDH and their need for {{protection}} were combined with nostalgia {{for the period of}} Habsburg rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among prominent Bosnian Muslims. These factors led to a push towards autonomy for the Bosnian Muslim community which was strongly opposed by Pavelić as <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, the autonomists were desperate to protect the Muslim people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich.|$|E
5|$|The castle was not greatly used; the Marquess rarely visited {{after its}} completion.

5|$|WASP-17b is an {{exoplanet}} in {{the constellation}} Scorpius that is orbiting the star WASP-17. Its discovery was announced on 11 August 2009. It is the first planet discovered to have a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits in a direction <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rotation of its host star. This discovery challenged traditional planetary formation theory. In terms of diameter, WASP-17b is the second-largest exoplanet discovered yet, and at half Jupiter's mass, this makes it the most puffy planet known.

5|$|He {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{publicly}} known judges thanks to his report on the Profumo Affair.

During his 38-year career as a judge he made large changes to the common law, particularly while in the Court of Appeal, and although many of his decisions were overturned by the House of Lords several of them were confirmed by Parliament, which passed statutes in line with his judgments. Although appreciated for his role as 'the people's judge' and his support for the individual, Denning was also controversial for his campaign against the common law principle of precedent, and for comments he made regarding the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four, and also as Master of the Rolls for his conflict with the House of Lords.|$|E
