40|$|This paper {{tries to}} explain {{different}} nature of the dynamics during the upward and downward part of the last house price cycle in Spain. Covered bonds are introduced as an instrument which may accelerate a house price boom, while it may {{also serve as a}} source of correction to overvalued house prices in downturn, where important rigidities may be present In a serious economic stress, lack of investment opportunities motivates investors to buy covered bonds due to the strong guarantees provided, which may in turn help to revitalize the credit and housing markets. To address such regime shift, house price dynamics is modelled within a framework of mutually related house price, credit and business cycles using smooth transition vector autoregressive model, in which volume of <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>issued</b> is included. Linear behaviour of such system is rejected, indicating the need to model house prices in a nonlinear framework. Also, importance of modelling house prices in the context of credit and business cycles is confirmed and causality from issuance of covered bonds to house price dynamics is found in this nonlinear structure. Finally, potential threat to financial stability resulting from rising asset encumbrance both in the upward and downward part of the house price cycle is identified. It is suggested that the collateral valuation used for the dynamic adjustment of the cover pool is done using forward looking predictions of house prices and that the rate of asset encumbrance is monitored jointly with stress testing the house prices...|$|E

40|$|Securitisation {{was heavily}} {{regulated}} after {{the global financial}} crisis because of the blames placed on it. However, a favourable treatment was given to <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> - close counterparts of securitised products. This discrimination raised many concerns among the market participants once the dust of the crisis was settled. This study provides a comparative analysis of securitised products and <b>covered</b> <b>bonds.</b> The study starts with {{a review of the}} regulations by providing the detailed information about regulations of both markets and highlights the asymmetry in regulations. After this review, a detailed empirical analysis is performed to assess the credibility of the blames placed on securitised products to identify the actual problems in this market. This empirical analysis also assesses if <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> can help in avoiding the problems linked with the securitisation. The data has been collected from 7 major European markets for period of 2000 - 2014. The major blame on securitisation is that it motivates banks to take elevated credit risk. However, the empirical results of the study do not support this blame, rather <b>covered</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issuing</b> banks are also found taking a higher risk in the long run. Moreover, the empirical analysis also shows that securitisation per se does not increase risk in the banking system, but it depends on the volume of issued securities. A non-linear (U-Shaped) relationship is found between securitisation volume and systemic risk. Results also suggest that only bigger banks should be allowed to <b>issue</b> <b>covered</b> <b>bonds.</b> Currently, regulations are trying to control the risk and restart the securitisation market at the same time. Based on empirical findings, the study suggests that flat treatment given to securitisation may not help in meeting these goals.

40|$|Following the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> (bank-issued {{debt instruments}} with credit en-hancements such as dual-recourse and dynamic cover pool) {{have been discussed}} {{as an alternative to}} mortgage-backed-securities (MBS) because of their potential of adding stability to the banking system. While being liquid is a key feature of the MBS market, the liquidity of <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> remains less well-understood by investors and academics. To better understand <b>covered</b> <b>bonds,</b> this project measures the liquidity of German <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> using transactional data and several common proxies.

25|$|In Europe {{there exists}} a type of asset-backed <b>bond</b> called a <b>covered</b> <b>bond,</b> {{commonly}} known by the German term Pfandbriefe. <b>Covered</b> <b>bonds</b> were first created in 19th-century Germany when Frankfurter Hypo began <b>issuing</b> mortgage <b>covered</b> <b>bonds.</b> The market has been regulated since {{the creation of a}} law governing the securities in Germany in 1900. The key difference between <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> and mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities is that banks that make loans and package them into <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> keep those loans on their books.
