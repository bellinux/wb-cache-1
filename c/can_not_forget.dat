Anime News Network also adds that in Reflection he [...] "continues to be his old mopey self" [...] and criticizes {{the fact that he}} never says [...] "oro", while IGN felt that some moments of the relationship between Kenshin and Kaoru were depressing. While criticizing the characters' sad decisions, Serdar Yegulalp from About.com wondered whether the OVAs had to make viewers accept Kenshin's death wish after so much time of wandering and feeling a mortal disease. However, some reviewers noted Kenshin's personality in the OVAs {{was one of the most}} complex ever to be animated remarking on the fact that he <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> his bloody past, despite having a peaceful life. Don Houston from DVD Talk noted the controversy between the fandom as they refrained from treating Reflection as canon due to how tragic the life of Kenshin's family became. Ridwan Khan from Animefringe shared similar feelings, but noted Kenshin had no new enemies to fight after Enishi, leaving him with his disease story arc.|$|E

Finally, the value of collective memory in social struggle is assessed.

This memory shapes their identity as refugees and the latter is looked upon as important in their social struggle against exploitation.

Since biometric characteristics are distinctive, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>forgotten</b> or lost, and the person to be authenticated needs to be physically present at the point of identification, biometrics is inherently more reliable and more capable than traditional knowledge-based and token-based techniques. Using biometrics for identifying human beings offers some unique advantages. Biometrics can be used to identify you as you. Biometrics holds the promise of fast, easy-to-use, accurate, reliable, and less expensive authentication for a variety of applications. This paper provides an overview of the different biometric technique with some advantages and disadvantages. Than we will try to find out which technique is more reliable and secure...|$|R
