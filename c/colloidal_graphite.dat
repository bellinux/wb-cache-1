40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the formation of}} nanofibers (with hundred of nanometers) by using electrospinning (electrostatic deposition) aiming at applications as sensors. Different quantities of a <b>colloidal</b> dispersion of <b>graphite</b> particles were blended with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and N,N dimethylformamide (DMF), resulting {{in a series of}} solutions with carbon concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 %. Precipitation was observed depending on the concentration of carbon added to the precursor blend. As a consequence, the relative viscosity decreases, due to PAN molecules removal from the solution by carbon particles adsorption, forming precipitates. The resulting fibers show an irregular shape, as observed by SEM and the diameters decrease with the increase of the carbon concentration in the precursor blend. The incorporation of carbon particles in the fibers was confirmed by FTIRS and Raman spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} novel route to produce a graphene-based film on a polymer substrate. A {{transparent}} <b>graphite</b> <b>colloidal</b> suspension was applied to a slat of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The good adhesion to the PMMA surface, combined with the shear stress, allows a uniform and continuous spreading of the graphite nanocrystals, resulting in a very uniform graphene multilayer coating on the substrate surface. The fabrication process is simple and yields thin coatings characterized by high optical transparency and large electrical piezoresitivity. Such properties envisage potential applications of this polymer-supported coating for use in strain sensing. The electrical and mechanical properties of these PMMA/graphene coatings were characterized by bending tests. The electrical transport was investigated {{as a function of}} the applied stress. The structural and strain properties of the polymer composite material were studied under stress by infrared thermography and micro-Raman spectroscopy...|$|R
30|$|Graphene, {{with its}} unique {{physical}} properties[1 – 4], {{is one of}} the most exciting nanomaterials discovered in the last years. A particularly promising graphene production technique is based on the obtainment of <b>colloidal</b> suspensions from <b>graphite,</b> or its derivatives[5]. In spite of other methods like epitaxial growth[6], chemical vapor deposition[7], and micromechanical exfoliation[8], this approach is both scalable, affording the possibility of high-volume production, and versatile in terms of chemical functionalization, which, on the other hand, is sometimes exploited to favor graphene obtainment and its dispersion. Colloidal graphene suspensions may be advantageous in that they could be used for a wide range of applications including: spray coating, vacuum filtration, or drop casting; moreover, by mixing them with polymers, graphene-based polymer composites can be prepared. In these production methods, the key challenge involves the exfoliation of graphitic materials in a liquid that can disperse graphene sheets in a stable way.|$|R

50|$|Usually a thin {{nichrome}} wire is used.

Another material, able to actively release chemical energy, is Pyrofuze, aluminium wire clad with palladium; when being heated it undergoes strongly exothermic reaction as the molten metals form an alloy. A variant with the same function consists of laminated thin alternate layers of aluminium and nickel. Carbon bridge is a thin spot of <b>colloidal</b> <b>graphite</b> used as the bridgewire.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} aimed {{to review the}} state of the art related to the {{preparation}} of polymer nanocomposites having tunable graphene loadings and summarize their main peculiar features. The current open literature describes several types of so-called ‘graphene', which differ for the processes used for its obtainment, namely: expansion, exfoliation, functionalization, oxidation, oxidation/reduction, etc. Thus, very often it becomes quite difficult to discriminate among the different ‘graphene products' and avoid any misunderstanding: indeed, as an example, the use of reduced graphene oxide instead of ‘graphene' can influence the overall final properties of the polymer material, to which the nanofiller is added, in a very different way with respect to the ‘graphene' obtained through direct sonication, milling or thermal expansion. Among the up-to-date methods exploited for obtaining and utilizing this nanofiller in nanocomposite fabrication, the direct sonication from <b>colloidal</b> suspensions of <b>graphite</b> and the use of graphene nanoplatelets (defined as graphene mono- or few-layers, possibly bearing some functional groups attached to the carbon structure) are the most convenient in terms of cost and simplicity; they differ as far as the purity and the presence of process-induced defects are considered. The former method involves a simple protocol based on low energy consumption and high volume production and allows obtaining graphene substantially without any defect. In addition, such a nanofiller, obtained by direct exfoliation (i. e., without any chemical oxidation and subsequent reduction) in suitable common solvents, surfactants or monomers to eventually polymerize, can be used for the preparation of both thermoplastic and thermoset polymer nanocomposites. Graphene nanoplatelets can be obtained by exploiting different exfoliation processes (i. e. milling, sonication, thermal expansion, etc.), usually in the presence of chemically reactive compounds that are used for the functionalization of the nanofiller. Nowadays, they represent the most used type of ‘graphene' existing in the market. However, it will be shown that, despite their availability, they should be used with caution in that they can hardly be considered ‘real graphene', because of the number of defects induced by the fabrication process and still remaining in the structure. The first part of the chapter summarizes the main methods for obtaining graphene, showing advantages and drawbacks. In the second part, the morphology, as well as the thermal, physico-mechanical, electrical and rheological peculiarities of the obtained nanocomposite materials based either on graphene from direct sonication of <b>colloidal</b> suspensions of <b>graphite</b> or graphene nanoplatelets are reviewed in detai...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrothermal}} {{reaction of}} {{a mixture of}} a <b>colloidal</b> dispersion of <b>graphite</b> oxide and ammonium vanadate yielded a hybrid made of graphene and a nanotubular metastable monoclinic polymorph of VO 2, known as VO 2 (B). The formation of VO 2 (B) nanotubes is accompanied by the reduction of graphite oxide. Initially the partially scrolled graphite oxide layers act as templates for the crystallization of VO 2 (B) in the tubular morphology. This {{is followed by the}} reduction of graphite oxide to graphene resulting in a hybrid in which VO 2 (B) nanotubes are dispersed in graphene. Electron microscopic studies of the hybrid reveal that the VO 2 (B) nanotubes are wrapped by and trapped between graphene sheets. The hybrid shows potential to be a high capacity cathode material for lithium ion batteries. It exhibits a high capacity (similar to 450 mAh/g) and cycling stability. The high capacity of the hybrid is attributed to the interaction between the graphene sheets and the VO 2 (B) tubes which improves the charge-transfer. The graphene matrix prevents the aggregation of the VO 2 (B) nanotubes leading to high cycling stability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Recently, we {{have shown}} that the graphene-VO 2 (B) {{nanotube}} hybrid is a promising lithium ion battery cathode material (Nethravathi et al. Carbon, 2012, 50, 4839 - 4846). Though the observed capacity of this material was quite satisfactory, the rate capability was not. To improve the rate capability we wanted to prepare a graphene-VO 2 (B) hybrid in which the VO 2 (B) would be built on 2 D nanosheets that would enable better electrode-electrolyte contact. Such a material, a N-doped graphene-VO 2 (B) nanosheet-built 3 D flower hybrid, is fabricated by a single-step hydrothermal reaction within a mixture of ammonium vanadate and <b>colloidal</b> dispersion of <b>graphite</b> oxide. The 3 D VO 2 (B) flowers which are uniformly distributed on N-doped graphene are composed of ultrathin 2 D nanosheets. When used in lithium ion batteries, this material exhibits a large capacity, high rate capability, and excellent cycling stability. The enhanced performance results from its unique features: excellent electronic conductivity associated with the N-doped graphene, short transportation length for lithium ions related to ultrathin nanosheets, and improved charge transfer due to the anchoring of the VO 2 (B) flowers to N-doped graphene...|$|R

40|$|Photothermal {{excitation}} is a cantilever excitation {{method that}} enables stable and accurate operation for dynamic-mode AFM measurements.

In this study, we propose a method for improving the photothermal excitation efficiency by coating cantilever backside surface near its fixed end with <b>colloidal</b> <b>graphite</b> as a photothermal conversion (PTC) layer. The excitation efficiency for a standard cantilever of PPP-NCHAuD with a spring constant of ≈ 40 N/m and a relatively stiff cantilever of AC 55 with a spring constant of ≈ 140 N/m were improved by 6. 1 times and 2. 5 times, respectively, by coating with a PTC layer. We experimentally demonstrate high stability of the PTC layer in liquid by AFM imaging of a mica surface with atomic resolution in phosphate buffer saline solution for more than 2 h without any indication of possible contamination from the coating.

40|$|Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization(MALDI) mass spectrometry(MS) {{has been}} widely used for {{analysis}} of biological molecules, especially macromolecules such as proteins. However, MALDI MS has a problem in small molecule (less than 1 kDa) analysis because of the signal saturation by organic matrixes in the low mass region. In imaging MS (IMS), inhomogeneous surface formation due to the co-crystallization process by organic MALDI matrixes limits the spatial resolution of the mass spectral image. Therefore, to make laser desorption/ionization (LDI) MS more suitable for mass spectral profiling and imaging of small molecules directly from raw biological tissues, LDI MS protocols with various alternative assisting materials were developed and applied to many biological systems of interest. <b>Colloidal</b> <b>graphite</b> {{was used as a}} matrix for IMS of small molecules {{for the first time and}} methodologies for analyses of small metabolites in rat brain tissues, fruits, and plant tissues were developed.

30|$|The Schottky diodes were {{prepared}} on polished single crystals of n-type InP or n-type GaN by painting <b>colloidal</b> <b>graphite</b> {{on the surface}} previously partly deposited with Pd NPs. The Pd NPs were deposited by electrophoresis from colloid solutions in isooctane prepared by chemical reduction of Pd-salt water solution in reverse micelles. The Schottky diodes showed current-voltage characteristics of low leakage currents and large rectification ratios, and they were much sensitive to H 2 exposure with more than two orders-of-magnitude improvement over the best result reported previously [5]. Hydrogen detection limit of reported diodes was estimated at 1 ppm H 2 /N 2.|$|E
30|$|The Schottky diodes {{obtained}} by application of <b>colloidal</b> <b>graphite</b> on n-type InP and n-type GaN, marked InP-C, InP-Pd-C, and GaN-Pd-C are inexpensive but {{of very high}} quality, having low reverse leakage currents and high rectification ratios. Schottky barrier heights of 0.873 and 1.14 eV of InP-Pd-C and GaN-Pd-C diodes are much higher than those {{obtained by}} other methods, like thermal evaporation, which was, e.g., 0.55 eV {{in the case of}} Pd onto InP [9]. It shows on a very small or virtually negligible Fermi level pinning in these diodes so that any change in the Schottky barrier height should be equal to the change of the work function caused by an external charge appearing at the interface. Indeed, the measured values of Schottky barrier heights of 0.873 or 1.14 eV are close to differences between the electron work function of palladium metal 5.12 eV [10] and the electron affinity of InP, 4.38 eV [11] (0.74 eV) or of GaN, 4.1 eV [12] (1.02 eV). In principal, Fermi level pinning is caused by interface states in a semiconductor near the intimate contact with the metal. There are two basic ways creating interface states, physical breakings [9] and chemical reactions [13]. I believe that elimination of chemical reactions, due to forming Schottky barriers with <b>colloidal</b> <b>graphite</b> and surfactant wrapped Pd NPs, is the main reason for the absence of Fermi level pinning in the prepared diodes.|$|E
