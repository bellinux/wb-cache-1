25|$|In rodents, <b>caloric</b> <b>restriction</b> slows {{aging and}} extends lifespan. At least 4 {{studies have shown}} that <b>caloric</b> <b>restriction</b> reduces 8-OHdG damages in various organs of rodents. One of these studies showed that <b>caloric</b> <b>restriction</b> reduced {{accumulation}} of 8-OHdG with age in rat brain, heart and skeletal muscle, and in mouse brain, heart, kidney and liver. More recently, Wolf et al. showed that dietary restriction reduced accumulation of 8-OHdG with age in rat brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. Thus reduction of oxidative DNA damage is associated with a slower rate of aging and increased lifespan.|$|E

25|$|One {{prominent}} and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called <b>caloric</b> <b>restriction.</b> <b>Caloric</b> <b>restriction</b> observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span {{from a very}} limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy. That {{is the key to}} why animals like giant tortoises can live so long. Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: While {{it is now}} {{accepted}} that genes and their products affect food intake, the concept that locomotor behavior or the propensity for physical activity is controlled by neuro hum oral regulators is frequently underappreciated. In mammals, complex interactions have developed to allow the cross-talk between fuel homeostasis and physical activity. AIM: The aim of this review {{is to provide a}} synopsis of the influence of the leptin-melanocortin pathway, a well-studied pivotal player in body weight regulation, on locomotor behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: In rodents, reductions in leptin levels that physiologically occur following acute food deprivation or a reduction of the fat mass consequent to prolonged <b>caloric</b> <b>restrictions</b> are associated with a decrease in total locomotor activity and simultaneous increase in food-anticipatory activity, a locomotor behavior which reflects a foraging attitude. These actions can be prevented by leptin administration and are at least partially mediated by the neurons of the melanocortin pathway. In humans, twin studies have attributed to genetic factors approximately 50...|$|R

Loss of weight but not of adipose tissue was significantly greater on the 330 -kcal/d diet. It is likely that dehydration rather than protein catabolism was responsible for additional loss offat-free mass in the 330 -kcal/d group because the nitrogen deficit was not excessive. The thermic response to food was blunted only in the 330 -kcal/d group whereas resting oxygen uptake decreased by equal amounts in both groups. There was a decrease in 24 -h urinary noradrenaline in the 330 -kcal/d group but plasma fT 4 was sustained {{when compared with the}} 780 -kcal/d group; fT 3 decreased significantly more quickly in the 330 -kcal/d group.

It is a sort of search for a big discovery, like a fountain of youth or such.

40|$|Ageing {{has been}} defined as a {{gradually}} decreased ability to maintain homeostatic potential and increased risk to die, associated with a tissue accumulation of altered proteins and lipids. Among other, increased concentration of an isoprenoid compound, dolichol (Dol), in mammalian tissues during ageing has been reported and it has been considered as a new biomarker of ageing. However, the mechanism and the role of this accumulation is still unknown. Aim of this work was to study the mechanism of age-dependent Dol accumulation in the liver analysing the activity of the hepatic rate-limiting enzyme of isoprenoid biosynthesis, the 3 -hydroxy 3 -methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCoA reductase), the Dol synthesis by mevalonate (MVA), the Dol level in the plasma, and the cholesterol (Chol) synthesis and content of ageing rat fed ad libitum (AL) or subjected to the effect of food <b>restriction.</b> Since the <b>caloric</b> <b>restrictions</b> are the most reproducible way to slow ageing and to extend life span, animals on these nutritional regimens were used to study ageing related mechanisms. The data show that during ageing the hepatic Dol accumulation is associated with an increase of HMGCoA reductase activity, which is affected by diet restriction, and with an increase of MVA incorporation in Dol and Chol, which is not. In addition, the liver of aged rats maintains the capability to regulate its Chol content and to modify Chol delivery into the blood...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE: Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) is a {{functional}} antagonist of corticotrophin-releasing factor, the main mediator {{of the stress}} response. Stress represents a key determinant of binge eating (BE) for highly palatable food (HPF). OBJECTIVES: In relation to the antistress properties of N/OFQ, we evaluated its effect on BE. After the observation that episodes of food restriction increase the sensitivity to its hyperphagic effects, the function of NOP receptor and N/OFQ was investigated after cycles of food restrictions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In BE experiments, four groups were used: rats fed normally and not stressed or stressed, rats exposed to cycles of restriction/refeeding and then stressed, or not stressed. In the other experiments, two groups were used: rats exposed or not to food restriction. RESULTS: Only restricted and stressed rats exhibited BE for HPF (containing chocolate cream). Intracerebroventricular injections of N/OFQ of 0. 5 nmol/rat significantly reduced BE. N/OFQ 1 nmol/rat did not reduce BE but significantly increased HPF intake following food restrictions. Cycles of food restriction increased animals' sensitivity to the hyperphagic effect of N/OFQ for HPF. In situ hybridization studies following food restrictions showed decreased ppN/OFQ mRNA expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and increased expression of ppN/OFQ and NOP receptor mRNA in the ventral tegmental area and in the ventromedial hypothalamus, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that N/OFQ slightly reduces BE at low doses, while higher doses increase HPF intake, due to increased sensitivity to its hyperphagic effect following a history of <b>caloric</b> <b>restrictions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Obesity is not {{a single}} disease, but a variety of {{conditions}} resulting from different mechanisms and associated with various types and degrees of risks. To determine who should lose weight, how much weight should be lost, and how to undertake weight loss, the following types of information are needed: personal-demographic data, developmental patterns, family history, energy balance, body composition/fat distribution, psychological/behavioral measures, endocrine/metabolic measures, complications and associated conditions. Weight reduction should be undertaken by women with morbid obesity, with complications secondary to the obesity, with a strong family history of conditions associated with obesity, or with increased abdomen:hip ratios. In contrast, women who have excess weight localized in the hips and thighs and no personal or family history of associated conditions may not benefit from dietary restriction. Low calorie diets result in adaptive changes, "designed" to prolong survival in the face of famine. These include changes in water balance, metabolic rate, and appetite. Metabolic rate declines, allowing the individual to burn fewer and fewer calories. Each time a woman diets she tends to lose weight less rapidly than the time before. "Restrained eating" predisposes binge eating. Indeed, bulimia rarely occurs in the absence of prior <b>caloric</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Current medical definitions of obesity do not consider these nuances.

40|$|Background: Improved diet {{quality has}} been {{identified}} as a key factor in improving longevity and quality of life. Behavior change interventions seeking to influence diet quality and limit obesity often focus on <b>caloric</b> <b>restrictions</b> and quantities of foods consumed. No current interventions have focused solely on the act of eating, despite initial research that suggests that pace at which food is consumed during a meal may be influential. ^ Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate relationships between within-meal eating rate and diet quality, and the influence of participation in an eating rate intervention on diet quality. ^ Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis utilizing data from the Eating Pace Instruction Classes (EPIC) I Study. Participants included 22 females ages 18 to 24 years with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31. 8 + 2. 6 kg/m 2. The study used a pre-test post-test design with randomized equivalent treatment and non-treatment control groups. The treatment group participated in a five week intervention consisting of weekly one-on-one coaching sessions focusing on techniques to help participants decrease their within-meal eating rates. Relationships between eating rate and diet quality were assessed by first using laboratory measured eating rate at baseline and post intervention for both groups, and 24 -hour dietary recalls to assess dietary quality at these time points. Diet quality was assessed by Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) scores. Pearson Correlations were used to assess relationships between diet quality and eating pace at baseline. Independent Samples t-tests and one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used to evaluate potential differences between treatment and control groups post intervention. ^ Results: There was no relationship between eating pace and diet quality at baseline (r = 0. 26, p= 3. 23). Although the intervention was successful in decreasing eating rate (F = 13, p 3 ̆c 0. 001), there was no effect on diet quality (F = 0. 3, p = 0. 91). In this study, an eating pace intervention that reduced eating rate had no influence on diet quality. Future research should explore combining eating rate instruction with nutrition education to increase diet quality and decrease chronic disease risk. ...|$|R

In this review, we assess hypoglycemia as an alternative physiological explanation for the biochemical and lipid findings in conditions of insulin resistance (IR). Therefore, PubMed databases (1961 – 2010) were searched for articles on the effect of hypoglycemia and starvation on non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) elevation and abnormalities in insulin signaling in muscles as well as abnormal kidney metabolism. The search included articles on NEFA and their role in triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism, as well as kidney and heart disease. Available studies support that hypoglycemia increases NEFA generation from adipose tissue. Elevated levels of NEFA induce increased plasma levels of TG and decreased levels of HDL cholesterol, and may cause direct kidney and myocardial damage. IR of adipose and skeletal muscle tissue, and the elevation in insulin levels in obese, insulin-resistant patients could be explained by an adaptation to their carbohydrate intake. These molecular abnormalities in insulin metabolic signaling can also be found in hypoglycemia or starvation. In conclusion, IR of adipose tissue cannot fully explain the lipid abnormalities observed in the cardiorenal syndrome.

Methods: Women were randomized to a diet (n = 97), mainly exercise (n = 98), or control group (n = 48). Goal of both interventions was to lose 5 to 6 kg bodyweight by a hypocaloric diet or an exercise program (4 hours/week) combined with a small <b>caloric</b> intake <b>restriction.</b> Outcomes after 16 weeks included serum high-sensitive C?reactive protein (hsCRP), IL 6, adiponectin, and leptin. Results: Both intervention groups achieved the target weight loss. Controls remained weight stable. Compared with control, hsCRP decreased with mainly exercise [treatment effect ratio (TER) = 0. 64] and borderline statistically significant with diet (TER = 0. 77). There was a suggestively larger effect of exercise, directly compared with diet (TER = 0. 83).

40|$|Dietary {{restriction}} (DR) is {{the most}} consistent means of extending longevity {{in a wide range}} of organisms. A growing body of literature indicates that mitochondria play an important role in longevity extension by DR, but the impact of mitochondrial genotypes on the DR process have received little attention. Mitochondrial function requires proper integration of gene products from their own genomes (mtDNA) and the nuclear genome as well as the metabolic state of the cell, which is heavily influenced by diet. These three-way mitochondrial-nuclear-dietary interactions influence cellular and organismal functions that affect fitness, aging, and disease in nature. To examine these interactions in the context of longevity, we generated 18 "mito-nuclear" genotypes by placing mtDNA from strains of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans onto controlled nuclear backgrounds of D. melanogaster (Oregon-R, w 1118, SIR 2 overexpression and control) and quantified the lifespan of each mitonuclear genotype on five different sugar:yeast diets spanning a range of <b>caloric</b> and dietary <b>restriction</b> (CR and DR). Using mixed effect models to quantify main and interaction effects, we uncovered strong mitochondrial-diet, mitochondrial-nuclear, and nuclear-diet interaction effects, in addition to three-way interactions. Survival analyses demonstrate that interaction effects can be more important than individual genetic or dietary effects on longevity. Overexpression of SIR 2 reduces lifespan variation among different mitochondrial genotypes and further dampens the response of lifespan to CR but not to DR, suggesting that response to these two diets involve different underlying mechanisms. Overall the results reveal that mitochondrial-nuclear genetic interactions play important roles in modulating Drosophila lifespan and these epistatic interactions are further modified by diet. More generally, these findings illustrate that gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interactions are not simply modifiers of key factors affecting longevity, but these interactions themselves are the very factors that underlie important variation in this trait...|$|R

The Daniel Fast is based on the Biblical book of Daniel, is commonly partaken for 21 days, and involves food intake in accordance with a stringent vegan diet. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the effect of a 21 day Daniel Fast on biomarkers of antioxidant status and oxidative stress. Methods 43 subjects (13 men; 30 women; 35 ± 1 yrs; range: 20 - 62 yrs) completed a 21 day Daniel Fast following the guidelines provided by investigators. Subjects reported to the lab in a 12 hour post-absorptive state both pre fast (day 1) and post fast (day 22). At each visit, blood was collected for determination of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), nitrate/nitrite (NOx), Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC), and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Subjects recorded dietary intake during the 7 day period immediately prior to the fast and during the final 7 days of the fast. Results A decrease was noted in MDA (0. 66 ± 0. 0. 03 vs. 0. 56 ± 0. 02 μmol L - 1; p = 0. 004), while H 2 O 2 demonstrated a trend for lowering (4. 42 ± 0. 32 vs. 3. 78 ± 0. 21 μmol L - 1; p = 0. 074). Both NOx (18. 79 ± 1. 92 vs. 26. 97 ± 2. 40 μmol L - 1; p = 0. 003) and TEAC (0. 47 ± 0. 01 vs. 0. 51 ± 0. 01 mmol L - 1; p = 0. 001) increased from pre to post fast, while ORAC was unchanged (5243 ± 103 vs. 5249 ± 183 μmol L - 1 TE; p = 0. 974). As expected, multiple differences in dietary intake were noted (p Conclusion Modification of dietary intake in accordance with the Daniel Fast is associated with an improvement in selected biomarkers of antioxidant status and oxidative stress, including metabolites of nitric oxide (i. e., NOx). </p...|$|R
