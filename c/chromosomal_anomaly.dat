40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine what percentage of fetal chromosomal anomalies remains undetected when first trimester combined testing is replaced by non-invasive prenatal testing for trisomies 13, 18, and 21. We focused on the added clinical value of nuchal translucency (NT) measurement. METHODS: Data on fetal karyotype, ultrasound findings, and pregnancy outcome of all pregnancies with an NT measurement ≥ 3. 5 [*]mm were retrospectively collected from a cohort of 25, 057 singleton pregnancies in which first trimester combined testing was performed. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-five fetuses (0. 9 %) had an NT ≥ 3. 5 [*]mm. In 24 of these pregnancies, a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomaly</b> other than trisomy 13, 18, or 21 was detected. Eleven resulted in fetal demise, and ten showed fetal ultrasound anomalies. In three fetuses with normal ultrasound findings, a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomaly</b> was detected, of which one was a triple X. CONCLUSIONS: In three out of 25, 057 pregnancies (0. 01 %), non-invasive prenatal testing and fetal ultrasound would have missed a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomaly</b> that would have been identified by NT measurement...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the results of}} second-trimester amniocyte karyotyping in western and eastern Taiwan, and identifying any regional differences in the prevalence of fetal <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies.</b> MethodsFrom 2004 to 2009, pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis in their second trimester at three hospitals in western Taiwan and at four hospitals in eastern Taiwan were included. All the cytogenetic analyses of cultured amniocytes were performed in the cytogenetics laboratory of the Genetic Counseling Center of Hualien Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital. We used the chi-square test, Student t test, and Mann–Whitney U test to evaluate the variants of clinical indications, amniocyte karyotyping results, and prevalence and types of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> in western and eastern Taiwan. ResultsDuring the study period, 3573 samples, 1990 (55. 7 %) from western Taiwan and 1583 (44. 3 %) from eastern Taiwan, were collected and analyzed. The main indication for amniocyte karyotyping was advanced maternal age (69. 0 % in western Taiwan, 67. 1 % in eastern Taiwan). The detection rates of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> by amniocyte karyotyping in eastern Taiwan (45 / 1582, 2. 8 %) {{did not differ significantly}} from that in western Taiwan (42 / 1989, 2. 1 %) (p =  1. 58). Mothers who had abnormal ultrasound findings and histories of familial hereditary diseases or <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> had higher detection rates of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> (9. 3 % and 7. 2 %, respectively). The detection rate of autosomal anomalies was higher in eastern Taiwan (93. 3 % vs. 78. 6 %, p =  0. 046), but the detection rate of sex-linked <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> was higher in western Taiwan (21. 4 % vs. 6. 7 %, p =  0. 046).

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} if ductus venosus (DV) pulsatility {{index for}} veins (PIV) and a-wave measurements {{can increase the}} accuracy of first-trimester Down syndrome screening in a high-risk population. Methods The database of our fetal medicine unit was searched for all cases at increased first-trimester Down syndrome risk. Multivariable logistic regression was used to construct a prediction rule for <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> at any given maternal age, nuchal translucency multiples of the median (NT-MoM) and DV-Ply MoM. The discriminative ability of the model was assessed by using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Results The study population included 445 fetuses. DV-PlV was increased (>= 95 (th) percentile) in 239 (54 %) and DV a-wave was abnormal in 187 fetuses (42 %). In this cohort, 80 % of all <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> were identified by an increased DV-PIV and 68 % by an abnormal a-wave. The odds of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> increased {{by a factor of}} 4. 2 per MoM increase in DV-Ply, adjusted for NT and maternal age. The area under the ROC curve for the prediction of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> was 0. 79. After correction for DV-PIV, DV a-wave did not significantly add to the prediction of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Conclusion In a population of fetuses at increased first-trimester risk for Down syndrome, the combination in a logistic regression model of NT, DV-Ply and maternal age can improve the accuracy of screening for trisomy 21 and other <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies.</b> This is the first study that models the additional value of DV-Ply as a continuous variable to NT measurement alone in a high-risk first-trimester population.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the prenatal diagnosis of dysmorphic syndromes by fetal ultrasound examination. Methods Data from 20 registries of congenital malformations in 12 European countries were included in the study. Results There were 2454 cases with congenital heart diseases, 479 of which were recognized syndromes, including 375 <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> and 104 syndromes without <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Fifty-one of the 104 were detected prenatally (49. 0 %). One hundred and ninety-two of 1130 cases with renal anomalies were recognized syndromes, including 128 <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> and 64 syndromes without chromosomal anomalies; 162 of them (84. 4 %) were diagnosed prenatally, including 109 <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> and 53 non-chromosomal syndromes. Fifty-four of the 250 cases with limb defects were recognized syndromes, including 16 chromosomal syndromes and 38 syndromes without chromosomal anomalies; 21 of these 54 syndromes were diagnosed prenatally (38. 9 %), including 9 chromosomal syndromes. There were 243 cases of abdominal wall defects including 57 recognizable syndromes, 48 with omphalocele and 9 with gastroschisis; 48 were diagnosed prenatally (84. 2 %). Twenty-six of the 187 cases with diaphragmatic hernia had recognized syndromes, including 20 chromosomal aberrations and 6 syndromes without <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Twenty-two of them (84. 6 %) were detected prenatally. Sixty-four of 349 cases with intestinal anomalies were recognized syndromes; 24 were diagnosed prenatally (37. 5 %). There were 553 cases of cleft lip and palate (CL(P)) and 198 of cleft palate (CP) including 74 <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> and 73 recognized non-chromosomal syndromes. Prenatal diagnosis was made in 51 cases of CL(P) (53. 7 %) and 7 of CP (13. 7 %). Twenty-two of 188 anencephalic cases were syndromic and all were diagnosed prenatally.

Methods Retrospective observational study of all fetuses diagnosed with a RAA between 2004 and 2012 at a tertiary centre for fetal cardiology. Results A RAA was identified in 98 fetuses: 27 had normal intracardiac anatomy and 71 were associated with other congenital heart disease (CHD); conotruncal anomalies being the most common. An aberrant left subclavian artery was diagnosed in 18. 4 % of cases, a double aortic arch in 6. 1 %, and 12. 2 % had a vascular ring confirmed after birth. Overall, an extracardiac anomaly was present in 31. 6 % of the patients and a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomaly</b> in 15. 3 %, {{with half of the}} latter cases being 22 q 11. 2 microdeletion. Extracardiac and chromosomal anomalies were more commonly associated with RAA with structural CHD (39. 4 % and 19. 7 %, respectively), compared to cases of RAA with normal intracardiac anatomy (11. 1 % and 3. 7 %, respectively) (p< 0. 05). First year mortality was 10. 3 %, with all deaths being in cases with associated structural CHD. Conclusions Detailed fetal extracardiac examination should be undertaken in all cases of RAA.

Design: Retrospective study. Setting: A reproductive centre in Hong Kong. Participants: A total of 295 Chinese subfertile men who underwent both karyotyping and Y-microdeletion studies from 2000 to 2007 were categorised as having non-obstructive azoospermia (n= 71), very severe oligospermia (sperm concentration > 0 and ≤ 2 million/mL, n= 158), and severe oligospermia (sperm concentration > 2 and < 5 million/mL, n= 66). Main outcome measures: Karyotyping and Y-microdeletion studies. Results: The prevalence of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> and Y-microdeletions in the study population were 8. 5 % (25 / 295; 95 % confidence interval, 5. 6 - 12. 3 %) and 6. 4 % (19 / 295; 3. 9 - 9. 9 %), respectively. The total prevalence of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> and Y-microdeletions was 13. 2 % (39 / 295; 95 % confidence interval, 9. 6 - 17. 6 %) as five cases of non-obstructive azoospermia showed both Y structural alterations and AZFbc deletion. The corresponding figures for <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> in the groups with non-obstructive azoospermia, very severe oligospermia, and severe oligospermia were 21. 1 % (15 / 71; 95 % confidence interval, 12. 3 - 32. 4 %), 5. 7 % (9 / 158; 2. 6 - 10. 5 %), and 1. 5 % (1 / 66; 0. 0 - 8. 2 %). While for Y-microdeletions they were 8. 5 % (6 / 71; 3. 2 - 17. 5 %), 8. 2 % (13 / 158; 4. 5 - 13. 7 %) and 0 % (0 / 66; 0. 0 - 4. 4 %), respectively.

Prenatally identified associated anomalies were significantly lower in the newborn group {{in comparison with the}} TOP group (4 % vs 31 %, p< 0, 0001). They were also lower in the surviving group at one year of follow up (7, 5 % vs 20, 7 %, p< 0, 0001). A 4 -fold increase of death rate was observed if an associated anomaly was identified (IC 95 %[2, 5 - 6, 7], p< 0, 0001). These associations remained significant after multiple logistic regression analysis including the severity of the heart defect (univentricular or biventricular physiology). ConclusionWomen are more likely to terminate pregnancy if extracardiac or <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> are associated. Post natal survival is strongly influenced by these associated anomalies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Male {{infertility}} due {{to severe}} oligozoospermia and azoospermia {{has been associated}} with a number of genetic factors. Chromosomal abnormalities are one of the principle genetic factors in male infertility. Purpose: To detect the frequency and types of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> in azoospermics and severe oligozoospermics in Western region of India and to compare these with same studies of other regions of India and the world. Method: - To assess the chromosomal aberration, the karyotyping of 44 azoospermics and 68 severe oligozoospermics were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes using standard G-banding technique. Result: <b>Chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> in azoospermics 18. 2 % (n= 8 / 44) and in severe oligozoospermics 7. 35 % (n= 5 / 68) with an over all 11. 6 % (13 / 112) in western parts of India were comparable with studies from Europe, Africa, Asia, South America and other regions of India. Polymorphic chromosomal variants were high 36. 6 % in infertile males; this incidence was similar 33. 3 % that found in controls. Conclusion: In view of the genetic risk for the next generation, the occurrence of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>anomalies</b> among infertile males strongly suggests the need for routine genetic testing and counseling prior to employment of assisted reproduction technique. It should be discussed during genetic counselin...|$|R
