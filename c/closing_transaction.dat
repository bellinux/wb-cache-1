40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{the importance of}} bid-ask spread-induced biases on event date returns as exemplified by seasoned equity offerings by NYSE listed firms. They document significant negative return biases on the offering day, which explain {{a large portion of}} the negative event date returns documented in the literature. Buy-sell order flow imbalance is prominent around the offering and induces a relatively large spread bias. If order imbalances are suspected, the researcher can use returns calculated from the midpoint of the closing bid and ask quotes instead of returns calculated from <b>closing</b> <b>transaction</b> prices to avoid this return bias.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{attempts to}} achieve two objectives. The first {{aim is to}} study {{the relationship between the}} TAIEX call options market and the spot market among different levels of Moneyness, namely, deep-in-the-money, in-the-money, at-the-money, deep-out-of-the-money, as well as out-of-the-money. The other one is to build a pricing model of TAIEX call options. The experimental data presented in this study come from the daily <b>closing</b> <b>transaction</b> price of TAIEX call options and the associated spot market from September 24, 2001 to August 31, 2003. This investigation applied the Bi_EGARCH model to study the interactive relationship of returns and volatility between TAIEX call options and the spot market, and used the Neuron Algorithm to establish a model for pricing TAIEX call options. This study reaches two main findings. First, the interactive relationship between TAIEX call options and the spot market differs among different Moneyness, and investors take larger risks under out-of-the-money and deep-out-of-money situations. Second, the prediction ability of the neural network pricing model is better than that of the regression model given different levels of Moneyness in most circumstances...|$|E

40|$|Long-short {{strategies}} {{are one of}} the most successful tools, applied by hedge funds manager. One under-evaluated stock is bought (long position) and an over-evaluated stock is sold (short position) at the same time. After a short term, when the values of the stocks are as expected, profit can be realized by a <b>closing</b> <b>transaction.</b> The possibility to find first obvious over- and under-evaluated stocks depends on the number of participants in this markets. While the hedge funds strategies become more popular, the chance to achieve profit by this strategies is shrinking. Therefore two models to generate long-short portfolios are proposed. By this approaches a portfolio A for the long- and a portfolio B for the short position were computed. The difference of the values of A and B is designed to oscillate from negative to positive and reverse. This behavior of oscillating or mean reverting stock prices was stated by e. g. E. Fama and K. R. French (1988). Mean reversion of portfolios can offer the possibility of statistical arbitrage. The proposed linear models were tested by stocks of the Tokyo stock exchange. The results seem to be applicable and show an additional advantage of low systematic risk...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} Sharia Bank in Indonesia has {{increased}} significantly {{during the year}} of 2011. The increase of the growth is contributed by the increase of funding and financing products of Sharia Banks. Risk management and funding and financing products of a bank are things that have a very close relationship in the Sharia banking. Bank Indonesia as central bank also has {{a special interest in}} establishing provisions to all banks in Indonesia to be able to manage their risks. Risks posed to Sharia Banks have several types inherited from products or services offerred to their customer. One of them is legal risk. Legal risks may derive from the weaknesses of legal aspects of products or services of Sharia Bank. Therefore, Mudharabah Muqayyadah On Balance Sheet (MMOB) as a product of PT Bank XYZ which has nature of funding as well as financing, poses legal risks originate from the weaknesses of its legal aspects. Legal risk in a transaction may be in the form of incomplete requirements for a valid agreement which may originates from several factors of legal risks. Factors of legal risk of a transaction cover incorrect legal structure, absence of consent of the parties, absence of competence of the parties, no certain objects, no permissible cause, imperfect clauses in the agreement, and incomplete legal documents. This final project is composed to identify the legal risks that may arise from MMOB transaction, its risk priority and the way to mitigate such legal risks. Legal risks of MMOB transaction derived from the weaknesess of legal aspects of MMOB Transaction. Legal risks of MMOB transaction occur in every steps of MMOB process. MMOB process steps consist of Process Step 1 Offering Product to Customer, Process Step 2 Product/Transaction Explanation, Process Step 3 Structure Selection, Process Step 4 Prepare Legal Document, and Process Step 5 <b>Closing</b> <b>Transaction.</b> The assessment of risk priority number (RPN) used Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA). The assessment result has revealed that the rank of RPN of MMOB Transaction which describe the consecutive rank of RPN is in the Process Step 3 of Structure Selection, Process Step 3 Prepare Legal Document, Process Step 4 <b>Closing</b> <b>Transaction,</b> Process Step 2 Product/Transaction Explanation, and Process Step 1 Offering Product to Customer. The legal risks of MMOB transaction have effects that the agreements can be deemed either void or voidable. Mitigation of legal risk of MMOB transaction is carried out through strengthening legal aspects of MMOB transaction by perfecting legal structure of MMOB transaction, revising legal document related to MMOB transaction, peparing procedures of marketing and offering MMOB transaction and preparing legal risk management policy...|$|E
