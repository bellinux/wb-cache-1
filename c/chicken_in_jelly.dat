Thirty-six, one day old broiler chickens were divided into 3 groups of 12 each. <b>Chickens</b> <b>in</b> each group were randomly divided into 2 replicates. The <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> group 1 that were not vaccinated and challenged served as a negative control. The <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> group 2 that were not vaccinated but received E. coli serotype O 78 served as a positive control. The <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> group 3 were vaccinated by the oral route at 5 days of age with E. coli aroA-vaccine and challenged with E. coli serotype O 78. All the <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> groups 2 and 3 were challenged intratracheally at 4 weeks of age with 0. 5 ml (1. 2 x 109 cfu/ml) per dose of E. coli O 78. The chickens were monitored for 7 days after infection for feed conversion ratio (FCR), and the post-mortem pathology was assessed. The results revealed that the vaccine tends to prevent E. coli infection. The <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> group 3 tended to show lower pathological findings including airsacculitis, pericarditis, perihepatitis, peritonitis and arthritis than the <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> group 2 but the FCR was not different in each group (p> 0. 05) ...|$|R

Result This high-efficiency liquid chromatography determination of the concentration of sodium cyclamate in the linear relationship between the 0 - 300 ug/ml,the correlation coefficient was 0. 9995 above, and require accuracy and good reproducibility. The recovery rate of sodium cyclamate was 80 %- 120 %,the coefficient of variation less than 10 %. Conclusion:The method is rapid, simple,highly sensitive and with less interference, which is suitable {{for the detection of}} cyclamate <b>in</b> <b>jellies...</b>|$|R
