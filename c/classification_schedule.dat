We incorporate all the operational and infrastructural restrictions of this yard instance in our integer program.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study the train {{classification}} problem. Train classification basically {{is the process}} of rearranging the cars of a train in a specified order, which can be regarded as a special sorting problem. This sorting is done in a special railway installation called a classification yard, and a classification process is described by a <b>classification</b> <b>schedule.</b> In this paper we develop a novel encoding of classification schedules, which allows characterizing train classification methods simply as classes of schedules. Applying this efficient encoding, we achieve a simpler, more precise analysis of well-known classification methods. Furthermore, we elaborate a valuable optimality condition inherent in our encoding, which we succesfully apply to obtain tight lower bounds for the length of schedules in general and to develop new classification methods. Finally, we present complexity results and algorithms to derive optimal schedules for several real-world settings. Together, our theoretical results provide a solid foundation for improving train classification in practice...|$|E

The {{research}} method used for this essay has been a comparative case study between the Swedish and Norwegian declared policy of foreign affairs and it strives to answer the research question, which is if the Swedish declared policy of foreign affairs has been changed in character due to the Europeanization. The theoretical framework of this study consists of Europeanization as a comprehensive theoretical perspective. I order to answer the research question a <b>classification</b> <b>schedule</b> has been elaborated to examine the objectives of the Swedish and Norwegian declared policy of foreign affairs.

In constructing our Climate variable we made a ranking of climates according to how favorable they are to agriculture. Countries with type B and E climates have been given a value of 0. Most of the tropical dry countries in this category are found in the Sahara and on the Arabian peninsula. The tropical climates in the A category were scored 1. Precipitation is abundant and biodiversity great, but the heavy rainfall typically does not favor annual grasses. Countries with temperate climates of type Cfa, Cwa, and D (humid subtropical and continental) were scored 2.

40|$|This group project {{represented}} {{an attempt to}} study some factors pertaining {{to the formation of}} a system of case classification in a county public welfare agency, Multnomah County Public Welfare Commission, Portland, Oregon. The classification tool was a Case Planning Schedule intended to encourage diagnostic thinking {{on the part of the}} caseworker and to enhance planning and service for the client. The focus of the study was limited to two areas: (1) whether or not the use of the Schedule resulted in agreement among caseworkers in classification and in consistency on prognoses, (2) the attitudes of the caseworkers in various departments toward the Case Classification Program and the Case Planning Schedule. Background for the study involved a search of the literature surrounding new approaches to the problems of 2 ̆ 2 multi-problem families 2 ̆ 2 and public assistance caseloads. Consideration was given to agency structure and the circumstances surrounding the creation of the Oregon Program for Case Classification. Five main hypotheses were tested.

Appropriate statistical tests of significance were employed and a content analysis was used in connection with an open-ended attitudinal question. Qualitative and quantitative findings were consistent in demonstrating that caseworkers tended to be favorable toward the intent of the Program but critical toward implementation procedures. Divergent viewpoints were shown in comparing responses of workers by categories of work-load assignments departmental assignments, and length of service in the agency.
