The definition of high voltage varies but in {{power transmission}} work is usually thought to be 72.5kV or higher, {{according to a recent}} definition by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). High-voltage breakers are nearly always solenoid-operated, with <b>current</b> <b>sensing</b> protective relays operated through current transformers.

25|$|Medium-voltage circuit {{breakers}} rated between 1 and 72 kV may be assembled into metal-enclosed switchgear line ups for indoor use, {{or may be}} individual components installed outdoors in a substation.

Like the high voltage circuit breakers described below, these are also operated by <b>current</b> <b>sensing</b> protective relays operated through current transformers. The characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage circuit breakers nearly always use separate current sensors and protective relays, instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic overcurrent sensors.|$|E
