5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver <b>chlorate</b> and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E

40|$|In {{agricultural}} lowland landscapes, intensive agricultural {{is accompanied}} by a wide use of agrochemical application, like pesticides and fertilizers. The latter often causes serious environmental threats such as N compounds leaching and surface water eutrophication; additionally, since perchlorate can be present as impurities in many fertilizers, the potential presence of perchlorates and their by-products like <b>chlorates</b> and chlorites in shallow groundwater could be a reason of concern. In this light, the present manuscript reports the first temporal and spatial variation of <b>chlorates,</b> chlorites and major anions concentrations in the shallow unconfined aquifer belonging to Ferrara province (in the Po River plain). The study was made in 56 different locations to obtain insight on groundwater chemical composition and its sediment matrix interactions. During the monitoring period from 2010 to 2011, in June 2011 a nonpoint pollution of <b>chlorates</b> was found in the shallow unconfined aquifer belonging to Ferrara province. Detected <b>chlorates</b> concentrations ranged between 0. 01 and 38 mg/l with an average value of 2. 9 mg/l. <b>Chlorates</b> were found in 49 wells out of 56 and in all types of lithology constituting the shallow aquifer. <b>Chlorates</b> concentrations appeared to be linked to NO 3 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 2, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and oxygen reduction potential (ORP) variations. <b>Chlorates</b> behaviour was related to the biodegradation of perchlorates, since perchlorates are favourable electron acceptors for the oxidation of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater. Further studies must take into consideration to monitor ClO 4 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 2 in pore waters and groundwater to better elucidate the mass flux of ClO 4 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 2 in shallow aquifers belonging to agricultural landscapes. The main findings are the first recognition in Europe of ClO 3 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 2 temporal and spatial variation concentrations in a shallow unconfined aquifer belonging to agricultural landscapes...|$|R

25|$|One classic study {{involves}} an experiment {{that takes place}} in the laboratory. When sodium <b>chlorate</b> is allowed to crystallize from water and the collected crystals examined in a polarimeter, each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the L form or the D form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of L crystals collected equals the amount of D crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium <b>chlorate</b> solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively L or exclusively D. In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver D-crystals and 18 others L-crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to autocatalysis taking place in the nucleation process.|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{chlorine}} oxoacids may {{be produced by}} exploiting these disproportionation reactions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is highly reactive and quite unstable; its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and sterilising abilities. They are very strong oxidising agents, transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species. Chlorous acid (HOClO) is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition: it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide. However, sodium chlorite is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles, as an oxidising agent, and {{as a source of}} chlorine dioxide. Chloric acid (HOClO2) is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to 30% concentration, but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Evaporation under reduced pressure allows it to be concentrated further to about 40%, but then it decomposes to perchloric acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and chlorine dioxide. Its most important salt is sodium <b>chlorate,</b> mostly used to make chlorine dioxide to bleach paper pulp.
