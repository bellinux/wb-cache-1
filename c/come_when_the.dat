5|$|Major-General Sir Isaac Brock KB (6 October 1769– 13 October 1812) was a British Army {{officer and}} colonial {{administrator}} from Guernsey. Brock {{was assigned to}} Lower Canada in 1802. Despite facing desertions and near-mutinies, he commanded his regiment in Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) successfully for many years. He was promoted to major general, and became responsible for defending Upper Canada against the United States. While many in Canada and Britain believed war could be averted, Brock began to ready the army and militia for what was to <b>come.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> War of 1812 broke out, the populace was prepared, and quick victories at Fort Mackinac and Detroit defeated American invasion efforts.|$|E
5|$|The Definite Synodical Platform was {{not enough}} to cause the Pennsylvania Ministerium to leave the General Synod, but it was a foretaste of things to <b>come.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> Frankean Synod, a Lutheran church body noted for its {{progressive}} politics and its utter disregard for the Lutheran Confessions, was admitted to the General Synod, the leadership of the Ministerium had seen enough. At the 1864 gathering of the General Synod, at which the Frankeans were admitted, the delegates from the Ministerium left in protest. Unfortunately, the delegates left before the General Synod passed a resolution affirming and strengthening their commitment to the Augsburg Confession.|$|E
5|$|Once again, the {{official}} end of hostilities did not spell {{an end to}} fighting and Israel remained engaged in Lebanon for years to <b>come.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> Syrians introduced the SA-8 Gecko into Lebanon in July 1982, IAF Phantoms were sent to hunt down four launchers on July 24 and two were claimed by 69 Squadron. Up to its very disbandment in 1994, the squadron also took part in repeated strikes against terrorist organizations operating from Lebanon. On one such operation on October 16, 1986, a bomb exploded immediately after release from Kurnass 306, forcing both crew to eject. The pilot, Yishai Aviram, was rescued by an IAF AH-1 Cobra, but navigator Ron Arad was captured {{by members of the}} Shi'a Amal Movement. Initial negotiations for an exchange of prisoners failed and Arad has been missing since and his fate remains unknown.|$|E

25|$|McDonald {{retired to}} California. In 1969, he {{published}} his autobiography, Union Man: The Life of a Labor Statesman. Although union members voted to {{invite him to}} their convention in 1966, Abel {{did not ask for}} him to <b>come.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> USWA held its convention in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1976, McDonald was not invited to attend.|$|E
25|$|I {{am doing}} {{everything}} in my power to discourage the use of gases and other chemicals in any war between nations. While, unfortunately, the defensive necessities of the United States call for study of the use of chemicals in warfare, I do not want the Government of the United States to do anything to aggrandize or make permanent any special bureau of the Army or the Navy engaged in these studies. I hope the time will <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Chemical Warfare Service can be entirely abolished.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{parts of}} Australia get the usual westerly winds and rain-bearing cold fronts that <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> high pressure systems move towards northern Australia during winter. Cold snaps may bring frosts inland, though temperatures near the coast are mild or near mild all year round. Summers in southern Australia are generally dry and hot with coastal sea breezes. During a lengthy dry spell, hot and dry winds {{from the interior}} can cause bushfires in some southern and eastern states, though most commonly Victoria and New South Wales.|$|E

25|$|The {{final blow}} may have <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{favorable}} agricultural conditions during the Holocene climatic optimum, which lasted from 7000 to 3200 B.C., quite suddenly changed, {{resulting in the}} arid Sub-Boreal phase, which created the worst and longest drought in Europe {{since the end of}} the last Ice Age. The large Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements, which relied entirely on subsistence agriculture for support, would have faced very nasty Dust Bowl conditions, making it impossible to continue their way of life. It is theorized that the combination of this drought and the existence of neighboring nomadic pastoralist tribes led to the complete collapse of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, and the abandonment of their settlements, as members of the culture left behind the plow to take up the saddle of a nomad, as pastoralists are better equipped to eke out a living in an arid environment. The results were that by 2750 B.C. the Proto-Indo-European culture completely dominated the area. The primitive trade network of the Cucuteni-Trypillia society that had been slowly growing more complex was thus abruptly ended, along with the culture that supported it. Or, rather, it was supplanted by another more advanced trade network as the Proto-Indo-Europeans moved in to take the land, and to bring with them an entirely new society with division of labor, a ruling and religious elite, social stratification, and, in a word, civilization.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 Race of Champions (still {{sponsored}} by Daily Mail) {{saw the first}} of two major victories by American cars at Brands when Dan Gurney brought the Eagle-Weslake T1G over the line first by 0.8 seconds from Lorenzo Bandin's Ferrari 312/67. So good was the public's response to the race (run in two 10-lap heats and a 40-lap final) that John Webb decided to make the race an annual event. The other great American victory was to <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> be-winged 7-litre Chaparral 2F-Chevrolet driven by Phil Hill and Mike Spence won the BOAC 500 run over 211 laps of the Grand Prix Circuit at an average speed of 93.08mph, from the Ferrari 330-P4 of Chris Amon and Jackie Stewart. These two had lapped {{the rest of the field}} twice, third place going to the Jo Siffert/Bruce McLaren Porsche 910. The year saw many firsts; in July, Tetsu Ikuzawa became the first Japanese ever to win a race in Britain, the first Mini Festival was run at Whitsun and the Mini-Seven Club ran the first ever all-saloon car meeting in February. But the biggest ‘first ‘was the arrival of Formula Ford which was to become the providing ground and starting place for so many drivers. The first Formula Ford race was run on 7 July and was won by Roy Allan in a Lotus 51.|$|E
25|$|The {{camp was}} never finished, and its {{structures}} were looted in 1941. As a result, {{it was in}} poor shape when the first prisoners arrived, and the situation would deteriorate further in the months to <b>come,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> camp came under German control. The camp had a roughly rectangular shape, surrounded by a triple barbed wire fence, with guard towers at every 200 m. The camp's gate was {{on the western side}} of the fence. Most buildings were clustered on the northern half of the camp. Blocks 1 to 4 were located there, built in a staggered line towards the East. These were two-storey barracks buildings, divided in two equal but separate sections, western and eastern, with separate entrances to each. In addition, the north-eastern corner housed storage houses, the mess hall, the baths (Block 16), where the women's solitary confinement cells were also located, the workshops (Block 21) and the camp headquarters (Block 20). The infamous Block 15, located to the east of the headquarters, was the solitary confinement facility, with the camp guard's quarters and mess room. In the south-eastern corner there was the isolated women's wing (Block 6). Under the Germans, the first floor housed Jewish women, while the second floor was reserved for Christians. In total, over 300 Christian and 2,500 Jewish women passed through Haidari beginning on 7 December 1943, including heroines of the Resistance such as Iro Konstantopoulou or Lela Karagianni (executed on 5 and 8 September 1944 respectively).|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, the Umayyads still {{considered}} the complete subjugation of Byzantium as their ultimate objective. Their thinking {{was dominated by}} Islamic teaching, which placed the infidel Byzantines in the Dār al-Ḥarb, the [...] "House of War", which, {{in the words of}} Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy, [...] "the Muslims should attack whenever possible; rather than peace interrupted by occasional conflict, the normal pattern was seen to be conflict interrupted by occasional, temporary truce (hudna). True peace (ṣulḥ) could only <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> enemy accepted Islam or tributary status." ...|$|E
500|$|The drafter of the Malayan ISA was Hugh Hickling, a British lawyer, {{author and}} professor. In 1989, he commented that he [...] "could not imagine {{then that the}} time would <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> power of detention, {{carefully}} and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution, would be used against political opponents, welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent, peaceful activities". Nonetheless, he commented that he supported review of the ISA {{but it was not}} for him to say if the law should be scrapped, as [...] "you've got a multi-racial society [...] in which emotions can run high very quickly".|$|E

500|$|In 1942, J. Reuben Clark—an LDS apostle and {{a member}} of the church's First Presidency—said that [...] "You and I have heard all our lives that the time may <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Constitution may hang by a thread.... I do know that whether it shall live or die is now in the balance." [...] Regarding the Constitution, Clark went on to cite its [...] "free institutions", {{separation}} of powers, and the Bill of Rights. [...] He added that [...] "if we are to live as a Church, and progress, and have the right to worship ... we must have the great guarantees that are set up by our Constitution." ...|$|E
500|$|Ball quotes the 2nd Edition's {{epigraph}} by the statistician Karl Pearson: [...] "I {{believe the}} day must <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> biologist will—without being a mathematician—not hesitate to use mathematical analysis when he requires it." [...] Ball argues that Thompson [...] "presents mathematical principles as a shaping agency that may supersede natural selection, showing how {{the structures of}} the living world often echo those in inorganic nature", and notes his [...] "frustration at the 'Just So' explanations of morphology offered by Darwinians." [...] Instead, Ball argues, Thompson elaborates on how not heredity but physical forces govern biological form. Ball suggests that [...] "The book's central motif is the logarithmic spiral", evidence in Thompson's eyes of the universality of form and the reduction of many phenomena to a few principles of mathematics.|$|E
500|$|Taraborrelli was proven wrong, and, in 1990, he {{considered}} writing her biography, but put the thought aside, thinking such a venture was premature. He {{pointed out that}} [...] "most subjects need time for evolution and personal growths, before their stories are ripe enough to put on paper. Madonna was in an ambitious, self-involved phase during which nothing mattered more to her than her career." [...] He picked up the writing again in 1994, but {{felt the same way}} about her, and hoped the time would <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> singer would focus on her personal life, rather than her career. A personal evolution occurred in her life with the birth of daughter Lourdes in 1996, and it was then that Taraborrelli sensed the time was ripe to begin writing her biography.|$|E

500|$|As John Ray has observed, [...] "the day may <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> stone {{has spent}} {{longer in the}} British Museum than it ever did in Rosetta." [...] There is strong {{opposition}} among national museums to the repatriation of objects of international cultural significance such as the Rosetta Stone. In response to repeated Greek requests for return of the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon and similar requests to other museums around the world, in 2002 over 30 of the world's leading museums— including the British Museum, the Louvre, the Pergamon Museum in Berlin and the Metropolitan Museum in New York City— issued a joint statement declaring that [...] "objects acquired in earlier times must be viewed {{in the light of}} different sensitivities and values reflective of that earlier era" [...] and that [...] "museums serve not just the citizens of one nation but the people of every nation".|$|E
500|$|According to the New Straits Times, Hickling {{later wrote}} in 1989, [...] "I {{could not imagine}} then that the time would <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> power of detention, {{carefully}} and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution, would be used against political opponents, welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent, peaceful activities." [...] However, he commented {{that it was not}} for him to say if the Internal Security Act should be scrapped. [...] "As a lawyer, I'm all for its review but on whether it should be scrapped, I don't know. You've got a multi-racial society [...] in which emotions can run high very quickly." [...] Interviewed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio programme PM in April 2001, Hickling agreed with the interviewer, Geoff Thompson, that he supported the law's continued existence and said he was [...] "sorry to say that, in the light of my own experience, I'm inclined to think you couldn't really safely get rid of it at the moment". Worldwide terrorist attacks such as 9/11 confirmed his views on the matter.|$|E
500|$|La Rivière also cites {{external}} influences that, in his view, {{did not work}} in favour of The Secret Service. He expounds on the continuing popularity of earlier Anderson puppet productions {{as far back as}} the pre-Supermarionation series The Adventures of Twizzle (1959), and the frequent repeat runs that they had on ATV throughout the 1960s: [...] "... as with anything that is phenomenally popular, the time must <b>come</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> audience is satiated and drifts away to something else." [...] Fryer suggests that the espionage theme may not have been attractive to potential foreign buyers, noting that the American spy series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. had been cancelled in 1968 and that the last episode of The Avengers had aired in the UK the following year. Fryer considers the production of [...] "a spy series just when the fad for the genre was waning" [...] was the biggest problem that faced The Secret Service in finding an audience. On the other hand, it is argued that, in light of the release of Century 21's Doppelgänger (1969), a live-action film that preceded UFO, the Supermarionation format had become outdated. Archer and Hearn express similar concerns about expectations for a new Supermarionation series in 1969, writing that Anderson and his colleagues had become [...] "a bit too successful" [...] in producing a winning format.|$|E
