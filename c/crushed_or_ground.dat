In the United States, breads labeled as [...] "rye" [...] nearly always contain caraway unless explicitly labeled as [...] "unseeded." [...] In Canada (especially Montreal), breads labeled as [...] "rye" [...] often have no seeds, whereas breads labeled as [...] "kimmel" [...] are usually rye with caraway seeds. Some unique rye bread recipes include ground spices such as fennel, coriander, aniseed, cardamom, or citrus peel. In addition to caramel and molasses, ingredients such as coffee, cocoa, or toasted bread crumbs are sometimes used for both color and flavor in very dark breads like pumpernickels. The addition of caraway seeds to rye bread is to counter the bloating that can be caused by the high fiber content of rye. Caraway has well-known anti-flatulence properties; however, the association is so long-standing that the flavor combination is now almost inseparable.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports an {{investigation}} of the effect of the particle size of kaolin on its transformation to metakaolinite. Kaolin from the island of Milos was either <b>crushed</b> <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> in order to produce four samples with different degrees of fineness (residue at 500 mu m: 0 - 71. 8 %). The samples were treated thermally under different conditions {{in order to determine the}} optimum treatment conditions. The conversion of kaolinite to metakaolinite and the structural changes in the material during treatment were investigated by means of TG and XRD, respectively. Each sample was incorporated into a type I cement, at 20 % by mass of cement, and the compressive strengths of the resulting blended cements were measured. It is concluded that the particle size of the raw kaolin does not affect the thermal conversion or the pozzolanic activity of the material. The use of crushed kaolin has many benefits since the furnace load can be increased, while the grinding process is needed only to reduce the size of the metakaolinite particles...|$|E

Plant lignans can be converted by intestinal bacteria into the so-called enterolignans, enterodiol and enterolactone. For a proper evaluation of potential health effects of enterolignans, information on their bioavailability is essential. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether crushing and milling of flaxseed enhances the bioavailability of enterolignans in plasma. In a randomized, crossover study, 12 healthy subjects supplemented their diet with 0. 3 g whole, <b>crushed,</b> <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> flaxseed/(kg body weight · d).

40|$|See {{description}} of calcium oxide {{production in the}} calcium oxide TAP Review. Hydrated lime is produced from the slow addition of water to <b>crushed</b> <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> quicklime (calcium oxide). This is done in a premixing chamber or vessel that mixes and agitates the lime and water at prescribed levels. The addition of water generates considerable heat of the reaction and produces steam. Although the theoretical amount of moisture needed is 24. 5 %, in practice about 50 - 65 % water is added to counteract loss from steam. After hydration, the slightly moist slaked lime is conveyed to a separator where coarse fractions are removed, and the powder dries. It is then bagged in paper sacks or shipped in bulk by truck or rail. The reaction can be characterized as: CaO + H 20 � � Ca(OH) 2 + heat high calcium quicklime high calcium hydrate Depending on the source parent rock, different grades of hydrated lime may be produced. A high calcium hydrate is 71 - 74 % calcium oxide, with 0. 5 - 2 % magnesium oxide and 24 - 25 % water. Slaked lime may also be produced as a waste product.

40|$|The {{most common}} method {{to get an}} idea about the pH of {{solution}} is to use an acid base indicator. An indicator is a large organic molecule that works somewhat like a “color dye”. Whereas most dyes do not change color with the amount of acid or base present, there are many molecules, known as acid-base indicators, which do respond to a change in the hydrogen ion concentration. A variety of indicators change color at various pH levels. A properly selected acid-base indicator can be used to visually “indicate” the approximate pH of a sample. Many indicators can be extracted from plants. Karamunting, as well as many other flowers and fruits, contain natural indicators that are sensitive to acids and bases. The color of a natural acid-base indicator depends on pH. The purpose of this research is to extract karamunting as a natural indicators and design a procedure to investigate their color changes as a function of pH. A set of standard acid and base solutions of known pH (pH = 1 – 14) was provided. The results was used to construct color charts of the indicators. Karamunting indicator solutions were obtained by treating this fruits with a solvent to dissolve the soluble components. The solid was <b>crushed</b> <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> and extracted with an appropriate solvent, such as boiling water and alcohol.

40|$|Bread is baked {{from the}} <b>crushed</b> (<b>or</b> <b>ground)</b> seeds of grain. Around 10, 000 years ago people cooked {{porridge}} or gruel {{and at least}} 3000 years ago leavened the dough of bread. In Europe, north of the Alps, it was only from the 16 th century that the consumption of bread (and porridge) spread widely. Urban population concentrations grew, while yields fell due to the climatic deterioration. Greater areas of land were ploughed for grain cultivation and, independently {{of the quality of}} flour improved as a result of technical innovations in milling. The main factors for the dominance of grain were given. In regions where little was produced due to the natural endowments, such as the Mediterranean, bread grain was imported from Antiquity (Panem et circenses!). In mediaeval Europe nutrition was still characterised by the consumption of meat and vegetables (mainly cabbage). The balance tilted in the towns where the predominance of cereals can be observed. North-western Europe imported grain from the Baltic region. Up to the 18 th century Eastern Central Europe exported beef cattle to the towns of Central Europe. As the demand for grain grew grazing land was ploughed and in the 19 th century the country exported grain. Cereal consumption took the forms mainly of porridge, griddle-cakes, and later bread, dumplings and various kinds of boiled noodles. At the same time the role of soups (hot pots) in the daily diet increased. Bread and soup marked a new era in the history of menus. The people of Eastern Europe are still porridge-eaters. Almost from the start brewing {{has been one of the}} technologies for cereal consumption. Beer, with an increasing alcohol content, was at first the drink of urban dwellers, but later after the Middle Ages the peasantry also drank increasing quantities of ever stronger beer. Together with this latter process, grain spirits (whisky, gin, vodka, etc.) were also drunk on a growing scale. Distillation was an Arab invention and spread in the monasteries from the Middle Ages.

40|$|Keywords: Lignans; enterodiol; enterolactone; plasma; flaxseed; bioavailability; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; case-control studies; {{prospective}} studies; colorectal adenomas; colorectal carcinomas; {{coronary heart}} diseases Lignans are biphenolic compounds {{that occur in}} foods of plant origin. Some of the plant lignans can be converted into the enterolignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, by the microorganisms in the colon. Because of their biological activities, enterolignans may affect the development of chronic diseases. It is not sufficiently known to what extent enterolignans become bioavailable, i. e., are absorbed and used for metabolic processes in the body. The aim of the present research was to gain further insight in the bioavailability of enterolignans and in their relation with several chronic diseases. To {{be able to do}} this, we developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using triply 13 C-labeled isotopes for the simultaneous quantification of enterodiol and enterolactone in plasma. Enterodiol and enterolactone absorption started 8 to 10 hours after consumption of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, an isolated plant lignan, and they were eliminated slowly. A substantial part (~ 40 %) of the enterolignans was excreted in urine, and thus had been available in the blood circulation. Because of the slow elimination, enterolignans will accumulate and reach steady state concentrations in plasma when consumed 2 to 3 times a day. As lignans are present in many foods this is very likely to happen. The bioavailability of lignans from flaxseeds, a high lignan source, improved substantially when whole seeds were replaced by <b>crushed</b> <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> seeds. Independent determinants of plasma concentrations of enterolignans were, besides the intake of plant lignans, use of antibiotic therapy, defecation frequency, and body mass index. Our data suggest a protective role of enterolignans against colorectal adenomas; the risk reduction was ~ 2 -fold in highest versus lowest quartile of enterolignan plasma concentrations. However, a protective effect could not be confirmed for colorectal carcinomas. Moreover, we observed increased risks (~ 2. 5 -fold) in women, especially in postmenopausal women, and in subjects with a high body mass index. This suggests that an estrogen-related hormonal mechanism might be involved. In addition, our data do not support a protective role of enterolignans against the development of nonfatal myocardial infarction. In conclusion, a substantial part of the enterolignans enters the blood circulation and is subsequently excreted in urine. Enterolignans might protect against colorectal adenomas. We did not find protective associations for colorectal carcinomas and myocardial infarction. At this point, there is not enough evidence to give recommendations regarding the consumption of foods rich in lignans...|$|E
