5000|$|Despite the April 2011 NRG {{announcement}} of the reactor's cancellation, the NRC continued the <b>combined</b> <b>licensing</b> process for the new reactors in October 2011. [...] It was unclear at the time why the reactor license application was proceeding. During early 2015 some pre-construction activities were performed on site and initial NRC documents listed the original targeted commercial operational dates as March 2015 for unit 3 {{and a year later}} for the other unit. [...] On February 9, 2016 the NRC approved the combined license. Due to market conditions, no construction events occurred at that time.

Implementing a device or software application that uses HEVC may require a license from HEVC patent holders.

Patent licenses can be obtained directly from each patent holder, or through patent licensing bodies, such as MPEG LA, HEVC Advance, and Velos Media.

40|$|Data {{and models}} of aerosol {{particle}} deposition in leak pathways are described. Pathways considered include capillaries, orifices, slots and cracks in concrete.

Deposition of particles can be limited by bounce from surfaces defining leak pathways and by resuspension of particles deposited on these surfaces.

Resuspension of deposited particles can be triggered by changes in flow conditions, particle impact on deposits and by shock or vibration of the surfaces.
