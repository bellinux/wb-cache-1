40|$|The {{origin of}} tektites has been obscure {{because of the}} {{following}} dilemma. The application of physical principles to the data available on tektites points strongly to origin from one or more lunar volcanoes; but few glasses of tektite composition have hitherto been reported from the lunar samples. Instead, the lunar silicic glasses consist chiefly of a material very rich in K 2 O and poor in MgO. The ratio of K 2 O/MgO is higher in these glasses than in any tektites reported. The solution of the dilemma seems {{to come from the}} study of some recently discovered terrestrial deposits of tektite glass with high values of K 2 O/MgO at the <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>Tertiary</b> <b>boundary.</b> These glasses are found to be very vulnerable to crystallization into sandine or to alteration to smectite. These end products are known and are more abundant than any terrestrial deposits of tektite glass. It seems possible that, in fact, the moon produces tektite glass, mostly of the high K 2 O-low MgO type; but on Earth these deposits are destroyed. The much less abundant deposits with lower K and higher Mg are observed because they survive. Other objections to the lunar origin hypothesis appear to be answerable...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>tertiary</b> <b>boundary</b> {{controversy}} is discussed. The {{importance of the}} platinum group metals (PGM) as markers of extraterrestrial material in sediments is explained. The use of inductively coupled plasma source mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS), to determine PGM in geological materials, was investigated. Both techniques require the analyte to be substantially separated from the geological matrix before instrumental analysis is performed. Separation schemes involving fire-assay, ion exchange chromatography, solvent extraction, and coprecipitation, were investigated. A standard ore (PTC- 1) was successfully analysed for Rh and Pd using a separation scheme involving Te coprecipitation followed by dissolution and determination by ICP- MS. The same ore was successfully analysed for Pd using GF-AAS after a separation procedure involving solvent extraction of a Pd-ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate complex. Sedimentary rock samples were collected from a newly discovered K/T boundary site (Flaxbourne River) in New Zealand. Determinations of Pd in Flaxbourne River sediments were made using GF-AAS after matrix separation using solvent extraction. Elevated levels of Pd at the K/T boundary were found contiguous with elevated levels of Ir. Besides these PGM, a further twenty elements were determined in Flaxbourne River K/T boundary sediments. The results of this geochemical survey are discussed {{with respect to the}} impact and volcanism theories (theories which seek to explain the palaeontological, geochemical, and geological changes occurring at the K/T boundary) ...|$|E
40|$|Paired {{analyses}} of Os isotope composition and concentration of bulk sediment and leachable Os in a metalliferous pelagic clay sequence from the North Pacific, ODP Site 886 C, {{are used to}} reconstruct the marine Os isotope record and the particulate meteoritic Os flux between 65. 5 and 78 Ma. Measured 187 Os/ 188 Os of bulk sediments ranges from approximately 0. 64 to 0. 32 and those of leach analyses {{are very similar to}} bulk analyses. Hydrogenous Os dominates the sedimentary Os inventory throughout most of the studied interval. As a result the measured 187 Os/ 188 Os of leachable Os approximates that of contemporaneous seawater. The ODP 886 C record shows rising 187 Os/ 188 Os in the deepest portion of the core, with a local maximum of 0. 66 close to 74 Ma. The 67 - 72 Ma portion of the record is characterized by nearly constant 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios close to 0. 6. The structure of the marine Os isotope record from ODP 886 C differs markedly from the seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr curve, which rises monotonically throughout the time interval studied here. Calculated particulate meteoritic Os fluxes are between 0. 5 and 2 pg/cm** 2 /kyr throughout most of the studied interval. Two discrete intervals of the core (one of which is within <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>Tertiary,</b> <b>boundary</b> KTB interval) are characterized by higher fluxes of meteoritic Os. Excluding these two intervals, the average background flux of particulate meteoritic Os is roughly half of that estimated from {{analyses of}} Cenozoic marine sediments. These are the first Os isotope data to provide evidence of resolvable temporal variations in the background flux of particulate meteoritic material to the Earth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Continental {{deposits}} especially conglomerates {{have always}} been a challenge to geologists {{because of the lack of}} fauna and of the petrographic diversity of their particles. The continental deposits located in the south-western part of the Transylvanian Basin make no exception. This paper presents the sedimentological and facial features of the Şard Formation, which is cropping out on the right bank of the Ampoi River. Among the various sedimentary formations exposed in this region, the Upper <b>Cretaceous</b> to Lower <b>Tertiary</b> successions are of special interest, marking the sedimentary environment’s evolution near the <b>Cretaceous</b> - <b>Tertiary</b> <b>boundary.</b> At this level a reddish continental formation was deposited and its formation is typical for alluvial depositional system (braided rivers).

40|$|North American and Pacific spore-pollen {{records show}} a major {{extinction}} {{event at the}} <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>Tertiary</b> (K-T) <b>boundary,</b> and abrupt changes are similarly found in many marine organisms world-wide. In contrast, records from the Old World reveal little evidence of terrestrial vegetational change across the boundary. In order to improve the characterization of changes across the K-T boundary, palynological assemblages from two sections in the southern Pyrenees have been evaluated. The abundance and diversity of trilete fern spores are high in Maastrichtian samples and show a statistically significant decrease during the Danian. The 'fern spike' of low-diversity spores found elsewhere is not recorded in the Pyrenean region. Minor replacements of taxa across the K-T boundary are also noted, {{as well as an}} increase in inaperturate gymnosperm pollen in the Danian. Comparing our two examined sections with one another reveals important differences in angiosperm pollen composition...|$|R
40|$|Deep {{exploration}} well Koraljka- 1 {{in the central}} part of the Adriatic Sea was drilled through Neogene and Paleogene deposits and penetrated the Upper Cretaceous. In the interval from 2500 to 2230 m, the Cretaceous and Paleogene deposits consist of white to grey, mud-supported, fairly fossiliferous deeper-water, chalky limestone (wackestone-mudstone) with sporadic occurrences of chert, intercalated with bioclastic limestone packstone/rudstone to floatstone. Bioclastic limestone (calcarenite) intercalations, which yield platform-derived detritus, were redeposited seaward on the deep platform slope by a gravity mechanism. Lithostratigraphically, sedimentation was almost continuous across the <b>Cretaceous</b> - <b>Tertiary</b> <b>boundary.</b> The importance of these deposits and their stratigraphic interest is based on the fact that there is no on-shore equivalent of such deeper-water deposits in the Croatian part of the Outer Dinarids. In biostratigraphic terms, the K/T boundary is marked by significant changes in the microfossil assemblages (calcareous nannofossils, plankton and benthic foraminifera), which revealed that the hiatus at the boundary is minimal...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cretaceous</b> <b>Tertiary</b> (K/T) <b>boundary</b> is {{traditionally}} associated {{with one of}} the most dramatic mass extinctions in the Earth history. A number of killing mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to the widespread extinctions of Cretaceous biota at this boundary, including severe, global deterioration of the atmosphere and hydrosphere from the shock-induced release of CO 2 and SO(x) from carbonate- and sulfate-bearing target rocks, respectively. Recently carried out calculations revealed that the global warming caused by CO 2 release was considerably less important than the cooling due to SO(x) gases release during the Chicxulub impact event. Considering apparent potential importance of the response of sulfates to the shock metamorphism, relative lack of the data on shock behavior of sulfates as well as some general difficulties encountered during thermodynamic modeling of the shock-induced CO 2 loss from carbonates we subjected anhydrite to a series of shock experiments designed for complete recovery of the shocked material. We report here on the detail X-ray diffraction analysis of seven samples that were subjected to experimental shock-loading from 10 to 65 GPa...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{extinction}} {{attracts the}} attention of scientists for a long time. Particularly examined in detail the extinction at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary, took place from 65. 9 + - 0. 4 millionyears. There are numerous theories which try to explain the causes {{that led to the}} youngest of the five major extinctions in Earth history. Since 1980, when the iridium anomaly has been recorded in sediments, the theory of extraterrestrial cause of the extinctions caused by meteorite or comet was introducet. This theory has partly been confirmed by the findings impact crater in the Gulf of Mexico. Further examination, however, proved that the crater quite significantly precedes the boundary. Attention therefore has turned in another direction,i. e. the terrestrial cause of extinction. More recent scientists pay attention to present-day India and huge volcanic traps that created the Deccan platform. During the examination of the Deccan traps, the unexpected an impact crater structure, which is several times larger than the crater in the Gulf of Mexico, has been discovered This discovery started anew dispute about the main cause of the extinction at the <b>Cretaceous</b> / <b>Tertiary</b> <b>boundary.</b> Based on modern literature, the three major theories of the K/T extinction are discussed.

40|$|High {{precision}} oxygen isotope {{analyses were}} made of phosphate extracted from 17 samples of nektonic and benthic fish debris sampled across the stratigraphic <b>Cretaceous</b> [...] <b>Tertiary</b> <b>boundary</b> in northern Morocco. A refinement of the silver phosphate method was used to isolate phosphate from biogenic materials. Measured [delta] 18 O values of 18. 6 - 20. 5 [per mille sign] are interpreted as reflecting high-resolution thermal variations that affected the ocean water column of the western Tethys. The warm (27 [deg]C) water masses that characterized Maastrichtian times underwent rapid cooling and stabilized at an average temperature of 19 [deg]C during the Dano-Montian and Thanetian. This period of constant and cool temperature {{was followed by a}} relatively rapid but more gradual warming to about 25 [deg]C achieved in the Middle Ypresian. Significant small shifts in [delta] 18 O values between nektonic and benthic fauna recorded only during the stages of rapid warming or cooling may correspond to averaged thermal differences within the water column that developed in response to global climatic changes. The indicated temperature distribution could have been caused by thermal changes in the atmosphere rather than some signal carried by deep ocean currents. The oxygen isotope data coupled with previous measurements of REE and [epsilon]Nd(T) on the same samples support the suggestion that paleo-Pacific westward currents progressed as far as the northwestern part of the African platform {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous period...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{patterns of}} calcareous dinoflagellate cysts were {{studied in the}} classic <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>Tertiary</b> (K-T) <b>boundary</b> section of Stevns Klint, Denmark, focusing mainly on {{the response of the}} cyst association to an abrupt environmental catastrophe. A major part of the Fish Clay, which covers the K-T boundary at its base and is exposed in the investigated section, contains fallout produced by an asteroid impact. Calcareous dinoflagenate cysts are the best preserved remains of carbonate-producing phytoplankton in this layer. The potential of this group of microfossils for the analysis of survival strategies and extinction patterns has been underestimated. The cyst species of the investigated section can be grouped into four assemblages that represent victims, survivors, opportunists, and specially adapted forms. The victims (Pithonelloideae) were an extremely successful group throughout the Upper Cretaceous, but were restricted to the narrow outer shelf. This restriction minimized their spatial distribution, which generally should be large to facilitate escape from unfavorable conditions. Spatial restriction optimized the population decrease by mass mortality, disabling a successful recovery. In contrast, the survivors that became the dominating group in the Danian had a wide spatial range from the shelf environment to the oceanic realm. A unique calcareous dinocyst assemblage in the Fish Clay shows that even under the stressed conditions immediately following the impact event, some species flourished due to special adaptation or high ecological tolerance. The ability of these dinoflagellate species to form calcareous resting cysts in combination with their generally wide spatial distribution in a variety of environments appears to be the main reason for a low extinction rate at the K-T boundary as opposed to the high extinction rate of other phytoplankton groups, such as the coccolithophorids...|$|R
40|$|Four main Late <b>Cretaceous</b> and <b>Tertiary</b> {{phases of}} crustal {{shortening}} and thrust-related deformation are {{recognised in the}} northern Oman Mountains, each phase ending with a regional unconformity throughout the Oman Mountains and the UAE foreland. The earliest is the major thrust emplacement of the Semail Ophiolite, and underlying Haybi, Hawasina and Sumeini duplexes from NE to SW onto the depressed northeastern continental margin of the Arabian Plate during the Cenomanian to Campanian-early Maastrichtian (D 1). A prominent widespread unconformity that places Maastrichtian Qahlah Formation laterite, sandstones and conglomerates and Simsima Formation rudist - Acteonellid gastropod limestones over all underlying allochthonous units is recognised throughout the Oman Mountains. SW-verging folds and thrusts in Triassic to Cretaceous carbonate slope facies rocks exposed in Jabal Sumeini (Sumeini Group and Harnrat Duru Group) have been emplaced over uppermost Cretaceous Juweiza Formation conglomerates {{at the highest level}} of the Aruma. foreland basin. These Sumeini D 1 structures are abruptly truncated by an unconformity, above which are Middle Maastrichtian beds showing up to 95 % 'death assemblage' rudists and gastropods just below the <b>Cretaceous</b> - <b>Tertiary</b> <b>boundary</b> (top of Simsima Formation). A second deformation event (D 2) affected the Simsima Formation and underlying Sumeini Group, Hamrat Duru complex and Semail Ophiolite rocks. This phase shows gentle folding about NW-SE fold axes (e. g. Jabal Rawdah), along a similar trend to the Late Cretaceous D 1 event. This trend is also parallel to a regional set of NW-SE aligned fractures in the UAE foreland. A major angular unconformity occurs beneath the Upper Palaeocene - Eocene shallow-marine limestones (Umm Er Radhuma, Rus and Dammam formations). Many foreland jabals in eastern Abu Dhabi (Jabals Qatar, Malaqet, Mundasa) show gentle post-Eocene folding formed during the third stage of crustal shortening (D 3). The large perichne of Jabal Hafit is a double-plunging, east-verging box fold that formed after deposition of the Oligocene Asmari Formation limestones and Miocene Fars Formation gypsum and clays, the youngest beds affected by the fold. This Late Miocene - Pliocene phase of crustal shortening (D 4) is the youngest phase of deformation in the eastern Al Ain-Buraimi region...|$|R
