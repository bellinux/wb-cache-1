5|$|Coal mining {{became a}} major industry, and {{continued}} to grow into the 20th century, producing the fuel to heat homes, factories and drive steam engines, locomotives and steamships. By 1914 there were 1,000,000 <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> in Scotland. The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs; that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> everywhere, with {{a strong emphasis on}} masculinity, egalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.|$|E
5|$|Hallidayboro's housing {{compared}} {{favorably to}} that in other model company towns during this period. Not until {{the turn of the}} century did comparable company houses appear in southern Illinois, when Joseph Leiter built the town of Zeigler. In contrast to Hallidayboro's bustling, peaceful environment, <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> never lived in the attractive houses provided by Joseph Leiter.|$|E
5|$|Secondly, quotas {{were raised}} {{to limit the}} ability of workers to overfulfill targets. In the case of time workers, this was {{sometimes}} done by keeping quotas the same but reducing hours; for example, <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> saw their working day shortened to six hours. Some rises were very steep; {{in the case of}} engineering enterprises, quotas were raised by 65 percent.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} written and {{directed}} by Thomas Rickman, who was nominated for an Academy Award in 1980 for his screenplay of <b>Coal</b> <b>Miner's</b> Daughter, also starring Tommy Lee Jones. The film was produced by Bob Larson (executive producer of <b>Coal</b> <b>Miner's</b> Daughter) and Michael Apted (who directed <b>Coal</b> <b>Miner's</b> Daughter) served as executive producer. The film was a Larson/Rickman Production in association with the Sundance Institute. The original music was composed by Mike Post.|$|R
5|$|Ferret-legging was an {{endurance}} test or stunt in which ferrets {{were trapped in}} trousers worn by a participant. Also known as put 'em down and ferret-down-trousers, {{it seems to have}} been popular among <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> in Yorkshire, England. Contestants put live ferrets inside their trousers; the winner is the one who is the last to release the animals. The world record is five hours and thirty minutes.|$|E
5|$|Since the race's {{inception}} in 1984, 353 people from 11 countries have {{competed in the}} Yukon Quest, some many times. The race attracts from 21 (in 1996) to 47 (in 1988 and 1989) mushers each year. Of the 776 entries from 1984 to 2007, 263 (34%) did not finish. The racers have come from various professions: taxicab drivers, swimming instructors, <b>coal</b> <b>miners,</b> tax assessors, lawyers, fur trappers, journalists, and a car salesman have all entered.|$|E
5|$|The Stockport, Bolton and Rochdale Volunteers were {{reviewed}} on Kersal Moor on 25 August 1797 and in June 1812, 30,000 {{troops from the}} Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire, Louth and Stirling regiments were camped there ready for action to suppress the Luddites. In 1818 a protest meeting was held on the moor by <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> to publicise their case for better pay, because of the dangers they faced at work.|$|E

5|$|Widespread strikes marked 1922, {{as labor}} sought redress for falling wages and {{increased}} unemployment. In April, 500,000 <b>coal</b> <b>miners,</b> led by John L. Lewis, struck over wage cuts. Mining executives {{argued that the}} industry was seeing hard times; Lewis accused them of {{trying to break the}} union. As the strike became protracted, Harding offered compromise to settle it. As Harding proposed, the miners agreed to return to work, and Congress created a commission to look into their grievances.|$|E
5|$|Joe {{received}} little formal schooling. Due to the transient lifestyle of <b>coal</b> <b>miners,</b> {{his family moved}} frequently during his childhood. The McGinnitys moved to Gallatin County in 1878. Two days {{after the birth of}} their seventh child, Peter died in an accident. At the age of eight, Joe and his older brothers went to work in the mines to support their family. In 1880, the family moved to Springfield, Illinois, where Joe and his brothers worked for the Springfield Coal Company. They moved to Decatur, Illinois less than six months later, continuing to mine coal, while their mother cleaned houses.|$|E
5|$|KMFDM {{was officially}} founded in Paris, France, on February 29, 1984, as a {{performance}} art project between Sascha Konietzko and German painter and multimedia artist Udo Sturm {{at the opening}} of an exhibition of young European artists at the Grand Palais. The first show consisted of Sturm playing an ARP 2600 synthesizer, Konietzko playing vacuum cleaners and bass guitars with their amplifiers spread throughout the building, and four Polish <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> (whom Konietzko had met at a bordello) pounding on the foundations of the Grand Palais.|$|E

5|$|The {{massacre}} at Rock Springs led to other incidents of anti-Chinese aggression, primarily in Washington Territory, {{though there were}} incidents in Oregon and other states as well. Near Newcastle, Washington a mob of whites burned down the barracks of 36 Chinese <b>coal</b> <b>miners.</b> Throughout the Puget Sound area, Chinese workers were driven out of communities and subject to violence in Washington cities and towns, including Tacoma, Seattle, Newcastle, and Issaquah. Chinese workers were driven out of other Washington towns, but sources indicated, as early as 1891, that the above events were specifically connected to the wave of violence touched off at Rock Springs.|$|E
5|$|As the two armies {{faced the}} {{stalemate}} of trench warfare at Petersburg in July 1864, Burnside {{agreed to a}} plan suggested by a regiment of former <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> in his corps, the 48th Pennsylvania: dig a mine under a fort named Elliot's Salient in the Confederate entrenchments and ignite explosives there to achieve a surprise breakthrough. The fort was destroyed on July 30 in {{what is known as}} the Battle of the Crater. Because of interference from Meade, Burnside was ordered, only hours before the infantry attack, not to use his division of black troops, which had been specially trained for this mission. He was forced to use untrained white troops instead. He could not decide which division to choose as a replacement, so he had his three subordinate commanders draw lots.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E

50|$|Biggins {{was born}} and raised in Brownhills, Staffordshire, the eldest of nine {{children}} born to John Biggins, a <b>coal</b> <b>miner,</b> and Elizabeth Biggins (née Wilton). By 1901, the teenaged Biggins was also working as a <b>coal</b> <b>miner</b> in Brownhills before moving to Yorkshire, where he boarded with Yorkshire footballer Harry Ness.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was very}} {{involved}} in the mining industry: as a <b>coal</b> <b>miner,</b> <b>coal</b> merchant, inventor of safety equipment and in opening new coalfields.|$|R
5|$|The Panic of 1893 had a {{severely}} {{negative effect on}} the Hoosier economy when many factories closed and several railroads declared bankruptcy. The Pullman Strike of 1894 hurt the Chicago area and <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> in southern Indiana participated in a national strike. Hard times were not limited to industry; farmers also felt a financial pinch from falling prices. The economy began to recover when World War I broke out in Europe, creating a higher demand for American goods. Despite economic setbacks, advances in industrial technology continued throughout the last years of the 19th and into the 20th century. On July 4, 1894, Elwood Haynes successfully road tested his first automobile, and opened the Haynes-Apperson auto company in 1896. In 1895, William Johnson invented a process for casting aluminum.|$|E
5|$|Ida {{insisted that}} McKinley {{continue}} his increasingly successful career {{in law and}} politics. He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875, and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall. The next year, McKinley undertook a high-profile case defending a group of <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers. Lynch, McKinley's opponent in the 1871 election, and his partner, William R. Day, were the opposing counsel, and the mine owners included Mark Hanna, a Cleveland businessman. Taking the case pro bono, he was successful in getting {{all but one of}} the miners acquitted. The case raised McKinley's standing among laborers, a crucial part of the Stark County electorate, and also introduced him to Hanna, who would become his strongest backer in years to come.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidates}} were the same, but {{the issues of}} the campaign had shifted: free silver was still a question that animated many voters, but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party. Democrats knew the war had been popular, even if the imperialism issue was less sure, so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power, painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business. As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home, this time making only one speech, to accept his nomination. Roosevelt emerged as the campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> strike in Pennsylvania. Bryan's campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896, and McKinley never doubted that he would be re-elected. On November 6, 1900, he was proven correct, winning the largest victory for any Republican since 1872. Bryan carried only four states outside the solid South, and McKinley even won Bryan's home state of Nebraska.|$|E

5|$|The {{quarries}} and mines made {{increasing use of}} mechanization {{from the}} start of the 20th century, with electricity replacing steam and water as a power source. The Llechwedd Quarry introduced its first electrical plant in 1891, and in 1906, a hydro-electric plant was opened in Cwm Dyli, on the lower slopes of Snowdon, which supplied electricity to the largest quarries in the area. The use of electric saws and other machinery reduced the hard manual labour involved in extracting the slate, but produced much more slate dust than the old manual methods, leading to an increased incidence of silicosis. The work was also dangerous in other ways, with the blasting operations responsible for many deaths. A government enquiry in 1893 found that the death rate for underground workers in the slate mines was 3.23 per thousand, higher than the rate for <b>coal</b> <b>miners.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1906–07 was the coldest in Alberta history; this was {{exacerbated}} by {{a shortage of}} coal. One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> and mine operators in the province. At the beginning of April 1907 the Canada West Coal and Coke Company locked out the miners from its mine near Taber. The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the Crow's Nest Pass, where miners were refusing to sign a new contract. The problem spread, until by April 22 all 3,400 miners working for member-companies of the Western Coal Operators' Association were off work. Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay; the mine operators objected to this last point {{on the basis that}} many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the primary campaign, the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and <b>coal</b> <b>miners.</b> Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E
