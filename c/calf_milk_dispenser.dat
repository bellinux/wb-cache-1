Experimental milk replacers were formulated to contain whey protein concentrate (WPC) as the pri-mary protein source orWPCplus 5 % spray-dried bovine plasma (SDBP) or spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP). The SDPP was heated to remove heat-insoluble materi-als and provide products with similar IgG content. Calves were also fed commercial calf starter and water for ad libitum consumption. Intake, change in body weight (BW), feed efficiency, morbidity and mortality were determined. Mortality was 10, 3, and 2 in calves fed WPC, SDBP, and SDPP treatments, respectively. Morbidity, measured {{as the number of}} days that calves had diarrhea was reduced by 30 %when SDBP or SDPP were fed.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new <b>milk</b> <b>dispenser</b> product that is designed to dispense milk with varying levels of milk fat content. The product contains two tanks of milk, one containing skim and one containing whole. The user can rotate a dial to select which type of milk they want (skim, 1 %, 2 %, whole) and the product is able to mix the skim and whole milk at the appropriate ratio to dispense the desired type of milk. A prototype was developed that uses two, gallon-size milk jugs, each attached to a flexible tube at the cap interface. The flexible tubes passes through a ratio selection mechanism that the user can rotate to select the desired type of milk. The mechanism compresses the tubes to achieve the appropriate ratio, and finally the tubes pass on through to a dispensing valve. The prototype was tested using clear water in one tank, and colored water in the other to visually observe how well the product mixes. The final prototype was able to mix quite appropriate ratios with sufficient precision in milk fat ratios. by Julie E. Henion. Thesis (S. B.)

50|$|In {{beef cattle}} production, profits are derived almost entirely from the weaning {{weight of the}} <b>calf.</b> <b>Milk</b> from the mother {{supplies}} {{only half of the}} nutrients the calf needs to achieve its maximum growth rate and weaning weight. By offering creep feed, both the rate of weight gain and the weaning weight of the calf can be significantly improved. It is used primarily with spring-born calves, as pasture quality at this time is declining, preventing the calf from finding the other 50% of its nutritive needs by grazing. A calf requires approximately 10% of its body weight in milk daily; for a 100 lb calf, this means 10 lb of <b>milk.</b> As the <b>calf</b> grows, the amount of milk it requires begins to exceed the capacity of its mother to produce the milk. A 500 lb calf requires 50 lb of milk, but a beef cow only produces approximately 13 lb of milk a day. The 500-lb calf is therefore shorted nearly 40 lb of milk. This difference is made up for by offering creep feed. However, a calf's rumen is still small and poorly developed - for this reason, creep feed offered to beef calves must be very energy-dense.|$|R

Therefore, the aim of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of <b>calf</b> presence during <b>milking</b> during sampling period (winter or grazing periods), on dairy performance, milk fatty acid (FA) composition, lipolysis and cheese yield and composition. Nine and 8 Salers lactating cows were milked in the presence (CP) or absence (CA) of their calves respectively. During winter, the cows were fed a hay-based diet and then they only grazed a grassland pasture. <b>Calf</b> presence during <b>milking</b> increased milk yield and milk 16 : 0 concentration and decreased milk fat content and milk total odd- and branched-chain FA (OBCFA) concentrations. Calf presence only increased initial lipolysis in milk collected during the winter season. Milk from CP cows compared to CA cows resulted in a lower cheese yield and ripened cheeses with lower fat content. Milk from the grazing season had lower saturated medium-chain FA and OBCFA concentrations and higher 18 : 0, cis- 9 - 18 : 1, trans- 11 - 18 : 1 and cis- 9, trans- 11 -CLA concentrations than that from the winter season. Initial milk lipolysis was higher in the winter than in the grazing season. These variations could be due to seasonal changes in the basal diet.

Bucket fed + QLL; 3). Teat fed + no QLL and 4). Bucket fed + no QLL. For the 42 -day experimental period, 8 groups of 8 calves were penned (2. 4 × 10. 0 m) on straw in a naturally ventilated Monopitch calf house. A quartz linear heating lamp (3 k output) was positioned in the centre of the individual sheds, 10 feet above the floor of the straw bedded pens for these on QLL treatments, and remained switched on for the duration of the study. The calves received an individual allowance of 25 kg of milk replacer powder offered warm (38 °C) by bucket and had ad libitum access to a concentrate ration. Individual disease episodes were determined by the requirement to treat with antibiotics for either enteric disease or respiratory disease. Serum immunoglobulins (IgG 1) were measured quantitatively by single radial immunodiffusion standard and calculated via an internal Ig standard (100 mg/L) on days 1, 14 and 28 of the study. Haematological parameters were measured on days 1, 14 and 42 of the study and included red blood cell number, haemoglobin, packed cell volume, mean cell volume and total white cell counts. The data were analysed using a model appropriate to factorial design, with terms for QLL and teat in the main plot. The average temperature and relative humidity of the shed compartments with and without the QLL heating lamps were recorded continuously and were 11. 3 °C and 81 % and 10. 5 °C and 86 %, respectively. There was no significant difference (P > 0. 05) between treatments with respect to liveweight gain from day of arrival (day 1) to day 42 of the study. There was no significant interaction between QLL, no QLL, teat fed and bucket fed treatments with respect to serum IgG 1 concentrations and haematological parameters throughout the study period (P > 0. 05). The incidence of respiratory disease and enteric disease was similar across the treatment groups (P > 0. 05). It is concluded that the rearing of calves indoors, in the presence of quartz linear heating lamps, and either fed <b>calf</b> <b>milk</b> replacer by teat or bucket had no beneficial effect on calf health and performance when compared with calves reared in a natural ventilated environment. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Adequate {{nutrition}} {{is important}} to provide all nutrients for proper health and growth of young calves, especially {{in the presence of}} stressors such as cold and transport. Serum protein products have been proposed to improve health and diminish effects of stress in dairy calves. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess a serum protein-based arrival formula (AF) and use of a serum protein supplement (G; Gammulin, APC Inc.) in milk replacer for neonatal male calves stressed by transport and cold on performance, morbidity, and mortality. Ninety-three male Holstein calves were stratified by arrival BW and plasma protein concentration, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Treatments were 1 = control electrolyte, milk replacer without G (E; n = 25); 2 = AF, milk replacer without G (AF; n = 22); 3 = control electrolyte, milk replacer with G (EG; n = 24); and 4 = AF, milk replacer with G (AFG; n = 22). At arrival, calves were fed either AF or a control electrolyte solution. At the next feeding, all calves received either a commercial <b>calf</b> <b>milk</b> replacer (20 % CP, and 20 % fat; no G supplementation) or the same milk replacer supplemented with G. The G‐supplemented group received 50 g/d of G in the milk replacer during the first 14 d of feeding only. Feed offered and refused was recorded daily. Calf health was assessed by daily assignment of scour an...|$|R

The experiment covered 63 animals in 20 smallholder farms, divided into control and supplemented groups.
