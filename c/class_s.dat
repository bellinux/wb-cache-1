5|$|In 1890 Manson was {{replaced}} as locomotive superintendent by James Johnson, {{the son of}} Samuel W. Johnson, then locomotive superintendent at the Midland Railway. In 1893 Neilsons delivered six new 4-4-0 tender locomotives that were more powerful any previous Great North locomotive and the first not to have Clark's smoke prevention apparatus. Classified as <b>Class</b> <b>S</b> and known for rapid acceleration and sustained high speed, these were the blueprint for the later Great North tender locomotives. Manson had left a design for a 0-4-4 tank locomotive and Johnson changed the firebox, boiler and value gear so {{they were the same}} as the <b>Class</b> <b>S</b> tender locomotives before ordering nine to work the Deeside Line. These arrived in 1893 and most were transferred to the Aberdeen suburban services in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream, non-pornographic manga also {{frequently}} contains explorations {{of gender and}} sex roles, although usually for purposes of exoticism or comedy {{rather than in a}} realistic manner. Some supporting characters cross-dress, such as Nuriko from Fushigi Yuugi, and some series are centred around the idea of changing sex, such as Ranma ½, whose protagonist changes sex, but not gender, when splashed with cold water. IS, a manga about two intersexual characters, won the 2007 Kodansha Manga Award in the girls' manga division. <b>Class</b> <b>S</b> is a genre of girl's fiction that tells stories about crushes between a female upperclassman and an underclassman.

25|$|Both KSS and KES {{were taken}} over by the {{municipality}} in 1924, when their concessions expired. Oslo Municipality thereby established a new municipally-owned company, Oslo Sporveier, to operate all street trams in Oslo. KSS continued to use the <b>Class</b> <b>S</b> trams until 1918. However, many of the trams were rebuilt to other models and these remained in service until 1966. KSS had no need for Rodeløkka Depot and closed it down immediately after the take-over. The Rodeløkka Line was closed in 1949, although the southern part is still in operation as part of the Sinsen Line. Sagene Ring closed in 1961, and the Vippetangen Line followed suit six years later.|$|E
25|$|With the {{delivery}} of the Class SS starting 1914, the older <b>Class</b> <b>S</b> trains became less popular due to their limit size and comfort. However, they were still technically suited for service. Nos. 48, 49 and 66 were converted to trailers in 1916, being renumbered 247–249. By 1918 the class was removed from regular service. That year no. 57 collided and KSS decided to rebuild it. The body was removed and the undercarriage and motors were used to construct a snowplow unit. The plow itself {{came out on the}} side and could be maneuvered from within. This allowed it to plow the tracks and the section from the tracks to the sidewalk. It remained in operation until 1950.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the Sagene Line {{commenced}} {{in early}} 1899. Although originally stipulated {{to open in}} August, this was delayed until 24 November, when revenue operation started. Initially there was not more power available than allowed a ten-minute headway with the <b>Class</b> <b>S</b> trams. Once additional power supply had been secured, the headway was cut to five minutes. To begin with services altered between running the full length to Sagene or just {{the southern part of}} St. Hanshaugen. In the city center they terminated at Athenæum. From 1900 an agreement was reached with KES, allowing the Sagene services to continue along its tracks to Jernbanetorget. The services from St. Hanshaugen were run onwards along the Vippetangen Line.|$|E

25|$|This is the recursion-theoretic {{branch of}} {{learning}} theory. It {{is based on}} Gold's model of learning in the limit from 1967 and has developed since then more and more models of learning. The general scenario is the following: Given a <b>class</b> <b>S</b> of computable functions, is there a learner (that is, recursive functional) which outputs for any input of the form (f(0),f(1),...,f(n)) a hypothesis. A learner M learns a function f if almost all hypotheses are the same index e of f {{with respect to a}} previously agreed on acceptable numbering of all computable functions; M learns S if M learns every f in S. Basic results are that all recursively enumerable classes of functions are learnable while the class REC of all computable functions is not learnable. Many related models have been considered and also the learning of classes of recursively enumerable sets from positive data is a topic studied from Gold's pioneering paper in 1967 onwards.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Shelton has {{suggested}} that Maria-sama ga Miterus [...] "reduced capacity for epic drama" [...] {{is due to the}} lack of malicious characters; he considers the series [...] "pure shōjo", mostly due to its character-driven storyline.

Hairston notes that Maria-sama ga Miteru emphasizes romance and emotion over sexuality, and it has a respectful treatment of its homoerotic themes.

The extensive use of French titles has also been criticized as being distracting and initially difficult to follow. Over 5.4 million copies of the light novels have been published.|$|E

The railway took over the working of the Aberdeen harbour railway and in 1915 purchased four 0-4-2 tank locomotives from Manning Wardle. After the war, six more locomotives were built in 1920 by the North British Locomotive Company, and two locomotives the following year at Inverurie.

2500|$|Peano {{defined the}} notion of [...] "function" [...] in a manner {{somewhat}} similar to Frege, but without the precision.

He then introduces φ, [...] "a sign or an aggregate of signs such that if x is an object of the <b>class</b> <b>s,</b> the expression φx denotes a new object". Peano adds two conditions on these new objects: First, that the three equality-conditions hold for the objects φx; secondly, that [...] "if x and y are objects of <b>class</b> <b>s</b> and if x = y, we assume {{it is possible to}} deduce φx = φy". Given all these conditions are met, φ is a [...] "function presign". Likewise he identifies a [...] "function postsign". For example [...] if φ is the function presign a+, then φx yields a+x, or if φ is the function postsign +a then xφ yields [...] x+a.|$|E
