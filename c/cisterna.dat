5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the <b>cisterna</b> magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E

40|$|Radioautographs of 45 Ca-labeled frog {{skeletal}} muscles {{have been}} prepared using freeze-dry and vapor fixation techniques to avoid displacement of the isotope during {{the preparation of the}} radioautographs. 45 Ca has been localized in resting muscles exposed to 45 Ca Ringer's for 5 min or 5 hr and in isotopically labeled muscles recovering from tetanic stimulation at room temperature or at 4 °C. In muscles soaked at rest for 5 min 45 Ca was present almost exclusively in the terminal <b>cisternae.</b> In all other muscles there were three sites at which the isotope was concentrated: (a) the terminal <b>cisternae,</b> (b) the intermediate <b>cisternae</b> and the longitudinal tubules, and (c) the A band portion of the myofibrils.

The amount of 45 Ca in the longitudinal tubules and the intermediate <b>cisternae</b> decreased with time after a tetanus as the amount in the terminal <b>cisternae</b> increased. It is proposed that electrical stimulation releases calcium from the terminal <b>cisternae</b> and that relaxation occurs from the binding of the released calcium by the longitudinal tubules and the intermediate <b>cisternae.</b> Complete recovery from mechanical activity involves the transport of this bound calcium into the reticulum and its subsequent binding by the terminal <b>cisternae.</b> Resting exchange of calcium occurs primarily between the terminal <b>cisternae</b> and the transverse tubules...|$|R

The origin, development, and fate of paired <b>cisternae</b> during the cell cycle were studied in a poorly differentiated carcinoma of the eyelid. Early in the mitotic cycle, multiple membrane-bound, ovoid vesicles separated by interconnecting septa formed at the nuclear-cytoplasmic interface coincident with {{the disappearance of the}} nuclear envelope.

40|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} of plant cells {{is engaged in}} both the processing of glycoproteins and the synthesis of complex polysaccharides. To investigate the compartmentalization of these functions within individual Golgi stacks, we have analyzed the ultrastructure and the immunolabeling patterns of high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted suspension-cultured sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells. As {{a result of the}} improved structural preservation, three morphological types of Golgi <b>cisternae,</b> designated cis, medial, and trans, as well as the trans Golgi network, could be identified. The number of cis <b>cisternae</b> per Golgi stack was found to be fairly constant at approximately 1, whereas the number of medial and trans <b>cisternae</b> per stack was variable and accounted for the varying number of <b>cisternae</b> (3 - 10) among the many Golgi stacks examined. By using a battery of seven antibodies whose specific sugar epitopes on secreted polysaccharides and glycoproteins are known, {{we have been able to}} determine in which types of <b>cisternae</b> specific sugars are added to N-linked glycans, and to xyloglucan and polygalacturonic acid/rhamnogalacturonan-I, two complex polysaccharides. The findings are as follows. The β- 1, 4 -linked d-glucosyl backbone of xyloglucan is synthesized in trans <b>cisternae,</b> and the terminal fucosyl residues on the trisaccharide side chains of xyloglucan are partly added in the trans <b>cisternae,</b> and partly in the trans Golgi network. In contrast, the polygalacturonic/rhamnogalacturonan-I backbone is assembled in cis and medial <b>cisternae,</b> methylesterification of the carboxyl groups of the galacturonic acid residues in the polygalacturonic acid domains occurs mostly in medial <b>cisternae,</b> and arabinose-containing side chains of the polygalacturonic acid domains are added to the nascent polygalacturonic acid/rhamnogalacturonan-I molecules in the trans <b>cisternae.</b> Double labeling experiments demonstrate that xyloglucan and polygalacturonic acid/rhamnogalacturonan-I can be synthesized concomitantly within the same Golgi stack. Finally, we show that the xylosyl residue-linked β- 1, 2 to the β-linked mannose of the core of N-linked glycans is added in medial <b>cisternae.</b> Taken together, our results indicate that in sycamore maple suspension-cultured cells, different types of Golgi <b>cisternae</b> contain different sets of glycosyl transferases, that the functional organization of the biosynthetic pathways of complex polysaccharides is consistent with these molecules being processed in a cis to trans direction like the N-linked glycans, and that the complex polysaccharide xyloglucan is assembled exclusively in trans Golgi <b>cisternae</b> and the trans Golgi network...|$|R

40|$|When {{the nerves}} of {{isolated}} frog sartorius muscles were stimulated at 10 Hz, synaptic vesicles in the motor nerve terminals became transiently depleted. This depletion apparently {{resulted from a}} redistribution rather than disappearance of synaptic vesicle membrane, since {{the total amount of}} membrane comprising these nerve terminals remained constant during stimulation. At 1 min of stimulation, the 30 % depletion in synaptic vesicle membrane was nearly balanced by an increase in plasma membrane, suggesting that vesicle membrane rapidly moved to the surface as it might if vesicles released their content of transmitter by exocytosis. After 15 min of stimulation, the 60 % depletion of synaptic vesicle membrane was largely balanced by the appearance of numerous irregular membrane-walled <b>cisternae</b> inside the terminals, suggesting that vesicle membrane was retrieved from the surface as <b>cisternae.</b> When muscles were rested after 15 min of stimulation, <b>cisternae</b> disappeared and synaptic vesicles reappeared, suggesting that <b>cisternae</b> divided to form new synaptic vesicles so that the original vesicle membrane was now recycled into new synaptic vesicles. When muscles were soaked in horseradish peroxidase (HRP), this tracerfirst entered the <b>cisternae</b> which formed during stimulation and then entered {{a large proportion of the}} synaptic vesicles which reappeared during rest, strengthening the idea that synaptic vesicle membrane added to the surface was retrieved as <b>cisternae</b> which subsequently divided to form new vesicles. When muscles containing HRP in synaptic vesicles were washed to remove extracellular HRP and restimulated, HRP disappeared from vesicles without appearing in the new <b>cisternae</b> formed during the second stimulation, confirming that a one-way recycling of synaptic membrane, from the surface through <b>cisternae</b> to new vesicles, was occurring. Coated vesicles apparently represented the actual mechanism for retrieval of synaptic vesicle membrane from the plasma membrane, because during nerve stimulation they proliferated at regions of the nerve terminals covered by Schwann processes, took up peroxidase, and appeared in various stages of coalescence with <b>cisternae.</b> In contrast, synaptic vesicles did not appear to return directly from the surface to form <b>cisternae,</b> and <b>cisternae</b> themselves never appeared directly connected to the surface.

25|$|The {{structure}} and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature {{is in contrast to}} the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. Cis <b>cisterna</b> are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the trans cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.|$|E

We have used a combination of electron tomography and immunolabeling techniques to examine Golgi stacks and associated vesicles in {{the cells of the}} scale-producing alga Scherffelia dubia and Arabidopsis preserved by high-pressure freezing/freeze-substitution methods. Five structurally distinct types of vesicles were distinguished. In Arabidopsis, COPI and COPII vesicle coat proteins as well as vesicle cargo molecules (mannosidase I and sialyltransferase–yellow fluorescent protein) were identified by immunogold labeling. In both organisms, the COPI-type vesicles were further characterized by a combination of six structural criteria: coat architecture, coat thickness, membrane structure, cargo staining, cisternal origin, and spatial distribution. Using this multiparameter structural approach, we can distinguish two types of COPI vesicles, COPIa and COPIb. COPIa vesicles bud exclusively from cis <b>cisternae</b> and occupy the space between cis <b>cisternae</b> and ER export sites, whereas the COPIb vesicles bud exclusively from medial- and trans-Golgi <b>cisternae</b> and are confined to the space around these latter <b>cisternae.</b> We conclude that COPIa vesicle-mediated recycling to the ER occurs only from cis <b>cisternae,</b> that retrograde transport of Golgi resident proteins by COPIb vesicles is limited to medial and trans <b>cisternae,</b> and that diffusion of periGolgi vesicles is restricted...|$|R
40|$|Biol., 96 : 835 - 850), we {{suggested}} that the Golgi stack could be divided into functionally distinct cis, medial, and trans compartments, each comprising one or two adjacent <b>cisternae.</b> These compartments were identified using Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells infected with Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and treated with monensin. This drug blocked intracellular transport but not synthesis of the viral membrane proteins that were shown to accumulate in the medial <b>cisternae.</b> In consequence, these <b>cisternae</b> bound nucleocapsids. Here we show that this binding markedly increased {{the density of the}} medial <b>cisternae</b> and allowed us to separate them from cis and trans Golgi <b>cisternae.</b> A number of criteria were used to show that the intracellular capsid-binding membranes (ICBMs) observed in vivo were the same as those membranes sedimenting to a higher density in sucrose gradients in vitro, and this separation of <b>cisternae</b> was then used to investigate the distribution, within the Golgi stack, of some specific Golgi functions. After labeling for 2. 5 min with [3 H]palmitate, most of the fatty acid attached to viral membrane proteins was found in the ICBM fraction. Because the viral membrane proteins appear to move from cis to trans, this suggests that fatty acylation occurs in the cis or medial Golgi <b>cisternae.</b> In contrast, the distribution of ~l_ 2 -mannosidase, a...|$|R
