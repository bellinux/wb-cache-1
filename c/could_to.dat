5|$|After the massacre, General Henry Atkinson was {{informed}} that Dodge was to take over General Alexander Posey's brigade at Fort Hamilton. While Dodge {{was on his way}} to visit the brigade, he heard a rifle shot from a group of Native Americans. Dodge quickly returned to his command post and gathered as many men as he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> pursue the enemy. With Dodge in quick pursuit, a group of approximately 25 Native warriors criss-crossed the Pecatonica River until, finding flight hopeless, they prepared to make a stand at the Battle of Pecatonica.|$|E

5|$|Casualties were {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they <b>could</b> <b>to</b> relieve {{the suffering of the}} wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand made it impossible to use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E

The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people. The restriction offended area suffragists, who chartered a boat and got as close as they <b>could</b> <b>to</b> the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote. A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.|$|E

However, broader considerations were anyway leading the British towards support for an independent Sudan despite attempts by the United States to persuade them to give Egypt a role.|$|E

5|$|A Cape Coloured of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa {{primarily}} because the era's apartheid legislation seriously restricted his career prospects on racial grounds and barred {{him from the}} all-white Test team. He qualified for Worcestershire County Cricket Club through residency in 1964 and first played for England two years later. The consequences of D'Oliveira's possible inclusion in the 1968–69 MCC tour of South Africa were discussed by English and South African cricketing bodies as early as 1966. Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring the matter to a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links with South Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister B.J. Vorster sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be acceptable, but secretly did all he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> prevent it.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they <b>could</b> <b>to</b> facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the Greek advance, the fortresses of Bizani and Kastritsa were cut off by 16h and isolated {{from the rest of the}} Ottoman army and its headquarters in Ioannina. As night fell, the forts ceased firing, and their garrisons abandoned them, trying to cut through the rather loose Greek encirclement to Ioannina. In their attempt to withdraw towards Ioannina, a significant number of Ottoman troops, totaling 35 officers and 935 soldiers, were captured by the Greek units positioned on the city's southern outskirts. Several Ottoman positions capitulated the next morning, although Bizani and Kastritsa continued to resist until after the surrender. Meanwhile, Esat Pasha realized that the battle was lost, and tried to evacuate as many troops and wounded as he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> the north. As the Greeks pressed their advance however, he contacted the city's foreign consulates to seek help in negotiating a surrender. At 23:00 on , he agreed upon the unconditional surrender of Ioannina and the Ottoman garrison to the Greeks. The following day the Greek forces under Crown Prince Constantine were parading through the flag-covered streets of the city. On the other hand, Esat Pasha upon arriving in Turkey was welcomed as a national hero.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham {{had been ordered}} by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia {{for the defense of}} the {{province}} against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did what they <b>could</b> <b>to</b> restore the premises to a defensible condition. But Goreham had not been adequately provisioned and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, even trying to induce members of the garrison to defect.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.|$|E

5|$|Costa {{was chosen}} as Down Beat jazz critics' new star on piano and vibes for 1957; {{this was the first}} time that one artist had won two {{categories}} in the same year. In 1962 he was invited to play at the first International Jazz Festival in Washington, D.C. by the President's Music Committee of the People to People program. An indication of the esteem in which Costa was held by musicians is the caliber of those who performed at his memorial concert at The Village Gate on October 8, 1962: Cohn, Benny Golson, Zoot Sims, Charlie Byrd, Jim Hall, Mundell Lowe, Farmer, Clark Terry and Hawkins were among those who played. The playing of the bands led by the last two was recorded and released as an LP. Hawkins did not usually play at benefit concerts, but his feelings for Costa meant that he did what he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> make the seven-hour event a success.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn's {{diabetes}} worsened {{during the}} course of the trial, and by the time he was executed, his elderly mother had died. He suffered a heart attack while in custody. On 9 May 1964, was carried on a stretcher into the prison courtyard and assisted by guards and two Catholic priests to stand alongside the post to which he was tied. He was blindfolded against his request and shot in front of approximately 200 spectators. Lodge defended his actions, claiming the United States did all it <b>could</b> <b>to</b> prevent the execution. The ambassador claimed Cẩn would have been allowed to seek refuge at the U.S. embassy, despite the fact that he had ordered Conein to intercept Cẩn at the airport. Rev. Cao Văn Luân, Catholic rector of Huế University who had been fired for falling afoul of the powerful Archbishop Thục, asked Lodge that Cẩn not be executed. According to Luân, Lodge reportedly assured the rector the execution would not take place. Cẩn left his personal fortune, which had indeed been deposited in foreign banks, to Catholic charities.|$|E

Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} {{becoming}} abbot, one {{morning after the}} Divine Liturgy a group of approximately thirty monks rose against Symeon, who drove them away. Breaking the locks on the monastery gate on their way out, the monks took their appeal to the Patriarch Sisinios, who sided with Symeon and sent the monks into exile. Symeon pleaded on their behalf, doing everything he <b>could</b> <b>to</b> have the monks return to the monastery, including seeking {{out some of the}} monks to apologize to them. During his time as abbot, Symeon wrote Hymns of Divine Love (completed during his exile), the Discourses, and many letters and polemical works which have been lost. He also wrote articles relating to his disputes with the church theologians—these survived as his theological and ethical treatises. In 1005 Symeon resigned as abbot of St. Mammas, appointing one of his disciples in his stead, and taking up a more solitary life at the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Foiled at the AOC, boycott advocates {{turned to}} the AAU, hoping that the {{athletics}} organization, though also led by Brundage, would refuse to certify athletes for Berlin. Although no vote took place on a boycott at the AAU's December 1934 meeting, Brundage did not seek re-election, and delegates elected Judge Jeremiah T. Mahoney as the new president, to take office in 1935. Although pro-boycott activities briefly fell into a lull, renewed Nazi brutality against the Jews in June 1935 sparked a resurgence, and converted Mahoney to the pro-boycott cause. In October, Baillet-Latour wrote to the three American IOC members: William May Garland, Charles Sherrill, and Ernest Lee Jahncke, asking them to do all they <b>could</b> <b>to</b> ensure a US team was sent to Germany. Garland and Sherrill agreed; Jahncke, however, refused, stating {{that he would be}} supporting the boycott. Brundage, at Baillet-Latour's request, took the lead in the anti-boycott campaign. Matters came to a head at the AAU convention in December 1935. Brundage's forces won the key votes, and the AAU approved sending a team to Berlin, specifying that this did not mean it supported the Nazis. In victory, Brundage was not magnanimous, demanding the resignation of opponents. Although not all quit, Mahoney did.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all they <b>could</b> <b>to</b> help rescue those trapped in the flood waters {{and take care of}} the homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents in the wake of the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to quicksand and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E
