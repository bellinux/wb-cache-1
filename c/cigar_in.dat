5|$|Both prank and {{intentionally}} deadly exploding cigars {{have been}} featured in numerous works of fiction, spanning many forms of media including literature, film, comics books, cartoons and others. A well-known use of the exploding <b>cigar</b> <b>in</b> literature, for example, appears in Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow. In it, the character Etzel Ölsch symbolically betrays his death wish by eagerly smoking a cigar he knows {{to be of the}} prank explosive variety. Other book examples include Robert Coover's 1977 novel, The Public Burning, where a fictionalized Richard Nixon hands an exploding cigar to Uncle Sam, and Sherburne James' Death's Clenched Fist (1982), in which a Tammany Hall politico of the 1890s is murdered with an exploding cigar.|$|E

The transition from war to peace was marked by the appointment as governor general of the Viscount Alexander, whose son, Brian, reportedly used the portraits of former governors general throughout the hall as targets for his water pistol. During Alexander's tenure, Government House's first post-war Canadian royal visitors were the heiress presumptive to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), and her husband, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who came in late 1951 and, amongst other activities, took part in a square dance in the ballroom (replete with checked shirts). Churchill, once again Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, returned to Rideau Hall in January of the next year, where, sprawled on a sofa with a <b>cigar</b> <b>in</b> one hand and a brandy in the other, he persuaded Alexander to join the British Cabinet.|$|E

500|$|The {{specific}} epithet geaster {{alludes to}} members of genus Geastrum, which also open to form star-shaped fruit bodies commonly called 'earthstars'. In the United States, Chorioactis geaster {{is commonly known as}} the Texas star, or the devil's cigar. Regarding the origin of the latter name American mycologist Fred Jay Seaver commented: [...] "Whether the name Devil's Cigar refers to the form of the young specimens which resemble a bloated <b>cigar</b> <b>in</b> form, as well as in color, or {{to the fact that the}} fungus appears to 'smoke' at maturity, we cannot say... At any rate, the name is very appropriate." [...] In 1997, Texan state Senator Chris Harris filed a bill to make C.geaster the official state fungus of Texas. The bill passed the Senate but did not succeed in the House. In Japan the mushroom is called kirinomitake (キリノミタケ), because the immature, unopened fruit body bears a superficial resemblance to the seed pods of kiri, the empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa).|$|E

An exploding cigar is also featured on the poster for the Channel 4 British Documentary, 638 Ways to Kill Castro, which shows Castro with a <b>cigar</b> <b>in</b> his mouth that has a fuse projecting from the end and a lit match approaching. An exploding cigar was tested on a season 2 episode of Deadliest Warrior, KGB vs. CIA.

500|$|Brosnan's Bond was {{introduced}} in Goldeneye; James Chapman argues that the film works his portrayal of Bond {{into the history of}} the others in the series through the post-credits sequence use of the , previously seen in Goldfinger and Thunderball, [...] "thus immediately evoking the memory of [...] Connery". Brosnan's characterisation of Bond was seen by Jeremy Black as being [...] "closer to the Fleming novels than Moore... yet he is also lighter and less intense than Dalton". Black also commented that the shift in character in the first three films reflected changing social opinions, with Bond not smoking. Brosnan was clear he wanted to change Bond's smoking habit, saying [...] "I don't give a damn about everyone's perception of the character: I think smoking causes cancer therefore he doesn't smoke", although he did smoke a Cuban <b>cigar</b> <b>in</b> Die Another Day. Brosnan continued with the use of humour prevalent with other portrayals, and provided a [...] "mix of action and danger threaded through with the right amount of wit and humour"; Smith and Lavington saw the humour largely as puns that were [...] "flippant, but not crass".|$|E

The room was a favourite haunt of Spencer's grandfather, Albert Spencer, who would spend thousands of hours in it perusing over the family history. So guarded was he of the collection that when Winston Churchill once spent time in the room looking for information on his ancestor, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722), Albert immediately doused out his <b>cigar</b> <b>in</b> fear of creating a fire.
