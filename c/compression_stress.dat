50|$|Another {{possibility}} {{to avoid a}} strong tensile stress when sealing copper through glass {{is the use of}} a thin walled copper tube instead of a solid wire. Here a shear stress builds up in the glass-to-metal interface which is limited by the low tensile strength of the copper combined with a low tensile stress. The copper tube is insensitive to high electric current compared to a Dumet-seal because on heating the tensile stress converts into a <b>compression</b> <b>stress</b> which is again limited by the tensile strength of the copper. Also, it is possible to lead an additional solid copper wire through the copper tube. In a later variant, only a short section of the copper tube has a thin wall and the copper tube is hindered to shrink at cooling by a ceramic tubeinside the copper tube.|$|E

30|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the causes of}} the diffusion mobility growth of carbon in phase-hardened alloy Fe- 18  wt.%Mn- 2  wt.%Si, we should consider two different mechanisms that make the diffusion possible.

This mechanism of carbon diffusion is mainly athermal.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} aspect is the wetting {{of the metal}} by the glass. If the thermal expansion of the metal {{is higher than the}} thermal expansion ofthe glass like with the Housekeeper seal, a high contact angle (bad wetting) means that there is a high tensile stress in the surface of the glassnear the metal. Such seals usually break inside the glass and leave a thin cover of glass on the metal. If the contact angle is low (good wetting)the surface of the glass is everywhere under <b>compression</b> <b>stress</b> like an enamel coating. Ordinary soda-lime glass does not flow on copper at temperatures below the melting point of the copper and, thus, does not give a low contact angle. The solution is to cover the copper with asolder glass which has a low melting point and does flow on copper and then to press the soft soda-lime glass onto the copper. The solder glassmust have a coefficient of thermal expansion which is equal or a little lower than that of the soda-lime glass. Classically high lead containingglasses are used, but it is also possible to substitute these by multi-component glasses e.g. based on thesystem ---------.|$|E
50|$|Paterae and {{mountains}} are observed to appear near {{each other on}} Io. This observation indicates that these two structures are somehow related. As Io has strong tidal heating and very violent volcanic activities, the interior of Io should be vigorously convecting). Localized regions of up-welling and down-welling of mantle material could affect the stress field in Io's lithosphere. Buoyant mantle diapir can locally enhance the compressive stress which may be sufficient {{for the development of}} thrust faults. This mechanism would predict curved and circular mountains if it were responsible for the initiating faulting. However, many Ionian mountains are observed to have straight margins. This contradiction indicates that faults exist before the raising of diapirs. Thus, diapirs only provide a mechanism for focusing the stresses in Io's lithosphere. Fractures that are not under <b>compression</b> <b>stress</b> induced by underlying diapiring processes could serve as conduits through which the melt erupts onto the surface. Meanwhile, in a global view, an anti-correlation between the distributions of mountains and volcanic centers is observed on Io. This may reflect a global convective pattern. On the hemisphere which is dominated by up-welling, there are more volcanic centers. On the hemisphere that is dominated by down-welling, there are more mountains.|$|E
50|$|Swept {{crystals}} are crystals {{that have}} undergone a solid-state electrodiffusion purification process. Sweeping involves heating the crystal above 500 °C in a hydrogen-free atmosphere, with a voltage gradient {{of at least}} 1 kV/cm, for several hours (usually over 12). The migration of impurities and the gradual replacement of alkali metal ions with hydrogen (when swept in air) or electron holes (when swept in vacuum) causes a weak electric current through the crystal; decay of this current to a constant value signals {{the end of the}} process. The crystal is then left to cool, while the electric field is maintained. The impurities are concentrated at the cathode region of the crystal, which is cut off afterwards and discarded. Swept crystals have increased resistance to radiation, as the dose effects are dependent on the level of alkali metal impurities; they are suitable for use in devices exposed to ionizing radiation, e.g. for nuclear and space technology. Sweeping under vacuum at higher temperatures and higher field strengths yields yet more radiation-hard crystals. The level and character of impurities can be measured by infrared spectroscopy. Quartz can be swept in both α and β phase; sweeping in β phase is faster, but the phase transition may induce twinning. Twinning can be mitigated by subjecting the crystal to <b>compression</b> <b>stress</b> in the X direction, or an AC or DC electric field along the X axis while the crystal cools through the phase transformation temperature region.|$|E

The transitional alloy at intermediate state possesses partial disorder and low magnetization. Ferromagnetism is governed by anti site in the ordered matrix, in fact, the long range order and lattice expansion contribute to the increase in magnetism at low <b>compression</b> <b>stresses</b> while it is only due to the lattice expansion at higher stresses.

5000|$|Within {{material}} groups (classes) {{there is}} a further subdivision {{that depends on the}} relation between strength and toughness between different material subgroups. The ovals, or [...] "balloons" [...] within each material class tend to have a sloping trend that describes the subgroup's strength-toughness relationship. For example, take the alloy system's downward sloping trend. This relationship indicates, that within an alloy class an increase in strength leads to a decrease in fracture toughness regardless of the strengthening mechanism used. For this reason, it is beneficial to think of an increase in strength (within the engineering alloys) as a direct decrease in fracture toughness, which is correlated with a lower ductility of the material. This however, is not the trend for other material classes. As a first example, consider the polymer foams and porous ceramics. In direct contrast to alloys, the trend in this material class is to have an upward slope. Explicitly, when the strength of these materials is increased we can expect to see an accompanied increase in fracture toughness. Indeed, in the subgroup of basal and ash we observe a close to one order of magnitude increase in both properties. Porous ceramics have been shown to behave exactly like this under both <b>compression</b> <b>stress</b> and tensile stress, however, the fracture toughness values are ten times lower under tension. This behavior can most easily be grasped by considering the porosity of these materials, where these voids can be modeled as preexisting cracks, which increase the nucleation energy of cracks under stress and impede the propagation of these cracks. Note that the engineering ceramics also show the same sloping trend as the porous ceramics, however, the slope is much greater, which makes it less noticeable in the log-scale.|$|E
5000|$|In 1911 the Dumet-wire seal {{was invented}} {{which is still}} the common {{practice}} to seal copper leads through soda-lime or lead glass. If copper is properly oxidised before it is wetted by molten glass a vacuum tight seal of good mechanical strength can be obtained. After copper is oxidized, it is often dipped in a borax solution, as borating the copper helps prevents over-oxidation when reintroduced to a flame. Simple copper wire is not usable because its {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} is much higher than that of the glass. Thus, on cooling a strong tensile force acts on the glass-to-metal interface and it breaks. Glass and glass-to-metal interfaces are especially sensitive to tensile stress. Dumet-wire is a copper clad wire (about 25% of the weight of the wire is copper) with a core of nickel-iron alloy 42, an alloy with a composition of about 42% nickel. [...] The core has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing for a wire with a coefficient of radial thermal expansion which is slightly lower than the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass, so that the glass-to-metal interface is under a low <b>compression</b> <b>stress.</b> It is not possible to adjust the axial thermal expansion of the wire as well. Because of the much higher mechanical strength of the nickel-iron core compared to the copper, the axial thermal expansion of the Dumet-wire is about the same as of the core. Thus, a shear stress builds up which is limited to a safe value by the low tensile strength of the copper. This is also the reason why Dumet is only useful for wire diameters lower than about 0.5 mm. In a typical Dumet seal through the base of a vacuum tube a short piece of Dumet-wire is butt welded to a nickel wire at one end and a copper wire at the other end. When the base is pressed of lead glass the Dumet-wire and a short part of the nickel and the copper wire are enclosed in the glass. Then the nickel wire and the glass around the Dumet-wire are heated by a gas flame and the glass seals to the Dumet-wire. The nickel and copper do not seal vacuum tight to the glass but are mechanically supported. The butt welding also avoids problems with gas-leakages at the interface between the core wire and the copper.|$|E

MethodsRabbits with a surgically induced V-shaped tibial fracture were separated into 2 main groups: the control group (C Group, n= 6) without application of any axial <b>compression</b> <b>stress</b> stimulation postoperatively and the stimulation group (S Group, n= 90). The S Group was further divided into 20 subgroups (S 11 to S 54) in terms of 5 axial <b>compression</b> <b>stress</b> stimulation levels (112. 8 kPa, 289. 8 kPa, 396. 5 kPa, 472. 7 kPa, and 602. 3 kPa) and 4 experimental endpoints (1, 3, 5 and 8 weeks after operation). A custom made circular external fixator was used to provide the axial <b>compression</b> <b>stress</b> of the fracture sites. Based on X-ray observation, a fracture healing scoring system was created to evaluate the fracture healing process. ResultsAt 8 weeks after operation, there existed a “∩–shape” relationship between healing score and axial <b>compression</b> <b>stress</b> stimulation level of fracture site. The optimal axial <b>compression</b> <b>stress</b> stimulation ranged from 289. 8 kPa to 472. 7 kPa, accompanying the best fracture healing, i. e. the fracture line became indistinct or almost disappeared, {{and a lot of}} callus jointed the two fracture ends.
