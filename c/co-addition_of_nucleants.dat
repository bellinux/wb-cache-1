40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the development of improved technology of the preparation of coal-water slurries that have potential for replacing fuel oil in direct combustion. Research accomplishments are summarized for: standardization of experimental procedures; investigation of effect of high-pressure roll mill/ball mill grinding on the energetics of fine grinding and the rheology of coal-water slurries prepared with such fines; study of aging behavior of slurries; and ways of improving rheology of slurries. The rheological behavior of slurries is a manifestation of particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions in the slurry. Improvement in the rheology of slurries could be brought about by suitably altering these interactions. The research directed towards investigation of the influence <b>of</b> <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> sodium hexametaphosphate and vacuum oil, with CoalMaster as the primary dispersant, showed that <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> the reagents significantly improved the rheology of coal-water slurries.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The fire {{retardant}} action of red phosphorus in nylon 6 was im-proved by <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> ferric/ferrous oxides. It {{was found that}} the activity of Fe oxides depends on the product grade. Polymer formulations, non-ignitable in air were obtained by <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> Fe 3 O 4 /Fe 2 = 3 : 2 with red phosphorus. Scanning electron microscopy showed that ferric oxide contributes beneficially to the fire retardancy, probably because it modifies the morphology of the char. Red phosphorus coated by Fe 3 O 4 and encapsulated with phenol formaldehyde resin provided further improvements of fire retardancy and significantly de-creased the rate of evolution of phosphine. Mechanistic studies did not support the hypothesis reported in the literature, that the {{fire retardant}} action of red phosphorus is due to its oxidation by oxygen of air. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} for gamma ray bursters and {{the detection of}} gravitational waves (GWs) are two outstanding problems facing modern physics. Many models of gamma ray bursters predict copious GW emission, so the assumption of an association between GRBs and GW bursts may be testable with existing bar GW detector data. We consider Weber bar data streams {{in the vicinity of}} known GRB times and present calculations of the expected signal after <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> 1000 GRB/GW bursts that have been shifted to a common zero time. Our calculations are based on assumptions concerning the GW spectrum and the redshift distribution of GRB/GW sources which are consistent with current GRB/GW models.

Second, we present techniques to build models that can successfully predict the most defect-prone parts of largescale industrial software, in our experiments Windows Server 2003. This helps managers to allocate resources for quality assurance to those parts of a system that are expected to have most defects. The proposed measures on dependency graphs outperformed traditional complexity metrics. In addition, we found empirical evidence for a domino effect, i. e., depending on defect-prone binaries increases the chances of having defects. 1...|$|R

Two different OMt were used non polar Cloisite 15 A and polar Cloisite 30 B with a composition of 3 mass% {{as well as}} epoxy functionalized graphene (EFG) with different compositions (1, 3, 5 mass%). The morphology and thermal properties of OMt/PBAT, EFG/PBAT and OMt-EFG/PBAT nanocomposites were studied. A compatibilizing agent (PBATgMA) was elaborated by grafting maleic anhydride on PBAT chains. The effect of incorporation of this compatibilizer on the different nanofillers dispersion in PBAT matrix was studied. The structure of the nanofillers/PBAT nanocomposites was examined using X-ray diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> EFG with OMt allowed a better dispersion of these nanofillers and more intercalated structures were obtained. The rheological results showed an increase of the storage modulus G' in the different nanofillers/PBAT nanocomposites, particularly after the <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> OMt and EFG. The thermal properties evaluated by TGA were sensibly improved by the association of these nanofillers. From all these results, it can be speculated that a synergism phenomenon between graphene and OMt was produced in the PBAT matrix. However, this phenomenon was reduced after the addition of PBATgMA compatibilizer, probably because of repulsive interactions were produced between this compatibilizing agent and the epoxy functionalized graphene...|$|R

The ability of the peroxisome proliferator nafenopin to suppress or delay the onset of liver apoptosis was investigated using primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and the Reuber hepatoma cell line FaO. 50 microM nafenopin reversibly maintained the viability of primary rat hepatocyte cultures which otherwise degenerated within 8 d of establishment. The maintenance of viability of hepatocyte monolayers {{was associated with a}} significant {{decrease in the number of}} cells exhibiting chromatin condensation patterns typical of apoptosis. Apoptosis could be induced in hepatocytes by administration of 5 ng/ml TGF beta 1. <b>Co-addition</b> <b>of</b> 50 microM nafenopin significantly reduced TGF beta 1 -induced apoptosis by 50 - 60 %. TGF beta 1 (1 - 5 ng/ml) also induced apoptosis in the FaO rat hepatoma cell line. Cell death was accompanied by detachment of FaO cells from the monolayer and detached cells exhibited chromatin condensation and non-random DNA fragmentation patterns typical <b>of</b> apoptosis. <b>Co-addition</b> <b>of</b> 50 microM nafenopin to TGF beta 1 -treated FaO cultures significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells detaching from the monolayer at 24 h. In contrast, nafenopin had no significant effect on FaO apoptosis induced by the DNA damaging agents etoposide and hydroxyurea. We conclude that suppression of liver cell death by apoptosis may play a role in the hepatocarcinogenicity of the peroxisome proliferators, although the extent of this protection is dependent on the nature of the apoptotic stimulus...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study {{of the effect of}} cooling rate on the grain size of a range of grain refined wrought aluminum alloys was carried out under quiescent solidification conditions where nucleation occurs predominantly by a constitutional undercooling mechanism. Increasing the cooling rate reduced the grain size by increasing the number of particles that nucleate grains and by affecting the development of constitutional undercooling. Both effects are represented using simple analytical relationships.

40|$|To {{be able to}} {{determine}} the grain size obtained from the addition of a grain refining master alloy, the relationship between grain size (d), solute content (defined by the growth restriction factor Q), and the potency and number density <b>of</b> <b>nucleant</b> particles needs to be understood. A study was undertaken on aluminium alloys where additions of TiB 2 and Ti were made to eight wrought aluminum alloys covering a range of alloying elements and compositions.

From consideration of the experimental data and from further analysis of previously published data, it is shown that the coefficients a and b relate to characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>nucleant</b> particles added by a grain refiner. The term a is related to the maximum density of active TiB 2 nucleant particles within the melt, while b is related to their potency.

40|$|Recent work {{developed}} {{a model that}} predicts relative grain size changes due to the addition <b>of</b> <b>nucleant</b> particles and solute. The model predicts that when potent nucleant particles such as TiB(2) are present then the gain size is inversely proportional to solute content {{as defined by the}} growth restriction factor, Q. The predictions of the model have been confirmed by grain size data for seven wrought alloys. The results also indicate that there is a minimum grain size that can be achieved by the addition of solute. A further result arising from this work is the role of impurity boron in affecting the performance of grain refiners. At low solute titanium levels impurity boron can remain in excess after consuming the titanium as TiB(2). This excess appears to form less stable borides that decrease the potency <b>of</b> the <b>nucleant</b> particles. Once the amount of added titanium exceeds that required to consume all of the boron, the particles become effective refiners again. The implications of this research for casthouse practice and the possible effect of casting conditions on the validity of the model are discussed...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of heme precursors on the expression of CYP 1 A 2 and POR. Methods: The heme precursors [δ-Aminolaevulinic Acid (5 -ALA), Fe 3 + and hemin] were introduced into the system to evaluate their effects on the expression of CYP 1 A 2, POR and their co-expression. All the proteins were identified using immunoblotting, CO-difference spectroscopy, or cytochrome c assay. Results: In the present study, functional CYP 1 A 2 and POR were successfully {{expressed in the}} baculovirus/sf 9 system, and both of them showed high activities. <b>Co-addition</b> <b>of</b> 5 -ALA and Fe 3 + significantly improved expression of CYP 1 A 2 by about 50 % compared with the addition of 5 -ALA, Fe 3 + or hemin alone. Either <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> 5 -ALA and Fe 3 + or addition of 5 -ALA or Fe 3 + alone improved the POR expression level 2 fold and its activity 7 - 10 fold compared with control (no addition).

PBM were cocultured with or without different polyclonal B-cell activators: Pokeweed mitogen (PWM), Staphylococcal phage lysate (SPL) and Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC). Ferric citrate significantly inhibited PWM, SPL and SAC responses as well as Con A responses. Furthermore, PBM were separated into PBM depleted of monocytes, E-RFC (T-cell enriched) and non E-RFC (B-cell enriched), and each cell fraction was cultured with mitogens and ferric citrate. Mitogen responses of fractionated cells were inhibited by <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> ferric citrate {{in the same way as}} PBM.

Expression of the human cannabinoid CB 1 receptor in these cells from the inducible Flp-In T-REx locus did not alter expression levels of the mu {{opioid receptor}}. This allowed the cannabinoid CB 1 agonist WIN 55212 - 2 to stimulate ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation but resulted in a large reduction in the capacity of DAMGO to activate these kinases. Although lacking affinity for the mu opioid receptor, <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> SR 141716 A caused recovery {{of the effectiveness of}} DAMGO. In contrast <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> the CB 1 receptor neutral antagonist O- 2050 did not. Induction of the CB 1 receptor also resulted in an increase of basal [35 S]guanosine 5 ′- 3 -O-(thio) triphosphate (GTPγS) binding and thereby a greatly reduced capacity of DAMGO to further stimulate [35 S]GTPγS binding. CB 1 inverse agonists attenuated basal [35 S]GTPγS binding and restored the capacity of DAMGO to stimulate. Flp-In T-REx HEK 293 cells were generated, which express the human mu opioid receptor constitutively and harbor a modified D 163 N cannabinoid CB 1 receptor that lacks constitutive activity. Induction of expression of the modified cannabinoid CB 1 receptor did not limit DAMGO-mediated ERK 1 / 2 MAP kinase phosphorylation and did not allow SR 141716 A to enhance the function of DAMGO.

Both turkey P 2 Y 1 and human P 2 Y 2 MAPK activation was PKC dependant; inhibited by Ro 31 - 8220 and Go 6850, but not Go 6976 a calcium sensitive PKC isoform inhibitor. PKC isoforms (or) may be involved in this signalling pathway. Some experiments investigating Pyk 2 and Shc involvement in P 2 Y signalling are presented...|$|R
40|$|In Part I of this article, the {{literature}} underpinning both the nucleant and solute paradigms was explained, and {{the validity of}} the paradigm shift toward the solute paradigm, as a more complete understanding of grain refinement, was presented. In this Part II, experimental work is presented which confirms {{the validity of the}} solute paradigm. TiB 2 particle additions were found to refine the columnar zone of pure aluminum; however, an equiaxed structure was only observed when a small amount of titanium was added as solute. The potency <b>of</b> <b>nucleant</b> particles was confirmed by thermal analysis, which showed that additions of TiB 2 to pure aluminium removed the nucleation undercooling. Upon the addition of more TiB 2 particles and titanium as solute, the grain size continued to decrease until an apparent minimum grain size was achieved, past which little further refinement occurs. That the segregating ability of solute elements in general is essential for grain refinement, and not only that of titanium in particular, was confirmed by comparison of the Al- 2 Si and Al- 0. 05 Ti systems. Finally, a mechanism of grain refinement is presented that incorporates both nucleant particles and solute segregation as essential for effective,grain refinement. The solute is required to form a constitutionally undercooled zone in front of the growing solid/liquid interface to facilitate further nucleation on the substrates present. The potency <b>of</b> the <b>nucleants</b> dictates the probability of nucleation occurring for a given degree of constitutional undercooling...|$|R
40|$|A {{quick and}} {{effective}} sample preparation is demonstrated for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) analysis of nonpolar polymers. Polyisoprene, polystyrene, and polybutadiene polymers were investigated by using as matrix a 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid and silver nitrate combination. Silver cationized oligomers produce useful spectra {{that can be}} signal averaged to characterize polymer distributions extending up to 6000 u by using a 3 -T Fourier transform mass spectrometer. Because an electrostatic ion deceleration protocol was used to extend the mass range, trapping discrimination is shown to exist for molecular weight distributions broader than about 2500 u. However, an integral procedure {{can be used to}} reconstruct the true polymer profiles through <b>co-addition</b> <b>of</b> signal transients obtained by using various gated deceleration times. For polymers with narrower mass distributions, silver cationization along with signal averaging provides rapid and accurate polymer characterization for nonpolar polymer systems by using standard MALDI Fourier transform mass spectrometry instrumentation...|$|R
