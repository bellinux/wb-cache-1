This feat is achieved through dynamic soaring, a non-flapping flight strategy where propulsive energy is extracted from horizontal wind shears.

We analytically and numerically investigate the aerodynamically optimal flight trajectory for varying shear thicknesses. Contrary to current thinking, but consistent with GPS recordings of flying albatrosses, in thin shears the optimal trajectory is composed of small angle arcs. Essentially, the albatross is a flying sailboat, sequentially acting as sail and keel, and most efficient when remaining crosswind.

As a consequence of selection pressure, management in closed populations and historical bottlenecks, many dog breeds have experienced considerable inbreeding and show (on the basis of a pedigree approach) comparable diversity loss compared to other domestic species. This evolution is linked to breeding practices such as the overuse of popular sires or mating between related animals. The popular sire phenomenon is the most problematic breeding practice, since it has also led to the dissemination of a large number of inherited defects.
