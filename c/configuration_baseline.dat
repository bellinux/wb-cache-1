40|$|Sectors may combine or split within {{areas of}} {{specialization}} {{in response to}} changing traffic patterns. This method of managing capacity and controller workload could be made more flexible by dynamically modifying sector boundaries. Much {{work has been done}} on methods for dynamically creating new sector boundaries [1 - 5]. Many assessments of dynamic configuration methods assume the current day baseline configuration remains fixed [6 - 7]. A challenging question is how to select a dynamic <b>configuration</b> <b>baseline</b> to assess potential benefits of proposed dynamic configuration concepts. Bloem used operational sector reconfigurations as a baseline [8]. The main difficulty is that operational reconfiguration data is noisy. Reconfigurations often occur frequently to accommodate staff training or breaks, or to complete a more complicated reconfiguration through a rapid sequence of simpler reconfigurations. Gupta quantified a few aspects of airspace boundary changes from this data [9]. Most of these metrics are unique to sector combining operations and not applicable to more flexible dynamic configuration concepts. To better understand what sort of reconfigurations are acceptable or beneficial, more configuration change metrics should be developed and their distribution in current practice should be computed. This paper proposes a method to select a simple sequence of configurations among operational configurations to serve as a dynamic <b>configuration</b> <b>baseline</b> for future dynamic configuration concept assessments. New configuration change metrics are applied to the operational data to establish current day thresholds for these metrics. These thresholds are then corroborated, refined, or dismissed based on airspace practitioner feedback. The dynamic <b>configuration</b> <b>baseline</b> selection method uses a k-means clustering algorithm to select the sequence of configurations and trigger times from a given day of operational sector combination data. The clustering algorithm selects a simplified schedule containing k configurations based on stability score of the sector combinations among the raw operational configurations. In addition, the number of the selected configurations is determined based on balance between accuracy and assessment complexity...|$|E

While the traditional software product-line paradigm has proven successful in reducing stove-pipe development and the initial cost of deploying new members of the LT 2 family, there are inherent complexity challenges during maintenance and evolution due to baseline divergence of the reusable software components that have been downloaded and tailored for the different product configurations. With each new product team that creates a new baseline, the cost and effort grows exponentially for merging software features and patches from the products back into the core assets and then out to other members of the product-line, leading to high cost and unmanageable complexity. The Consolidated Product-line Management (CPM) construct incorporates a new Second Generation Software Product-line (2 G SPL) paradigm that breaks divergence, and enables an automated production-line process of generating one or more products in the LT 2 software product-line from a common set of core assets and feature profiles.

40|$|As the {{maturity}} of COSYSMO increases, users continue to identify {{areas in which}} the model can be improved. Recent emphasis {{has been placed on}} the clarification of counting rules for the COSYSMO size drivers. These drivers represent various attributes of the total size of the task of the systems engineering effort estimated by COSYSMO; in terms of person months. The intent of these rules is to ensure consistent interpretation and use of the size input parameters that include: requirements, interfaces, algorithms, and operational scenarios. Experience in applying these rules has exposed a limitation of the current version of the model; there was no way of including the affect of reusing system components in the calculation of systems engineering effort. This has resulted in inaccurate estimates of systems engineering effort for systems that incorporated significant reuse, {{as in the case of}} programs with a high degree of COTS integration. As a result, a method was needed to account for the fact that not all of the requirements that drive systems engineering effort are new. Specifically, some of the requirements for a new system may be “reused ” from a prior system. Further, some of the new system’s requirements may be “modified ” from a prior system. Moreover, the evolution of system requirements over the system life cycle may result in “deleted ” requirements from the initial <b>configuration</b> <b>baseline.</b> On the surface, the notion of reuse in COSYSMO may appear as a necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention activity but in reality it was an inevitable feature. One reason is that most software cost estimation models – especially COCOMO II – go into great detail in addressing aspects of software reuse. The other is that reuse is more prevalent among defense contractors that aim for higher productivity gains as they avoid pursuing designs from scratch. For these reasons, this paper provides (1) an approach for handling reuse in systems engineering in terms of the number of systems requirements in COSYSMO, (2) a discussion on the potential cost drivers that could be influenced by reuse, and (3) strategies in which this approach can be extended to include the three other size drivers in the model...|$|E
