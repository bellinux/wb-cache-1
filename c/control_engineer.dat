5|$|Ted Serong {{was born}} in the suburb of Abbotsford in Melbourne on 11 November 1915, the first child of William and Mabel Serong. His father was of Portuguese {{heritage}} from the island of Madeira; the family had first settled in Australia in 1824. An apprentice blacksmith, William had served in the Citizens Military Force (CMF) and later the First Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF) in France during the First World War, before specializing in the maintenance of weapons and engineering stores, and working for the Department of Defence as a quality <b>control</b> <b>engineer.</b> Serong's younger brother, Raymond, {{was born in}} 1917. William believed in physical fitness and discipline, and he taught both of his sons to box, as well as to scout, shoot rabbits, and live off the land. Between 1930 and 1932, during the Great Depression, the boys lived in the bush for extended periods, relying on their hunting skills to survive.|$|E

He attended F-86 gunnery school at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, followed by F-100 gunnery school at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. In April 1958, Armstrong {{was assigned to}} the 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in South Carolina. After three years flying F-100s, he attended the University of Michigan where he earned master's degrees in astronautical engineering and instrumentation engineering. In 1963, Armstrong was assigned to Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico where he served as a guidance and <b>control</b> <b>engineer.</b>|$|E

2500|$|... 30 July 1966: 60-6941 (Article 135), {{one of the}} two drone carriers, {{was lost}} during a test flight off the California coast. The pilot and launch <b>control</b> <b>{{engineer}}</b> ejected safely but the engineer drowned. Article 135 was operating 300 miles from the California coast to carry out a test launch of a D-21. The aircraft was flying at Mach 3.2+ when the crew made sure that the Marquardt engine on the D-21 had the required airflow. The drone was launched but the D-21 engine failed to start and it slammed down on the launch pylon causing the mother ship to pitch up. The pressure from the Mach-3.2 airflow [...] "ripped the fuselage forebody from the wing planform". The crew were unable to escape at this high speed but managed to eject as the forebody tumbled towards the sea. The pilot was picked up by helicopter from the sea but the LCO drowned.|$|E

Many practicing <b>control</b> <b>engineers</b> delve into the intricacies of one or more particular fields of mathematics. Consequently, many of the sections in this chapter on controls rely heavily on algebraic considerations or have algebraic roots. This chapter purports to provide a lively introduction for such investigations by discussing common algebraic topics that occur in control.
