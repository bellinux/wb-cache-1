40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> {{arbitrary}} dimensional tripartite quantum systems. An explicit operational lower bound <b>of</b> <b>concurrence</b> is obtained in terms <b>of</b> the <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> sub-states. A given example show that our lower bound may improve the well known existing lower bounds <b>of</b> <b>concurrence.</b> The significance <b>of</b> our result {{is to get}} a lower bound when we study the <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary dimensional multipartite quantum systems.

40|$|<b>Concurrence</b> <b>of</b> {{duties of}} a member of the Board of Directors and an {{employee}} within a joint-stock company The aim of this thesis is to describe a situation, where a member of the Board of Directors of a joint-stock company is simultaneously an employee of the same company (so called <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties) and to analyze problems arising from this situation. In this context it is important to show the differences between labour-law relationship and commercial-law relationship, as well as to look at <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties in the past. An amendment to the Commercial Code made performance of the business management in the framework of parallel labour-law relationship possible, but the recodification of Civil Law that shall come into effect as of January 1, 2014 does not take <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties into consideration. One of the most important parts of this thesis will be thus looking for an answer to the question, what the situation regarding <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties will be in the future. The second crucial problem, that this thesis is focused on, is issue <b>of</b> <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> the powers to act on behalf of the company, i. e. if a member of the Board of Directors is entitled to act even as a contractual or legal representative of a company. At the conclusion, the author reflects real advantage <b>of</b> <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> [...] ...|$|R
