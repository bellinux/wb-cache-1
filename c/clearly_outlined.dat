25|$|In {{addition}} to his role as an influential art critic prior {{to the creation of}} the Salon d'Automne, Jourdain was a member of the Decorative Arts jury at the Chicago World's Fair (1893), the Brussels International (1897) and the Paris Exposition Universelle (1900). Jourdain <b>clearly</b> <b>outlined</b> the dangers of following the academic path in his review of the 1889 Exposition, while pointing out the potentials in the art of engineers, aesthetics, the fusion with decorative arts and the need for social reform. He soon became well known as a staunch critic of traditionalism and a fervent proponent of Modernism, yet even for him, the Cubists had gone too far.|$|E
500|$|Origen's letters do not survive. However, most {{scholars}} {{believe that the}} letters that circulated {{in the era of}} Eusebius and Jerome were genuine. It is also reasonable that Origen, a man with close contacts in the Christian Arab community, would have taken a particular interest in the first Arab emperor. The scholar K. J. Neumann argued that, since Origen would have known the faith of the imperial couple, he must have written about it in the letters listed at 6.36.3. Since Eusebius read these letters, and does not mention that the emperor was Christian (Neumann understands the passage at 6.34 to reflect Eusebius' disbelief in Philip's Christianity), we must conclude that Philip was not Christian, and was neither baptized nor made catechumen. Against Neumann, Shahîd argues that, if Eusebius had found anything in the letters to disprove Philip's Christianity, he would have <b>clearly</b> <b>outlined</b> it in this passage—as the biographer of Constantine, it would have been in his interest to undermine any other claimants to the title [...] "first Christian emperor". Moreover, this segment of the Historia is a catalog of Origen's works and correspondence; the contents of the letters are irrelevant.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Slakan writer F. Plitplov, [...] "the plot of Vedontakal Vrop is so laughable {{that no one}} {{can fail}} to take a delight in its immense confusions."

The 'amphibious reconnaissance' doctrine <b>clearly</b> <b>outlined</b> that the recon Marines' duties consisted of scouting the littoral areas, or beachhead, and inland; to test the soil permeability for a possible beach landing; to clear any obstacles that may hinder an amphibious assault; and to observe any sign of enemy activity. The Navy UDT were tasked with providing the same, but from off the coastline to the littoral, or adjacent beach areas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{attendees}} of {{the inaugural}} meeting drafted a [...] "Declaration of Principles", which was primarily {{the work of}} Du Bois and Trotter. The philosophies of the group were in direct contrast to more conciliatory philosophies of Booker T. Washington that proposed patience over militancy. [...] The declaration <b>clearly</b> <b>outlined</b> the group's philosophy and its demands; politically, socially and economically. It began by first describing the progress that the [...] "Negro-Americans" [...] had made [...] "particularly the increase of intelligence, the buy-in of property, the checking of crime, the uplift in home life, the advance in literature and art, and the demonstration of constructive and executive ability {{in the conduct of}} great religious, economic and educational institutions". [...] It called for blacks to be granted manhood suffrage. It called for equal treatment for all American citizens alike. Very specifically, it demanded equal economic opportunities, in the rural districts of the South, which amounted for many blacks trapped in indentured servitude to [...] whites and resulted in [...] "virtual slavery", or in terms of all of south so that they had the ability to [...] "earn a decent living".|$|E
2500|$|One of Kahlo's {{earliest}} champions was Surrealist artist André Breton, {{who claimed}} her {{as part of}} the movement as an artist who had supposedly developed her style [...] "in total ignorance of the ideas that motivated the activities of my friends and myself". This was echoed by Bertram D. Wolfe, who wrote that Kahlo's was a [...] "sort of 'naïve' Surrealism, which she invented for herself". Although Breton regarded her as mostly a feminine force within the Surrealist movement, Kahlo brought postcolonial questions and themes to the forefront of her brand of Surrealism. Breton also described Kahlo's work as [...] "wonderfully situated at the point of intersection between the political (philosophical) line and the artistic line." [...] While she subsequently participated in Surrealist exhibitions, she stated that she [...] "detest Surrealism", which to her was [...] "bourgeois art" [...] and not [...] "true art that the people hope from the artist". Some art historians have disagreed whether her work should be classified as belonging to the movement at all. According to Andrea Kettenmann, Kahlo was a symbolist concerned more in portraying her inner experiences. Emma Dexter has argued that as Kahlo derived her mix of fantasy and reality mainly from Aztec mythology and Mexican culture instead of Surrealism, it is more appropriate to consider her paintings as having more in common with magical realism, also known as New Objectivity. It also combined reality and fantasy, and employed similar style to Kahlo's, such as flattened perspective, <b>clearly</b> <b>outlined</b> characters and bright colours.|$|E
