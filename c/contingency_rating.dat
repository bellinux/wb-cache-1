40|$|A {{consistent}} finding {{observed in}} many contingency learning experiments is that people’s {{estimation of the}} strength of a cause-effect relation is systematically biased by a number of variables, such as the relative frequencies of the cause and the effect. Some studies have found, however, that these latter biases are highly dependent on the procedure used to assess participants’ perception of the contingency: Specifically, these effects tend to occur more often when participants are requested a causal or <b>contingency</b> <b>rating</b> that when their contingency perception is inferred from their actual, trial-by-trial predictive behavior. This result has been taken as evidence for the higher complexity of the cognitive processes underlying causal or contingency judgments, relative to those involved in outcome prediction. Our experiments show, however, that the cue-density bias can be observed even when a predictive judgment is used as a dependent variable. This suggests that previous failures to observe biases with predictive trial-by-trial responses might not have been due to their predictive nature but to the specific response format and the moment in which these measures were collected (during training or after training) in those experiments. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A new {{schedule}} of reinforcement {{was used to}} maintain key-pecking by pigeons. The schedule reinforced only pecks terminating interresponse times which occurred least often relative to the exponential distribution of interresponse times to be expected from an ideal random generator. Two schedule parameters were varied: (1) the rate constant of the controlling exponential distribution and (2) {{the probability that a}} response would be reinforced, given that it met the interresponse-time <b>contingency.</b> Response <b>rate</b> changed quickly and markedly with changes in the rate constant; it changed only slightly with a fourfold change in the reinforcement probability. The schedule produced stable rates and high intra- and inter-subject reliability, yet interresponse time distributions were approximately exponential.

A negative (if CS—then no US) contingency resulted in suppressed responding during CS-off minutes, and rate increases during the CS. A no-contingency control procedure, during which CS and US were randomly related, almost totally suppressed responding throughout the session and showed no differential effects of the CS on response rate.

For the control group, pecks on the second key had no <b>contingency.</b> The <b>rate</b> of responding on the timeout key during extinction for the experimental group was higher than that of the control group during all sessions of discrimination training except the first.

There were more timeouts from extinction in Exp. I than from variable-interval 5 -min in Exp. II. Experiment III showed that not presenting the positive stimulus reduced the number of timeouts from the negative stimulus for the two birds from Exp.

These results suggest that in a multiple schedule, the stimulus correlated with extinction, or the lower response rate, functions as a conditioned aversive stimulus.

40|$|An observing {{procedure}} {{was used to}} investigate the effects of alterations in response–conditioned-reinforcer relations on observing. Pigeons responded to produce schedule-correlated stimuli paired with the availability of food or extinction. The contingency between observing responses and conditioned reinforcement was altered in three experiments. In Experiment 1, after a contingency was established in baseline between the observing response and conditioned reinforcement, it was removed and the schedule-correlated stimuli were presented independently of responding according to a variable-time schedule. The variable-time schedule was constructed such {{that the rate of}} stimulus presentations was yoked from baseline. The removal of the observing <b>contingency</b> reliably reduced <b>rates</b> of observing. In Experiment 2, resetting delays to conditioned reinforcement were imposed between observing responses and the schedule-correlated stimuli they produced. Delay values of 0, 0. 5, 1, 5, and 10  s were examined. Rates of observing varied inversely as a function of delay value. In Experiment 3, signaled and unsignaled resetting delays between observing responses and schedule-correlated stimuli were compared. Baseline rates of observing were decreased less by signaled delays than by unsignaled delays.

40|$|The role of {{dopamine}} {{in controlling}} behavior remains poorly understood. In {{this study we}} examined licking behavior in an established hyperdopaminergic mouse model—dopamine transporter knockout (DAT KO) mice. DAT KO mice showed higher rates of licking, {{which is due to}} increased perseveration of licking in a bout. By contrast, they showed increased individual lick durations, and reduced inter-lick-intervals. During extinction, both KO and control mice transiently increased variability in lick pattern generation while reducing licking rate, yet they showed very different behavioral patterns. Control mice gradually increased lick duration as well as variability. By contrast, DAT KO mice exhibited more immediate (within 10 licks) adjustments—an immediate increase in lick duration variability, as well as more rapid extinction. These results suggest that the level of dopamine can modulate the persistence and pattern generation of a highly stereotyped consummatory behavior like licking, as well as new learning in response to changes in environmental feedback. Increased dopamine in DAT KO mice not only increased perseveration of bouts and individual lick duration, but also increased the behavioral variability in response to the extinction <b>contingency</b> and the <b>rate</b> of extinction...|$|R
40|$|Two multiple-schedule {{experiments}} with pigeons examined {{the effect of}} adding food reinforcement from an alternative source on the resistance of the reinforced response (target response) to the decremental effects of satiation and extinction. In Experiment 1, key pecks were reinforced by food in two components according to variable-interval schedules and, in some conditions, food was delivered according to variable-time schedules in one of the components. The rate of key pecking in a component was negatively related to the proportion of reinforcers from the alternative (variable-time) source. Resistance to satiation and extinction, in contrast, was positively related to the overall rate of reinforcement in the component. Experiment 2 was conceptually similar except that the alternative reinforcers were contingent on a specific concurrent response. Again, the rate of the target response varied as a function of its relative reinforcement, but its resistance to satiation and extinction varied directly with the overall rate of reinforcement in the component stimulus regardless of its relative reinforcement. Together the results of the two experiments suggest that the relative reinforcement of a response (the operant <b>contingency)</b> determines its <b>rate,</b> whereas the stimulus-reinforcement contingency (a Pavlovian contingency) determines its resistance to change...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} effects of a negative (setback) response contingency on key pecking engendered by a changing light-intensity stimulus clock (ramp stimulus) signaling fixed-time 30 -s food deliveries. The response contingency specified that responses would immediately decrease the light-intensity value, and, because food was delivered only after the highest intensity value was presented, would delay food delivery by 1 s for each response. The first experiment examined the acquisition and maintenance of responding for a group trained with the contingency in effect and for a group trained on a response-independent schedule with the ramp stimulus prior to introduction of the contingency. The first group acquired low rates of key pecking, and, after considerable exposure to the <b>contingency,</b> those <b>rates</b> were reduced to low levels. The rates of responding for the second group were reduced very rapidly (within four to five trials) after introduction of the setback contingency. For both groups, rates of responding increased for all but 1 bird when the contingency was removed. A second experiment compared the separate effects of each part of the response contingency. One group was exposed only to the stimulus setback (stimulus only), and a second group was exposed only to the delay of the reinforcer (delay only). The stimulus-only group's rates of responding were immediately reduced to moderate levels, but for most of the birds, these rates recovered quickly when the contingency was removed. The delay-only groups's rates decreased after several trials, to very low levels, and recovery of responding took several sessions once the contingency was removed. The results suggest that (a) sign-tracking behavior elicited by an added clock stimulus may be reduced rapidly and persistently when a setback contingency is imposed, and (b) the success of the contingency is due both to response-dependent stimulus change and response-dependent alterations in the frequency of food delivery. The operation of the contingency is compared with the effects of secondary reinforcement and punishment procedures...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that behavioral variability can come under control of discriminative stimuli. The present experiment further examined discriminative control of variability in a novel way by using the discrimination-reversal paradigm. Eight pigeons responded under a multiple schedule of Vary and Yoke components signaled by different-colored keylights. In the Vary component, 4 -response sequences that differed from the previous 10 produced food, while in the Yoke component, any 4 -response sequence had a fixed probability of producing food, yoked to the prior Vary component. Following stability in this procedure, the key colors signaling the Vary and Yoke components were reversed across four successive conditions. Across the experiment, variability of keypeck sequences was higher in the Vary than in the Yoke component. Across successive reversals, the level of variability in the Vary component adapted more rapidly to the reversed <b>contingencies,</b> while the <b>rate</b> of adaptation in the Yoke component did not change systematically. These results are interpreted in terms of the different contingencies in the Vary and Yoke components. In addition, the improvement in the rate of adaptation across successive reversals in the Vary component appears consistent with a proactive interference account of discrimination-reversal performance. These results join others in suggesting that variability may be an operant dimension of behavior...|$|R

Scores on the Child Psychopathy Scale, Inventory of Callous and Unemotional Traits, <b>Contingency</b> Response <b>Rating</b> Scale and the Sensitivity to Reward Sensitivity to Punishment – Children Revised scale were used to evaluate 20 children, aged 7 - 13, recruited from FIU’s Center for Children and Families. The sample comprised 14 males and 6 females displaying a range of psychopathic traits measured by the CPS, with scores from 9 to 46 (M = 28. 45, SD = 10. 73). Sensitivity to punishment was examined using a behavioral task in which children endured various amounts of either white noise (type I punishment) or time-out from positive reinforcement (type II punishment) in order to gain access to a demonstrated reinforcer. The sample was stratified {{on the basis of the}} magnitude of psychopathy scores, and sensitivity to rewards and punishment were evaluated using a Behavioral Activation / Behavioral Inhibition framework by examining task performance: the frequency and duration of punishment conditions selected, electrodermal activity (skin conductance response), and parent-reported measures of child sensitivity to reward and punishment. Results indicated that the magnitude of CU traits was directly proportional to hyposensitivity to punishment and hypersensitivity to reward. Children with elevated levels of CU traits elected to endure a greater frequency and duration type I punishment in order to maintain continued access to the reinforcer. Significant differences were not found between high- and low-psychopathy children in the selection of type II punishment. The findings indicate that although there may be a hyporeactivity to type I punishment {{in children with}} CU traits, the use of a type II punishment by the removal of a positive stimulus has demonstrated treatment efficacy. The difference in sensitivity to rewards and the types of effective punishment in children with CU traits may affect reinforcement based learning, leading to the ineffectiveness of traditional methods informing the development of social responses...|$|R

Morphometric measurements, a differential diagnosis of all quantitatively detected deformation, and a qualitative evaluation for osteoporotic fractures were performed.

The methods yield differing results: prevalence rates vary between 13 % (Felsenberg 0. 75) and 34 % (Minne), kappa scores of quantitative methods compared with the qualitative one vary between 0. 43 (Minne) and 0. 86 (Melton), and the spatial distribution of vertebral deformations differs in the mid thoracic spine and lower lumbar spine. Between 9 % (Felsenberg 0. 75) and 69 % (Minne) of the quantitatively detected deformations could not be confirmed as osteoporotic fractures. They were classified as degenerative deformations, traumatic fractures, or no deformation could be confirmed at all. There is no perfect quantitative method to detect osteoporotic vertebral fractures. All quantitative methods lack specificity for osteoporotic fractures because detection of deformations is only based on vertebral height reduction which is not specific for osteoporotic fractures.

40|$|Background: Psychopathy has {{repeatedly}} {{been linked to}} disturbed associative learning from aversive events (i. e., threat conditioning). Optimal threat conditioning requires the generation of internal representations of stimulus-outcome <b>contingencies</b> and the <b>rate</b> with which these may change. Because mental representations are imperfect, {{there will always be}} uncertainty about the accuracy of representations in the brain (i. e., representational uncertainty). However, it remains unclear i) to what extent threat conditioning is susceptible to different types of uncertainty in representations about contingencies during the acquisition phase and ii) how representational uncertainty relates to psychopathic features. Methods: A computational model was applied to functional neuroimaging data to estimate uncertainty in representations of contingencies (CoUn) and the rate of change of contingencies (RUn), respectively, from brain activation during the acquisition phase of threat conditioning in 132 adolescents at risk of developing antisocial personality profiles. Next, the associations between these two types of representational uncertainty and psychopathy-related dimensions were examined. Results: The left and right amygdala activation were associated with CoUn, while the bilateral insula and the right amygdala were associated with RUn. Different patterns of relationships were found between psychopathic features and each type of uncertainty. Callous-unemotional traits and impulsive-irresponsible traits uniquely predicted increased CoUn, while only impulsive-irresponsible traits predicted increased RUn. Conclusions: The findings suggest that i) the insula and amygdala differ in how these regions are affected by different types of representational uncertainty during threat conditioning, and ii) CoUn and RUn have different patterns of relationships with psychopathy-related dimensions...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{evaluated the}} effects of superimposing the Estes-Skinner Conditioned Emotional Response (CER) procedure on one of two components of a multiple schedule. The question was whether CER conditioning occurred under contextual control. The procedure had four experimental phases: (1) baseline of operant responding under a two-component multiple schedule (mult VI 30 VI 30), one component correlated with the house light on and the other correlated with the house light off (light/dark components), (2) introduction of tone-shock pairings during the light component only, (3) return to baseline contingencies, and (4) reintroduction of the tone (but not shock) in the light component. Three Wistar rats showed robust suppression of responding in the light component, and the suppression also partially generalized to the dark component. The suppression was stronger during the pre-aversive stimulus than during the intervals immediately before and after its presentation. Responding partially recovered under baseline <b>contingencies,</b> but response <b>rates</b> remained lower in the light component than in the dark component. Thus, under the present experimental conditions, {{the context in which}} CER conditioning occurred (i. e., the house light-illuminated chamber) also produced conditioned suppression, and contextual control of suppressed responding generalized to another context, one that shared some but not all elements of the first context (i. e., the same chamber not illuminated by a house light). These results have direct implications for our understanding of emotional conditioning produced in the laboratory and for analysis of related phenomena addressed in the clinic...|$|R
