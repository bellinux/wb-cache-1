25|$|On 10 November, Apollo chased a xebec and then, <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a brig, chased and {{captured}} her. The brig was Resolution, a sloop of war, of 18 guns and 149 men, {{under the command}} of Don Francisco Darrichena. She was the former British navy cutter Resolution and had sailed from Vera Cruz three days earlier. After securing the prize, Apollo set out after the xebec, sighting her an hour after daybreak. Apollo finally captured the xebec Marte, of 75 tons, at three in the afternoon. She had been sailing from Vera Cruz for Havana. Apollo towed Resolution until 27 November, when she lost her mast. Resolution was in such an irreparable state Halkett destroyed her. Then on 7 December Apollo captured the schooner St Joseph, of 70 tons.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 February, Napoleon finally {{received}} conclusive reports that Blücher's army was advancing on Paris and had gained a 3-day head start. The French emperor ordered Marshal Jacques MacDonald to take command of the 42,000 troops opposing Schwarzenberg along the Aube River. MacDonald would have the II, VII and XI Corps and the II Cavalry, V Cavalry and VI Cavalry Corps. Napoleon took 35,000 troops and began marching northwest toward Sézanne and La Ferté-Gaucher in Blücher's wake. At nightfall on 27 February, Victor, the Imperial Guard and Napoleon were in Sézanne while Ney's infantry, the Imperial Guard cavalry and Roussel's cavalry were in Esternay, west of Sézanne. The cavalry of Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle and the infantry of Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova were <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Ney's left flank.|$|E
25|$|After Ayres's {{division}} {{had captured}} the return, Warren again went {{to search for}} Crawford. He found Crawford's division in good order {{on the east side}} of the Boisseau farm, facing west. Unfortunately for Warren, Sheridan asked for Warren at about this time and no one could say where he was. Sheridan then ordered Griffin to take command of the corps. Meanwhile, Warren ordered Crawford to wheel to the left and drive south against Five Forks because Warren perceived that the Confederates still held the crossroads because of artillery fire coming from that direction. Coulter's brigade led the attack on the left of Ford's Road with Kellogg's and Baxter's brigades and four of Bartlett's separated regiments <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the right. From woods on the south of the Boisseau farm, the Confederates fired steadily on the Union battle line. Three companies of the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment routed a patrol of Rosser's cavalry across Hatcher's Run before rejoining their regiment. Warren assigned the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment and the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment to watch the ford across Hatcher's Run.|$|E
25|$|Results of a {{genome study}} {{reported}} in 2014 suggest that tuberculosis is newer than previously thought. Scientists {{were able to}} recreate the genome of the bacteria from remains of 1,000-year-old skeletons in southern Peru. In dating the DNA, they found {{it was less than}} 6,000 years old. They also found it related most closely to a tuberculosis strain in seals, and have theorized that these animals were the mode of transmission from Africa to South America. The team from University of Tubingen believe that humans acquired the disease in Africa about 5,000 years ago. Their domesticated animals, such as goats and cows, contracted it from them. Seals acquired it when <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> African beaches for breeding, and carried it across the Atlantic. In addition, TB spread via humans on the trade routes of the Old World. Other researchers have argued there is other evidence that suggests the tuberculosis bacteria is older than 6,000 years. This TB strain found in Peru is different from that prevalent today in the Americas, which is more closely related to a later Eurasian strain likely brought by European colonists. However, this result is criticised by other experts from the field, for instance because there is evidence of the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 9000 year old skeletal remains.|$|E

25|$|Liquid {{reveals that}} he plans to destroy the Patriots' core AI with a nuclear strike using Metal Gear REX's railgun, and that he will {{substitute}} the core with his own to gain control. To facilitate his plan, Liquid needs a non ID-tagged nuclear warhead, which is to be recovered from the Shadow Moses facility, familiar to Snake from prior adventures. Snake, tormented by old memories, infiltrates Shadow Moses Island and reaches REX's hangar only to be ambushed by Vamp who has Naomi with him. Raiden assists Snake in battling Vamp and ultimately kills him. Naomi, revealing she is riddled with cancer and tormented by her mistakes, disables her nanomachines holding off the cancer and dies. Snake and Raiden use REX to head out of the hangar and battle Metal Gear RAY, piloted by Liquid. Upon his defeat, Liquid reveals Outer Haven, a modified version of Arsenal Gear ready to fulfill his launch plan. Raiden is severely injured during the attack while defending Snake. The , captained by Mei Ling, arrives and begins firing on Haven, causing it to retreat. Seizing the moment it surfaces to launch the nuke, Snake, Meryl, and Johnny board the ship via catapults. When Snake arrives at the core, he uses Otacon's robot to install a computer virus coded by Naomi and Sunny, that destroys the core AI and the Patriot system controlling the entire world, leaving the bare necessity for the modern civilization to survive. The destruction of the Patriots brings the war economy to a halt, counteracts the Patriots' upcoming civilian control scheme, and causes a mental breakdown for the enemy soldiers as their mind-control systems are disabled. Snake, after passing out in the core room, awakes atop Outer Haven's tower to find Liquid. Liquid reveals to Snake that his plan the whole time was to have Snake himself defeat the Patriots while Liquid draw their attention to himself. Liquid also reveals to Snake that Eva died because of the FOXDIE virus Snake is carrying. The two engage in a tough and emotional battle, with Snake <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> top. After telling Snake a few last words, Liquid dies from the Foxdie virus as well.|$|E

He was on the right-hand side of the road, with Michael Matthews <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> his left. In the final , Bouhanni drifted to the left and leaned into Matthews; the two riders nearly crashed. Bouhanni crossed the line first, with Matthews just beating Niccolò Bonifazio (Trek–Segafredo) for second place, but the result was changed shortly after the stage. Bouhanni was relegated to third place after the jury decided that he had driven the sprint dangerously, giving Matthews the stage victory and putting Bonifazio into second. Alexander Kristoff led the rest of the field home, one second behind. Marcel Kittel, one of the favourites for the stage victory, finished 65th.|$|E

500|$|American Pharoah faced a {{field of}} 10 horses, most of whom, {{including}} Keen Ice, he had previously defeated. [...] Espinoza had concerns at the starting gate when he noticed that his mount was already sweating, even though the weather was not particularly hot. [...] While the horse led {{for much of the}} race, he was hard-pressed throughout by Frosted, a change from Frosted's previous stalking style, attributed to a rider change less than an hour before the race, when Jose Lezcano replaced an injured Joel Rosario, altering the [...] "complexion" [...] of the race. [...] The unexpected tactics of Lezcano may have been decisive. Espinoza stated that he [...] "knew he was in trouble" [...] by the half-mile pole because American Pharoah did not pull away from his rival and lacked his usual energy. Frosted challenged American Pharoah for the lead at the far turn, and the horses bumped several times, but American Pharoah dug in and fought back when Frosted took a very brief lead. While American Pharoah fended off the challenge from Frosted, Keen Ice was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the outside, also under a new jockey, Javier Castellano. They overtook American Pharoah at the sixteenth pole, going on to defeat him by three-quarters of a length. Once again the Saratoga track lived up to its reputation.|$|E
500|$|Although the two fleets {{both had}} eight ships in their lines, the British had an {{advantage}} in firepower: the 90-gun [...] was the largest ship of either fleet (compared to the 84-gun Duc de Bourgogne), while the French fleet also included the recently captured 44-gun Romulus, the smallest vessel on either line. [...] When Arbuthnot spotted the French fleet to his northeast at 6 am on March 16, they were about [...] east-northeast of Cape Henry. [...] Arbuthnot came about, and Destouches ordered his ships to form a line of battle heading west, with the wind. [...] Between 8 and 9 am the winds began shifting, but visibility remained poor, and the two fleets manoeuvred for several hours, each seeking {{the advantage of the}} weather gage. [...] By 1 pm the wind had stabilised from the northeast, and Arbuthnot, with superior seamanship, was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the rear of the French line as both headed east-southeast, tacking against the wind. [...] Destouches, in order to escape this position, gave orders to wear ship in sequence, and brought his line around in front of the advancing British line. [...] With this manoeuvre he surrendered the weather gage (giving Arbuthnot the advantage in determining the attack), but it also positioned his ships relative to the wind such that he could open his lower gundecks in the heavy seas, which the British could not do without the risk of water washing onto the lower decks.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to literature, the episode spoofs the Ocean's Trilogy, a film series {{about a group}} of criminals that heist casinos. Selman revealed to Entertainment Weekly in January 2011 that the episode is essentially about [...] "Homer and some people in Springfield hav to perpetrate an Ocean's Eleven–style heist in the non-Ocean's Eleven world of children’s fantasy book publishing." [...] Throughout the episode as the story progresses, title cards with titles such as [...] "The Crew", [...] "The Setup", [...] "The Heist", and [...] "The Payday" [...] appear. During these title cards, which last for about three to four seconds each, a version of the song [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] by David Holmes is heard. This song was played for approximately three minutes during a scene in Ocean's Eleven. On his blog, The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma wrote that Selman wanted [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] to be played repeatedly throughout [...] "The Book Job" [...] because he erroneously thought that was how it was done in film. During the heist of TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, the screen splits in several ways, showing the different team members making their way to the printing room. According to Selman, [...] "the set-up and feel [...] is a real creative departure for us. It's sort of a heist movie where the heist is writing a book but when that kicks in, there's a giant stylistic leap. It's also a little sillier, a little more stylistic than most episodes. We're <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> 500 episodes, but really, {{this is the kind of}} episode a show would only do if hadn't already had a couple hundred episodes." [...] Cuban American actor Andy García, who appeared in the Ocean's Trilogy as casino owner Terry Benedict, guest starred in [...] "The Book Job" [...] as the book publishing executive. At the end of January 2011, the recording of his performance took place.|$|E
