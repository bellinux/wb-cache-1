2500|$|The {{retirement}} {{life of the}} wing spar of a transport category aeroplane type-certificated to the safe-life principle {{is based on a}} safety factor applied to data obtained from flight tests and information about properties of the spar material. [...] The life of 11,400 flights for the Viscount inner lower boom was based on safety factors of 3.5 for the ground-air-ground cycle and 5.0 for fatigue damage due to atmospheric gusts. These safety factors were typical for this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeroplane.</b> [...] A 50% reduction of mean time to failure does not adequately explain why the inner lower boom in VH-RMQ should have failed before reaching its {{retirement life}}. In anticipation that the atmospheric gust spectrum in Australia may be more severe on the Viscount than the spectrum in some other climatic zones the gust spectrum was measured during 14,000 Viscount flights in Australia before 1961. [...] The Department of Civil Aviation accepted the Viscount retirement lives as compatible with the atmospheric gust spectrum these aircraft would encounter during operations in Australia.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Microlight {{aircraft}} are increasingly becoming {{the most popular}} segment of private aviation. In the United Kingdom the majority (about 2500 of a total fleet of 3500) of these {{aircraft are}} of the weightshift class, also known as flexwings or trikes. This paper introduces the main issues involved {{in the design and}} operation of this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeroplane...</b>|$|E
40|$|The tumble mode is a {{pitching}} departure from controlled flight {{which leads to}} a pitch autorotation that is generally unrecoverable – resulting in vertical ground impact, usually preceded by in-flight breakup (the mechanism for which, surprisingly, can sometimes prevent loss of life). This was identified in work led by the British Microlight Aircraft Association beginning in 1997 as a response to a number of fatal accidents in Rogallo winged microlight aeroplanes, although the tumble is also known to occur to hang-gliders. This paper explains how this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeroplane</b> is controlled, and how it has been found that they can enter the tumble mode. The mechanism by which the tumble can be entered is described. This has led to work showing how flight testing can be used to establish and demonstrate resistance to tumble entry – particularly important with increasing number of very high performance flexwings. These flight tests will be explained, together with the significance of the results. Recent accident investigation work has also shown a new mechanism of tumble entry, through partial failure of the A-frame structure and the pitch-trimmer mechanism. Also described is a possible relevance to well known historical accidents to flying wing aeroplanes – specifically the YB- 49 and dH- 108, and discovered data on the characteristics of the BKB- 1 flying wing glider; are also described...|$|E
