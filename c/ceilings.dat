5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical <b>ceilings</b> (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square <b>ceilings.</b> Both types of <b>ceilings</b> originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square <b>ceilings,</b> the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the increase of floor impact sound caused by <b>ceiling</b> air space in test building. Firstly, the change in floor impact sound with and without <b>ceiling</b> air-space was measured. Noise reduction effect of perforated <b>ceiling</b> systems and glass wool at <b>ceiling</b> area was also investigated. It was expected that perforated <b>ceiling</b> systems could reduce air-spring effect in <b>ceiling</b> space. As a result, <b>ceiling</b> air space caused increasement of floor heavy-weight impact sound about 2 ~ 4 dB. On the other hands, perforated <b>ceiling</b> with sound-absorbing materials system could reduced heavy-weight floor impact sound by 3 dB...|$|R

40|$|The {{means for}} {{predicting}} <b>ceiling</b> jet temperature under an unconfined <b>ceiling</b> {{has been well}} established by the previous work under an unconfined <b>ceiling.</b> However, a room <b>ceiling</b> is usually enclosed by walls so a fire plume rises in a stratified environment {{in the event of}} room fire. Previous work under an unconfined <b>ceiling</b> will not be sufficient to predict the <b>ceiling</b> jet temperature in such a configuration. On the other hand, a two layer zone model is often used for predicting fire temperature in a stratified configuration but it only gives average condition in the upper layer, which is too crude to predict the near <b>ceiling</b> temperature to assess the actuation of <b>ceiling</b> mounted detectors and sprinklers. In this study, a formula for <b>ceiling</b> jet temperature in a two layer configuration was derived by combining previous work under an unconfined <b>ceiling,</b> upper layer temperature and layer interface height. The validity of the formula was examined by comparing the results of prediction and the experiments using the test fires prescribed in an ISO/TC 21 /SC 3 draft standard. The predicted <b>ceiling</b> temperatures generally exhibit satisfactory agreement with the measured temperatures...|$|R

5|$|On the interior, Strickland {{placed the}} grand {{staircase}} {{that connects the}} three levels immediately behind the portico in the central core of the structure. The floor system is composed of fired-clay jack arches supported on steel I-beams, a common feature of warehouses and other long-span structures. On the second floor, many of the larger rooms, which were used for coining and melting, contain <b>ceilings</b> with beautiful high arches supported by the walls and freestanding piers. The smaller rectangular rooms on the second level (and the basement), such as the former superintendent's office, also contain these arched <b>ceilings</b> with a single groin vault. The basement formerly contained the boilers inside a brick cage, but now contain museum exhibits devoted to the minting processes {{as well as the}} Coin Vault at the Mint, a coin shop.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} an exergy analysis on embedded pipes of radiant <b>ceiling</b> cooling system.

Under the different pipe spacing, depth and diameter, the exergy efficiency of radiant <b>ceiling,</b> refrigerating unit, pump and radiant <b>ceiling</b> cooling system and the surface temperature of radiant <b>ceiling</b> panel are compared and analyzed and the exergy loss coefficients of radiant <b>ceiling</b> panel, refrigerating unit and pump are calculated.

5000|$|Commercial or {{industrial}} <b>ceiling</b> {{fans are}} usually used in offices, factories or industries. Commercial <b>ceiling</b> fans {{are designed to}} be more cost effective and more energy efficient then other cooling alternatives. The industrial or commercial <b>ceiling</b> fans usually use three blades and operate with a high-speed motor. Some can be found with more than 3 blades though. These energy efficient <b>ceiling</b> fans usually push massive amounts of air compared to other <b>ceiling</b> fan types. In the 1980s, it was common to find metal-bladed industrial <b>ceiling</b> fans in American households, while industrial fans in household applications are still commonplace today in Middle-Eastern households.|$|R

40|$|Summary: This study {{examines}} {{the way of}} utilizing a <b>ceiling</b> fan for airflow control in a large air-conditioned room. Although it seems that CFD simulation is useful in predicting the airflow around a <b>ceiling</b> fan, modeling of a <b>ceiling</b> fan as a body of rotation is very complicated. Therefore, in this study, airflow of a <b>ceiling</b> fan is modeled as boundary conditions of air velocity data measured near the <b>ceiling</b> fan. In this paper, the measured airflow pattern around a <b>ceiling</b> fan is compared with the CFD simulation result using the airflow model of the <b>ceiling</b> fan, {{in order to examine}} the validity of the airflow model. The CFD result was in good agreement with the measurement result concerning the average of air velocity...|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} of the chapel is marked by quartered oak <b>ceilings,</b> bluestone floors, and five original Tiffany stained glass windows. The chancel contains an onyx altar and mosaic floor made of more than twenty colors of marble.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} original woodwork, sills, door frames, {{and interior}} doors, are all solid oak. The interior walls are 12inches thick and, either painted or covered with paneling. An open, double staircase leads {{from the first}} floor to {{the second and third}} floors and the center of the building houses an elevator which moves from the basement to the third floor. The interior floors are all white pine wood, though some of the floors have now been carpeted. First floor <b>ceilings</b> are 15feet high, with doors at a height of 12feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had the <b>ceilings</b> lowered to 10feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the way of}} {{utilizing}} a <b>ceiling</b> fan for airflow control in a large air-conditioned room was examined. Although it seems that CFD simulation is useful in predicting the airflow, modeling of a <b>ceiling</b> fan as a rotational body is very complicated. Therefore, the airflow by <b>ceiling</b> fan is modeled by fixing air velocity measured near the <b>ceiling</b> fan. In this paper, CFD simulation for airflow around the <b>ceiling</b> fan with standard k-ε model and Reynolds stress model was conducted. The calculation result of Reynolds stress model {{turned out to be}} in agreement with the measurement one. The calculation result of standard k-ε model was different from it, concerning the impinging region on the floor. Moreover, CFD simulation using this airflow model was conducted near the <b>ceiling.</b> In the limited situations where the <b>ceiling</b> fan was extremely close to the <b>ceiling,</b> this model might be hardly applicable...|$|R
