5|$|Delta drifted {{slowly and}} erratically southwards {{for several days}} before {{accelerating}} north-eastwards then eastwards towards the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> and north Africa. During this period, it twice approached hurricane strength, although it never achieved hurricane intensity. On November 28 it merged with a frontal system northwest of the Canaries and became a vigorous extratropical storm. It caused severe damage in the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> and claimed at least seven lives, including six who drowned while attempting to reach the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> by boat from Africa. El Dedo de Dios, or God's Finger, a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium and an important landmark for the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands,</b> was toppled during the storm. Delta also caused power outages, leaving some 200,000people without power and forcing airports to close down.|$|E
5|$|A. n. granti, {{described}} by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1890, {{is confined to}} Madeira and the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands.</b> It is small and dark.|$|E
25|$|Three endemic reptile {{species are}} found in the park: the <b>Canary</b> <b>Island</b> lizard (Gallotia galloti galloti), the <b>Canary</b> <b>Island</b> wall gecko (Tarentola delalandii), and the <b>Canary</b> <b>Island</b> skink (Chalcides viridanus viridanus).|$|R
50|$|Forests of <b>Canary</b> <b>Island</b> pine (Pinus canariensis) occur from 1000-2100 m, {{covering}} the middle {{slopes of the}} volcano, and having an alpine timberline 1000 m {{lower than that of}} continental mountains of similar latitude. At higher altitudes, the Las Cañadas caldera provides sufficient shelter for more fragile species such as the <b>Canary</b> <b>Island</b> cedar (Juniperus cedrus), and the <b>Canary</b> <b>Island</b> pine (Pinus canariensis) to grow.|$|R

Other mammals, such as the mouflon, the rabbit, the house mouse, the black rat, the feral cat, and the North African hedgehog, have all been {{introduced}} to the park.|$|R

5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands,</b> it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{were also}} shipped from {{south-western}} Asia to Spain, Italy, Turkey, France, <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands,</b> the Americas and Australia. Dromedaries were introduced into Spain in 1020 AD and to Sicily in 1059 AD. Camels were exported to the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> in 1405 during the European colonisation of the area, {{and are still}} extant there, especially in Lanzarote and {{to the south of}} Fuerteventura. Attempts to introduce dromedaries into the Caribbean, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil were made between the 17th and 19th centuries; some were imported to the western United States in the 1850s and some to Namibia in the early 1900s, but presently they exist in small numbers or are absent in these areas.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1940, Hitler {{considered}} the possibility of occupying the Portuguese Azores, Cape Verde and Madeira and the Spanish <b>Canary</b> <b>islands</b> to deny the British a staging ground for military actions against Nazi-controlled Europe. In September 1940, Hitler further raised the issue in a discussion with the Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano Súñer, offering now Spain to transfer one of the <b>Canary</b> <b>islands</b> to German usage {{for the price of}} French Morocco. Although Hitler's interest in the Atlantic islands must be understood from a framework imposed by the military situation of 1940, he ultimately had no plans of ever releasing these important naval bases from German control.|$|E

5|$|On Lanzarote a {{somewhat}} {{larger number of}} these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than three hundred and perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> which are usually assigned to the nominate subspecies have declined much, and here wanton destruction seems still to be significant. On Tenerife they seem relatively numerous {{but on the other}} islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to their assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland Spain, the western <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> population is not classified as threatened.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> were colonised in two waves. The {{first step}} was the {{occupation}} of Tenerife and La Gomera 1.9–2.3 million years ago, followed by a separate invasion of El Hierro and La Palma 1.3–1.8 mya.|$|E
