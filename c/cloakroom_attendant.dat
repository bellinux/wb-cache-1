60|$|The {{whole affair}} {{was a matter}} of seconds, yet Arnold dashed through the door to find Rosario a crumpled-up heap, the <b>cloakroom</b> <b>attendant</b> bending over him, and {{no one else in the}} vestibule. Then the people began to stream in--the hall porter, the lift man, some loiterers from the outer hall. The <b>cloakroom</b> <b>attendant</b> sprang to his feet. He seemed dazed.|$|E
5000|$|While {{still at}} Billy's, Strange and Egan joined Billy Currie and Midge Ure of Ultravox {{to form the}} band Visage. Before forming Culture Club, Boy George and Marilyn worked as <b>cloakroom</b> <b>attendants</b> at the Blitz. The video for David Bowie's 1980 UK number one single [...] "Ashes to Ashes" [...] {{included}} appearances by Strange with three other Blitz Kids and propelled the New Romantic movement into the mainstream.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} delay in the <b>cloakroom</b> while the <b>attendant</b> searched for Philip's hat, which had been {{temporarily}} misplaced. Honeybrook, who had followed the two men out of the room, fumbling {{for a moment in}} his locker and, coming over to Philip, dropped something into the latter's overcoat pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Great idea," [...] Holderness assented, turning {{towards the}} <b>cloakroom</b> <b>attendant.</b> [...] "Don't you {{remember}} my friend, James?" [...] he went on. [...] "He arrived about half-past one, and threw {{his coat and}} hat over to you." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{passed through}} the {{turnstile}} door and disappeared. Pamela made her adieux to Holderness and his sister, and then, recognising some acquaintances, turned back into the restaurant to speak to them. Fischer, who had just received his hat and cane from the <b>cloakroom</b> <b>attendant,</b> stood watching her.|$|E
6000|$|She never {{finished}} her sentence. From their table, which was nearest to the door, they were suddenly {{aware of a}} commotion of some sort going on just outside. Through the glass door Rosario was plainly visible, his sleekness ruffled, his white face distorted with terror. The hand of some unseen person was gripping him by the throat, bearing him backwards. There was a shout and they both saw the <b>cloakroom</b> <b>attendant</b> spring over his counter. Something glittered in the dim light--a flash of blue polished steel. There was a gleam in the air, a horrible cry, and Rosario collapsed upon the floor. Arnold, who was already on his feet and half-way to the door, caught one glimpse of the upstretched hand, and all his senses were thrilled with what he saw. Upon the little finger was a signet ring with a scarlet stone! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{extraordinary}} how the affair could have happened, almost unnoticed, {{in such a}} crowded place," [...] Arnold went on, feeling somehow that it was best for him to talk. [...] "There is nearly always a little stream of people coming in, or a telephone boy, or some one passing, but it happened that Mr. Rosario came in alone. He had just handed his silk hat to the <b>cloakroom</b> <b>attendant,</b> who had turned away with it, when {{the man who killed}} him slipped out from somewhere, caught him by the throat, and it was all over in a few seconds. The murderer seems to have kept his face entirely hidden. They do not appear to have found a single person who could identify him. I had a table quite close to the door, as you told me, and I really saw the blow struck. We rushed outside, but, though I don't believe we were more than a few seconds, there wasn't a soul in sight." ...|$|E

She was arrested several times for soliciting in the Greater Manchester area, and moved to London. Other arrests led to convictions for cannabis possession and shoplifting.

5000|$|Determined {{to become}} an entertainer, Cilla White gained a {{part-time}} job as a <b>cloakroom</b> <b>attendant</b> at Liverpool's Cavern Club, {{best known for its}} connection with the Beatles. Her impromptu performances impressed the Beatles and others. She was encouraged to begin singing by a Liverpool promoter, Sam Leach, who booked her first gig at the Casanova Club, on London Road, where she appeared as [...] "Swinging Cilla". She became a guest singer with the Merseybeat bands Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, Kingsize Taylor and the Dominoes and, later, with the Big Three. Meanwhile, she worked as a waitress at the Zodiac coffee lounge, where she later met her future husband Bobby Willis. She was featured {{in an article in the}} first edition of the local music newspaper Mersey Beat by the paper's publisher, Bill Harry, who mistakenly referred to her as Cilla Black, rather than her real surname, White. She then took the name Black as part of her stage name.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi party) {{took power}} and lost {{little time in}} {{establishing}} a one-party state in Germany. Membership of political parties (other than of the Nazi party) was banned which meant that political activities undertaken {{on behalf of the}} Communist Party became illegal. Richter nevertheless continued her political resistance work under the new regime. She helped to hide people whom state agencies wished to persecute, undertook courier work between Berlin and Prague and contributed material for illegal publications until April 1934, which was when she emigrated, initially to Prague and from there to the Soviet Union. Her partner, Hans G√ºnther, was by now already there and was working at the Communist Academy and as a writer. In Moscow Trude Richter was able to complete her post-doctoral dissertation and taught at the Moscow Pedagogical for modern languages. During {{the next couple of years}} she pursued her teaching career and produced at least one text-book for language teaching. On 3 November 1936 she took Soviet citizenship: the next day, on 4 November 1936, Richter and her partner Hans G√ºnther were both arrested and placed in pretrial detention. In the event there was to be no trial, but at the end of 1937 she was nevertheless sentenced to five years of detention in one of the Gulag Labor camps and a lifetime ban. She had, in fact, been expelled from the Communist Party in January 1937, a couple of months after her initial detention. Grounds for her sentencing were recorded as alleged Counter-revolutionary and Trotskyite activities. On 17 August 1938 she was transferred to the Kolyma concentration camp region in the eastern interior of the Soviet Union, first in the North East [...] "Ispravitel'no-trudovoj" [...] Rehabilitation Camp and then in the [...] "Teka" [...] "Ispravitel'no-trudovoj" [...] Dalstroy Rehabilitation Camp. Richter's partner Hans G√ºnther also found himself taken to the Kolyma region, but he died from Typhus on 10 November 1938 in a transit camp at Vladivostok. Trude Richter was released from her detention on 14 September 1946 but she would remain in the eastern part of the Soviet Union till 1953. Between 1946 and 1949 she was employed as a <b>cloakroom</b> <b>attendant</b> at the Gorki Theatre in Magadan where she was also able to help out with the stage sets and in the orchestra.|$|E
