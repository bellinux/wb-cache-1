2500|$|Understanding the biblically {{recorded}} {{sequence of}} events in Hezekiah's life as chronological or not {{is critical to the}} <b>contextual</b> <b>interpretation</b> of his reign. According to scholar Stephen L. Harris, chapter 20 of 2 Kings does not follow the events of chapters 18 and 19 (161). Rather, the Babylonian envoys precede the Assyrian invasion and siege. Chapter 20 would have been added during the exile, and Harris says it [...] "evidently took place before Sennacherib's invasion' when Hezekiah was [...] "trying to recruit Babylon as an ally against Assyria.' Consequently, [...] "Hezekiah ends his long reign impoverished and ruling over only a tiny scrap of his former domain.' Likewise, The Archaeological Study Bible says, [...] "The presence of these riches' that Hezekiah shows to the Babylonians [...] "indicates that this event took place before Hezekiah's payment of tribute to Sennacherib in 701 BC" [...] (564). Again, [...] "Though the king's illness and the subsequent Babylonian mission are described {{at the end of the}} accounts of his reign, they must have occurred before the war with Assyria. Thus, Isaiah's chastening of Hezekiah is due to his alliances made with other countries during the Assyrian conflict for insurance. To a reader who interprets the chapters chronologically, it would appear that Hezekiah ended his reign at a climax, but with a scholarly analysis, his end would contrarily be interpreted as a long fall from where he began.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{alternate}} <b>contextual</b> <b>interpretation</b> of this sonnet can {{be explained}} by Leslie Hotson. In the previous sonnet, 123, the speaker addresses time by stating [...] "Thy pyramids built up with newer might / To me are nothing novel". Shakespearean critic, Leslie Hotson, argues that the speaker in 123 is unimpressed by Time, which she claims to be a prince of Shakespeare's time. Hotson states that this prince is referred to in Sonnet 124 where [...] "This 'fortune's bastard', this victim of the 'time's hate', is... King Henri III of France". The atrocities that are described within Sonnet 124 parallel actions that King Henri III committed against his people as [...] "The first great 'accident' (line 5) or misfortune that befell [...] was Paris's famous Day of Barricades". Ultimately, Hotson argues that [...] "the blow of tralled discontent" [...] (Sonnet 124.7) was the speaker's reaction against a prince [...] "as strong as his love, Shakespeare calls to witness the English fools of the inviting time, who die 'for their religion', having lived to murder their Queen". This interpretation becomes one of praise for the speaker's queen, which is clearly an [...] "affirmation of the strength of his love voice... of every true-born Englishman in the preservation of his Queen from all the treacherous attempts on her life". Shakespeare allows this speaker to praise the Queen as reference to the numerous failed [...] "conspiracy and other plots of assassination" [...] that Queen Elizabeth successfully evaded; effectively making [...] "love untouched by assassins' attempts".|$|E

40|$|I present {{evidence}} that indefinite possessives display some peculiar semantic properties distinguishing them from {{other types of}} possessive DPs. In particular, indefinite possessives do not license <b>contextual</b> <b>interpretations,</b> which are instead available for the corresponding definite possessives and possessive partitives. This semantic asymmetry argues against existing theories according to which indefinite possessives are structurally equivalent to definite possessives (Kayne (1994)) or to possessive partitives (Barker (1998); Zamparelli (1998)). The unavailability of <b>contextual</b> <b>interpretations</b> for indefinite possessives is accounted for in Storto ([to appear]) {{in terms of the}} discourse semantics of these DPs: indefinite possessives cannot be interpreted as discourse-specific DPs. This semantic peculiarity is due to the interaction between their partitive structure and the indefiniteness of the nominal embedded under of. The implementation of this idea proposed in Storto ([to appear]), however, is not compatible with the “classic” formulation of the Partitive Constraint. I show that this proposal can be maintained under a reformulation of the Partitive Constraint along the lines of de Hoop (1997), and draw some conclusions on the structural complexity of indefinite possessives from a crosslinguistic perspective...|$|R

The fact that the woman in the video initially wanted to place her ring on the Bible, but ended up placing it in the blood pool suggests that Farmer is 'married' to her liberator (the Devil) and wishes to live her new life without any religious inhibitions.

5000|$|Vatican II's Constitution on Revelation {{opened the}} door to {{acceptance}} within the Church for much of the scholarly study of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures that had taken place since the 19th century. Developments within the Catholic Church can be traced through documents of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, which oversees scriptural interpretation as it pertains to Catholic teaching. Until Vatican II the decrees of this commission reflected the Counter-Reformation effort to preserve the tradition unchanged, lest errors arising during the Protestant Reformation enter into Catholic belief. Consequent on Vatican II, the Counter-Reformation mentality in the Catholic Church diminished and the ecumenical spirit of openness to what is good in modern studies was embraced. The Council Fathers reiterated what was dogmatic in the previous teaching of the Church, [...] "that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation." [...] This is the substance of what church dogma (infallible teaching) says. The Council document went on to show an openness to development of doctrine, since historically growth in understanding has led to more developed theologies - in this case of scriptural interpretation within the Church. The Council Fathers continued: However, since God speaks in Sacred Scripture through men in human fashion, [...] the interpreter of Sacred Scripture, in order to see clearly what God wanted to communicate to us, should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended, and what God wanted to manifest by means of their words. To search out the intention of the sacred writers, attention should be given, among other things, to [...] "literary forms" ... in accordance with the situation of his own time and culture. For the correct understanding of what the sacred author wanted to assert, due attention must be paid to the customary and characteristic styles of feeling, speaking and narrating which prevailed {{at the time of the}} sacred writer, and to the patterns men normally employed at that period in their everyday dealings with one another. But, since Holy Scripture must be read and interpreted in the sacred spirit in which it was written, no less serious attention must be given to the content and unity of the whole of Scripture if the meaning of the sacred texts is to be correctly worked out. The living tradition of the whole Church must be taken into account along with the harmony which exists between elements of the faith. It is the task of exegetes to work according to these rules toward a better understanding and explanation of the meaning of Sacred Scripture, so that through preparatory study the judgment of the Church may mature. In these words and in the ensuing decrees of the Biblical commission, the <b>contextual</b> <b>interpretation</b> of scripture was endorsed, as distinguished from the fundamentalist approach which would hold to the verbal accuracy of every verse of scripture. Catholics, however, remain free to interpret Scripture in any way that does not contradict Catholic dogma.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} grammar and {{semantics}} of verbs that describe separation events in Asante Twi (Akan), a Kwa (Niger-Congo) language spoken in Ghana. It adopts a constructionist approach {{combined with a}} 'monosemic bias' perspective in the analysis. It theoretical starting point is that <b>contextual</b> <b>interpretations</b> are derived from {{the interaction of the}} prototypical meanings of verbs and their arguments. A multi-method approach was used in data gathering: (i) compilation of verbs that code separation as well as sentences in which they are used from literary texts (bibles, and novels) and dictionaries. (ii) Descriptions of separation activities elicited using video-stimuli Bohnemeyer et al. (2001), 61 video clips depicting cutting and breaking events (fieldmanuals. mpi. nl) supplemented by 82 clips created by the author involving culturally appropriate objects (Agyepong 2015). (iii) Spontaneous narratives, and procedural discourses about cultural events/practices involving separation e. g. cooking, palm-wine tapping. (iv) Introspection based on the author's native speaker intuitions. The main findings of the thesis are that there are two central verbs in the separation domain in Akan: twá 'to cut' and bú 'to break'. There are, in addition, more specialized verbs for specific types of object separation, e. g. nú 'harvest palm fruit by poking with a bladed instrument' or pòrò 'to pluck fruit'. The choice of a particular verb in context is determined by the following parameters: instrument involvement, manner of separation, physical properties of entities as well as the end-state result of the situation. Crucially, the thesis further addresses the challenge of how to account for the interpretation of the typical as well as atypical argument realization patterns associated with the separation verbs. It shows how constructional meanings contribute to the interpretation of collocations of the verbs. Other principles such as coercion, addition and suppression of components in the lexical semantics of both the verbs and its arguments as well as cultural implicatures are invoked in the compositional process of calculating the <b>contextual</b> <b>interpretations...</b>|$|R

This paper proposes an integrative conceptual framework composed of two key contextualized components: well-being and social justice. Well-being, according to Lindenberg, is the ultimate goal of life and is achieved by relevant themes organized in a hierarchical system. Social justice relating to the equal distribution of resources, opportunities, and rights is also significant for the achievement of well-being.

The term jihad as related to any exertion of power has been used by Muslim leaders to justify wars.

Linked to the logically possible cases problem, and thus also of interest in the present thesis, is the relata problem, the problem of what are the things that the relation of logical consequence relates.

40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} ontologies raises {{the need to}} establish relationships and make inferences across heterogeneous knowledge models. The approach proposed and supported by knowledge representation standards consists in establishing formal symbolic descriptions of a conceptualisation, which, it has been argued, lack grounding and are not expressive enough to allow to identify relations across separate ontologies. Ontology mapping approaches address this issue by exploiting structural or linguistic similarities between symbolic entities, which is costly, error-prone, {{and in most cases}} lack cognitive soundness. We argue that knowledge representation paradigms should have a better support for similarity and propose two distinct approaches to achieve it. We first present a representational approach which allows to ground symbolic ontologies by using Conceptual Spaces (CS), allowing for automated computation of similarities between instances across ontologies. An alternative approach is presented, which considers symbolic entities as <b>contextual</b> <b>interpretations</b> of processes in spacetime or Differences. By becoming a process of interpretation, symbols acquire the same status as other processes in the world and can be described (tagged) as well, which allows the bottom-up production of meaning. ...|$|R
