40|$|This article {{examines}} the job prospects of displaced industrial workers in Switzerland. Based on a survey of 1, 203 workers who were dismissed after their manufacturing plants closed down, we analyse the determinants of re-employment, the sector of re-employment and the change in wages. Two years after displacement, a majority of workers were back in employment: 69 % were re-employed, 17 % un-employed and 11 % retired. Amongst re-employed workers, two thirds found a job in manufacturing and one third in services. Contrary to a common belief, low-end services are not the <b>collecting</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>of</b> redundant industrial workers. Displaced workers aged 55 and older seem particularly vulnerable after a plant closes down: over 30 % were long-term unemployed, and those older workers who found a new job suffered disproportionate wage losses. Advanced age-and not low education-appears as the primary handicap after mass redundancy...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Lymph is {{the minute}} net volume of contending {{hydrostatic}} and osmotic capillary forces. It is built up extravasculary in tissues and reaches the intravasal space by definite lymph <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels,</b> which enter the venous System at the angulus venosus {{at the root}} of the neck. Sampling methods for lymph from individual tissues or from lymph <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> man and various animals afe cited and the preparation of lymph for enzymatic analysis is described. The extracellular distribution and transport of enzymes is important for diag-nostic enzymology, because enzymes released from cells in continuous physiological processes, or after injury to the tissue, reach the intravasal space mainly via the lymphatics. This is evident from the high lymph-plasma ratios of diagnostically important enzymes. The type of enzyme transport (lymphatic or by direct interstitial-venous entry) depends on the heterogeneity of the capillary barrier characteristic of the different organs. The permeability is extremely high in liver, i. e. enzymes in hepatic lymph originale mainly from blood, which they have reached through the large openings in the sinusoidal endothelial lining; in contrast the permeability is extremely low in skeletal muscle, where lymphatic transport therefore predominates. The phenömenon of increased enzyme activities in plasma after physical exertion is explained by alterations of lymph flow.

40|$|The splenic sinuses are {{the first}} <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> the spleen. They follow a tortuous course, ramifying {{extensively}} in the red pulp.

They are thin-walled structures consisting only of endothelial cells and a delicate supporting connective tissue, the reticulum. Sinal endothelial cells are reticular cells flattened to endothelial form and, as such, represent a portion of the reticulo-endothelial system. They are relatively undifferentiated cells, differing from common endothellum in being phagocytic and, at least under certain conditions, hematopoietic. It is a matter of dispute whether the normal sinal wall is anatomically closed or open. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the endothelium of the splenic sinuses is anatomically continuous with that of the terminal arterial branches or whether these arterial endings open upon the red pulp.

However, the effects of obesity on lymphatic function have been poorly studied. We investigated if and how adipose tissue accumulation influences lymphatic function. Using a lymphatic specific tracer, we performed in vivo near-infrared (NIR) imaging to assess the function <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> lymphatic <b>vessels</b> in mice fed normal chow or high-fat diet (HFD).

40|$|AbstractWe {{previously}} identified apoptosis stimulating protein of p 53 (Aspp 1) as an endothelial-specific gene {{functioning in}} mouse embryogenesis. To investigate the in vivo role of Aspp 1, we generated Aspp 1 knockout mice by targeted disruption. Aspp 1 −/− embryos showed subcutaneous edema and disorganized lymphatic vasculature. Morphological changes in lymphatic endothelial cells and isolated lymphatic islands were detected in Aspp 1 −/− embryos. Lymphangiography by injecting dye subcutaneously into the embryonic forelimb showed defective lymphatic drainage function and obstruction in <b>collecting</b> lymphatic <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> Aspp 1 −/− embryos. Interestingly, Aspp 1 −/− adult mice resolved these lymphatic functional defects seen during embryogenesis, but lymphangiography in Aspp 1 −/− adult mice revealed abnormal patterns in <b>collecting</b> lymphatic <b>vessels.</b> Since Aspp proteins reportedly enhance apoptotic activity of p 53, we asked whether p 53 deficiency also affected lymphatic <b>vessel</b> development.

40|$|International audienceLymphatic <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> direct lymph {{into and}} from lymph nodes (LNs) and can become hyperpermeable {{as the result}} of a {{previous}} infection. Enhanced permeability has been implicated in compromised immunity due to reduced flow of lymph and immune cells to LNs, which are the primary site of antigen presentation to T cells. Presently, very little is known about the molecular signals that affect lymphatic <b>collecting</b> <b>vessel</b> permeability. Here, we have shown that lymphatic <b>collecting</b> <b>vessel</b> permeability is controlled by CCR 7 and that the chronic hyperpermeability <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> observed in Ccr 7 –/– mice is followed by <b>vessel</b> fibrosis. Reexpression <b>of</b> CCR 7 in DCs, however, was sufficient to reverse the development of such fibrosis. IFN regulatory factor 4 –positive (IRF 4 +) DCs constitutively interacted with collecting lymphatics, and selective ablation of this DC subset in Cd 11 c-Cre Irf 4 fl/fl mice also rendered lymphatic <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> hyperpermeable and fibrotic.

40|$|Envenomations by snakes of {{the family}} Viperidae (pit vipers) induce severe {{pathological}} alterations {{at the site of}} venom injection, such as edema, necrosis, hemorrhage, and blistering, which may lead to permanent tissue damage and disability. Edema is a prominent and common manifestation in these envenomations. The effect of viperid snake venoms in lymphatic vessels has not been previously investigated. This study analyzed the effect of the venom of Bothrops asper, the most important venomous snake in Central America, on the <b>collecting</b> lymphatic <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> the mouse mesentery. The venom induced a rapid reduction in the lumen of these lymphatics, associated with a halting in the flow of lymph. These effects were reproduced by a myotoxic phospholipase A 2 homologue isolated from this venom, but not by a hemorrhagic metalloproteinase nor by a coagulant serine proteinase. B. asper venom, and the purified myotoxin, were cytotoxic for smooth muscle cells in culture, thus suggesting that the alterations observed in lymphatics are due to the effect on smooth muscle cells <b>of</b> the lymphatic <b>vessel</b> wall.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} tests {{two methods}} {{to obtain information}} of the distribution and movement of cetaceans. The first method uses <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> opportunity as platforms to conduct acoustic surveys between the main Hawaiian Islands, with {{the ultimate goal of}} providing a method {{that can be used in}} future studies to contribute to mapping distribution and habitat modeling of data-poor cetacean species in the areas of the ocean which are infrequently surveyed. The distribution of a well-studied species, the humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae was mapped and analyzed in relation to remotely sensed data on ocean depth, sea surface temperature, sea surface height, wind speed, chlorophyll-A, and surface currents. The results agreed with previous research on humpback whales, indicating that acoustic surveys from <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> opportunity are a viable method for collecting distribution data on cetaceans. The predicted species of odontocete whistles <b>collected</b> during <b>vessel</b> <b>of</b> opportunity surveys was determined using the Real-time Odontocete Call Classification Algorithm, and analyzed in respect to remotely sensed data. The sighting rate for odontocete surveys in this study is comparable to that of previous survey methods, and cryptic species are identified at a higher relative rate than when using visual sighting methods. The biases inherent in concentrating survey effort primarily in the calm waters on the leeward sides the Hawaiian Islands are discussed, as well as the drawbacks of relying on visual sighting methods for detecting species with low visual detection probability. In addition, the potential impacts of anthropogenic noise and ship strikes from commercial vessels are discussed during the case study of a high-speed craft. This dissertation also discusses a second methodology involving the use of DIFAR sonobuoys to track multiple singing humpback whales, with the end goal of learning more about the function about humpback song.

Fragments of the atria, ventricles and fat surrounding the major coronary branches were obtained from hearts of dilated cardiomyopathy patients. Serial semithin sections were observed under light microscopy and used for tridimensional reconstructions. Ultrathin sections were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Precollectors, the initial lymphatic outflow routes of the heart, are small valved vessels with irregular, discontinuous musculature. They originate in the subepicardial region from a network of epicardial, and from scattered myocardial absorbing lymphatic vessels and drain into the <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> accompanying the major coronary branches. <b>Collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> are larger but structurally similar to precollectors.

These anomalies are indicative of a contamination of the sample. By examining hydrographic data, reports and recent experience in collectionand storage in sea water, we can attribute these large errors to unclean buckets where salt crystals dissolve into the sample and to breathing of the samples during the storage. Each of these stages contributes in estimating a too large salinity and adds to the scatter of the measurements. (D'après résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTie 1 is a {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} with broad expression in embryonic endothelium. Reduction of Tie 1 levels in mouse embryos with a hypomorphic Tie 1 allele resulted in abnormal lymphatic patterning and architecture, decreased lymphatic draining efficiency, and ultimately, embryonic demise. Here we report that Tie 1 is present uniformly throughout the lymphatics and from late embryonic/early postnatal stages, becomes more restricted to lymphatic valve regions. To investigate later events of lymphatic development, we employed Cre-loxP recombination utilizing a floxed Tie 1 allele and an Nfatc 1 Cre line, to provide loxP excision predominantly in lymphatic endothelium and developing valves. Interestingly, unlike the early prenatal defects previously described by ubiquitous endothelial deletion, excision of Tie 1 with Nfatc 1 Cre resulted in abnormal lymphatic defects in postnatal mice and was characterized by agenesis of lymphatic valves and a deficiency <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> lymphatic <b>vessels.</b> Attenuation <b>of</b> Tie 1 signaling in lymphatic endothelium prevented initiation of lymphatic valve specification by Prox 1 high expression lymphatic endothelial cells {{that is associated with}} the onset of turbulent flow in the lymphatic circulation.

40|$|SummaryTo induce {{adaptive}} immunity, dendritic cells (DCs) migrate through afferent lymphatic vessels (LVs) to draining {{lymph nodes}} (dLNs). This process occurs in several consecutive steps. Upon entry into lymphatic capillaries, DCs first actively crawl into downstream <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels.</b> From there, they are next passively and rapidly {{transported to the}} dLN by lymph flow. Here, we describe a role for the chemokine CCL 21 in intralymphatic DC crawling. Performing time-lapse imaging in murine skin, we found that blockade of CCL 21 —but not the absence of lymph flow—completely abolished DC migration from capillaries toward <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> and reduced the ability of intralymphatic DCs to emigrate from skin. Moreover, we found that in vitro low laminar flow established a CCL 21 gradient along lymphatic endothelial monolayers, thereby inducing downstream-directed DC migration.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about the {{morphology}} of precollectors, the lymphatic vessels connecting the absorbing and the <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels,</b> which are regarded as the initial drainage routes of lymph. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the structural features of human precollectors. METHODS: Samples of fat from around the saphenous veins were obtained from patients undergoing varicotomy, and serial sections were observed under light and transmission electron microscopy. Tridimensional reconstructions were also obtained by computer analysis. RESULTS: Precollectors were characterized by an irregular and discontinuous arrangement of smooth muscle cells in their wall. This arrangement was unrelated to the site of valves. When present, muscular elements were arranged helicoidally, as shown in tridimensional reconstructions. Under transmission electron microscopy, the endothelium of precollectors was similar to that <b>of</b> absorbing lymphatic <b>vessels,</b> irrespective <b>of</b> the presence of smooth muscle cells, and was thin, rich in pinocytotic vesicles, supported by a discontinous basal lamina, and connected by anchoring filaments to the surrounding connective tissue. Myoendothelial contacts were frequent. Valves were similar to those <b>of</b> <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels,</b> except for the presence of numerous zonulae adherentes connecting the characteristic "tip cells" of the free edge. CONCLUSIONS: Human thigh precollectors are characterized by the alternation of portions with a well-developed muscular coat and portions with an absorbing structure. These morphological features suggest that the precollectors contribute to fluid absorption and lymph propulsion.

40|$|RATIONALE: Lymphatic {{vasculature}} plays {{important roles}} in tissue fluid homeostasis maintenance and in the pathology of human diseases. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that control lymphatic vessel maturation remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the gene expression profiles of ex vivo isolated lymphatic endothelial cells to identify novel lymphatic vessel expressed genes and we investigated the role of semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A) and neuropilin- 1 (Nrp- 1) in lymphatic vessel maturation and function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lymphatic and blood vascular endothelial cells from mouse intestine were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and transcriptional profiling was performed. We found that the axonal guidance molecules Sema 3 A and Sema 3 D were highly expressed by lymphatic vessels. Importantly, {{we found that the}} semaphorin receptor Nrp- 1 is expressed on the perivascular cells <b>of</b> the <b>collecting</b> lymphatic <b>vessels.</b> Treatment <b>of</b> mice in utero (E 12. 5 -E 16. 5) with an antibody that blocks Sema 3 A binding to Nrp- 1 but not with an antibody that blocks VEGF-A binding to Nrp- 1 resulted in a complex phenotype <b>of</b> impaired lymphatic <b>vessel</b> function, enhanced perivascular cell coverage, and abnormal lymphatic vessel and valve morphology.

A nitric oxide donor cream (GTNO) was applied to the tail. Additionally, two different NIR dyes, indocyanine green (ICG) and LI-COR IRDye 800 CW PEG, were utilized for function imaging at the time of initial injection and at 1, 2, and 4 week follow-up time points after which both draining lymph nodes were harvested. Results and Discussion: Significant differences were found between the two <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> such that the vessel first showing fluorescence (dominant) produced enhanced functional metrics compared to the second vessel (non-dominant). GTNO significantly reduced lymphatic function in the non-dominant vessel compared to the dominant. ICG remained visible in the tail for 2 weeks after injection and was accompanied by significant losses in lymphatic function and enlarged draining lymph nodes. The Licor tracer also remained visible for 2 weeks. However, the dye produced significantly lower effects on lymphatic function than ICG, and lymph nodes were not enlarged at any time point, suggesting that this may be a more appropriate contrast agent for longitudinal lymphatic imaging...|$|R
