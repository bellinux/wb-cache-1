Armored scale resistance is found on an estimated 40 % of 163, 000 acres of citrus in the San Joaquin Valley. Citrus growers have responded by either increasing their use of natural enemies, especially the parasitoid wasp Aphytis melinus, or by applying newly registered insect growth regulator or neonicotinoid insecticides.

40|$|Loneliness or {{subjective}} {{social isolation}} {{has been described}} as characterizing cases in which a person feels a disagreeable or unacceptable lack of meaningful social relationships, both quantitative and qualitative. This study aimed to develop a scale that measured not only general loneliness, but also two dimensions of it, social and emotional, and to see which factors influences it, adapting two measures: The UCLA, second version (University of Loneliness <b>California</b> <b>Scales,</b> Russell et al, 1980) and the De Jong-Gierveld Loneliness Scales (De Jong-Girveld & Kamphuis, 1985). A questionnaire was constructed that included 18 items on loneliness, a measure of depression and one of social isolation. Participants were 199 subjects, 112 females, 86 males. Factorial analyses confirmed the existence of a general loneliness dimension, and of its two components, social and emotional. The results showed the importance of a social relationship net and of the presence of emotional problems (e. g [...] , depression) in the perception of loneliness; age and profession were instead secondary factors. Further analyses are currently being performed on a sample of 9540 subjects of all regions of Italy and several age groups who took the test on-line...|$|R

Marketing outlets, ethnicity and primary information sources also influenced the extent of reliance on beneficial insects.

40|$|A {{physical}} {{refuge from}} the parasitoid, Aphytis melinus, is provided to the <b>California</b> red <b>scale,</b> Aonidiella aurantii, by the interior bark substrates of citrus trees, even though scale have lower fitness on bark {{in the absence of}} A. melinus. How bark-reared scale escape parasitism was unclear because A. melinus searches the interior of trees as effectively as the exterior. Host identification in A. melinus is mediated by a kairomone, O-caffeoyltyrosine, in scale covers. O-caffeoyltyrosine concentration varies with scale age and rearing conditions. We hypothesized that the reduced acceptance of bark-reared scale may be due, in part, to reduced quantities of O-caffeoyltyrosine in their covers. We reared scales on bark, leaves, and fruit of lemon and orange trees in the field at monthly intervals then collected the scales and measured them. We bioassayed covers for their acceptability to A. melinus in the laboratory then determined their O-caffeoyltyrosine content. Even after adjusting for the differences in scale body size, O-caffeoyltyrosine content in bark-reared scale covers was 45 – 85 % less than that in covers of leaf- or fruit-reared scales, depending upon cultivar and rearing date. Covers of bark-reared scales were selected for probing only 40 – 45 % of the time when compared to leaf-reared scales. Covers with the relatively highest levels of O-caffeoyltyrosine were most likely to be selected for probing. We conclude that part of the mechanism by which <b>California</b> red <b>scale</b> on bark avoids discovery is through reduced O-caffeoyltyrosine content in their covers. This reduction is probably a consequence of the reduced nutritional quality of bark as a substrate for scale survival and growt...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between religious orientation and prejudice. This relationship is not much clear but earlier studies suggested {{that there has been}} a negative relationship between intrinsic religious orientation and prejudice towards out-groups and a positive relationship between extrinsic religious orientation and prejudice towards out-groups. Sample group is composed of university students. They were asked to complete The Religious Orientation Scale–ROS, Prejudice <b>Scale</b> (<b>California</b> F <b>Scale,</b> Form 40 - 45) and also a Personal Information Form. According to the findings there is a significant relationship between sex and department that the students are in while a similar relationship is observed between the department and intrinsic religious orientation. In addition, a relationship between intrinsic religious orientation and extrinsic religious orientation is significant. Furthermore Divinity Faculty students are not differentiated from the others in respect to extrinsic religious orientation while they have much higher scores than the others as regards to intrinsic religious orientation. Main effects of sex variable and the interaction effects of department and sex are not significant on religious orientations in statistical terms. Intrinsic religious orientation has a positive effect in predicting strict conformity to rules as sub-dimension of prejudice while it has a negative effect in predicting the disbelief to human agency. On the other hand, extrinsic religious orientation is found to be as a positive predictor of strict conformity to rules and disbelief to human agency. The variables of sex and department contributed to predict only disbelief to human agency...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to inves­tigate the {{reliability}} and validity of the Southern <b>California</b> Ordinal <b>Scales</b> of Development (SCOSD).

Results found that the SCOSD alpha internal consistency coefficients ranged from. 94 to. 98; percent agreement between raters ranged from 85 % to 100 %; and inter­ rater correlations ranged from. 96 to. 99. Strong intercorrelations were found between the SCOSD and standardized domain-specific instruments (. 65 to. 92), providing evidence of concurrent validity. The secondary purpose was to investigate patterns of development across domains of the children's functioning. As expected, results revealed a hierarchy of skill development, with the children showing relatively less development in gross-motor skills and practical abilities...|$|R

In order to circumvent this issue, parasitoids emerging from four armored scale species were characterized through DNA barcoding.

5000|$|In 1935, Charles Richter and Beno Gutenberg {{developed}} the local magnitude (...) scale (popularly {{known as the}} Richter scale) {{with the goal of}} quantifying medium-sized earthquakes (between magnitude 3.0 and 7.0) in Southern <b>California.</b> This <b>scale</b> was based on the ground motion measured by a particular type of seismometer (a Wood-Anderson seismograph) at a distance of 100 km from the earthquake's epicenter. Because of this, there is an upper limit on the highest measurable magnitude, and all large earthquakes will tend to have a local magnitude of around 7. Further, the magnitude becomes unreliable for measurements taken at a distance of more than about 600 km from the epicenter. Since this [...] scale was simple to use and corresponded well with the damage which was observed, it was extremely useful for engineering earthquake-resistant structures, and gained common acceptance.|$|R
