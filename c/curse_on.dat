5|$|In the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the god Shiva is {{described}} as having cast a <b>curse</b> <b>on</b> Surabhi. This curse is interpreted as {{a reference to the}} following legend: Once, when the gods Brahma and Vishnu were fighting over who was superior, a fiery pillar—linga (symbol of Shiva)—emerged before them. It was that decided whoever found the end of this pillar was superior. Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar, but failed. So Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga; Shiva punished Surabhi by putting a <b>curse</b> <b>on</b> her so that her bovine offspring would have to eat unholy substances. This tale appears in the Skanda Purana.|$|E
5|$|In 2013's free-to-play mobile game Snow White: Queen's Return (also {{known as}} Seven Dwarfs: The Queen's Return), an uncanonical {{continuation}} of the film, the Queen has survived the fall at {{the climax of the}} film and then reverted to her youthful form to cast a <b>curse</b> <b>on</b> Snow White and the dwarfs and their entire forest.|$|E
5|$|When Sugriva {{challenges}} Vali to a duel, Tara wisely advises Vali not {{to accept}} because of the former's alliance with Rama—the hero of the Ramayana and an avatar of the god Vishnu—but Vali does not heed her, and dies from Rama's arrow, shot {{at the behest of}} Sugriva. The Ramayana and its later adaptations emphasize Tara's lamentation. While in most vernacular versions, Tara casts a <b>curse</b> <b>on</b> Rama by the power of her chastity, in some versions, Rama enlightens Tara.|$|E

5|$|Etty {{felt that}} his {{approach}} to the work illustrated a moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, but his approach was not entirely successful. The Bard was about a supposed <b>curse</b> <b>on</b> the House of Plantagenet placed by a Welsh bard following Edward I of England's attempts to eradicate Welsh culture, and critics felt that Etty had somewhat misunderstood the point of Gray's poem. Some reviewers greatly praised the piece, and in particular Etty's technical abilities, but audiences of the time {{found it hard to}} understand the purpose of Etty's painting, and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work tasteless and offensive.|$|E
5|$|Looking to do {{a family}} film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 {{when he heard}} of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film. Depp was excited by the {{possibility}} of reviving an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the Black Pearl were not in search of treasure but trying to return it to lift a <b>curse</b> <b>on</b> them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.|$|E

The Markovići brotherhood in Ljuljaci, Serbia, with the slava of St. John, settled {{in the first half of}} the 18th century, descending from one of Pivljanin's children. The Bajić brotherhood in Takovo, with the slava of St. George, numbering 30 households in 1960, also claim descent from him.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{following}} months, the population radicalized itself, and, on September 18, 1848, {{just one week}} before the Revolution was crushed, crowds entered the Interior Ministry, taking over the official copies of Regulamentul Organic and the register of boyar ranks (Arhondologia). The documents were subsequently paraded through the city in a mock funeral cortege, and burned down, one sheet at a time, {{in the public square}} on Mitropoliei Hill. Neofit reluctantly agreed to preside over the ceremony and to issue a <b>curse</b> <b>on</b> both pieces of legislation.|$|E

Harry and Hermione lead her into an area of the forest inhabited by centaurs, where Umbridge provokes them into taking her captive. The centaurs are furious upon learning that Hermione used them to do her bidding and turn on the pair, but Grawp arrives and clashes with the centaurs, allowing Harry and Hermione to escape.|$|E

Despite the misgivings of the Magic Mirror (Esposito) and her valet (Tony Perez), she goes to see the sorceress Maleficent (Kristin Bauer van Straten), to whom she had traded a Dark Curse. Maleficent refuses to return the curse, but the Queen defeats her in a magical battle, taking the curse's scroll. She lets Maleficent live, stating that the sorceress is the only friend she has. Later in the forest, the Queen assembles a number of dark creatures. She demands a lock of hair {{from each of the}} {{assembly}} in order to cast the curse and sacrifices the heart of her prized stallion to complete the spell. The curse, however, fails.|$|E
5|$|Childermass {{meanwhile}} eventually {{receives the}} message meant {{for him by}} Strange and uses it to break the enchantment over Lady Pole. Enraged by this, the gentleman with the thistledown hair intends to place a second deadly <b>curse</b> <b>on</b> Lady Pole, as Faerie tradition demands. En route, he murders Vinculus after they encounter him, with Stephen Black forced to watch. During these events, Norrell and Strange attempt a spell that would cause the nature forces of England {{to pay homage to}} John Uskglass. Not knowing his true name, they dedicate it to the 'nameless slave'. However, the two magicians' belief that this is Uskglass is mistaken, and instead the power is devoted to Stephen. He uses his momentary control of England to destroy the man with the thistledown hair, before Stephen, travelling through one of the newly opened Faerie roads, becomes the new king of the now blossoming Lost-Hope.|$|E
5|$|Elaine's role is {{significantly}} reduced for the sequel , though {{the majority of}} the story is conveyed by Guybrush to Elaine {{in the form of a}} flashback. Between the games, the two have broken off their relationship and Elaine has moved to her governor's mansion on Booty Island. When Guybrush appears at the mansion, she presumes he has come to apologize; instead he is looking for a map that belonged to Elaine's grandfather, which leads to fabled treasure Big Whoop. After discovering Guybrush's intentions, Elaine is infuriated and refuses to speak to him. Guybrush eventually becomes trapped at the site of Big Whoop, with Elaine arriving to rescue him. Guybrush falls into a chasm, where he is confronted by LeChuck, recently resurrected as a zombie.

5|$|In a final onslaught, Bellatrix {{is killed}} and Harry reveals to Voldemort {{that he is}} alive. He {{explains}} to Voldemort the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. Although Voldemort believes by killing Snape he has gained the Wand's loyalty, Snape was in fact never its master. Instead, Draco Malfoy earned the Wand's loyalty when he disarmed Dumbledore just before Snape arrived. Harry believes the Elder Wand recognized Draco as its master, {{up to the point}} where Harry disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor weeks prior, and the duel will depend on whether or not the wand recognizes Harry to be its master. Voldemort attempts one final Killing <b>Curse</b> <b>on</b> Harry, but the Elder Wand refuses to act against Harry and the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort at last.|$|E
5|$|The next arc, Summer, reveals {{events that}} {{occurred}} in the summer of one thousand years before the Dream arc, taking place in the Heian period. Kannabi no mikoto, or Kanna, {{is one of the last}} winged beings in Airs fictional setting and is held as a prisoner in her own castle. Since she bears wings on her back, she is not permitted to leave the castle walls or see her mother, who is in a similar situation elsewhere. With Ryūya, a member of her samurai guard, and Uraha, a fledgling telekinetic, Kanna escapes and traverses feudal Japan to find her mother. However, the rest of the guard and a sect of Buddhist monks follow them. After catching up, they place a <b>curse</b> <b>on</b> Kanna where she must endure constant reincarnation and death whenever she finds love; Misuzu is one such reincarnation.|$|E
5|$|Vithoba {{is usually}} {{depicted}} with his main consort, Rakhumai, {{on his left}} side. Rakhumai (or Rakhamai) literally means 'mother Rukmini'. Rukmini is traditionally viewed as the wife of Krishna. Hindus generally consider Krishna to {{be a form of}} Vishnu, hence his consort as a form of Lakshmi. Rakhumai is depicted in the arms-akimbo posture, standing on a brick. She has an independent cella in the Pandharpur temple complex. According to Ghurye, Rukmini—a princess of the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra—was elevated to the status of the main consort instead of Radha, because of her affiliation with the region. According to Dhangar tradition, Rukhumai is worshipped by the community as Padmavati or Padubai, a protector of the community and cattle in particular. Dhangar folklore explains the reason behind separate shrines for Vithoba and Padubai as the outcome of Vithoba invoking a <b>curse</b> <b>on</b> his consort, and his non-attachment to samsara (the householder's life). Apart from Rakhumai, two other consorts Satyabhama and Rahi (derived from Radha) are worshipped too. All three consorts are regarded as Krishna's in Hindu mythology.|$|E
