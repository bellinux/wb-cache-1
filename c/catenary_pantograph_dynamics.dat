Experience has shown that, {{in countries such as}} France and Germany, high velocity trains can be preferable to flying, given that the distance is not too great (usually under 1000 km). The {{domestic flight}} routes mentioned are all under that limit and therefore, there is great interest for increasing velocities of trains travelling in Norway. The biggest barrier for this purpose is the dynamic behaviour of the <b>catenary</b> [...] <b>pantograph</b> system, which is the system supplying power to the train. This thesis covers the modelling of that system, experimentally and numerically. The <b>catenary</b> [...] <b>pantograph</b> system mainly consists of a messenger wire, contact wire and a pantograph. Electrical power is transmitted from the contact wire through the pantograph to the train's engine. Consistent contact between the pantograph's head and contact wire is vital for the train to operate at high velocities. Too much or too little contact leads to increased wear in the system. In order to examine the performance of the system, the contact force is defined, i. e. the force at the point of contact.

40|$|Comfort {{and safety}} of railway {{transport}} has become more important as train speeds continue to increase. In electrified railways, the electrical current of the train is produced by the sliding contact between the <b>pantograph</b> and <b>catenary.</b> The quality of the current depends on the reliability of contact between the <b>pantograph</b> and <b>catenary.</b> So, <b>pantograph</b> inspection is very important task in electrified railways and it is periodically made for preventing dangerous situations.

In some yards (notably Hither Green, South East London and Snowdown colliery near Dover) overhead catenary energized to 650 V DC was used. This overhead collection method was only employed where it was deemed too dangerous to have third rail with staff constantly at ground level reaching into low running areas to couple and uncouple trains. The overhead system utilised tram-style <b>catenary</b> and <b>pantographs</b> - {{it was not necessary}} to collect traction current at speed and these provided a cost saving. The pantograph retracted into a cut-out recess in the roof when not in use, to keep within the loading gauge. Certain examples were delivered new without pantographs and ran with the recess vacant for some time. Evidently supply of the overhead equipment was short. Later in life (when the catenary in yards had almost completely been removed) during overhaul the opportunity was taken, on some examples of the class, to remove the sometimes troublesome pantograph, leading again to a vacant roof recess.|$|R

The _rst contributor to contact force variations is the geometry of the catenary under gravity loading. This parameter is however shown to be insu_cient to explain higher frequency e_ects.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in high-speed train transportation systems is {{the control of the}} contact force between the <b>catenary</b> and the <b>pantograph</b> collector end.

Such oscillations can originate electric arcs that damage the mechanical structure and reduce the system performance. Here we consider the equivalent stiffness of the catenary to compensate such an uncertainty. Assuming that a sufficiently accurate measure of the actual contact force is available, the use of an output-feedback control scheme based on higher-order sliding modes is proposed. The actual system structure and robustness properties of the sliding-mode control, allow for the almost-complete rejection of the undesired oscillations of the contact force by means of a continuous force acting on the lower frame of an active pantograph.

They showed that an intermittent source of electromagnetic interference (EMI) is received by the GSM-R antennas [18]. The EMI is generated by the electric arc emissions due to the sliding contact between the <b>catenary</b> and the <b>pantograph.</b> The variables that influence the electric arc emissions are the contact wire surface conditions, the pantograph sliding contact conditions, the temperature, the train speed, the amplitude of the collected current, the mechanical suspensions reaction, and in general the mechanical characteristics of the catenary system [19]. The noise distribution measured in [18] is well approximated by a S α S distribution [20].|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in high-speed train transportation systems is to counteract the fast variations of the contact force between the <b>catenary</b> and the <b>pantograph</b> collector end. The variation of the catenary equivalent stiffness, due to the suspending system, originates mechanical oscillations whose frequency and magnitude are larger and larger as the train speed increases. Such oscillations cause electric arcs that damage the mechanical structure and compromise {{the collection of the}} current from the supply wire, degradating the overall performance. Active pantographs offer the possibility of affecting the contact force evolution by suitably modifying the control torque applied to the lower arm of the pantograph. We consider the equivalent stiffness of the catenary as an uncertainty to compensate for by suitable robust control techniques, and, under the assumption that a noisy measurement of the contact force is available, we propose an output feedback control scheme based on higher-order sliding modes and high-gain observers. That combination allows for an almost complete rejection of the undesired oscillations of the contact force, as confirmed by simulations, and it is very attractive for real-time implementation purposes, due to its simplicity and robusteness...|$|R

Being the catenary a stationary system with a long lifespan it is also less likely to be redesigned and upgraded than the pantographs that fit the train vehicles. This letter proposes an optimization procedure for the improvement of the contact quality between the <b>pantograph</b> and the <b>catenary</b> solely based on the redesign of the pantograph head suspension characteristics. A pantograph model is defined and validated against experimental dynamic characteristics of existing pantographs. An optimization strategy based on the use of a global optimization method, to find the vicinity of the optimal solution, followed by the use of a deterministic optimization algorithm, to fine tune the optimal solution, is applied here. The spring stiffness, damping characteristics and bow mass are the design variables used for the pantograph optimization. The objective of the optimal problem is the minimization of the standard deviation of the contact force history, which is the most important quantity to define the contact quality. The pantograph head suspension characteristics are allowed to vary within technological realistic limits. It is found that current high-speed railway pantographs have a limited potential for mechanical improvements, not exceeding 10 %– 15 % on the decrease of the standard deviation of the contact force...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we have {{investigated}} the performance, in terms of BER, of a precoded MIMO system, based on the max-dmin precoder, {{in the presence of}} impulsive noise in the railway environment. First, we have proposed a lower bound on the error probability of the max-dmin precoder in a Cauchy noise environment for any MIMO system dimensions and M-QAM rectangular modulation, which is tight at high SNR relative to the simulation results of the communication chain. The expression is validated by the Monte Carlo evaluation of the minimum distance and the full simulation of the communication chain. The chosen approximation is simple and more accurate, but a more complex form may be found by taking into account all neighbors. Second, we have evaluated the performance of a realistic communication system close to the Wi-Fi PHY layer, including a realistic tunnel channel, based on previous MIMO channel sounding measurements and S α S parameter values derived from distribution fitting of measured transient EMI received at the GSM-R antenna {{on the roof of the}} train. These transient EMI are due to bad sliding contacts between the <b>catenary</b> and the <b>pantograph.</b> The log-likelihood ratios, needed at the input of the channel decoder, have been expressed in a Cauchy noise for the MIMO system.
