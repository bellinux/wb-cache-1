500|$|In a <b>comparison</b> <b>test</b> {{published}} in the CAR March 1994 issue the testers liked the [...] "sheer blistering pace, looks and a superb cabin" [...] but its size, the doors not opening far enough and handling were criticised: [...] "If there's a more evil device on our roads, I wouldn't like to find it, for the XJ220 suffers from immense initial understeer followed by violent and snappy pendulous oversteer." ...|$|E

2500|$|A 2011 study {{conducted}} by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland found practically no difference in fuel consumption in normal driving conditions between commercial gasoline grades 95E10 and 98E5 sold in Finland, despite the public perception that fuel consumption is significantly higher with 95E10. VTT performed the <b>comparison</b> <b>test</b> under controlled laboratory conditions and their measurements showed the cars tested used an average of [...] of 95E10 per , as opposed to [...] of 98E5 per [...] The difference was 0.07 in favor of 98E5 on average, meaning that using 95E10 gasoline, which has a higher ethanol content, increases consumption by 0.7%. When the measurements are normalized, the difference becomes 1.0%, a result that is highly consistent with an estimation of calorific values based on approximate fuel composition, which came out at 1.1% in favour of E5.|$|E
2500|$|Early reviews {{praised the}} Insight's futuristic styling, handling, and price but {{noted that it}} was less powerful, less fuel efficient, and less {{comfortable}} than other more expensive hybrids. The Insight performed well in comparison tests administered by Motor Trend and Car and Driver. In their <b>comparison</b> <b>test</b> against the 2010 Toyota Prius, Car and Driver stated [...] "...the Insight proved more visceral, connected, and agile than the Prius. The Insight represents a lot of engineering bang for the buck, {{and the majority of}} its dynamics are more satisfying than the Prius’s" [...] citing the benefits of the Insight's firm brake feel, accurate steering, and tight suspension (the latter borrowing heavily from the latest Honda Fit). It did not perform as well in Edmunds or Popular Mechanics tests. Despite a high reliability rating in Consumer Reports testing, the Insight was assigned a low score, stating that it fell short in ride quality, handling, interior noise, acceleration, refinement, rear seat access and rear visibility.|$|E
2500|$|Production {{start-up}} for the 2005 Mustang was on September 7, 2004, {{with the}} first 2005 model rolling off Flat Rock Assembly on September 27, 2004. U.S. market launch and customer delivery began {{at the end of}} October 2004, with production ending in late 2008 for the 2009 model. The 2005–2009 base Mustang was powered by Ford's cast iron block 4.0L Cologne SOHC V6, replacing the 3.8L Essex OHV V6 used in 2004 and older models. It produces 210hp (157kW) at 5300rpm and 240lb·ft (325N·m) of torque at 3500rpm and was mated to a standard Tremec T-5 5-speed manual transmission with Ford's 5R55S 5-speed automatic transmission available as an option. A 3.31:1 final drive ratio is standard with either transmission. In a <b>comparison</b> <b>test</b> with a Pontiac G6 Convertible conducted by Motor Trend magazine, a Mustang V6 convertible equipped with an automatic transmission was able to accelerate from zero to [...] in 7.3 seconds; 1.4 seconds better than the 2006 Pontiac G6 convertible.|$|E

[...] In conclusion, they stated: [...] "The Corvette as a total concept has always been far {{more than the sum of}} its individual parts. The fanatical clientele that buys 30,000 of them a year can attest to that. And we'll attest to the fact that after 20 years, the Corvette is more than going strong. It's still the epitome of the American motoring experience." ...|$|E

The Lexus LFA won the comparison and {{was featured in}} full in the November 2010 magazine edition.

The reviewers praised the Lexus engine, technology, luxury, chassis and suspension calling it a 'rocketship'. Their comments on LFA were [...] "The Lexus feels more athletic than the Ferrari, and its performance is more accessible, more immediately. The engine is remarkable. Austin noted: “They  figured out the engine. It’s really strong, and then you hit about 6500 rpm and your eyes get all big as the power hits another level.” The only street-car engine that matches this one for smoothness, ecstatic noise, and power delivery is the 458 Italia’s".

The magazine had established the Lexus LFA engine as the better of the two going as far as saying that [...] " [...] is powered by the best engine this side of Paul Rosche’s masterpiece {{in the back of}} a McLaren F1." [...] Regarding the exterior look of the Lexus LFA, editor commented [...] "To me LFA is a glorious looking car - beautifully proportioned and meticulously finished and with drama in every crease and curve". Once the editors had the cars on mountain roads, clearly Lexus LFA seemed to make a very positive impression on the editors as they commented [...] "The way the Aventador quickly reverses in my rearview mirror, my guess was not far off". [...] " [...] zings between hairpins and then peels cleanly into them, front end assured, but never artificially pointy and the rear noticeably wants to edge just a few degreess wide as the V10 feeds the rear tires with its buzzsaw power". In the end in terms of sheer driving enjoyment, the editors were clear that Lexus LFA was the more enjoyable car of the two.|$|E

2500|$|Reception to the Aura has {{generally}} been positive. The Aura {{has been described as}} the best looking sedan to come out of GM in quite a while. The Aura was also praised for its performance. The Aura has been described as [...] "the best Saturn yet", and fit and finish and ride quality are regarded as greatly improved over previous Saturns. Other improvements include reduced road noise, attributed to the fact that this model doesn't use polymer body panels like its predecessors, in addition to the extensive soundproofing GM added to car, and the triple-pane front windows and windshield. The Aura also garnered praise for its value, as it is noted that an Aura XE loaded up with certain options costs less than the standard MSRP of the Toyota Camry with a V6. The Aura finished fourth out of six places in a Car and Driver <b>comparison</b> <b>test,</b> ahead of the Chrysler Sebring and the Toyota Camry, but fell behind the Honda Accord. Despite this, it was the best performing out of the cars compared. The Aura also got praise for the craftsmanship of its interior and its European flair. The Aura also got a favorable review by Consumer Guide, with it being a recommended pick. It also got more than favorable reviews from actual owners of the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Capsaicin induces a {{localized}} inflammatory {{process known}} as neurogenic inflammation upon its topical administration on the skin, due {{to the release of}} various neuropeptides from the cutaneous sensory nerve endings. In this study, we investigated real-time skin blood flow changes that occur in neurogenic inflammation induced by topical capsaicin by means of in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy. 27 healthy subjects (15 women and 12 men, mean age ± Standard Deviation: 22. 62 ± 4. 47) were administered topical capsaicin solution (Capsaicin group) or immersion oil (Control group) on the dorsal side of their non-dominant hand. At different time intervals during administration (0, 10, 25, and 40 minutes), cutaneous blood flow was evaluated using reflectance confocal microscopy and compared between the two groups. Blood flow values were higher during topical capsaicin, with significant increase after 25 (P= 0. 0160, Dunn’s multiple <b>comparisons</b> <b>test)</b> and 40 minutes (P= 0. 0132, Dunn’s multiple <b>comparisons</b> <b>test)</b> after its administration when compared with the initial 0 min value. Furthermore, the differences in the blood flow changes between the two groups were significant at 25 min (P= 0. 0182, Dunn’s multiple <b>comparisons</b> <b>test)</b> and 40 min (P= 0. 0296, Dunn’s multiple <b>comparisons</b> <b>test)</b> after capsaicin administration. Reflectance confocal microscopy allows in vivo, real-time evaluation of cutaneous blood flow changes within the capsaicin-induced inflammation, and this method might serve as a research model to test neurovascular reactivity.  </p...|$|R
