50|$|A {{standard}} ammunition pouch as issued (Pouch, Ammunition, Universal, DPM, IRR.) has two pockets; single pocket versions (Pouch, Ammunition (Other Arms), DPM, IRR.) {{are available}} for those individuals not required to carry as much ammunition. Pouches designated to hold ammunition initially contained a <b>dividing</b> <b>strip</b> to hold two magazines in separate compartments and eliminate rattle. Some soldiers, especially infantry soldiers, often removed these <b>dividing</b> <b>strips</b> {{to make it easier}} to insert and remove magazines. They also found that three magazines would then fit comfortably and without excessive noise, giving a total capacity of twelve magazines per person in a standard fighting configuration. Later issue ammunition pouches were manufactured without dividers, as eight magazines was not thought to be sufficient for sustained firefights with the enemy. Without dividers, each pouch can now alternatively contain one grenade.|$|R
