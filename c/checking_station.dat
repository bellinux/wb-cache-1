Some of the uses of these stations were preventing the trafficking of firearms, ensuring that the various rules and policies surrounding the sankin-kōtai were followed, and checking the passports of travelling commoners. Fifty-three <b>Check</b> <b>Stations</b> were created in the 17th century.

50|$|In 1984, BAR also {{implemented}} a biennial Smog Check Program, {{also known as}} the motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program, pursuant to authority granted by Senate Bill 33 of 1982 (SB 33). SB 33 authorized BAR to implement, maintain, and enforce the Smog Check Program, which licenses Smog <b>Check</b> <b>stations</b> and technicians to reduce air pollution from vehicles through mandatory testing of vehicle emission control components. Smog <b>Check</b> <b>stations</b> must also be registered as ARDs to ensure that consumers receive protection associated with vehicle repairs. In addition, BAR ensures that the equipment used to perform Smog Check inspections and the inspections performed at Smog <b>Check</b> <b>stations</b> by Smog <b>Check</b> Inspectors or Technicians will achieve reductions in vehicle emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. Recently, BAR's authority to protect consumers subject to the Smog Check Program was enhanced by Assembly Bill 2289 of 2010 (AB 2289). AB 2289 authorizes BAR to certify high performing Smog <b>Check</b> <b>stations</b> and technicians as STAR certified, which allows them to inspect and repair vehicles that are likely to be high polluters. Shortly after implementation, BAR was recognized for outstanding environmental achievements in government for the STAR Program and was named one of the 2013 Best of California Award winners and received The Green IT Award. AB 2289 further increased the citation amounts for program violations by stations and technicians.|$|R

5000|$|The {{structures}} {{were used for}} their intended purpose until 1953 when the gates {{to each of the}} three government sites were relocated to the specific sites. The three white Gatehouses remained in federal government ownership for many years, but stood vacant. In 1992, they were listed on the National Register as three separate properties, identified as the Oak Ridge Turnpike <b>Checking</b> <b>Station,</b> Bear Creek Road <b>Checking</b> <b>Station,</b> and Bethel Valley Road <b>Checking</b> <b>Station.</b> [...] All three were included in a larger Multiple Property Submission for Oak Ridge-related properties. [...] In 1999, the Department of Energy (DOE), the AEC-successor agency that currently controls the Bear Creek Road and Oak Ridge Turnpike properties, as well as the small structure on the Bethel Valley property, restored the large structures at the checking stations at the Oak Ridge Turnpike and Bear Creek Road sites. [...] The large structure at the Bethel Valley Road site belongs to Lockheed Martin who obtained it with the Commerce Park property in 1984 when Martin Marietta took over the managing and operating contract for the three DOE sites in Oak Ridge as well as the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Portsmouth, Ohio, and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky.

50|$|The Ranger and <b>Checking</b> <b>Station</b> {{was built}} {{starting}} in 1929. Access was difficult, since Yakima Park Highway construction {{had not yet}} reached the area. Work was not entirely completed until 1931. Design was by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Design, {{under the supervision of}} Thomas Chalmers Vint. The station is a one-story T-shaped log structure of seven rooms, with a porte-cochere extending over the road. It follows the prototype of the Nisqually Entrance Station, although the Nisqually station was remodeled to incorporate the porte-cochere first used at White River. The building provided living and working quarters for a ranger, with two bedrooms, a dining room, kitchen bathroom and living room.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, when the {{building}} was assessed for National Register listing, the interior lobby area was marble clad, and the ceiling was described as, [...] "gold and silver leaf pressed metal with a repeating chevron and diamond point pattern".

Military police controlled a metal gate that extended between the pair of buildings. Workers and visitors had to show special badges to the guards in order {{to pass through the}} gates.|$|R
