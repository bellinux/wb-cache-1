25|$|From 1950, India ran {{continued}} {{trade deficits}} that increased in magnitude in the 1960s. Furthermore, the Government of India had a budget deficit problem {{and could not}} borrow money from abroad or from the private <b>corporate</b> <b>sector,</b> due to that sector's negative savings rate. As a result, the government issued bonds to the RBI, which increased the money supply, leading to inflation. In 1966, foreign aid, which had hitherto been {{a key factor in}} preventing devaluation of the rupee, was finally cut off and India was told it had to liberalise its restrictions on trade before foreign aid would again materialise. The response was the politically unpopular step of devaluation accompanied by liberalisation. Furthermore, The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 led the US and other countries friendly towards Pakistan to withdraw foreign aid to India, which necessitated more devaluation. Defense spending in 1965/1966 was 24.06% of total expenditure, the highest {{it has been in the}} period from 1965 to 1989 (Foundations, pp 195). Another factor leading to devaluation was the drought of 1965/1966 which resulted in a sharp rise in prices.|$|E
25|$|In {{exchange}} for US $43 billion in liquidity aid, Suharto {{was forced to}} sign three letters of intent from October 1997 to April 1998 with the IMF. The LoI promised reforms which includes closing banks owned by Suharto's family and cronies starting in November 1997. Plan to close unhealthy banks resulted in a bank run that drained liquidity; depositors knew of the poor regulations and risky related-party credit extensions of Indonesian banks. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantee for bank deposits, and set-up Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take-over management of troubled banks to prevent collapse of the financial system. Based on IMF recommendation, the government increased interest rates to 70% pa in February 1998 to control spiralling inflation caused by higher price of imports, but this action killed availability of credit to the <b>corporate</b> <b>sector.</b> Suharto's foot-dragging in undertaking reforms demanded by IMF in relation to his children's business further weakened public confidence. According to American economist Steve Hanke, invited by Suharto in February 1998 to plan currency board system, President Bill Clinton and IMF managing director Michel Camdessus deliberately worsened the Indonesian crisis to force Suharto to resign.|$|E
40|$|In a panel data {{framework}} applied to Portfolio Distance-to-Default series of <b>corporate</b> <b>sectors</b> in the euro area, this paper evaluates systemic and idiosyncratic determinants of default risk and examines how distress is transferred in {{and between the}} financial and <b>corporate</b> <b>sectors</b> {{since the early days}} of the euro. This approach takes into account observed and unobserved common factors and the presence of different degrees of cross-section dependence in the form of economic proximity. This paper contributes to the financial stability literature with a contingent claims approach to a sector-based analysis with a less dominant macro focus while being compatible with existing stress-testing methodologies in the literature. A disaggregated analysis of the different <b>corporate</b> and financial <b>sectors</b> allows for a more detailed assessment of specificities in terms of risk pro file, i. e. heterogeneity of business models, risk exposures and interaction with the rest of the macro environment...|$|R

500|$|Germany has {{successfully}} pushed its economic competitiveness {{by increasing the}} value added tax (VAT) by three percentage points in 2007, and using part of the additional revenues to lower employer's unemployment insurance contribution. Portugal has taken a similar stance and also France appears to follow this suit. In November 2012 French president François Hollande announced plans to reduce tax burden of the <b>corporate</b> <b>sector</b> by [...] within three years, while increasing the standard VAT from 19.6% to 20% and introducing additional eco-taxes in 2016.

500|$|Section four, [...] "InterOccupy", {{contains}} {{the transcript of}} {{a conference call with}} Chomsky chaired by Mikal Kamil and Ian Escuela on January 31, 2012, in which he answered pre-selected questions from the Occupy community. Beginning with a discussion of the media coverage of Occupy, he moves on to discuss the police repression that the movement has faced, arguing {{that the best way to}} avoid such repression was to gain [...] "active public support" [...] for their cause. He considers one of the primary achievements of Occupy to have been to bring together communities to discuss and debate in a democratic forum, thereby rejecting the ideologies of selfishness proposed by the likes of Ayn Rand. Chomsky then discusses how to get the <b>corporate</b> <b>sector</b> out of politics and how to introduce greater democracy to the U.S. He rounds off this chapter with a discussion of the nature of the Republican and Democratic parties, the work of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci and the role of the U.S. housing bubble in the global depression.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} {{is followed}} by a transcript of Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, originally given to Occupy Boston in Dewey Square on October 22, 2011. Contrasting the hope of the working classes in the Great Depression of the 1930s with the pessimism of their contemporaries in the current recession, Chomsky discusses the changes to the U.S. economy that have occurred since the 1970s: de-industrialization, de-development {{and the rise of the}} financial sector at the expense of other parts of the economy. He notes how both Adam Smith and David Ricardo partly foresaw this situation. Highlighting the work of Tom Ferguson, he discusses how the political parties have come under the increasing control of the <b>corporate</b> <b>sector.</b> Proceeding to look at corruption among the 1%, he makes reference to both Citigroup and Alan Greenspan, before discussing the role that worker sit-ins and industry takeovers could play in democratizing the U.S. economy, as well as the threat posed by both nuclear war and environmental catastrophe, both problems exacerbated by the current capitalist system. Finally, he responds to questions posed by the audience, discussing the concept of corporate personhood, rejecting the idea that the U.S. elite could resort to fascism, and discussing the possibility of a general strike, arguing that that would be [...] "a possible idea at a time when the population is ready for it." ...|$|E
