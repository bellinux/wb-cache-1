40|$|Yaw/spin {{motion is}} one of the crucial {{parameters}} for three degrees of motion (forward and lateral movements) for railway vehicle wheelset for analyzing its dynamics and modeling system. Perturbation is the cardinal problem during running of railway wheelset over railway track.

Thus impropriate ratio of adhesion based upon contamination owing to creep creates slippage of rail wheels from track. This slip is procured by unbalanced lateral motion associated with yaw motion based upon variation of <b>creep</b> <b>coefficient.</b> In this paper, the produced noise by running high speed of railway wheelset is estimated by using kalman filter (KF).

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{relaxation}} model for steel tendons {{based on the}} equivalent <b>creep</b> <b>coefficient</b> to enable the accurate estimation of losses of cable forces. The equivalent <b>creep</b> <b>coefficient</b> works {{not only in the}} case of intrinsic relaxation but also under various boundary conditions. Based on the proposed relaxation model, an accurate finite element analysis of the time-dependent behavior of concrete bridges considering concrete creep, concrete shrinkage and cable relaxation is devised based on the time integration method. Concrete members are modeled by beam elements while tendons are modeled by truss elements with nodes connected to the beam axis by perpendicular rigid arms. Then the individual and combined effects of concrete creep, concrete shrinkage and cable relaxation on the long-term performance of concrete structures are investigated. It is found that the proposed relaxation model and time integration method can provide a reliable method for time-dependent analysis.

The creep characteristics of over-consolidated soils are studied through plane strain tests for the undisturbed soft clay. Four creep tests are carried out by using the plane strain creep apparatus, one is conducted on normally consolidated clay and three are on over-consolidated clay. The studies show that for the normally consolidated soils, the volumetric strain of creep in plane strain tests varies in the same way with the secondary consolidation under one-dimension condition, and that the clay presents less axial strain in plane strain tests than that in one-dimension tests when the principal stress ratio equals the ratio in K 0 state.

In order to accurately quantify the early-age deformational characteristics of Australian concrete, including shrinkage and tensile creep, a comprehensive experimental program is underway at the Centre for Infrastructure Engineering and Safety at UNSW Australia, where a series of experiments have been performed to quantify the early-age properties of concrete. A restrained cracking test was devised and reinforced concrete prisms were tested in tension under sustained loading to measure tensile creep and restrained shrinkage.

Autogenous shrinkage increased rapidly in the ULCC at early-age and almost 95 % occurred {{prior to the start}} of creep test at 28 days. Hence, majority of shrinkage of the ULCC during creep test was drying shrinkage. Total shrinkage of the ULCC during the 450 -day creep test was the lowest compared to the NWAC and LWAC. However, corresponding total creep in the ULCC was the highest with high proportion attributed to basic creep (≥ ~ 90 %) and limited drying creep.
