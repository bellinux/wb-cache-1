40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} of electricity generation and saving at <b>compression</b> <b>stations</b> of magistral gas transporting pipelines in Russia. Russia is a biggest {{country in the}} world which faces set of challenges like transporting gas in European part from far North. Average gas travel distance in Russia is over 4000 km which means huge energy demand for transportation. Permanent availability of energy at <b>compression</b> <b>stations</b> is the key for stabile operation of gas transporting system. For satisfying those needs external sources of electricity used, or part of the transported gas used on special “self needs electricity stations” for electricity production. In 2012 in Russia about 655 bln m 3 of gas were produced. About 10 % of that number doesn’t come to consumer, because this amount spent for gas transport needs (biggest share is electricity production).  It is obvious, that in order to increase income, company should work on transport cost decreasing and on cheap electricity production. Even 10 % decrease in transport costs can give economy in about 6 - 7 bln m 3, which is bigger that production of many countries. In this thesis pipeline systems efficiency and reliability, gas turbines in Russian pipeline systems considered. Analysis of renewable energy included and propositions for reconstruction of CS “Russkaya” with help of PV panels for electricity generation and gas usage decreasing included.

40|$|AbstractAt {{the present}} time in Romania, the {{transition}} from the natural gas transportation system to the distribution system is done only thru the use of pressure reducing stations. Here the pressure drop is usually done by using throttle valves or pressure reducing valves, where the gas energy is spent without doing any work.

The plans are made at this time for a pilot project at the pressure reducing station in the city of Onesti, Bacau County...|$|R

40|$|WOW {{operates}} {{in the energy}} efficiency field- {{one of the fastest}} growing energy sectors in the world today. The two key products - WOWGen? and WOWClean? provide more energy at cheaper cost and lower emissions. ?WOWGen? - Power Generation from Industrial Waste Heat ?WOWClean? - Multi Pollutant emission control system. Current power generation technology uses only 35 % of the energy in a fossil fuel and converts it to useful output. The remaining 65 % is discharged into the environment as waste heat at temperatures ranging from 300 ?F to 1, 200 ?F. This waste heat can be captured using the WOWGen? technology and turned into electricity. This efficiency is up to twice the rate of competing technologies. Compelling economics and current environmental policy are stimulating industry interest. WOWGen? power plants can generate between 1 - 25 MW of electricity. Project payback is between two to five years with IRR of 15 % 30 %. Nearly anywhere industrial waste heat is present, the WOW products can be applied. Beneficial applications of heat recovery power generation can be found in Industry (e. g. steel, glass, cement, lime, pulp and paper, refining and petrochemicals), Power Generation (CHP, biomass, biofuel, traditional fuels, gasifiers, diesel engines) and Natural Gas (pipeline <b>compression</b> <b>stations,</b> processing plants). Sources such as stack flue gases, steam, diesel exhaust, hot oil or combinations of sources can be used to generate power. WOWGen? can also be used with stand alone power plants burning fossil fuels or using renewable energy sources such as solar and biomass...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{activity}} of {{supervision and control}} of the industrial processes is a very complex spot and require a great experiment because of the dynamic characteristics of the process. This experiment was acquired with the passing of years. What makes departure of an expert in retirement a great loss of the know-how. The problem thus consists to capture this know-how and allows experiment to be cumulate with an aim of construction of an enterprise memory. We propose an approach based on ontology to capture this know-how. In the dynamic situations are distinguished three classes from situations: situations of normal walk, situations of degraded walk and situations of incidental walk. The work presented in this article, was developed in the division of production at SONATRACH. It relates to the supervision and the control of the industrial process of a compressor station witch constitutes a typical case of dynamic situation. Among the three classes of quoted dynamic situations, we concentrate on the situations of degraded walk. These situations of nature different compared to the usual situations from normal walk, subject the operator to a workload at the same time complex and stressing. The work presented in this article enters within the framework of a doctoral project whose the principal objective was the development of an intelligent system of expertise and of decisionmaking aid in the domain of the industrial maintenance for the <b>compression</b> <b>stations.</b> It relates to ontological engineering and more particularly the use of ontologies in the knowledge-based systems.
