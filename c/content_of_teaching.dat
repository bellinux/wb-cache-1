30|$|Although the {{complexity}} of washback has been acknowledged, it has been claimed that tests seem to have direct impacts on the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning, which has been supported by various empirical studies (e.g., Ferman, 2004; Hawkey, 2006; Qi, 2004; Wall, 1996, 2005; Wall & Alderson, 1993). For example, Wall and Alderson (1993) investigated the washback effect of a newly employed English examination in Sri Lanka, focusing on its impact on language teaching. A series of classroom observations were conducted to examine the nature of classes. As a result, they found washback effects of the test on the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching,</b> {{but not on the}} methodology employed by the teachers. The effects were confirmed during both the normal instruction periods and the examination preparation periods (Wall, 2005). Language teachers appear to select the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> dealt with in the classroom based on the content of tests and tend to concentrate on the skills measured by tests. In a similar vein, the content of students’ learning appears to be strongly influenced by language tests, in particular by high-stakes examinations. Ferman (2004) found that a new national EFL oral matriculation test employed in Israel had a direct washback effect on students’ learning. The new test was developed in an attempt to emphasize oral communicative skills. A questionnaire survey to students showed {{that the majority of the}} students increased their focus on learning oral skills after the introduction of the test. Although the methods for improving them were not necessarily considered positive (e.g., it led to memorization and rote learning), students’ attention to oral skills was at least achieved by the new high-stakes test. Moreover, students believed that the test improved their overall command of English.|$|E
