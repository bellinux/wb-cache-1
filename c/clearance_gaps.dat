40|$|Francis turbine {{guide vanes}} have pivoted support with {{external}} control mechanism, for conversion {{of pressure to}} kinetic energy and to direct them to runner vanes. This movement along the support is dependent on variation of load and flow (operating conditions). Small <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps</b> between facing plates and {{the upper and lower}} guide vane tips are available to aid this movement, through which leakage flow occurs. This secondary flow disturbs the main flow stream, resulting performance loss. Additionally, these increased horseshoe vortex, in presence of sand, when crosses through the gaps, both the surfaces are eroded. This causes further serious effect on performance and structural property by increasing gaps. This paper discusses the observation of the severity in hydropower plants and effect of <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps</b> on general performance of the Francis turbine through computational methods. It also relates the primary result with the empirical relation for leakage flow prediction. Additionally, a possible method to computationally estimate thickness depletion has also been presented.

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} a brief {{presentation of the}} different losses developed in high head Francis turbines, where special {{attention is paid to}} the losses in the guide vanes due to the head covers deflection. The different factors determining the extent of the leakage flow are thoroughly examined. Also, since the guide vane facing plate and the head covers are exposed to serious wear due to the presence of sand particles in a high accelerating flow, efficiency measurements of sand eroded and repaired turbines are presented. In addition, results from efficiency measurements of Francis turbines with different <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps</b> are included to underline the severity of the clearance gap between the covers and the guide vanes. The thesis presents a numerical approach to calculate the head covers deflection. And the scope of this work is to develop a simplified 2 -D model, which calculates the head covers deflection within a certain order of accuracy. Thus a 3 -D modelling of the head covers deflection is also included with the purpose of validating the 2 -D modelling. Furthermore, a discussion of the efficiency with respect to the design of the head covers is performed to describe the potential of increasing the hydraulic efficiency by altering the design method. Also, a numerical computation of the leakage flow in the guide vanes due to the head covers deflections, is presented to better visualize the effect from the clearance gap between the head cover and guide vane facing plate. Also, to underline the severity of large <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps,</b> the guide vane has been modeled with four different sized <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps.</b> Finally, an analytical interpretation of the leakage flow is included to evaluate the numerical calculation of the leakage flow.

40|$|The Kaplan turbine {{has a small}} <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> {{between the}} blade tip and casing to allow the blades to rotate freely. This <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> {{is the cause of}} an {{undesirable}} Tip Leakage Vortex (TLV). A TLV might reduce the turbine efficiency, erode the turbine blades or cause instabilities for the power output. A literature study indicated that the tip <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> was a critical parameter affecting the behavior of the TLV. A research gap was observed for an operating Kaplan turbine where the turbine shafts tend to wobble slightly, and thus fluctuate the tip <b>clearance</b> <b>gap.</b> The aim of this thesis is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the Tip Leakage Vortex and investigate the research gap observing the effects generated by a fluctuating tip <b>clearance</b> <b>gap.</b> To examine the effects, a numerical study was completed on a mesh of 7 million elements. The selected turbulence models were Shear stress transport (SST) and Scale-adaptive simulation (SAS). The numerical results produced values close to the experimental results. Simulated results showed that the negative effects associated with TLV worsened when including the wobbling from the turbine shaft. For the smallest <b>clearance</b> <b>gap,</b> the maximum vortex strength showed an increase of 4 % compared to the maximum vortex strength of a stationary test. Tested on for stationary case, the radial forces showed a peak with a <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> size of 5 mm.

30|$|The work on lateral {{vehicular}} interactions can {{be traced}} from May’s experiments [4], which calculated internal frictions between two vehicles on test track. Based upon traffic arrival pattern of a multi-lane unidirectional highway, Mahalel and Hakkert [5] concluded that arrival pattern of vehicles in one lane {{is dependent on the}} arrival patterns of vehicles in the other lanes. For mixed traffic condition, there is no restriction of lateral movement, and hence, vehicles have the freedom to traverse in any gaps without the need to travel in demarcated paths. Hence, lateral movement for overtaking is not only in the form of lane changing (which has large literature), but also smaller lateral shifts which would be sufficient enough to maintain a clearance between adjacent vehicles as per the comfort of drivers. In this regard, <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps</b> between vehicles on bidirectional roads were first evaluated by Nagaraj et al.

Os seguintes parâmetros foram avariados durante o curso dos experimentos: comprimento {{longitudinal}} das aletas, diferença de temperatura aleta-ambiente, altura das aletas e a folga entre aletas/antepara. Anteparas possuindo características térmicas distintas foram empregadas (altamente condutora e isolante). Para cada configuração variou-se o Número de Rayleigh entre 4, 0 x 10 (1) a 7, 0 x 10 (2). Encontrou-se que o posicionamento de uma antepara próxima às alentas reduz a taxa de troca de calor de modo combinado quando comparado ao caso sem antepara. Encontrou-se, também, que as anteparas metálicas forneceram taxas de transferência de calor maiores que as isoladas. Cálculos mostraram que, quando a folga aleta/antepara era nula, a parcela convectiva era dominante. Para outros valores da folga, a contribuição da componente radiativa era da mesma ordem de grandeza da convectiva. A contribuição da parcela radiativa era maior para baixos valores do Número de Rayleigh e para valores da folga aleta/antepara diferentes de zero. Experiments {{were performed}} to determine the combined-mode natural convection/radiation heat transfer characteristics of a shrouded array of rectangular, vertical fins. The investigated parameters included the height and the longitudinal lenght of the fins, the clearance gap between the shroud and the fin tips and the fin to ambient temperature difference.

A set of four <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> sizes, in addition to zero clearance data for the stationary wall, gives the possibility to observe the dependence of performance characteristics on clearance size, and establish the influence of rotating the hub.

40|$|In Francis turbine, a small <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> {{between the}} guide vanes and the cover plates is usually {{required}} to pivot guide vanes {{as a part}} of governing system. Deflection of cover plates and erosion of mating surfaces causes this gap to increase from its design value. The <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> induces the secondary flow in the distributor system. This effects the main flow at the runner inlet, which causes losses in efficiency and instability. A guide vane cascade of a low specific speed Francis turbine has been developed for experimental investigations. The test setup is able to produce similar velocity distributions at the runner inlet as that of a reference prototype turbine. The setup is designed for particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements from the position of stay vane outlet to the position of runner inlet. In this study, velocity and pressure measurements are conducted with 2 mm <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> on one side of guide vane.

40|$|In gas turbines, {{the blades}} of axial turbine stages rotate in close {{proximity}} to a stationary peripheral wall. Differential expansion of the turbine wheel, blades, and the shroud causes variations {{in the size of the}} <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> between blade tip and stationary shroud. The necessity to tolerate this differential thermal expansion dictates that the <b>clearance</b> <b>gap</b> cannot be eliminated altogether, despite accurate engine machining. Pressure differences between the pressure and suction sides of a blade drives a flow through the <b>clearance</b> <b>gap.</b> This flow, the tip leakage flow, is detrimental to engine performance. The primary detrimental effect of tip leakage flow is the reduction of turbine stage efficiency, and a second is the convective heat transfer associated with the flow. The surface area at the blade tip in contact with the hot working gas represents an additional thermal loading on the blade which, together with heat transfer to the suction and pressure side surface area, must be removed by the blade internal cooling flows.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{loss and}} endwall heat {{transfer}} for a turbine blade {{are influenced by}} complex vortical flows that are generated at the airfoil-endwall junction. In an engine, those flows interact with <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps</b> between stationary and rotating components, {{as well as with}} leakage flow that is designed to exhaust through the gaps. This paper describes experimental measurements of endwall heat transfer for a high-pressure turbine blade with an endwall overlap geometry, as well as an upstream leakage feature that supplied swirled or unswirled leakage relative to the blade. For unswirled leakage, increasing its mass flow increased the magnitude and pitchwise uniformity of the heat transfer coefficient upstream of the blades although heat transfer further into the passage was unchanged. Leakage flow with swirl shifted the horseshoe vortex in the direction of swirl and increased heat transfer on the upstream blade endwall, as compared to unswirled leakage. For a nominal leakage mass flow ratio of 0. 75 %, swirled leakage did not increase area-averaged heat transfer relative to unswirled leakage. At a mass flow ratio of 1. 0 %, however, swirled leakage increased overall heat transfer by 4 % due to an increase in the strength of the vortical flows...|$|E

In small scale ORC systems (below 300 kWe) with a low temperature heat source (from 55 ◦C till 150 ◦C), twin screw expanders are commonly used to recover the mechanical power.

Two tip <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps</b> were used: 1. 6 % and 2. 8 % chord. Data was obtained at a Reynolds number of 2. 3 X 10 (5) based oil exit velocity and chord. Three different tip geometries were investigated: A flat (plain) tip, a suction-side squealer and a cavity squealer The experiments reveal that the flow through the plain gap is dominated by flow separation at the pressure-side edge and that {{the highest levels of}} heat transfer are located where the flow, reattaches on the tip surface.

40|$|<b>Clearance</b> <b>gaps</b> between {{guide vanes}} and cover plates of Francis {{turbines}} tend {{to increase in}} size due to simultaneous effect of secondary flow and erosion in sediment affected hydropower plants. The pressure {{difference between the two}} sides of the guide vane induces leakage flow through the gap. This flow enters into the suction side with high acceleration, disturbing the primary flow and causing more erosion and losses in downstream turbine components. A cascade rig containing a single guide vane passage has been built to study the effect of the clearance gap using pressure sensors and PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) technique. This study focuses on developing a numerical model of the test rig, validating the results with experiments and investigating the behavior of leakage flow numerically. It was observed from both CFD and experiment that the leakage flow forms a passage vortex, which shifts away from the wall while travelling downstream. The streamlines contributing to the formation of this vortex have been discussed. Furthermore, the reference guide vane with symmetrical hydrofoil has been compared with four cambered profiles, in terms of the guide vane loading and the consequent effect on the leakage flow. A dimensionless term called Leakage Flow Factor (Lff) has been introduced to compare the performances of hydrofoils.

Analytical modelling of the casing wall pressures and reconstruction of rotor blade vibration amplitudes from the analysis of these simulated pressure signals have shown potential advantages over current non-contact rotor blade vibration measurement methods.

Base line flat tip geometry and squealer type geometries, namely, double squealer or cavity and suction-side squealer, were considered. The performances of the squealer geometries, {{in terms of the}} leakage mass flow and heat transfer to the tip, were compared with the flat tip at two different tip <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps.</b> The computations were performed using a single blade with periodic boundary conditions imposed along the boundaries in the pitchwise direction. Turbulence was modeled using three different models, namely, standard k-epsilon, low Re k-omega, and shear stress transport (SST) k-omega, in order to assess the capability, of the models in correctly predicting the blade heat transfer The heat transfer and static pressure distributions obtained using the SST k-omega model were-found to be in close agreement with the experimental data. It was observed that compared to the other two geometries considered, the cavity tip is advantageous both from the aerodynamic and from the heat transfer perspectives by providing a decrease in the amount of leakage, and hence losses, and average heat transfer to the tip. In general, for a given geometry, the leakage mass flow and the heat transfer to the tip increased with increase in tip clearance gap.

This study examined the shear resistance of timber floors and attic horizontal planes nail-jointed with structural particleboards (PBs). Floor joist system specimens and attic beam system specimens with a dimension of 1. 82 m × 2. 73 m were manufactured form JIS (Japanese industrial standard) 18 M type PBs with thicknesses of 12 and 15 mm. The specimens were shear loaded under a cyclic mode until fracture. The effects of PB thicknesses, <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps</b> between PBs, nailing intervals, and nail types on the shear resistance were investigated. The results obtained are as follows. Horizontal planes attached with a 15 -mm-thick PB showed an initial stiffness somewhat higher than that with a 12 -mm-thick PB, whereas the maximum bearing load and ultimate load did not change. A clearance gap of approximately 4 mm between PBs was found to slightly weaken the shear resistance, and the negative effect was larger at the floor joist system than at the attic beam system. Shortening a nail interval from 150 mm to 100 mm enhanced the shear resistance by approximately 20 % and 30 % for the floor joist system and the attic beam system, respectively. Changing the nail type from JIS N 50 to JIS CN 50 strengthened the shear resistance of the attic beam system by approximately 20 %, whereas a clear positive effect was not recognized for the floor joist system. The shear resistance of floor joist and attic beam systems attached with PBs was found to be comparable to those attached with a structural plywood or an oriented strand board specified in the building code in Japan...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to provide {{additional}} data to supplement the work reported in NASA/CR- 2015 - 218868 (Berdanier and Key, 2015 b). The aim of that project was to characterize the fundamental flow physics and the overall performance effects due to increased rotor tip clearance heights in axial compressors. Data have been collected in the three-stage axial research compressor at Purdue University with a specific focus on analyzing the multistage effects resulting from the tip leakage flow. Three separate rotor tip clearances were studied with nominal tip <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps</b> of 1. 5 percent, 3. 0 percent, and 4. 0 percent based on a constant annulus height. Overall compressor performance was previously investigated at four corrected speedlines (100 percent, 90 percent, 80 percent, and 68 percent) {{for each of the}} three tip clearance configurations. This study extends the previously published results to include detailed steady and time-resolved pressure data at two loading conditions, nominal loading (NL) and high loading (HL), on the 100 percent corrected speedline for the intermediate clearance level (3. 0 percent). Steady detailed radial traverses of total pressure at the exit of each stator row are supported by flow visualization techniques to identify regions of flow recirculation and separation. Furthermore, detailed radial traverses of time-resolved total pressures at the exit of each rotor row have been measured with a fast-response pressure probe. These data were combined with existing three-component velocity measurements to identify a novel technique for calculating blockage in a multistage compressor. Time-resolved static pressure measurements have been collected over the rotor tips for all rotors with each of the three tip clearance configurations for up to five loading conditions along the 100 percent corrected speedline using fast-response piezoresistive pressure sensors. These time-resolved static pressure measurements reveal new knowledge about the trajectory of the tip leakage flow through the rotor passage. Further, these data extend previous measurements identifying a modulation of the tip leakage flow due to upstream stator wake propagation. Finally, a novel instrumentation technique has been implemented to measure pressures in the shrouded stator cavities. These data provide boundary conditions relating to the flow across the shrouded stator knife seal teeth. Moreover, the utilization of fast-response pressure sensors provides a new look at the time-resolved pressure field, leading to instantaneous differential pressures across the seal teeth. Ultimately, the data collected for this project represent a unique data set which contributes to build a better understanding of the tip leakage flow field and its associated loss mechanisms. These data will facilitate future engine design goals leading to small blade heights in the rear stages of high pressure compressors and aid in the development of new blade designs which are desensitized to the performance penalties attributed to rotor tip leakage flows...|$|E

Among the various technologies which are currently proposed for DG, micro {{combined heat and power}} (microCHP), defined as the process of producing both electricity and usable thermal energy at high efficiency and near the point of use, could play a very relevant role, because it positively integrates technological as well as cultural and institutional components, related to the potential for reducing the ecological impact of electricity conversion. Micro gas turbines offer many potential advantages in comparison to other conversion technologies suitable for microCHP applications, such as compact size and high specific power; small number of moving parts; low vibrations and noise; low maintenance requirements, which lead to low maintenance costs; high fuel flexibility; possibly short delivery time and very low emissions; modularity; high-grade residual thermal energy. The main components of a CHP unit based on a micro turbine are the compressor, the turbine, the combustor, the recuperator, the generator, and the heat recovery unit. In the size range of micro gas turbines, radial-flow components are usually adopted for the turbomachinery, since they offer minimum surface and end-wall losses, and provide the highest efficiency. Centrifugal compressors also provide very high pressure ratio per stage, are less expensive to manufacture, and are similar in terms of design and volume flow rate to those adopted for automotive turbochargers, whose market is currently around two millions units per year, and is therefore characterized by relatively low production costs. The use of single-shaft radial turbomachinery for micro turbines allows thus for simple designs, with satisfiying aerothermodynamic and economic constraints, thanks to the evolution that automotive turbochargers have experienced in the past seventy years. Furthermore, the introduction of advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools and of innovative materials in recent years has led to a marked improvement in the current state-of-the-art technology of small turbochargers. However, according to some authors, the efficiency levels of centrifugal compressors have almost "stalled" after years of development, while further improvements by means of CFD methodologies would likely to be only incremental. Nevertheless, improvements in micro turbines performance through suitable modifications of turbocharger technology are to be expected, especially considering that turbochargers usually employ centrifugal compressors with vaneless diffusers in order to maximize the flow range and minimize production costs, wherelse gas turbines require higher efficiency and pressure ratio for a much narrower operating range. Moreover, further engineering challenges are related to the so-called small-scale effects. These are due to i) relatively high viscous losses because of low Reynolds numbers; ii) high relative tip clearance (i. e., the ratio of the tip clearance to the blade height at the impeller outlet) due to manufacturing tolerances; iii) high heat losses, because of large area-to-volume ratios; iv) relative large size-independent losses, such as those from bearings and auxiliaries, given the low power output. As a consequence, the main objectives of this work are 1. To develop novel methodologies which allow understanding the flow structure and loss mechanisms of very small centrifugal compressors, and identifying those aspects whose improvement can lead to higher micro compressor performance. 2. To analyze and quantify the influence of the tip clearance on the performance and flow properties of micro compressors, since the unshrouded impellers used in automotive turbochargers suffer from efficiency decrements, because of the pressure losses and secondary flows caused by very large <b>clearance</b> <b>gaps.</b> 3. To design and build a test-rig for the automatic acquisition of the performance maps of very small centrifugal compressors, and for testing either future, new configurations which aim to improve the performance of an exemplary micro turbine compressor, or other very small centrifugal compressors. 4. To develop an original optimization methodology for turbomachinery components, to be further utilized for the improvement of the performance of an exemplary micro turbine compressor, through the investigation of vaned diffusers, which are claimed to exhibit higher static pressure recovery and efficiency than vaneless diffusers, at the expenses of a narrower operating range. In this study, the recuperated micro gas turbine developed by the Dutch company Micro Turbine Technology B. V. (MTT) has been utilized as an illustrative example. The MTT micro turbine delivers electrical and thermal power output up to 3 and 14 kW, respectively, and will be primarily applied in microCHP units for domestic dwellings. The turbomachinery consists of a commercial off-the-shelf automotive turbocharger, made of a centrifugal compressor, a radial turbine, and oil-lubricated bearings. A cycle study of the MTT recuperated micro gas turbine has been carried out in order {{to assess the impact of}} the centrifugal compressor performance on the system performance. The analysis proved that increasing the performance of the centrifugal compressor adopted for the MTT micro turbine is pivotal in order to achieve higher performance levels of the microCHP system. The main conclusions of the work presented here are summarized as follows: 1. A fully automated optimization methodology has been developed by integrating an optimization algorithm, a geometry generator, a grid generator, a CFD solver, and a post processor. This methodology can be used for the optimization of turbomachinery components, but has been applied here to the design and optimization of vaned diffusers for the exemplarymicro compressor. The optimized vaned diffusers led to increased static pressure recovery, but the compressor efficiency was lower than that of the vaneless configuration, because of larger total pressure losses. 2. The test-rig, which has been designed and built for the automatic acquisition of the performancemaps of very small, high-speed centrifugal compressors, proved to be robust, reliable, and versatile. An experimental campaign has been carried out in order to quantify the aerodynamic performance of the exemplary compressor, and the test data, summarized in the form of performance maps and tables, have been used to validate the results of the numerical analyses shown in this dissertation. Furthermore, the test-rig will be a useful tool in the development of future, new designs which aim at improving the performance of the exemplary micro turbine compressor, and will be utilized to test other very small centrifugal compressors for a variety of different applications. 3. A new one-dimensional (1 D) method for the assessment of the performance (i. e., stage total-to-total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency; impeller inlet and outlet velocity triangles; impeller internal, external, and mixing losses; vaneless diffuser losses; volute losses) of very small centrifugal compressors has been developed on the basis of two very well-known design methodologies, namely the single- and two-zone model. This novel tool combines the advantages of the two, since it distinguishes between high- and low-momentum flows within the impeller bladed passages as possible with the two-zone model, and allows evaluating the impeller loss mechanisms, as possible with the single-zone model. This dissertation is structured as follows. Chapter 1 illustrates the concept, potential, and technology of microCHP within the framework of different energy scenarios. The motivation and scope of this work, and the outline of the dissertation are also given here. Chapter 2 presents the new 1 D method for the assessment of the performance and loss mechanisms of very small centrifugal compressors. The novel methodology has been applied here to the exemplary micro centrifugal compressor. The numerical results computed by this tool have been validated against the experimental results obtained with the test-rig. The comparison has been performed at 190 and 220 krpm, and varying mass flow rate, respectively, and shows a good agreement, since the model is able to capture the pressure ratio and efficiency trends. However, in proximity of the choking condition the difference between the numerical and test data is higher. Furthermore, at the micro turbine design point (i. e., mass flow rate equal to 50 g/s and rotational speed equal to 240 krpm), the model overpredicts the pressure ratio, but underpredicts the efficiency. At the micro turbine design point, it has been calculated that the skin friction losses contribute to the largest efficiency decrease, followed by the mixing losses, and the vaneless diffuser losses. Chapter 3 describes the experimental set-up which has been designed and built for the acquisition of the performance maps of very small, high-speed centrifugal compressors. The compressor impeller is driven by a turbine powered by pressurized air coming from a buffer tank, pressurized in turn by two screw compressors. The shaft speed is varied by a turbine control valve, while further equipment necessary to operate the test-rig was also integrated into the set-up, as well as the instrumentation and data acquisition system. The test-rig can currently accomodate impellers with diameters up to 20 mm, and rotational speeds up to 220 krpm. However, rotational speeds up to 240 krpm (i. e., the micro turbine design point) are deemed within reach with suitable improvements of the compressor test-rig. The uncertainty propagation analysis has also been performed. The results show that for the exemplary micro compressor the static pressure uncertainty highly influences both the pressure ratio and efficiency uncertainties. In particular, the uncertainty of the compressor inlet static pressure is preponderant with respect to that of the outlet static pressure. Substituting the actual pressure transmitters with ones having better accuracy and lower full scale would therefore reduce the uncertainties of the final results. On the contrary, the total temperature uncertainty contributes to the efficiency uncertainty to a lower degree, while the mass flow rate uncertainty does not have any impact at all on the uncertainties of the final results. Chapter 4 shows the numerical study performed with a commercial CFD code which solves the three-dimensional (3 D) Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. Steady-state simulations of the exemplary centrifugal compressor have been carried out to approximate the real, time-dependent flow physics with satisfactory results and shorter computational time with respect to an unsteady approach. The results of the numerical analysis, which has been performed at the micro turbine design point, show that the flow separates due to the supersonic relative Mach number at the impeller blades tip. Subsequently, a low-velocity region develops on the blades suction side, enlarges along the streamwise direction, and leads to the generation of high losses in proximity of the impeller outlet, at the shroud. Furthermore, the calculated static pressure recovery coefficient of the vaneless diffuser of the exemplary compressor stage is equal to 0. 4. It is thus located at the lower end of the ranges documented in the literature. Finally, it has been calculated that for every 1 %-increase of the impeller tip clearance, the stage total-to-total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency decrease by 1. 3 %and 0. 6 %, respectively. The impeller efficiency drop due to the impeller tip clearance is two times larger than the loss documented in the literature for larger centrifugal impellers. Chapter 5 describes the influence of the diffuser on the compressor performance. Firstly, an overview of the impeller outlet flow phenomena is given, in order to identify their effects on the downstream flow field. A brief description of the two main categories of diffusers (i. e., vaneless and vaned) follows. Finally, the most important design parameters of a vaned diffuser are highlighted. Chapter 6 illustrates the developed optimization methodology. Firstly, the optimization of vaned diffusers has been performed by coupling a genetic algorithm (GA) to a in-house two-dimensional Euler CFD code, in order to test this optimization strategy. Secondly, the GA has been coupled to a commercial 3 D RANS CFD code, in order to account for the viscous effects and the impeller-diffuser interaction. In this case, the GA has been assisted by a Kriging metamodel, in order to reduce the computational costs, while a multi-objective problem has been solved by minimizing, separately and simultaneously, a function of the stage total-to-static pressure ratio, and a function of the stage total-to-total isentropic efficiency. The relative position of the vanes between the diffuser inlet and outlet, their inclination with respect to the radial direction at the leading and trailing edges, the diffuser outlet radius, and the vane number have been selected as design variables. At first, the optimization methodology has been utilized to design vaned diffusers for the exemplary compressor, at the micro turbine design point. In this case, the efficiency of the simulated most efficient optimized vaned diffuser is 1. 9 % lower than that of the vaneless diffuser. The vaned diffuser however exhibits a 7. 4 %-higher static pressure recovery. Subsequently, a larger impeller diameter, which delivers a higher pressure ratio at the same rotational speed, has been considered. At the micro turbine design point, the efficiency and static pressure recovery of the simulated most efficient optimized vaned diffuser are respectively 1. 8 % and 16. 6 % higher than those of the vaneless configuration. As a consequence, the use of vaned diffusers with a low-pressure pressure ratio compressor is beneficial only in terms of static pressure recovery, while a reduction of the friction losses, leading to increased efficiencies, can be achieved only in the case of high dinamic heads available at the diffuser inlet, due to larger impellers. Chapter 7 draws the conclusions regarding the work presented in this dissertation, while recommendations are suggested for future research activities.

The typical strategy to dene a complete 3 D compressor geometry is to use CFD models in combination with an optimization tool. The general problem with {{this is that the}} optimization requires many CFD evaluations and the more physically correct the CFD model is, the more computationally costly it becomes. Therefore the complexity of the CFD model {{at this stage of the}} design process must be kept relatively low in order to meet the targeted development cost and time. When the most promising designs have been identified, a more physically correct but more computationally heavy model is used to verify the compressor performance. Up to the present however, there has been no CFD model capable of fully capture the flow physics in compressors while being computationally cheap enough to be used for design. A particular challenge in this is to accurately predict the impact of the rotor tip <b>clearance</b> <b>gap.</b> In this thesis the aim has been to validate both simplied and detailed CFD models with experimental data on a low-speed axial compressor researched within the LEMCOTEC project.
