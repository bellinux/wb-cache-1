The patient in the present report is a 6. 5 -year-old girl, who suffered a severe brachial plexus injury at birth and had many reconstructive surgical procedures at an outside brachial plexus center before presenting to us. Discussion. The traditional surgical treatments by other surgical groups were unsuccessful and therefore the patient came to our clinic for further treatment. She had triangle tilt surgery with us, as a salvage procedure. Conclusion. The OBPI patient in this study <b>clearly</b> showed <b>noticeable</b> clinical and functional improvements after triangle tilt surgical management. The posture of the arm at rest was greatly improved to a more normal position, and hand to mouth movement was improved as well.

40|$|The prefaces which Calvin {{wrote for}} the Bible {{translation}} of Olivétan (1535) conform to the general custom during the Reformation to translate the Bible into the vernacular and to publish these translations simultaneously with interpretation aids. In the preface published in the Olivétan Bible and preceding the New Testament translation, Calvin wants to indicate to the reader (in this case the heathen) the correct way to approach the Bible. Although no captions or headings are included, the preface is structured very precisely, thus also presenting Calvin’s systematic kind of exposition. In order to show the heathen the way to salvation, Calvin indicates a way via prehistory (Gen. 1 - 11; Rom. 1 - 2; Acts 14 and 17), the Ten Commandments (Decalogue) to the New Testament witness about Christ. The focus and goal of this path are the fulfilment of the law. <b>Clearly</b> the most <b>noticeable</b> result of the analysis of this preface is the “system of corresponding doctrines” found between creation and salvation. This specific approach of Calvin {{is a key to}} understanding his later theology. In {{the second part of the}} preface Calvin explains the main Biblical concepts of “Testament”, “Evangelium” and “Messiah”. Regarding this his view corresponds to Luther’s writing, “De captivitate Babylonica [...] . ” (1520), and is perhaps dependent on it. The third part of the preface contains admonitions to Christians who are persecuted to assure them of their salvation.

40|$|Antimicrobial (AM) films {{containing}} naturally-derived AM agents, thymol or carvacrol, were developed. These {{agents were}} incorporated into a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) substrate using the techniques of both compression moulding and extrusion film blowing. Different film formulations containing additive polymers, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), were investigated for their potential to enhance the retention and to control {{the release of the}} AM agents from the films. The physical and mechanical properties of the films were evaluated in order to assess the effect that the addition of AM agent has on the ultimate properties of the film. The extruded films were also studied for AM agent release and retention during storage. Films were tested for AM activity in-vitro enabling the optimum concentrations for AM activity to be obtained and the effect of AM films on the bacterial inhibition in liquid media to be successfully modelled. The effects of combined AM systems in LDPE/EVA-based films were also studied. Having identified the AM activity in laboratory media, the films were then used to package Cheddar cheese in order to assess the usefulness of AM films in the enhancement of food preservation. The AM films had a positive effect on the microbial and physio-chemical attributes of Cheddar cheese under actual storage conditions.

40|$|Artistic temporality in a {{work has}} two functions: the semantic  – as a time motif, and {{compositional}} – {{as a means of}} building a model of the world at all of its levels. The author of the article discusses how this description is evident in the lyrical works of Taras Shevchenko. As an author (including the category of “proper author”), Shevchen ko does not convey the real course of events of a historical period or event, but rather experiences time by assigning events in his mind to a certain temporality  – consisting of the past, present, and future, with their interplay, movement, and juxtapositions, imbuing this temporal scheme into his works on a thematic level, which differs accor ding to genre  – the works of Shevchenko <b>clearly</b> show a <b>noticeable</b> connection between temporal composition and the genre variety of the poetry, with various resultant com binations. Thus, artistic temporality in Shevchenko’s lyrical works is a significant factor of the “complex structure of meaning ” (Lotman). Key Words: Taras Shevchenko, narration, artistic temporality, symbol, literary semiotics, structuralism. Artistic temporality {{in a work}} has two functions: the semantic  – as a time motif, and compositional  – as a means of building a model of the world at all of its levels. Considering the motif of time in Shevchenko, V. Movchaniuk states: “A contentthemed aspect of the category of time in literature is associated not only with philosophicalpsychological, ethical, and religious issues in general, but also with the problem of the literary hero, whose worldview objectifies the author’s creative intentions, his view of life, social and historical processes, and the characteristics of the experience of time.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an extensive vertical and longitudinal {{description of the}} biogeochemistry in the whole Mediterranean Sea during the summer 2008. During this strong stratified period, the distribution of nutrients, particulate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP) were investigated along a 3000 km transect (BOUM cruise) crossing the Western and Eastern Mediterranean basins. The partitioning of chemical C, N and P species among all these mineral and organic pools has been analysed to produce a detailed spatial and vertical extended examination of the elemental stoichiometry. Surface Mediterranean waters were depleted in nutrients and the thickness of this depleted layer increased towards the East from about 10 m in the Gulf of Lion to more than 100 m in the Levantine basin, concomitantly to the gradual deepening of the thermocline and nutriclines. We used threshold in oxygen concentration to discriminate the water column in three layers; surface (Biogenic Layer BL), intermediate (Mineralization Layer ML), and deep layer (DL) and to propose a schematic representation of biogeochemical fluxes between the different compartments and to compare {{the functioning of the}} two basins. The stoichiometry revealed a clear longitudinal and vertical gradient in the mineral fraction with a P-depletion evidenced on both dimension. As a consequence of the severe deficiency in phosphorus, the C:N:P ratios in all pools within the BL largely exceed the Redfield ratios. Despite these gradients, the deep estimated fluxes in the mineral compartment tend towards the canonical Redfield values in both basins. A change in particulate matter composition has been evidenced by a C increase relative to N and P along the whole water column in the western basin and between BL and ML in the eastern one. More surprisingly, a decrease in N relative to P with depth was encountered in the whole Mediterranean Sea. We suggest that there was a more rapid recycling of N than P in intermediate waters (below BL) and a complete use of DOP in surface waters. DOC accumulated in surface waters according to the oligotrophic status but {{this was not the case}} for nitrogen nor phosphorus. Our data <b>clearly</b> showed a <b>noticeable</b> stability of the DOC:DON ratio (12 – 13) in the whole Mediterranean Sea, contradicting the fact that N is recycled faster than C in the DOM but in agreement with a P limitation of bacterial activity. Finally, comparisons between these elemental distributions and ratios along the West-East Mediterranean gradient of trophic status provide new insights for identifying and understanding fundamental interactions between marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems, which will help to predict the impacts of environmental climate changes on the Mediterranean marine ecosystems. Indeed, the outflowing through the various Mediterranean straits have been shown to be changing, the functioning of the BL ecosystem could be impacted, not only by changes in nutrients surface sources but also by changes in deep nutrients one...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{reports on}} the media {{saturation}} experienced by the twenty-first century student have brought about an increased interest in focusing attention {{on the issue of}} visual literacy in today 2 ̆ 7 s schools. Concepts such as instructional personalization, where approaches to curriculum design and instruction are created to concentrate on the individual strengths of the learner, have been promoted by some as a path to improving overall student performance. Many believe that the content of the Social Studies classroom easily lends itself to a visually stimulating approach and as such is an ideal laboratory to test hypotheses on such an approach. This study examines the use of one such visual tool in the Social Studies content arena, the political cartoon. Political cartoons are believed to be ideally suited to appeal to the visually oriented characteristics of the millennial student {{in the form of a}} potentially content rich primary source document. Described within the pages of this paper are the unique experiences with using political cartoons from the perspective of both middle school American History students and their teacher. The qualitative data uncovered through the collection of these experiences <b>clearly</b> illustrates a <b>noticeable</b> disparity between teacher and student experiences with cartoons from the present and their counterparts from the past. While present day cartoons covering various recent events in the news elicited an impressive level of informational recall and personal connections to the topics covered, the results were considerably less spectacular when political cartoons from the distant past were utilized. Those older images were more difficult for the students to grasp the artist 2 ̆ 7 s intent and failed as an opportunity for the students to demonstrate their mastery of content knowledge. It was concluded through an examination of interviews from both teacher and student that the differences observed between the older and newer images may be a function of several factors. Chief among these possible explanations from the point of view of the student was the lifelong collection of experiences that each child brought with them to the process of analyzing a political cartoon. The unique cultural capital possessed by each student as a result of their daily, almost nonstop exposure to all forms of media created a personal connection to the modern material that could not be matched by the content from the past. It was also revealed to be possible that a portion of the blame for the difficulties experienced with the materials from the past could be the result of the day to day decisions made by this one particular classroom teacher. The time and dedication to the mastery of the content knowledge and procedural skills necessary to decipher political cartoons from the past may have been insufficient to the task at hand. Conclusions drawn from the information collected in these interviews focus on decreasing the discrepancy between the two forms of visual material by taking steps that include considerable work on the part of the teacher and student to improve upon the background content knowledge and processing skills necessary to consistently decipher the information contained within the political cartoons. Such steps may prove to be impractical given the nature of the already jam-packed curriculums and time-strapped teachers that populate today 2 ̆ 7 s Social Studies classrooms. Additional studies would be necessary to determine if the experiences viewed here are common to those encountered in other parts of the nation or if they are indeed uniquely characteristic of this one situation. Accordingly, the results of those additional studies would possibly initiate a reevaluation of the conclusions drawn here...|$|R
