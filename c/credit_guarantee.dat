40|$|We analyze asset-backed {{commercial}} paper conduits which {{played a central}} role in the early phase of the financial crisis of 2007 - 09. We document that commercial banks set up conduits to securitize assets while insuring the newly securitized assets using <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees.</b> The <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees</b> were structured to reduce bank capital requirements, while providing recourse to bank balance sheets for outside investors. Consistent with such recourse, we find that banks with more exposure to conduits had lower stock returns at the start of the financial crisis; that during the first year of the crisis, asset-backed {{commercial paper}} spreads increased and issuance fell, especially for conduits with weaker <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees</b> and riskier banks; and that losses from conduits mostly remained with banks rather than outside investors. These results suggest that banks used this form of securitization to concentrate, rather than disperse, financial risks in the banking sector while reducing their capital requirements. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the impact of}} public export <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees</b> on firms' exports. Earlier studies show that export <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees</b> stimulate exports, employment, and value added. Furthermore, there is {{evidence}} at the aggregate level that financial market imperfections are key to understanding the beneficial effects of this policy instrument. We use monthly firm-level survey data combined with official transaction-level data on covered exports of German firms to analyze in detail {{the hypothesis that the}} positive effects are due to mitigated financial constraints. Considering exporter and importer characteristics, as well as transaction-specific characteristics, we shed light on the particular sources of financing constraints that can be alleviated by the policy instrument. We find that positive effects are stronger at times when refinancing conditions for the private sector are tight. Furthermore, our results indicate that small firms and firms with little liquid means benefit more, and that the public guarantees matter especially for contracts involving large values at risk. Our analysis contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the interplay between export <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees</b> and financial market imperfections, which is crucial for an efficient policy design...|$|R
