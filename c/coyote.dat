5|$|The <b>coyote</b> {{plays a role}} {{in various}} mythologies and {{creation}} myths of Native American folklore. It is variously credited for having brought fire to humanity, releasing the bison into the world, and of having slain monsters by petrifying them. The Maidu creation myth has the <b>coyote</b> introducing work, suffering, and death to the world. Zuni folklore has the <b>coyote</b> bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the kachinas. Some tribes, such as the Chinook, Maidu, Paiute, Pawnee, Tohono O'odham, and Ute portray the <b>coyote</b> as the companion of the creator. In the Paiute creation myth, the <b>coyote</b> was created by the wolf as a companion, and the two created land by piling soil on the water-covered world. A Tohono O'odham flood myth has the <b>coyote</b> helping Montezuma survive a global deluge that destroys humanity. After the Great Mystery creates humanity, the <b>coyote</b> and Montezuma teach people how to live. The Crow creation myth portrays Old Man <b>Coyote</b> as the creator. In Navajo mythology, the <b>coyote</b> was present in the First World with First Man and First Woman, though a different version has it being created in the Fourth World. The Navajo <b>coyote</b> brings death into the world, explaining that without death, too many people would exist, thus no room to plant corn.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes were {{occasionally}} {{eaten by}} trappers and mountain men during the western expansion. Coyotes sometimes {{featured in the}} feasts of the Plains Indians, and <b>coyote</b> pups were eaten by the indigenous people of San Gabriel, California. The taste of <b>coyote</b> meat has been likened {{to that of the}} wolf, and is more tender than pork when boiled. <b>Coyote</b> fat, when taken in the fall, has been used on occasion to grease leather or eaten as a spread.|$|E
5|$|The <b>coyote</b> {{features}} prominently as a trickster {{figure in}} the folktales of America's indigenous peoples, alternately assuming {{the form of an}} actual <b>coyote</b> or a man. As with other trickster figures, the <b>coyote</b> acts as a picaresque hero which rebels against social convention through deception and humor. The <b>coyote</b> was likely given its trickster role in light of the actual animal's intelligence and adaptability; pre-Columbian American people observed its behavior, and their folkloric representations reflected its attributes. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike the gray wolf, which has undergone a radical improvement of its public image, cultural attitudes towards the <b>coyote</b> remain largely negative.|$|E

25|$|Sheep flight {{behavior}} is cited in one major study in California {{as the major}} stimulus responsible for eliciting predatory behavior in <b>coyotes.</b> Even <b>coyotes</b> that had not previously been exposed to sheep demonstrated predatory behavior when exposed to {{them for the first}} time. Of particular interest was that <b>coyotes</b> with no previous prey-killing experience readily attacked and killed sheep when given the chance. The <b>coyotes</b> were likely to attack sheep that exhibited flight behavior even when these <b>coyotes</b> were not hungry. The same study also determined that dominant <b>coyotes</b> were more likely to attack sheep.|$|R

5|$|The <b>coyote</b> is a {{prominent}} character in Native American folklore, {{mainly in the}} Southwestern United States and Mexico, usually depicted as a trickster that alternately assumes {{the form of an}} actual <b>coyote</b> or a man. As with other trickster figures, the <b>coyote</b> uses deception and humor to rebel against social conventions. The animal was especially respected in Mesoamerican cosmology as a symbol of military might. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike wolves (gray, eastern, or red), which have undergone an improvement of their public image, attitudes towards the <b>coyote</b> remain largely negative.|$|E
5|$|Tracks are an {{important}} factor in distinguishing <b>coyote</b> from dog predation. <b>Coyote</b> tracks tend to be more oval-shaped and compact than those of domestic dogs, and their claw marks are less prominent and the tracks tend to follow a straight line more closely than those of dogs. With the exception of sighthounds, most dogs of similar weight to coyotes have a slightly shorter stride. <b>Coyote</b> kills can be distinguished from wolf kills by less damage to the underlying tissues in the former. Also, <b>coyote</b> scat tends to be smaller than wolf scat.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the ranges of coyotes and gray wolves overlap, {{interference}} competition and predation by wolves has been hypothesized to limit local <b>coyote</b> densities. <b>Coyote</b> ranges expanded during the 19th and 20th centuries following the extirpation of wolves, while coyotes were driven to extinction on Isle Royale after wolves colonized the island in the 1940s. One study conducted in Yellowstone National Park, where both species coexist, concluded that the <b>coyote</b> population in the Lamar River Valley declined by 39% following the reintroduction of wolves in the 1990s, while <b>coyote</b> populations in wolf inhabited areas of the Grand Teton National Park are 33% lower than in {{areas where the}}y are absent. Wolves have been observed to not tolerate coyotes in their vicinity, though coyotes {{have been known to}} trail wolves to feed on their kills.|$|E

40|$|Expansion of the <b>coyoteâ€™s</b> (Canis latrans) {{distribution}} in North America has included most urban areas. Concerns for human safety {{have resulted in}} the need to understand the spatial relationship between humans and <b>coyotes</b> in urban landscapes. We examined the space use of <b>coyotes</b> with varying degrees of urban development in the Chicago metropolitan area, IL, USA, between March 2000 and December 2002. We compared home-range size, land use, and habitat use of 41 radio-collared <b>coyotes</b> (5 <b>coyotes</b> residing in developed areas, 29 in less-developed areas, and 7 in a matrix of developed and less-developed areas). The partitioning of <b>coyotes</b> into groups based on their level of exposure to urban development allowed us to examine if differences in use of land types by <b>coyotes</b> was evident in our study area. <b>Coyotes</b> in developed areas had home ranges twice the size of animals in less-developed areas. Nonurban habitats were used by all <b>coyotes</b> in the study area, while urban land was avoided. <b>Coyotes</b> in developed areas had large home ranges and high amounts of urban land in their range, but preferred nonurban habitat. This required the <b>coyotes</b> to travel through a matrix of urban land, thus encountering human activity and possibly increasing the risk of conflict with humans. However, <b>coyotes</b> in developed areas avoided crepuscular times when human activity was highest, suggesting that <b>coyotes</b> in developed areas may reduce conflicts with humans by traveling through the matrix of urban land late at night when the risk of contact with humans is lowest. <b>Coyotes</b> in less-developed areas were less affected by human activity at night and likely posed less risk to humans...|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, <b>coyote</b> fur was {{considered}} worthless. This {{changed with the}} diminution of beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became {{a great source of}} income (75 cents to $1.50 per skin) for wolfers in the Great Plains. <b>Coyote</b> pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs, but can be used for coats and jackets, scarves, or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making trimmings, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. <b>Coyote</b> fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E
5|$|The <b>coyote</b> {{feeds on}} a variety of {{different}} produce, including blackberries, blueberries, peaches, pears, apples, prickly pears, chapotes, persimmons, peanuts, watermelons, cantaloupes, and carrots. During the winter and early spring, the <b>coyote</b> eats large quantities of grass, such as green wheat blades. It sometimes eats unusual items such as cotton cake, soybean meal, domestic animal droppings, beans, and cultivated grain such as corn, wheat, and sorghum.|$|E
5|$|Xiaoming Wang and Richard H. Tedford, {{one of the}} {{foremost}} authorities on carnivore evolution, proposed that the genus Canis was the descendant of the coyote-like Eucyon davisi and its remains first appeared in the Miocene 6million years ago (Mya) in the southwestern USA and Mexico. By the Pliocene (5Mya), the larger Canis lepophagus appeared in the same region and by the early Pleistocene (1Mya) C.latrans (the <b>coyote)</b> was in existence. They proposed that the progression from Eucyon davisi to Clepophagus to the <b>coyote</b> was linear evolution. Additionally, C.edwardii, C.latrans, and C. aureus form together a small clade and because C.edwardii appeared earliest spanning the mid-Blancan (late Pliocene) to the close of the Irvingtonian (late Pleistocene), it is proposed as the direct ancestor of the <b>coyote.</b> Johnston describes C.lepophagus as having a more slender skull and skeleton than the modern <b>coyote.</b> Ronald Nowak found that the early populations had small, delicate, narrowly proportioned skulls that resemble small coyotes and appear to be ancestral to C.latrans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of the {{harassment}} of <b>coyotes</b> practiced by rural people, urban <b>coyotes</b> are losing their fear of humans, which is further worsened by people intentionally or unintentionally feeding <b>coyotes.</b> In such situations, some <b>coyotes</b> have begun to act aggressively toward humans, chasing joggers and bicyclists, confronting people walking their dogs, and stalking small children. Non-rabid <b>coyotes</b> in these areas sometimes target small children, mostly under the age of 10, though some adults have been bitten.|$|R

5|$|C. lepophagus was {{a similar}} in weight to modern coyotes, but had shorter limb bones that {{indicates}} a less cursorial lifestyle. The <b>coyote</b> represents a more primitive form of Canis than the gray wolf, {{as shown by}} its relatively small size and its comparatively narrow skull and jaws, which lack the grasping power necessary to hold the large prey in which wolves specialize. This is further corroborated by the coyote's sagittal crest, which is low or totally flattened, thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf's. The <b>coyote</b> is not a specialized carnivore as the wolf is, {{as shown by the}} larger chewing surfaces on the molars, reflecting the species' relative dependence on vegetable matter. In these respects, the <b>coyote</b> resembles the fox-like progenitors of the genus more so than the wolf.|$|E
5|$|Clifford E. Trafzer's A Chemehuevi Song: The Resilience of a Southern Paiute Tribe retells {{the story}} of Sinawavi (Coyote)'s love for Poowavi (Louse).

5|$|Construction of an {{extension}} to Route 115 (Santa Clara Street, now SR 130) at 30th Street in San Jose began in 1939, and {{was completed by}} late 1940. As with the portion between Fourth and 13th Streets, it was not marked as a numbered route. The state legislature authorized {{an extension}} beyond San Jose back to El Camino Real near Ford Road in 1947, which was already under construction, and was completed that year. This was the first segment built with interchanges, and included a median barrier. Despite this, most crossings were at-grade; only the two ends at Route 115 (Santa Clara Street) and regular US 101 included bridges, the former a diamond interchange and the latter a simple split with additional access to Ford Road. It also crossed over <b>Coyote</b> Road, though with no access, {{just south of the}} <b>Coyote</b> Creek bridge. The original 1947 bridge over <b>Coyote</b> Road remains, though widened in 1990, {{and is one of the}} oldest road-road grade separations on the present freeway.|$|E

5|$|Eastern and red wolves {{are also}} {{products}} of {{varying degrees of}} wolf-coyote hybridization. The eastern wolf probably {{was a result of}} a wolf-coyote admixture, combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf populations. The red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf populations in the southeastern United States, forcing a wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent <b>coyote</b> populations to the extent that about 75â€“80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of <b>coyote</b> derivation.|$|E
5|$|In Native American mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with {{the figure of}} the <b>coyote</b> in a theme of duality. Lynx and <b>coyote</b> are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectivelyâ€”two elements representing opposites in Native American folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and <b>coyote</b> as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, LÃ©vi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.|$|E
50|$|Opossums, skunks, raccoons, and <b>coyotes</b> {{can be seen}} in the Goleta and Santa Barbara area. Bobcats {{can also}} be seen. <b>Coyotes</b> {{sometimes}} prey on small domestic pets.

5000|$|Urban <b>coyotes</b> [...] are <b>coyotes</b> that {{reside in}} North American {{metropolitan}} areas (major cities and their suburbs). <b>Coyotes</b> thrive in suburban settings {{and even some}} urban regions, because {{of the availability of}} food and the lack of predators.

5|$|The bobcat prey base {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche. Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and <b>coyote</b> or red fox; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals. However, other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high <b>coyote</b> populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canada lynx, however, the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the bobcat {{is likely to have}} prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative.|$|E
5|$|The <b>coyote</b> is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} gray wolf, but has longer ears and a relatively larger braincase, {{as well as a}} thinner frame, face, and muzzle.

Other <b>coyotes</b> were fed preserved fish samples or administered oral or intraperitoneal treatments of lymph node matter from <b>coyotes</b> that died from SPD.
