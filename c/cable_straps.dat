40|$|An article, such as, but {{not limited}} to, a <b>cable</b> <b>strap</b> to wrap, support, or secure one or more wires or cables, is formed by {{cyclically}} heating and cooling and/or irradiating an article formed of a static dissipative ethylene tetrafluoroethylen (ETFE) resin, to reduce an electrical resistivity and/or to increase a tensile strength of the article...|$|R
40|$|Flexible ribbon <b>cable</b> <b>strap</b> carries {{heat and}} {{electrical}} signals across rotational shaft without creating backlash torques at both extremes of rotation through limited angular range. Keeps its flexibility and nonbacklash properties at cryogenic temperatures. Used to connect delicate equipment, such as movable infrared sensors, requiring precise positioning. Adapted to {{greater or lesser}} angular travel by changing its length and offset and bias of ribbon cables...|$|R
5000|$|Friction. Some attenuators work {{by forcing}} a steel <b>cable</b> or <b>strap</b> through an angled slot or tube, {{converting}} kinetic energy into heat.|$|R
50|$|The camera package {{includes}} a rechargeable Li-ion battery (EN-EL12), battery charger (MH-65), USB cable (UC-E6), audio video <b>cable</b> (EG-CP14), <b>strap</b> (AN-CP19), projector stand (ET-2), and remote control (ML-L4).|$|R
5000|$|Pressure suit joints {{are often}} {{constructed}} of alternating gores and convolutes of material constrained by <b>cables</b> or <b>straps</b> {{along the sides}} of the joint, producing an accordion-like structure that flexes with nearly constant volume to minimize the mechanical work which must be done by the suit occupant.|$|R
50|$|Avalanche nets (snow {{avalanche}} protection nets, snow nets) are flexible snow supporting structures for avalanche control, constructed of steel or nylon <b>cables</b> or <b>straps</b> held by steel poles, optionally supplied with compression anchors downhill. They are {{installed in the}} upper parts of potential avalanche paths to prevent snow from starting to slide into an avalanche, or to retard the slide.|$|R
50|$|A gig bag (or gigbag) is a padded, soft-sided bag {{used for}} the storage and {{transport}} of musical instruments, most commonly a guitar or bass guitar.

50|$|A cable harness, {{also known}} as a wire harness, cable {{assembly}}, wiring assembly or wiring loom, is an assembly of electrical cables or wires which transmit signals or electrical power. The cables are bound together by <b>straps,</b> <b>cable</b> ties, cable lacing, sleeves, electrical tape, conduit, a weave of extruded string, or a combination thereof.|$|R
50|$|The 7-100 {{includes}} hanger buttons for {{a guitar}} strap, allowing a musician {{to carry the}} amplifier while standing or walking. The 7-100 is powered by six AA batteries or an optional AC adapter and weighs between five and six pounds (2.27-2.72 kg). Another feature is the hinged case design, allowing the user not only to store objects like the <b>cable</b> and <b>strap</b> inside the amp, but also to open the case slightly to alter the tone to their preference http://www.pignoseamps.com/?disp=pg&id=story. A feature for the more serious musician is the preamplifier output jack on the rear, allowing it {{to be connected to}} a larger amplifier for use as a guitar distortion effect http://www.pignoseamps.com/?disp=detail&subcat=tubeamps&id=253.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} {{dates to}} at least the 19th century, {{and for a long}} time New York City required that all buildings higher than six stories be equipped with a rooftop water tower. Two companies in New York build water towers, both of which are family businesses in operation since the 19th century.The original water tower builders were barrel makers who expanded their craft to meet a modern need as buildings in the city grew taller in height. Even today, no sealant is used to hold the water in. The wooden walls of the water tower are held together with steel <b>cables</b> or <b>straps,</b> but water leaks through the gaps when first filled. As the water saturates the wood, it swells, the gaps close and become impermeable.|$|R
5000|$|A {{lashing device}} is a rope, wire <b>cable,</b> or <b>strap</b> which wraps around {{the board and}} {{essentially}} ties it up {{with some sort of}} locking device. A simple low cost {{way to do this is}} to wrap chain around the surfboard and secure it with a lock. Board clamping devices are large mechanical pencils that wrap around the board and like the lashing product secure the board by kissing it. Many times these clamping devices can be hard mounted in a truck bed or on the roof of a car to act as a carrying rack. Mechanical attachments to the board hardpoints such as the leash plug and fin box vary widely in their configuration but are generally some sort of attaching mechanism which grabs onto or into the board and then secured with a lock.http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_Lock_A_Surfboard.jpg ...|$|R
50|$|Lashing is the {{securing}} {{of cargo}} for transportation {{with the goal}} of minimizing shifting. Items used for lashing include ropes, <b>cables,</b> wires, chains, <b>strapping,</b> and nets. These items are anchored to the container and tensioned against the cargo. Another form of lashing used four devices attached to the top of each corner of a container. Lashing is products and methods are governed by various authorities such as the Association of American Railroads (AAR) for rail transportation in North America, the international Maritime Organization (IMO) for ocean transportation and the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA).|$|R
50|$|Following World War II, Raytheon {{developed}} the SCR-536's military replacement, the AN/PRC-6. The AN/PRC-6 circuit used 13 vacuum tubes (receiver and transmitter); {{a second set}} of thirteen tubes was supplied with the unit as running spares. The unit was factory set with one crystal which could be changed to a different frequency in the field by replacing the crystal and re-tuning the unit. It used a 24-inch whip antenna. There was an optional handset that could be connected to the AN/PRC-6 by a 5-foot <b>cable.</b> An adjustable <b>strap</b> was provided for carrying and support while operating.|$|R
50|$|The IEC 60601-1 {{standard}} {{requires that}} two independent precautionary measures (Means of Patient Protection, or MOPPs) {{are set in}} place, to protect the patient from electrical shock in the medical system. A network isolator can be constructed to provide one or both required MOPPs. In the case where only a single MOPP is present in a system, a second measure of protection for the medical device must be made. This can be achieved, for example, by installing a fixed, low-resistance earthing <b>cable,</b> bar, or <b>strap,</b> {{referred to as a}} potential equalisation conductor. Conformation to the requirements of applicable standards and guidelines, in particular the IEC 60601-1 standard, involves manufacturers themselves declaring CE compliance and/or gaining certification from an approved independent testing laboratory.|$|R
5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} <b>cable,</b> Peter <b>straps</b> a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him.

Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.|$|R
