40|$|A {{selective}} {{median filter}} which consumes less {{power has been}} designed and different logics for majority bit evaluation has been applied and simulated in VHDL. It is rightly called as selective because an edge pixel detector [2] {{has been used to}} select those pixels which are to be processed through median filter. As for median value calculation; sorting of 3 x 3 window’s pixel values has been done using majority bit circuit [4]. Different majority bit calculation method has been implemented and the result sorting circuit has been analyzed for power analysis. In this work a general median filter which uses binary sorting method known as Majority Voting Circuit (MVC) has been designed using VHDL and optimized using SYNOPSIS which has used 0. 13 μm CMOS technology. The digital design of sorting circuit saves approximately 60 % of power comprising of cell leakage and dynamic power comparing to a mixed signal design of Floating gate based Majority bit median filter [4]. Before operating median filter on each pixel double derivative filter [2] has been applied to check whether it is an edge pixel or not. Overall this is a digital design of a mixed filter which preserves edges and removes noises as well. Low power techniques at logic level and algorithmic level have been embedded into this work. In our work we have also designed a small microprocessor using VHDL code. Later a memory (for the purpose of image storing) based Control Unit for single median value evaluation has been designed and simulated in XILINX. Here for sorting <b>circuit</b> a <b>common</b> logic <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> (component) has been put forward.

To achieve the {{purpose of the}} study, thirty boys’ student in the age group 13 to 14 were selected as subjects at random. The selected subjects were from RCM High School, Natarajapuram, Sivagangai(DT), Tamilnadu. The study was formulated as pre and post-test random group design, in which thirty students were divided into three equal groups. The experimental group- 1 (n= 10, ESbCT) underwent explosive strength <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training, the experimental group- 2 (n= 10, SEbCT) underwent strength endurance <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training and group 3 served as control group (n= 10, CG) did not undergo any specific training.

The speed was selected as dependent variables. The speed was tested by 50 meters run recoded in seconds. The selected two treatment group namely explosive strength <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training and strength endurance <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training were performed five days in week for the period of six weeks, as per the stipulated training programme.

The Scheffe’s post hoc test was used to find out pair-wise comparisons between groups. To test the hypothesis 0. 05 level of significant was fixed in this study.

40|$|The success {{probability}} in an ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> generally decreases exponentially in {{the number}} of qubits consisted in the ancilla. Although the probability can be amplified through the amplitude amplification process, the input dependence of the amplitude amplification makes difficult to sequentially combine two or more ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuits.</b> A new version of the amplitude amplification known as the oblivious amplitude amplification runs independently of the input to the system register. This allow us to to sequentially combine two or more ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuits.</b> However, this type of the amplification only works when the considered system is unitary or non-unitary but somehow close to a unitary. In this paper, we present a general framework to simulate non-unitary matrices on ancilla <b>based</b> quantum <b>circuits</b> in which the success probability is maximized by using the oblivious amplitude amplification. In particular, we show how to extend a non-unitary matrix to an almost unitary matrix. We then simulate the extended matrix by using an ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> design along with the oblivious amplitude amplification. Measuring the distance of the produced matrix to the closest unitary unitary matrix, a lower bound for the fidelity of the final state obtained from the oblivious amplitude amplification process is presented. Numerical simulations for random matrices of different sizes show that independent of the system size, the final amplified probabilities are generally around 0. 75 and the fidelity of the final state is mostly high and around 0. 95. Furthermore, we discuss the complexity analysis and show that combining two such ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuits,</b> a matrix product can be implemented. This may lead us to efficiently implement matrix functions represented as infinite matrix products on quantum computers...|$|R

40|$|Silicon <b>based</b> {{integrated}} <b>circuit</b> (IC) {{technology is}} approaching its physical limits. For sub 10 nm technology nodes, the carbon nanotube (CNT) based {{field effect transistor}} {{has emerged as a}} promising device because of its excellent electronic properties. One of the major challenges faced by the CNT technology is the unwanted growth of metallic tubes. At present, there is no known CNT fabrication technology which allows the fabrication of 100 % semiconducting CNTs. The presence of metallic tubes creates a short between the drain and source terminals of the transistor and has a detrimental impact on the delay, static power and yield of CNT based gates. This thesis will address the challenge of designing robust carbon nanotube <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> in the presence of metallic tubes. For a small percentage of metallic tubes, circuit level solutions are proposed to increase the functional yield of CNT based gates in the presence of metallic tubes. Accurate analytical models with less than a 3 % inaccuracy rate are developed to estimate the yield of CNT <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> for a different percentage of metallic tubes and different drive strengths of logic gates. Moreover, a design methodology is developed for yield-aware carbon nanotube <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> in the presence of metallic tubes using different CNFET transistor configurations. Architecture based on regular logic bricks with underlying hybrid CNFET configurations are developed which gives better trade-offs in terms of performance, power, and functional yield. In the case when the percentage of metallic tubes is large, the proposed circuit level techniques are not sufficient. Extra processing techniques must be applied to remove the metallic tubes. The tube removal techniques have trade-offs, as the removal process is not perfect and removes semiconducting tubes in addition to removing unwanted metallic tubes. As a result, stochastic removal of tubes from the drive and fanout gate(s) results in large variation in the performance of CNFET based gates and in the worst case open circuit gates. A Monte Carlo simulation engine is developed to estimate the impact of the removal of tubes on the performance and power of CNFET based logic gates. For a quick estimation of functional yield of logic gates, accurate analytical models are developed to estimate the functional yield of logic gates when a fraction of the tubes are removed. An efficient tube level redundancy (TLR) is proposed, resulting in a high functional yield of carbon nanotube <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> with minimal overheads in terms of area and power when large fraction of tubes are removed. Furthermore, for applications where parallelism can be utilized we propose to increase the functional yield of the CNFET <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> by increasing the logic depth of gates...|$|R

A method of functional decomposition for single output XOR <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> is presented. It utilizes Gauss Jordan elimination, a method based on linearity, to decompose the circuits. The method was tested on a set of MCNC benchmark circuits in Blif format, and was successful in decomposing circuits efficiently.
