5|$|Discus {{is one of}} {{the events}} where the athlete has to throw a heavy disc in the attempt to mark a farther {{distance}} than their competitors. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy <b>circular</b> <b>disc</b> was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2kg (4.4pounds) in weight and 22cm (8inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928., although they had been competing at some national and regional levels previously.The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete Frantisek Janda-Suk. He invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus.|$|E

25|$|The use of plate fibulae {{continued}} in the 2nd century CE. Simple flat shapes were replaced with enamelled versions or more complex shapes. These included animal (zoomorphic) shapes (birds, horses, rabbits, flies, etc.), letters or words, abstract symmetrical or asymmetrical designs (including the so-called Celtic Trumpet designs), and skeuomorphic designs (symbolic designs). Most designs {{continued in}} use throughout the 2nd and 3rd centuries. In one later variation during this time, the Tutulus type, the <b>circular</b> <b>disc</b> plate was extended upwards to form a cone.|$|E

25|$|In Mesopotamian iconography, {{the most}} common symbol of Ishtar is an eight-pointed star, though {{the exact number of}} points {{sometimes}} varies. Six-pointed stars also occur frequently, but their symbolic meaning is unknown. The eight-pointed star was originally associated with Inanna and seems to have originally borne a general association with the heavens, but, by the Old Babylonian Period, it had come to be specifically associated with the planet Venus, with which Ishtar was identified. Starting during this same period, the star of Ishtar was normally enclosed within a <b>circular</b> <b>disc.</b>|$|E
500|$|The gills appear closely spaced in {{unexpanded}} caps, {{but usually}} more distant in old individuals. Between 8 and 16 gills extend from the margin to the stipe; there are additionally {{one or two}} tiers of small gills (lamellulae) that do not reach fully from the margin to the stipe. The gills are narrow but become [...] (swelling in the middle) and sometimes very broad in age, and are attached by a line or are very narrowly adnate. Sometimes the gills split away from the stipe while remaining attached to each other; in this way they form a collar around the stipe. Gills are pale gray but soon become whitish, with even edges. The stipe is [...] long, 0.5â€“1mm thick, and, above {{the level of the}} flat <b>circular</b> <b>disc</b> at the base, is equal in width throughout. The stipe is covered with fine white scattered fibrils, or is delicately [...] (as if covered with a fine white powder), but it later becomes smooth. Its color is bluish-gray when fresh but soon it fades to gray. The basal disc is grooved (from gill impressions) and pruinose or covered with fine minute hairs, but soon becomes smooth. The insubstantial fruit bodies are considered inedible.|$|E

Before the performance, she announced [...] "I feel like I've {{waited a long}} time to come here. And I feel very grateful.... For the first time ever, I'm going to sing 'Marry the Night'." [...] She sat on the piano and played a slow version of the song, accompanied by a sitar. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Gaga gave her first televised performance of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] dressed as a satellite landing on the moon. Wearing a red bikini, and a large red disc around her, Gaga was perched atop a semi-circular replica of the moon which was covered in silver chains. Flames erupted around the stage as Gaga revealed another <b>circular</b> <b>disc</b> covering her face. She sang the song from that vantage point and near the end of the performance, removed the metal disc and {{performed a}} choreographed dance routine with her back-up dancers. She also performed the song at the 2011 Bambi Awards in Wiesbaden, Germany, on November 10. The stage included a vintage convertible with a keyboard built into the side of the door and Gaga also won an award later that night at the gala.|$|E

2500|$|Bell's {{telephone}} transmitter (microphone) {{consisted of a}} double electromagnet, in front of which a membrane, stretched on a ring, carried an oblong piece of soft iron cemented to its middle. A funnel-shaped mouthpiece directed the voice sounds upon the membrane, and as it vibrated, the soft iron [...] "armature" [...] induced corresponding currents in the coils of the electromagnet. These currents, after traversing the wire, passed through the receiver which consisted of an electromagnet in a tubular metal can having one end partially closed by a thin <b>circular</b> <b>disc</b> of soft iron. When the undulatory current passed through the coil of this electromagnet, the disc vibrated, thereby creating sound waves in the air.|$|E
2500|$|The {{specimens}} first collected were roughly mushroom-shaped, {{and with}} a mostly asymmetrical structure. So far no sex organs or nervous system has been detected. The specimens consist of a flattened, somewhat <b>circular</b> <b>disc</b> and a stalk with what was originally interpreted as mouth on the end, surrounded by lobes. The [...] "mouth" [...] {{on the end of}} the stalk leads to what was presumed to be a digestive canal that forks repeatedly when it reaches the disc. The individuals have an outer skin, with what was taken to be a stomach separated from the skin by a layer of dense gelatinous material (mesoglea). The stalks measure up to 8 millimeters in length, while the disc ranges from 11 to 17 mm in diameter, although the original specimens experienced significant shrinkage in full-strength ethanol after measurements were made.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{rigorous}} analysis of three stacked circular microstrip patches {{is performed using}} a dyadic Greenâ€™s functions formulation. The <b>circular</b> <b>discs</b> are embedded in a multilayered substrate containing isotropic and/or uniaxial anisotropic materials. A very efficient technique to derive the dyadic Greenâ€™s functions of the stacked configuration in the vector Hankel transform domain is proposed. The complete orthogonal set of transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) modes of a cylindrical cavity with magnetic side walls and electric top and bottom walls {{is used in the}} approximation of the unknown current densities on the <b>circular</b> <b>discs.</b> Numerical results obtained for the resonant frequencies are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data available in the literature...|$|R
2500|$|The optimum illumination, {{taking into}} account both {{exposure}} dose and focus windows, is a strong function of pitch in the range between 32 nm and 48 nm, which is {{where most of the}} work on EUV application has been focused. For pitches larger than 44 nm, the illumination pupil shape is preferably conventional, which is a <b>circular</b> <b>disc,</b> possibly including a central obscuration to provide an annular appearance. For pitches in the range 44 nm down to 34 nm, the optimum shape is no longer conventional or annular but more shaped like the [...] "quasar" [...] (Quadrupole-shaped annular) source, i.e., an arc within each quadrant of the pupil. For pitches of 32 nm and below, the optimum illumination becomes more dipole like, i.e., concentrated toward the top and bottom or the left and right ends of the pupil. When source-mask optimization is performed, the resulting shape will resemble the closest of the standard set (conventional, annular, quasar, dipole). For pitches less than 41 nm, the central portion of the pupil must be excluded for a tool with NA=0.33, as 13.5 nm EUV light going through that portion would only contribute the zeroth diffraction order (unscattered light), effectively adding flare.|$|E
2500|$|Identification of Trains and Routing Automatically (IDENTRA) was {{implemented}} {{on the line}} in the 1957 and used until 1997, when a route selector punch box with B1 Astoria, local/express buttons was installed at the 10/11 car marker on the upper level of Queensboro Plaza. IDENTRA used a removable round <b>circular</b> <b>disc</b> type radio antenna assembly, slide-mounted on the small mounting brackets that were attached on the front of R12, R14, R15, and R17 cars that were assigned to the 7 route, which had been used on the line since 1948. Similar to the use of radio transponders in the CBTC installation, the system used the antennas to determine whether a train was running local or express, and then accordingly switched the track at interlockings near the Queensboro Plaza and Flushingâ€“Main Street stations. This move reduced the number of signal towers on the line from 9 to 2 and allowed to operate 37 eleven-car trains instead of only 30 nine-car trains per hour. The consolidated signal system was in use by 1956 while the selector system was in service by 1958. This system, still in use by many transit agencies such as SEPTA's Broad Street Line, is also nicknamed the [...] "toilet seat" [...] because the removable disc antenna is shaped like a toilet seat.|$|E
2500|$|A {{new form}} of the image, which from the rare early {{versions}} {{seems to have been}} formulated in 6th-century Palestine, was to set the essential form of Eastern Orthodox images down to the present day. The setting is now a cave â€“ or rather the specific Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem, already underneath the Church of the Nativity, and well-established as a place of pilgrimage, with the approval of the Church. Above the opening a mountain, represented in miniature, rises up. Mary now lies recovering on a large stuffed cushion or couch ("kline" [...] in Greek) beside the infant, who is on a raised structure, whilst Joseph rests his head on his hand. He is often part of a separate scene in the foreground, where Jesus is being bathed by midwives (Jesus is therefore shown twice). Despite the less than ideal conditions, Mary is lying-in, the term for the period of enforced bed rest in the postpartum period after childbirth that was prescribed until modern times. [...] The midwife or midwives come from early apocryphal sources; the main one is usually called Salome, and has her own miracle of the withered hand, although this is rare in art. They featured in most medieval dramas and mystery plays of the Nativity, which often influenced painted depictions. Several apocryphal accounts speak of a great light illuminating the scene, also taken to be the star of the Magi, and this is indicated by a <b>circular</b> <b>disc</b> {{at the top of the}} scene, with a band coming straight down from it â€“ both are often dark in colour.|$|E

40|$|An {{internal}} failure mode for a soil-nailed system consists of failure at nail heads, slope facing, nail strength, along groutâ€“soil interface and pullout failure. A {{better understanding of}} pullout of soil nail thus becomes important to assess the stability of a soil-nailed system. In the present study, {{an investigation into the}} pullout behaviour of soil nail with <b>circular</b> <b>discs</b> along the shaft has been carried out by a three-dimensional finite element analysis using Abaqus/Explicit routine. A total of 67 simulations have been performed to accurately predict the pullout behaviour of soil nail. The soil nail under study has <b>circular</b> <b>discs</b> along its shaft varying in numbers from 1 to 4. The pullout of this soil nail in a pullout test box has been simulated with a constant overburden pressure of 20 Â kPa acting on the nail. The pullout loadâ€“displacement characteristics, stresses around soil nail and failure mechanism during pullout are studied. Variations of dimensionless factors such as normalised pullout load factor and bearing capacity factor have been obtained with different combinations of parameters in terms of relative disc spacing ratio, anchorage length ratio, embedment ratio, diameter ratio and displacement ratio. From the results of analyses, it is found that nail with more <b>circular</b> <b>discs</b> requires higher pullout load. There are critical relative disc spacing ratio and diameter ratio which significantly affect the pullout behaviour of nail...|$|R

60|$|To start with, {{he places}} {{one of two}} identically {{constructed}} clocks at {{the centre of the}} <b>circular</b> <b>disc,</b> and the other {{on the edge of the}} disc, so that they are at rest relative to it. We now ask ourselves whether both clocks go at the same rate from the standpoint of the non-rotating Galileian reference-body K. As judged from this body, the clock at the centre of the disc has no velocity, whereas the clock at the edge of the disc is in motion relative to K in consequence of the rotation. According to a result obtained in Section 12, it follows that the latter clock goes at a rate permanently slower than that of the clock at the centre of the <b>circular</b> <b>disc,</b> i.e. as observed from K. It is obvious that the same effect would be noted by an observer whom we will imagine sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the <b>circular</b> <b>disc.</b> Thus on our <b>circular</b> <b>disc,</b> or, to make the case more general, in every gravitational field, a clock will go more quickly or less quickly, according to the position in which the clock is situated (at rest). For this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable definition of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest with respect to the body of reference. A similar difficulty presents itself when we attempt to apply our earlier definition of simultaneity in such a case, but I do not wish to go any farther into this question.|$|E

Castings when first ejected are viscid and soft; during rain, at which time worms apparently prefer to eject them, they are still softer; so that I have sometimes thought that worms must swallow much water at such times. However this may be, rain, even when not very heavy, if long continued, renders recently-ejected castings semi-fluid; and on level ground they then spread out into thin, circular, flat discs, exactly as would so much honey or very soft mortar, with all traces of their vermiform structure lost. This latter fact was sometimes made evident, when a worm had subsequently bored through a flat <b>circular</b> <b>disc</b> of this kind, and heaped up a fresh vermiform mass in the centre. These flat subsided discs have been repeatedly seen by me after heavy rain, in many places on land of all kinds.|$|E
