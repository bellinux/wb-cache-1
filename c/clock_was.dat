5|$|The {{place where}} the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh fenjaan. Usually {{this would be the}} top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another {{time-keeping}} tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 2005 Trafalgar Square {{hosted the}} {{announcement}} of London's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. A countdown <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> erected in March 2011, although engineering and weather-related faults caused it to stop a day later.

50|$|An {{electric}} <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> a <b>clock</b> that <b>is</b> {{powered by}} electricity, {{as opposed to}} a mechanical <b>clock</b> which <b>is</b> powered by a hanging weight or a mainspring. The term is often applied to the electrically powered mechanical <b>clocks</b> that <b>were</b> used before quartz <b>clocks</b> <b>were</b> introduced in the 1980s. The first experimental electric <b>clocks</b> <b>were</b> constructed around 1840, but they were not widely manufactured until mains electric power became available in the 1890s. In the 1930s the synchronous electric clock replaced mechanical clocks as the most widely used type of clock.|$|R

5|$|From 1996 to 2006, Nissin Foods {{operated}} a Cup Noodles billboard with smoke effects (an effect that {{had also been}} famously used by other Times Square billboards, such as the Camel Cigarettes sign). The Cup Noodles billboard was replaced in 2006 by a General Motors billboard featuring a Chevrolet branded clock; however, {{as a part of}} cutbacks resulting from GM's bankruptcy and re-organization, the Chevrolet <b>Clock</b> <b>was</b> removed in 2009 and eventually replaced by the current Dunkin' Donuts display.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, the Zytglogge {{and the other}} Bernese gate towers were {{extended}} and decorated after the Burgundian Romantic fashion. The Zytglogge received a new lantern (including the metal bellman visible today), four decorative corner towerlets, heraldic decorations and probably its stair tower. The astronomical <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> extended to its current state. In 1527–30, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner, and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} during Amenhotep I's reign the first water <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> invented. Amenhotep's court {{astronomer}} Amenemheb took credit for creating this device in his tomb biography, although the oldest surviving mechanism {{dates to the}} reign of Amenhotep III. This invention was of great benefit for timekeeping, because the Egyptian hour was not a fixed amount of time, but was measured as 1/12 of the night. When the nights were shorter in the summer, these waterclocks could be adjusted to measure the shorter hours accurately.|$|E
500|$|Incense clocks: [...] Incense <b>clocks</b> <b>were</b> Chinese {{timekeeping}} {{devices that}} {{appeared during the}} Song Dynasty (960-1279) and spread to neighboring East Asian countries such as Japan and Korea. In addition to water, mechanical, and candle <b>clocks,</b> incense <b>clocks</b> <b>were</b> used in Asia, and were fashioned in several different forms. Incense <b>clocks</b> <b>were</b> first used in China around the 6th century spread to Japan as one survives in the Shōsōin. Although popularly associated with China the incense <b>clock</b> <b>is</b> believed by some to have originated in India, at least in its fundamental form, if not function.|$|R

50|$|<b>Clocks</b> <b>were</b> some of {{the most}} complex early {{mechanical}} devices. <b>Clock</b> makers <b>were</b> important developers of machine tools including gear and screw cutting machines, and were also involved in the mathematical development of gear designs. <b>Clocks</b> <b>were</b> {{some of the}} earliest mass-produced items, beginning around 1830.|$|R
5|$|Palacio de Congresos de Badajoz, {{the congressional}} palace, {{is the work}} of the architects José Selgas and Lucia Cano. Palacio Municipal houses the City Hall. The remains of the {{original}} City Hall building are in ruins. The current building dates to 1852, and the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> added in 1889. In 1937, the municipal architect, Rodolfo Martinez, renovated the building, with particular emphasis on stylistic uniformity, expanding its towers and changing its decorative elements. It features a balustrade, a central balcony and columns.|$|E
5|$|The building's attic {{was damaged}} {{in a fire}} in 1913. An {{additional}} storey was constructed in 1935 under the engineer Todor Tonev, turning the headquarters into a three-storey edifice. The trademark <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> added in the late 19th century. In 1964–1967, the building's interior was refurbished so it could accommodate the City People's Council. Today, it houses the administration of Ruse's Chamber of Control.|$|E

5|$|The first geared <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> {{invented in}} the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; {{it was a}} water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{conveying}} {{a message}} through a periodically updated clock found an earlier {{expression in the}} Doomsday Clock. However, the innovation of the National Debt <b>Clock</b> <b>was</b> to feature a constantly running counter; it has since inspired similar projects elsewhere, both in the United States and further afield. In particular, {{it has become a}} national fixture shows that the U.S.'s increasing debt. By 1995, the New York Times reported that politicians were citing the clock to advocate for a reduction to the national budget. Various tracking counters of national debt are also kept online.|$|E
5|$|Further {{additions}} to the interior were made over the next quarter-century. A new Gothic altar, produced in Düsseldorf, Germany, was installed in 1880. Two years later a communion bench was installed. The tower was also given a clock and bells during this period; the <b>clock</b> <b>was</b> removed in 1978 since the machinery was broken. Lijden died in 1882, and the Jesuit Joannes de Vries became the parish priest, the first in an unbroken line of Jesuit pastors which continues until the present day. De Vries was soon after elected provincial superior for the province, and thus {{he spent much of}} his time away from the church. By 1885 there were 1,620 Catholics in Semarang, up from approximately a thousand four years earlier. Many of these were in the colonial military.|$|E
