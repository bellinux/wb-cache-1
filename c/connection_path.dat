40|$|Abstract – Current packet {{networks}} use a large {{variety of}} mechanisms which should support QoS (Quality of Service). One of those mechanisms is routing (calculating <b>connection</b> <b>paths</b> for incoming service requests). The {{most effective in}} QoS context is dynamic routing {{which is based on}} the current network state described by offered traffic matrix and link states. <b>Connection</b> <b>paths</b> changes after switching between calculated available paths may cause that received packets have changed order within a single stream. Following paper includes problem definition and analysis of all additional effects. Combined model simulation/analytic has been pro-posed which shall find the answer if the number of changed packets order is significant and if it should be considered when calculating the end-to-end delay balance in analytical models for packet networks with differentiated services. Pro-posed model gave also the answer how often calculated paths may be switched to avoid network to be out of tune. Index Terms – IP, QoS, DiffServ, QoS routing. I...|$|R

They circumnavigated the urban area in a three-quarter circle from Stettiner, the Hamburger, the Potsdamer and Anhalter Bahnhof to the Frankfurt train station.

5000|$|The floor {{emphasizes}} the <b>connection</b> <b>path</b> between {{the entrance and}} the altar. The design, created by Antonio Teruzzi, is a stylized tree. The leaves are made with mosaic technique, the trunk instead is made with pieces of marble. The tree is a thick figure of symbolic meanings: it refers to life that transcends time and space. The tree has the truck {{on the surface of}} the earth, the roots in the ground and the branches in the sky. This symbolically takes up the salvation-historical time path from the Creation to the coming of Christ, with the intent of making the entrance-altar journey as a passage from darkness to light. Teruzzi was assisted by Luigi Beretta in the collection of biblical references. Along the tree-trunk are represented the stages of the history of salvation. Each stage or day of history is marked by a stone. At the base appears a continuous line, without interruption, in dark colors and dotted with tiny bright flashes (few golden mosaic tiles). It represents the primordial chaos which preceded the Creation, when the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the abyss (in black tiles), but already the spirit (in clear tiles) hovered over the waters (Gen[...] 1:29). The creation is marked by stones 7, numbered from 1 to 7 with simple marble tiles, and they are one for each day. On each of them it is represent the work of God in that day as written in Genesis. After the Creation are remembered the 10 generations Cycle from Adam to Noah and 10 generations from Noah to Abraham. Each group is made with different shades of color of the marble tiles, on which there are marked at the most salient character names from which generations are named. So we read the names of Adam, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah and then David, Solomon and finally Mary and Joseph. The generations from Adam to Jesus are linked along the axis of the shaft by a continuous sinusoidal curve, similar to a spiral. The mosaic is in reddish hues. From Jacob the branches beginning to widen: 12 branches to mark his 12 children, that, after Jacob, all become owners, heirs of the promise of a land, as descents of a Messiah.|$|E

40|$|A {{system and}} method for the {{efficient}} utilization of core telecommunications resources (including both switching and transport resources) during a datacom session over a connection-oriented telecommunications system is described. First, the telecommunications resources along a <b>connection</b> <b>path</b> are partitioned into {{two or more}} segments. One or more pause sensors (550) placed along the <b>connection</b> <b>path</b> detect periods of inactivity in a connection. Whenever such a period of inactivity is detected, the pause sensor (550) selectively causes the release of core telecommunications resources for reallocation to active applications, typically by deactivating one or more segments. When wake-up sensors (520, 550) detect renewed activity over the connection, then the dormant connection is reactivated by reallocating core physical resources. The dynamic connection technique of the present invention can be used both with analog (inband) signaling systems (e. g., Plan Old Telephone Service) {{as well as with}} digital signaling systems (e. g., Integrated Services Digital Network). The deactivation and reactivation of core telecommunications resources can be performed using various priority schemes...|$|E

40|$|Our eyes move {{constantly}} at {{a frequency}} of 3 – 5 times per second. These movements, called saccades, induce the sweeping of visual {{images on the}} retina, yet we perceive the world as stable. It {{has been suggested that}} the brain achieves this visual stability via predictive remapping of neuronal receptive field (RF). A recent experimental study disclosed details of this remapping process in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), that is, about the time of the saccade, the neuronal RF expands along the saccadic trajectory temporally, covering the current RF (CRF), the future RF (FRF), and the region the eye will sweep through during the saccade. A cortical wave (CW) model was also proposed, which attributes the RF remapping as a consequence of neural activity propagating in the cortex, triggered jointly by a visual stimulus and the corollary discharge (CD) signal responsible for the saccade. In this study, we investigate how this CW model is learned naturally from visual experiences at the development of the brain. We build a two-layer network, with one layer consisting of LIP neurons and the other superior colliculus (SC) neurons. Initially, neuronal connections are random and non-selective. A saccade will cause a static visual image to sweep through the retina passively, creating the effect of the visual stimulus moving in the opposite direction of the saccade. According to the spiking-time-dependent-plasticity rule, the <b>connection</b> <b>path</b> in the opposite direction of the saccade between LIP neurons and the <b>connection</b> <b>path</b> from SC to LIP are enhanced. Over many such visual experiences, the CW model is developed, which generates the peri-saccadic RF remapping in LIP as observed in the experiment...|$|E

Network coding and reduced capacity are deployed in this strategy without adding extra working paths to the readily available <b>connection</b> <b>paths.</b> This strategy is based on protection against node failures as protection against multiple link failures.
