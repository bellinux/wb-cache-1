500|$|<b>Cheney</b> has <b>said</b> {{that the}} Tea Party Movement is a [...] "positive {{influence}} on the Republican Party" [...] and that [...] " [...] I think it's much better {{to have that kind}} of turmoil and change in the Republican Party than it would be to have it outside." ...|$|R
50|$|Though the {{shooting}} occurred on Saturday, February 11, news {{of it was}} not released until after 2 PM, eastern Standard Time on Sunday, February 12. Kathryn Garcia, {{a reporter for the}} Corpus Christi Caller-Times, broke the story at 1:48 PM after receiving an 11 AM call from Katherine Armstrong, the owner of the ranch where {{the shooting}} occurred. Armstrong had notified Cheney earlier in the morning {{that she was going to}} inform the news media about the incident. She <b>said</b> <b>Cheney</b> agreed. Armstrong <b>said</b> that Whittington did not announce his location, and this led to the incident.|$|R
5000|$|Chris <b>Cheney</b> has <b>said</b> {{that for}} the album, the [...] "aim has been to {{construct}} something more direct, simple and therefore tougher and bigger sounding than anything we've done before." [...] He {{also said that the}} band [...] "spent a lot of time experimenting with the parts of the songs to achieve this. Also and most importantly this will be an album, not just a bunch of songs." ...|$|R
500|$|Cheney {{has said}} {{his time at}} the Pentagon was the most {{rewarding}} period of his public service career, calling it [...] "the one that stands out." [...] In 2014, Cheney recounted that when he met with President George H. W. Bush to accept the offer, he passed a painting in the private residence entitled The Peacemakers, which depicted President Lincoln, General Grant, and William Tecumseh Sherman. [...] "My great-grandfather had served under William Tecumseh Sherman throughout the war," [...] <b>Cheney</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and {{it occurred to me}} as I was in the room as I walked in to talk to the President about becoming Secretary of Defense, I wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the White House with the President talking about taking over the reins of the U.S. military." ...|$|E
500|$|Bush {{authorized}} the CIA to use waterboarding {{and several other}} [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques" [...] that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture. Between 2002 and 2003 the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on a secret Justice Department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture and Vice President <b>Cheney</b> <b>said</b> enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal. The CIA had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given {{to it in the}} Bybee Memo from the Attorney General, though that memo was later withdrawn. While not permitted by the U.S. Army Field Manuals which assert [...] "that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information", the Bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations [...] "provided critical information" [...] to preserve American lives. Critics, such as former CIA officer Bob Baer, have stated that information was suspect, [...] "you can get anyone to confess to anything if the torture's bad enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2015, Judith Miller {{published}} an autobiography {{in which she}} wondered if her memories had been wrong, if her testimony had been false and asked, [...] "Had I misconstrued my notes? Had Fitzgerald's questions about whether my {{use of the word}} Bureau meant the FBI steered me in the wrong direction?" [...] Commenting on Miller's book, former Vice President Dick <b>Cheney</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I always believed Scooter was innocent. What Judith Miller basically provides is confirmation {{of the fact that he}} was innocent." ...|$|E
5000|$|Musically, <b>Cheney</b> has <b>said</b> {{that he used}} various {{effects to}} get a broader sound; [...] "I have used more effects on this record vs others. There was the chorus peddle sic which gave songs an '80s flavour we were excited about. The good thing about a new guitar peddle sic is when it {{influences}} your writing. it's important for our songs to grow and sonically there's a broader spectrum now." ...|$|R

500|$|Rangel again {{expressed}} his displeasure {{with the vice}} president in October 2006 – after <b>Cheney</b> had <b>said</b> that [...] "Charlie doesn't understand how the economy works" [...] – by opining that Cheney is [...] "a real son of a bitch" [...] who [...] "enjoys a confrontation", and suggesting that Cheney required professional treatment for mental defects. [...] The White House said that the vice president did not take Rangel's comments personally and had a [...] "big hearty laugh" [...] over them.|$|R
2500|$|On July 8, 2007, Ellison {{discussed}} {{the power of}} the executive branch in a speech before the organization Atheists for Human Rights. He stated that Dick <b>Cheney</b> <b>said</b> it was [...] "beneath his dignity in order for him to answer any questions from the citizens of the United States. That is the very definition of totalitarianism, authoritarianism and dictatorship." [...] He went on to say, [...] "It's almost like the Reichstag fire, kind of reminds me of that. After the Reichstag was burned, they blamed the Communists for it and it put the leader of that country, Hitler, in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted. The fact is that I'm not saying September 11 was a U.S. plan or anything like that because, you know, that's how they put you in the nut-ball box — dismiss you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The PAA was due {{to expire}} in 2002, and the former U.S. {{vice-president}} Dick <b>Cheney</b> <b>said</b> in 2001 that [...] "nobody's going to invest in nuclear power plants" [...] if the PAA is not renewed. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) concluded that the liability limits placed on nuclear insurance were significant enough to constitute a subsidy, but a quantification of the amount was not attempted at that time. Shortly after this in 1990, Dubin and Rothwell {{were the first to}} estimate the value to the U.S. nuclear industry of the limitation on liability for nuclear power plants under the Price Anderson Act. Their underlying method was to extrapolate the premiums operators currently pay versus the full liability they would have to pay for full insurance {{in the absence of the}} PAA limits. The size of the estimated subsidy per reactor per year was $60 million prior to the 1982 amendments, and up to $22 million following the 1988 amendments. In a separate article in 2003, Anthony Heyes updates the 1988 estimate of $22 million per year to $33 million (2001 dollars).|$|E

5000|$|After a live show in late 2006, {{the band}} was placed on hiatus due to the fatigue of lead vocalist Chris Cheney. Cheney took a number of months off, doing yoga for {{relaxation}} and consequently, inspiration.

2500|$|Lamont noted Lieberman's {{position}} {{was similar to}} George W. Bush and Dick <b>Cheney's</b> position.

5000|$|On March 22, 2004, Vice President Dick Cheney {{claimed that}} Clarke was [...] "out of the loop" [...] {{in the fight}} against terror.

5000|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration.

[...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick <b>Cheney,</b> who <b>said,</b> [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess."

500|$|When Cheney became {{eligible}} for the draft, during the Vietnam War, he applied for and received five draft deferments. [...] In 1989, The Washington Post writer George C.

Cheney testified during his confirmation hearings in 1989 that he received deferments to finish a college career that lasted six years rather than four, owing to sub-par academic performance and the need to work to pay for his education. Initially, Cheney was not drafted due to his marriage to Lynne Cheney. When the draft was expanded to include married men without children, he applied for four deferments in sequence. He applied for his fifth exemption on January 19, 1966, when his wife was about 10 weeks pregnant.
