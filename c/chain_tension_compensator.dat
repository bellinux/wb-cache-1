40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The research work was concened with the design of <b>tension</b> <b>compensators</b> for spinning-winding machines {{for the purposes of}} reducing winding tension variation during high speed cone winding. Initially, the research was directed to investigating the 'winding error', i. e. the difference between yarn supply and demand, which was the main cause of winding tension variation. Mathematical models were established to analyse the winding velocity variation and yarn path length variation. Several methods have been investigated to reduce winding tension variation and to develop <b>tension</b> <b>compensators.</b> These include using a servo motor to keep constant winding velocity and using a curved distribution bar to keep constant path length. Two promising <b>tension</b> <b>compensators</b> were selected for detailed investigation. they were a mechanical compensator and a mechatronic compensator. Based on the analysis of 'winding error', A multiple bar mechanism was devised, analysed and optimised to provide tension compensation. Further consideration has been given to a microprocessor controlled mechanism, that works according to predetermined look-up tables and sensor signals to reduce winding tension variation. The computer simulation of yarn winding process, the software design for the optimisation of mechanical compensator and the control of mechatronic compensator, and the results of winding tension experimentation are also presented in the thesis...|$|R

50|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> of a {{chainsaw}} may {{be adjusted}} {{with a chain}} tensioner.|$|R
5000|$|On {{bicycles}} that do {{not have}} a derailleur or other <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning</b> device, rear horizontal dropouts allow adjustment of <b>chain</b> <b>tension,</b> and can accommodate a range of chain lengths or cog sizes. They were standard on most older derailleur bicycles from before the 1990s. An older derailleur-equipped bicycle with horizontal dropouts can be readily converted into singlespeed, fixed gear or to use an internally geared hub.|$|R
25|$|An {{eccentric}} hub or {{bottom bracket}} allows the off center axle or bottom bracket spindle to pivot {{and change the}} <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b>|$|R
50|$|Typical {{track frames}} use 120mm spacing for the rear hub. The {{dropouts}} or track ends face rearwards to facilitate <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> adjustment.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{maintenance}} {{carried out}} on crosscut saws is sharpening, which requires a shop and a highly skilled filer. The primary maintenance on chainsaws is engine tuning, <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning,</b> and <b>chain</b> replacement.|$|R
50|$|Rear {{vertical}} dropouts {{have the}} slot facing downwards. The {{advantage is that}} the wheel axle cannot slip forward compared with horizontal dropouts. The disadvantage is that on a bicycle without a rear derailleur but with vertical dropouts, the <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> cannot be adjusted by moving the wheel forwards or backwards, and needs another means of chain-tensioning, by a derailleur, chain tensioner, or eccentric bottom bracket or rear hub. Fixed wheel bicycles cannot use any form of <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning</b> device, because the lower run of chain is pulled very tight when using the transmission as a brake.|$|R
50|$|The {{back folding}} mechanism, which folds beneath the frame, doesn't retain <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> when folded if dérailleur gears are fitted (unlike the Brompton for example). Again, {{this has been}} solved on the Mk 3.|$|R
25|$|Separate <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning</b> devices, such as {{the type}} that {{attaches}} to the dropout (commonly used on single speed mountain bikes) cannot be used because they are damaged {{as soon as the}} lower part of the chain becomes tight.|$|R
40|$|A load to an {{armoured}} {{face conveyor}} (AFC) during coal mining is changeable and very difficult or even {{impossible to be}} predicted. Changes of the load to the upper scraper chain affect the load of the driving motor and generate changes in a scraper <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> Impact of increasing the external load to the upper scraper chain on the operation of electric motors and on the scraper <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> is presented. The developed numerical model of the Rybnik 850 conveyor enabled identifying the places of the scraper <b>chain</b> high <b>tension</b> or places of its loosening. An impact of changing frequency of driving motor voltage on AFC’s operational conditions was tested and analysed using the AFC’s numerical model. During tests, tension of the scraper chain on the discharge end and the return end was recorded. High tension of the scraper chain and its loosening during the changeable load were also recorded on upward and downward transportation of run-of-mine material...|$|R
50|$|For {{motorcycles}} with chain drives, {{the rear}} axle {{can usually be}} adjusted forward and back {{in relation to the}} swingarm, to adjust <b>chain</b> <b>tension,</b> but a few models (such as 1971/72 Triumph and BSA four-strokes) make the adjustment at the swingarm's pivot point.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} pivot (like the Hesketh V1000) was co-axial with the drive sprocket to maintain constant <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> This feature meant that (i) a smaller drive chain {{could be used}} and/or (ii) the chain was less stressed and therefore less likely to break.|$|R

50|$|The belt or <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> on a single-speed bicycle can be {{maintained}} by either setting the fixed horizontal position of the rear sprocket or the front chainring horizontally, or by a separate tensioner that pushes perpendicular to the chain with either a fixed position or spring tension.|$|R

50|$|At {{the heart}} of chain units is {{essentially}} a guitar pick-up that mounts to the cycle's chain stay.The pick-up detects chain vibration from which it calculates <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> which, along with chain speed, gives power output. Finnish company Polar {{was the first to}} bring a chain-based power meter to market.|$|R
25|$|Track frames {{have much}} in common with road and time trial frames, but come with rear-facing, {{horizontal}} fork ends, rather than dropouts, to allow one to adjust the position of the rear wheel horizontally to set the proper <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> Also the seat tube angle is steeper than on road racing bikes.|$|R
50|$|Engine.The Clinton A490 Panther 2-stroke {{engine is}} {{centrally}} mounted to ensure perfect balance at all speeds. The engine position is adjustable to suit <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> The starting is by recoil starter, power {{being delivered to}} the rear wheel through an automatic centrifugal clutch which comes into effect upon opening of the throttle.|$|R
5000|$|Flip-flop hubs have a {{double-sided}} {{rear wheel}} with a (different sized) sprocket on each side.

25|$|Prior to 1937 {{this was}} the only {{permitted}} form of gear changing on the Tour de France. Competitors could have 2 sprockets {{on each side of the}} rear wheel, but still had to stop to manually move the chain from one sprocket to the other and adjust the position of the rear wheel so as to maintain the correct <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b>|$|R
30|$|With the {{development}} of 48  ×  152 compact high-strength round chain and link chain for the mine, {{as well as the}} high-strength forged scraper, the optimization of the meshing characteristics of the chain transmission system and the adaptability and <b>chain</b> <b>tension,</b> along with {{the development}} of along life 48  ×  152 drive sprocket and component, a heavy-duty high-strength chain transmission system was successfully developed.|$|R
50|$|Eccentrics {{are used}} in {{applications}} that require precise <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> adjustment such as the timing chain of tandem bicycles, the chain that connects the stoker's and captain's cranks. They may also be employed on bicycles {{that do not have}} an adjustable rear wheel position, due to vertical dropouts or a rear disc brake, and that do not have an external rear derailleur such as single-speeds or bikes with an internal-geared hub.|$|R

5000|$|One method, used by Shimano, {{is to use}} <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> {{to pivot}} the cage. This has the {{advantage}} of working with most sets of sprockets, if the chain has the proper length. A disadvantage is that rapid shifts from small sprockets to large over multiple sprockets at once can cause the cage to strike the sprockets before the chain moves onto the larger sprockets and pivots the cage as necessary.|$|R
50|$|Single-speed bicycle {{builders}} {{have devised}} {{a variety of}} methods for producing and maintaining the proper <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> The most common method is horizontal rear dropouts or track ends. These allow the rear wheel to be moved fore or aft as necessary. Using chain tugs with track ends ensures that optimum <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> can be achieved with the wheel remaining centered. A similar design, sliding dropouts, uses detachable dropouts that are bolted to the frame through horizontal slots. This allows both quick release or bolt on hubs to be used, or through-axle hubs with the appropriate dropouts. Sliding dropouts usually have set screws that bear on the front of them through the frame to adjust their position for tensioning and wheel alignment. The main advantage of sliding dropouts over track ends is realized when they are used with disc brakes, as the brake caliper mount is part of the left dropout, and thus moves with the dropout, maintaining the hub to caliper distance. Sliding dropouts can also include a derailleur hanger if multi-speed use is desired.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{derailleur}} serves double duty: moving the chain between rear sprockets and taking up chain slack caused by {{moving to a}} smaller sprocket at the rear or a smaller chainring by the front derailleur. In order to accomplish this second task, it is positioned {{in the path of}} the bottom, slack portion of chain. Sometimes the rear-derailleurs are re-purposed as chain tensioners for single-speed bicycles that cannot adjust <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> by a different method.|$|R

50|$|The Swift {{frame is}} simple and robust, and allows a quick fold, but when folded is not as compact as some other folding bicycle designs. The bottom bracket forms part of the folding rear triangle, {{and as a result}} the bottom bracket to rear fork-end {{distance}} remains constant throughout the fold. This keeps the <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> constant, which is an advantage when the Swift frame is used in a fixed-gear, single speed, or hub gear bicycle.|$|R
40|$|The {{one-dimensional}} falling {{motion of}} a bungee chain suspended from a rigid support {{and of a}} chain falling from a resting heap on a table is studied. Their Lagrangians are found to contain no explicit time dependence. As a result, these falling chains are conservative systems. Each of their Lagrange's equations of motion is shown to contain a term that enforces energy conservation when masses are transferred between subchains. We show in particular that Cayley's 1857 energy nonconserving solution for a chain falling from a resting heap is incorrect because it neglects the energy gained when the transferred link is emitted by the emitting subchain. The maximum <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> measured by Calkin and March for the falling bungee chain is given a simple if rough interpretation. In the simplified one-dimensional treatment, the kinetic energy {{of the center of}} mass of the falling bungee chain is found to be converted by the <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> at the rigid support into the internal kinetic energy of the chain. However, as the chain reaches full extension, even this internal kinetic energy disappears in a momentum conserving but inelastic collision at the moment the chain tip reaches full extension. This is followed by a grand finale as the chain snaps and rebounds against its support...|$|R
5000|$|A bicycle chain {{can be very}} energy efficient: {{one study}} {{reported}} efficiencies as high as 98.6%. The study, performed in a clean laboratory environment, found that efficiency was not greatly affected {{by the state of}} lubrication. A larger sprocket will give a more efficient drive, because moves the point of pressure farther away from the axle, placing less stress on the bearings, thus reducing friction in the inner wheel. Higher <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> was found to be more efficient: [...] "This is actually not in the direction you'd expect, based simply on friction".|$|R
50|$|This is {{different}} from the design of other oval style chainrings, which have the smaller effective chainring diameter coincide with the cranks being at top and bottom dead centre (TDC and BDC), thus making the crank easier for the rider to turn through BDC for a constant <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> By having the chainring at its peak effective diameter with the cranks level, where the rider has maximum leverage over the crank during the power stroke, these designs are supposed to make better use of the rider's power output.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Kinetic {{characteristics}} of chain drive system were investigated {{in this paper}} and some corresponding mathematical models were established. In accordance with the theory of chain drive, based on the multi-body dynamics software platform, a dynamic analysis model of timing bushing chain system for diesel engine was established. <b>Chain</b> <b>tension</b> force, <b>chain</b> contact force and chain fluctuation in a rotation cycle at different running speeds were analyzed. By analysis and evaluation these results, the kinematic and dynamic {{characteristics of}} the chain drive system during the operation could be effectively recognized, this research results can {{provide a basis for}} production tests. ...|$|R
