40|$|Chemokines are small, {{secreted}} proteins (5 - 15 kDa) that mediate leukocyte transmigration {{and can be}} secreted from endothelial {{cells in}} a constitutive or regulated manner. Regulated secretion shortens the response time to inflammatory stimuli because the chemokine is produced in advance and not dependent on de novo synthesis. The existence of regulated chemokine secretion from endothelial cells {{has not yet been}} demonstrated in animal models. A homologue of the potent neutrophilattracting chemokine IL- 8 has not been found in rodents. However, other potent neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL 1,CXCL 2, and CXCL 6 were therefore analyzed by immunohistochemistry in experimental acute peritonitis/sepsis and in DSS-induced colitis, with special emphasis on their possible sorting to Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB). The data presented imply that sorting to WPB for regulated chemokine secretion is not a prominent feature of rodent endothelial cells but also indicate that MIP- 2 may be sorted to another granular <b>compartment</b> <b>in</b> resting mesenteric <b>vessels,</b> perhaps related to the type II compartment of regulated secretion recently described in human endothelial cell cultures...|$|R
50|$|The Type 724 LCAC has a {{square-shaped}} hull {{with three}} compartments: the soldier <b>compartment</b> <b>in</b> the front, the driving <b>compartment</b> <b>in</b> the middle, {{and the power}} <b>compartment</b> <b>in</b> the rear. Ten soldiers are carried in an unprotected, open-top compartment, exposed to enemy fire. The Type 724 LCAC is unarmed.|$|R
30|$|Using an intra-compartmental {{pressure}} monitoring instrument, compartment pressures were measured in 60 out of 87 patients with ACS and 92  % had an absolute reading of greater than 30  mmHg. This raised intra-compartmental pressure occurred <b>in</b> the anterior <b>compartment</b> <b>in</b> 87  %, lateral <b>compartment</b> <b>in</b> 35  % and posterior <b>compartments</b> <b>in</b> 37  % of cases. All patients with ACS have positive intra-operative findings.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the myogenic behavior of blood vessels and their interaction within the coronary arterial tree and to evaluate the possible role of the myogenic response in autoregulation. The model consists of 10 <b>compartments</b> <b>in</b> series, each representing a class of vessel sizes. Diameter and resistance in each class are determined by their value at full dilation (d(p,) R(p)) and by the myogenic response. Three distributions of R(p) and three distributions of myogenic strength, M(i) (slope of pressure-diameter curve, range - 0. 05 to - 0. 4 %/mmHg) were evaluated (9 cases). It was found that larger vessels attenuate the myogenic activity of smaller vessels and that myogenic responsiveness is sufficient to achieve autoregulation. When M(i) has a maximum <b>in</b> <b>vessels</b> of 84 microm, the maximum effect of perfusion pressure on active diameter occurs <b>in</b> <b>vessels</b> between 123 and 181 microm, depending on the distribution of R(p). Distribution of resistance and control mechanisms in the coronary arterial tree are important for interpretation of individual vessel responses as observed in viv...|$|R

50|$|BTR-60 was {{a revolutionary}} design for its time.

This meant that, while the BTR-60 didn't {{share some of the}} weaknesses that other APCs had, it had several disadvantages of its own.|$|R
