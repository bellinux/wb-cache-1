The straight tooth design enables elastomers to be attached and removed radially, including a [...] "not fail-safe" [...] jaw elastomer in-shear design. For the elastomer in-shear design, the <b>coupling</b> <b>hub</b> teeth are no longer inter-meshed, so a elastomer failure will result in no torque being transmitted. When used with a stiff elastomer, the curved jaw design can maintain a zero-backlash fit required for many motion control applications.|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 153 - 160 In {{rotating}} machinery, torque {{is transmitted}} from shafts to <b>coupling</b> <b>hubs</b> (or vice versa) through keys, friction, {{or a combination of}} the two. As a rule; <b>coupling</b> <b>hubs</b> must be installed on shafts {{with a certain amount of}} interference. This interference has two purposes: to prevent rocking of the hub on the shaft, and to help in the torque transmission. With sufficient interference all the torque can be transmitted by friction, and keys can be eliminated. Interference has two disadvantages: it makes installation difficult, and hub removal even more difficult. Hydraulic methods of hub removal are discussed. These methods are sound, make for easy and quick hub removal, and are safe. Some engineers are reluctant to use hydraulic removal for two reasons: it requires specialized tools and better training of mechanics, and it was known to be potentially dangerous. As any new and sophisticated procedure, it also received a bad name from early failures, all caused by misuse. The following topics are discussed: ? Torque transmission through keys ? Installation of keyed hubs using interference ? Torque transmission through friction ? Installation of keyless hubs, heat-assisted installation, hydraulic assisted installation ? Hydraulic removal of hubs, dismounting keyed hubs, dismounting keyless hubs ? Failure cases. Hydraulic methods for hub removal were discussed in previous papers [1, 2].

Such exoskeletons could be used by the physically impaired and injured, in addition to the elderly. This report describes the design of a power-assist exoskeleton specifically for the pronation and supination motion of the forearm. The exoskeleton is controlled by two push-button sensors to indicate the direction of rotation, which is controlled by the user at all times. As a safety precaution, visual feedback was implemented to confirm the user’s inputs were received by the exoskeleton and that the robot is actuating. A stepper motor, whose torque is transferred to the system using a bidirectional winch system, is used such that the exoskeleton is able to output such holding torques to lock the position of the arm. The mechanical structure is composed of various PVC and ABS <b>coupling</b> <b>hubs,</b> which form a stationary and rotating unit.

40|$|Special PaperPg. 159 - 166 The tools used {{to install}} {{hydraulically}} fitted hubs {{need to be}} as carefully designed and manufactured as the couplings themselves. The authors describe an installation of coupling hubs on upgraded machines where tools that were designed to be used on a coupling for a 6. 0 in diameter shaft were adapted to mount a coupling on an 8. 0 in shaft. The larger forces involved caused a threaded rod to fracture and the <b>coupling</b> <b>hub</b> to be expelled from the shaft end with considerable force and velocity. An after-the-fact analysis of these "design alpha" tools is presented, along with a technical description of the forces acting upon a newly mounted hub and the velocity with which such a hub could be expelled from a shaft end. The 8. 0 in hub was successfully installed on the shaft using modified "design alpha" tooling for expediency, but this modification {{was considered to be}} only a stopgap solution. The authors designed new "design beta" tools to accomplish the installation of the coupling hubs safely.

Using the physical and data flow information from a freight forwarder, we intend to model the flow of inbound and outbound goods in a freight transport hub. Approach: This paper presents the operation of a road haulage group. To deliver goods within two days to any location in France, a haulage contractor needs to be part of a network. This network handles the processing of both physical goods and data. We will also explore the ways in which goods and data flows are connected. We then build a first model based on Ordinary Differential Equations which decrypt the flow of goods inside the hub and which is consistent with available data. This first model is designed to work at a fine-scale level. A second model which aggregates factors of the fine scale one is also built and a way to <b>couple</b> <b>hub</b> models to build a hub network is depicted. Tests are carried out to show the accuracy of the models. Finally, an explanation on how to use the models for industrial process optimizing is given...|$|R

40|$|Tutorialpg. 121 - 138 In {{rotating}} equipment, torque {{is usually}} transmitted from shafts to <b>coupling</b> <b>hubs</b> through keys, splines, friction, {{or a combination}} of these. Not covered in this tutorial are applications where the rotating equipment has integral flanges that bolt to the coupling. The type of interface, the fit, and materials used are dependent on the criticality of the equipment. Equipment can be classified into general purpose and special purpose. General purpose equipment includes machines such as pumps that are spared. If they fail or require maintenance the operation does not shut down or slow down. In contrast special purpose equipment (compressor, generator) is critical to the process and if it is unavailable the entire plant might slow down, shut down, or might incur a safety incident or environmental incidence. Generally special purpose equipment and more sophistication is justified {{in the design of the}} interface. The type of interface has also a lot to do with several other issues, including: ?	Ease of assembly/disassembly ?	Reliability of connection ?	How much torque can be transmitted ?	Field conditions Most commonly for general purpose equipment keys with setscrews are used on a small horsepower applications. For larger horsepower applications keys with interference bores are common. For critical equipment the most common interface is keys with interference. As the application gets more critical and power dense, keyless shrink drives and integral flanges become common. Tight fitted splines are common in aircraft derivative gas turbines. The various types are covered in some detail for general purpose and special purpose applications. Covered also is how to assemble some of the most common types. Other issues such as who should bore the couplings, how does one fit bores and keys, and what needs to be considered when specifying interfaces is discussed. They types of couplings that are used on general purpose applications versus special purpose applications are discussed first...|$|R

We analyze an original data-set of LAN equipment consisting of more than 1, 000 hubs and switches marketed between 1990 and 1999. Modularity emerged as a design strategy that supported incumbent firms’ efforts to enter new product niches in the hub segment. However, after the emergence of switches {{as an alternative to}} <b>hubs,</b> <b>coupled</b> with the introduction of a new standard, incumbents relying on a modular hub strategy were overtaken by a new comer (Cisco). Moreover, the fastest followers were incumbents that had not previously relied on modular hub architectures. Our interpretation is as follows: modularity offers advantages of speed when changes occur within established boundaries. However, it also generates a ‘tunnel effect’ that prevents firms from developing products based on different problem-solving strategies. Such changes are more easily introduced by firms that do not rely on tightly-defined modular design rules. Entry; Modularity; LAN Equipment...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{concentrations}} at {{the ends}} of a flat contact including frictional sliding are analyzed in this article by using the finite element (FE) method. The numerical studies are conducted with a shaft <b>coupled</b> to the <b>hub</b> by conical rings. The applied mesh refinement at the contact ends assures the reliability of the FE results, which show significantly higher stress peaks than those obtained from the conventional analytical solution recommended in the design guidelines of the frictional conical joints. These notch stresses result in low cycle fatigue (LCF) failures of the shaft-hub connection in service, since the yield point of the shaft material can be locally exceeded. The effect of clearances among the joint components and magnitudes of the friction coefficient on variations of the maximum stress in the contact are considered as well. The paper's findings and conclusions are applicable to the design and manufacturing process of the frictional conical joints with regard to assembly tolerances...|$|R
40|$|In a carbon-constrained world, {{natural gas}} with low {{emission}} intensity {{plays an important}} role in the energy consumption area. Energy consumers and distribution networks are linked via energy hubs. Meanwhile, reconfiguration that optimizes operational performance while maintaining a radial network topology is a worldwide technique in the electricity distribution system. To improve the overall efficiency of energy infrastructure, the expansion of electricity distribution lines and elements within energy hubs should be co-planned. In this paper, the co-planning process is modeled as a mixed integer quadratic programming problem to handle conflicting objectives simultaneously. We propose a novel model to identify the optimal co-expansion plan in terms of total cost. Operational factors including energy storages and reconfiguration are considered within the systems to serve electricity, cooling and heating loads. Reconfiguration and elements in energy hubs can avoid or defer new elements’ installation to minimize the investment cost, maintenance cost, operation cost, and interruption cost in the planning horizon. The proposed co-planning approach is verified on 3 and 12 -node electricity and natural gas distribution systems <b>coupled</b> via energy <b>hubs.</b> Numerical results show the ability of our proposed expansion co-planning approach based on energy hub in meeting energy demand...|$|R
30|$|The phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) pathway {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} altered signaling pathways in human cancers. Under physiological conditions the PI 3 Ks are a family of proteins involved in the regulation of cell survival, growth, metabolism, and glucose homeostasis [27]. This pathway is activated by mutations in tumor suppressor genes, such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), mutations in the components of the PI 3 K complex, or by elevated signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases [28]. Upon activation, the PI 3 K pathway not only provides strong growth and survival signals to tumor cells but also has strong effects on their metabolism. The best-studied effector downstream of PI 3 K is the RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT 1). AKT 1 is a critical driver of the tumor glycolytic phenotype and stimulates ATP generation through multiple mechanisms, ensuring that cells have the bioenergetic capacity required to respond to growth signals [29, 30]. AKT 1 stimulates the expression of glucose transporters, phosphorylates key glycolytic enzymes, and alters their catalytic activity, e.g. hexokinase (HK) and phosphofructokinase 2 [29, 31]. In addition, the activation and the prolonged signaling via AKT 1 inhibits forkhead box subfamily O (FOXO) transcription factors by mediating their phosphorylation and sequestration in the cytoplasm, resulting in transcriptional changes that increase glycolytic capacity [32]. AKT 1 also directly influences the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. mTOR functions as a key metabolic <b>hub,</b> <b>coupling</b> growth signals to nutrient availability. Under physiological stimulation triggered by amino acids, growth factors, stress, energy, as well as oxygen, mTOR stimulates protein and lipid biosynthesis and cell growth when sufficient nutrient and energy are available [33 – 35]. mTOR is often constitutively activated during tumorigenesis [36]. AKT 1 strongly activates mTOR-signaling pathway by inducing an inhibitory phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC 2), a negative regulator of mTOR [27, 31].|$|R
40|$|Input?output {{approximation}} of spacecraft motion is convenient and necessary in many situations. For a rigid?body spacecraft, {{this process is}} simple because the system is governed {{by a set of}} equations that is linear in the system parameters. However, the combination of a ?exible appendage and a rigid hub adds complexity by increasing the degrees of freedom and by introducing nonlinear <b>coupling</b> between the <b>hub</b> and appendage. Assumed Modes is one technique for modeling ?exible body motion. Traditional Assumed Modes uses a set of linear assumed modes, but when dealing with rotating ?exible systems, a modi?cation of this method allows for the use of quadratic assumed modes. The quadratic assumed model provides an increased level of sophistication, but the derivation still neglects a set of higher?order terms. This work develops the nonlinear equations of motion that arise from retaining these nonlinear, higher?order terms. Simulation results reveal that the inclusion of these terms noticeably changes the motion of the system. Once the equations of motion have been developed, focus turns to the input?output mapping of a system that is simulated using this set of equations. Approxi?mating linear systems is straightforward, and many methods exist that can success?fully perform this function. On the other hand, few approximation methods exist for nonlinear systems. Researchers at Texas A&M University recently developed one such method that obtains a linear estimation and then uses an adaptive polynomial estimation method to compensate for the disparity between that estimate and the true measurements. This research includes an in?depth investigation of this nonlinear approximation technique. Finally, these two major research thrusts are combined, and input?output approx?imation is performed on the nonlinear rotational spacecraft model developed herein. The results of this simulation show that the nonlinear method holds a signi?cant advantage over a traditional linear method in certain situations. Speci?cally, the nonlinear algorithm provides superior approximation for systems with nonzero natu?ral frequencies. For the algorithm to be successful when rigid?body modes are present, the system motion must be persistently exciting. This research is an important ?rst step toward developing a nonlinear parameter identi?cation algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The Green Line or hydro {{corridors}} of Toronto are sprawling lengths of continuous, mostly vacant land {{used for the}} primary purpose of transmitting electricity. They are unusual terrain, physically sparse but culturally intense. Stippled with electrical towers, planned in acres of mowed grass, they hold the promise of light, energy and power. Within a 125 mile radius of downtown Toronto, there are approximately 8, 145 acres of land passing through a wide range of neighborhoods and fabrics [...] yet they currently have very little to offer beyond the transmission of electricity. The stigma of living next to these high voltage power lines [...] with their aging infrastructure and the health hazards associated with the hydro towers [...] has resulted in a dearth of development along these corridors. This thesis investigates the opportunities created by reclaiming one of these public corridors, which is currently an underutilized urban void. The decision to bury the high voltage power lines underground creates a space for economic and social opportunities. The new programs promote potential for social and economic growth and come together in a unique narrow and linear site condition. As an urban strategy that brings together domestic culture with infrastructure and manufacturing, this project can create a radical and innovative urban fabric. By introducing a new underground transportation line and densifying the area around the stops, the new urban fabric could be organized as a sequence of urban centers, while promoting the preservation of the remaining green corridor. The opportunistic corridor will be a series of high density to low density spaces <b>coupled</b> with manufacturing <b>hubs</b> that ultimately add cultural and real estate value to the surrounding neighborhoods.
