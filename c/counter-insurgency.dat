5|$|The {{principal}} protagonists {{were the}} SADF and the PLAN. Other groups involved included the South West African Territorial Force (SWATF) and National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) (both {{aligned with the}} SADF) and the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (both aligned with SWAPO). The South African-aligned forces consisted of regular army (SADF), South West African Police forces and the South West Africa Police <b>Counter-Insurgency</b> Unit (SWAPOL-COIN), including the paramilitary-trained SWAPOL police <b>counter-insurgency</b> unit known as Koevoet.|$|E
5|$|The third <b>counter-insurgency</b> {{operation}} in Kozara was undertaken {{at the end}} of November 1941 by about 19,000 Croatian Home Guards, Ustaše, and Germans. The Partisans emerged from the operation without significant losses, though NDH propaganda claimed that the rebels in Kozara were destroyed and that Stojanović had been killed. The Kozara Partisans never repeated the mistake of frontal resistance. When stronger enemy forces advanced toward them, they manoeuvred to position themselves behind the attackers, thus avoiding battles they could not win. The Partisans therefore did not defend villages. During the third <b>counter-insurgency</b> operation, the Ustaše and Germans killed hundreds of Serb civilians in the villages, resulting in a loss of support for the Partisans among the population. Stojanović thought that a significant victory over the enemy would {{be the best way to}} restore the lost support.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, Southern Rhodesians' {{service on}} Britain's behalf in the World Wars, {{particularly}} the Second, {{was an integral}} part of the colony's national psyche. The territory had also latterly contributed to British <b>counter-insurgency</b> operations in Malaya, Aden and Cyprus, as well as Operation Vantage in Kuwait. The colonial government's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 was deliberately made on 11 November, Armistice Day, in an attempt to emphasise the territory's prior war record on Britain's behalf. The proclamation was signed at 11:00 local time, during the customary two-minute silence to remember the fallen.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>counter-insurgencies</b> {{under the}} Japanese {{occupation}} from 1942 to 1944, Kapampangan guerrilla fighters and the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas fought {{side by side}} in the province of Pampanga, attacking and retreating the Japanese Imperial forces for over three years of fighting and invasion.|$|R

5|$|Following Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, the RLI became {{widely known}} for its <b>counter-insurgency</b> {{operations}} during the Rhodesian Bush War against incursions by ZAPU and ZANU's respective military wings, the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) and Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). The Regiment acquitted itself well in several such operations, with some of its soldiers winning decorations for their actions. Some operations, such as Operations Flotilla and Excess in 1968, involved cooperation with the Portuguese Armed Forces in Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his service}} in Korea, Mitchell was posted in Britain, but in late 1957, he {{returned}} to the Argylls as a company commander with the 1st Battalion, and was posted to Cyprus. At the time, the Cyprus Emergency was in full swing. Mitchell was placed in charge of the coastal towns of Paphos and Ktima, where his men engaged in <b>counter-insurgency</b> operations against EOKA guerrillas. They faced both conventional EOKA raids and forest fires deliberately lit by EOKA fighters and local villagers who were motivated by the money they would receive to fight them.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the corps}} began {{a number of}} {{training}} initiatives with the Republic of Korea Army. These included Operation Key Resolve, a command post exercise simulating major, high intensity combat operations. The exercises were held in Yongin, South Korea. These operations were designed to keep the corps familiar with commanding during large-scale conventional warfare, as opposed to <b>counter-insurgency</b> tactics it employed during its two tours in Iraq. Upon return to the United States, the corps conducted similar exercises at Fort Hood.|$|E
50|$|War {{from the}} Ground Up: Twenty-First Century Combat as Politics is a 2012 book on war and {{military}} strategy written by Emile Simpson, a former British Army officer. The book analyzes the War in Afghanistan (2001-present) {{in terms of}} Carl von Clausewitz's theory of war, arguing that modern <b>counter-insurgencies</b> {{have more in common}} with domestic political struggles than the traditional state-on-state conflicts described by Clausewitz. The book was favorably reviewed by Michael Howard, a prominent military historian, among others.|$|R
50|$|Civil {{affairs in}} the United States Armed Forces are civil-military {{operations}} (CMO) {{use of military force}} to control areas seized from the enemy (or a third party), minimize insurgency or civil interference with military operations, and maximize civil support for military operations. CMO is conducted in conjunction with combat operations during wartime and becomes a central part of a military campaign in <b>counter-insurgencies.</b> CMO operations have been in frequent use since 1775 by the Army, as well as more recently by the Navy and Marine Corps.|$|R

5|$|In May 1962, Serong was {{selected}} to lead the 30-man Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) of instructors to South Vietnam. Serong had been appointed by Pollard—with whom he was close friends—and was given authority to act unilaterally. He conducted a reconnaissance of South Vietnam in June, and {{the main body of}} the AATTV began arriving in early August. Serong based his headquarters in Saigon; the rest of the team was located at various installations throughout the country. Although the AATTV was mostly involved in training the South Vietnamese forces, a few had been attached to the Combined Studies Division, run by the CIA as a <b>counter-insurgency</b> organisation. Serong later became a <b>counter-insurgency</b> advisor to General Paul Harkins, Commander US MACV, but this relationship ended under Pollard's successor, Lieutenant General John Wilton, who reduced Serong's autonomy while continuing to grant him considerable latitude. In May 1963 Serong accepted an invitation to visit the US Special Warfare School in North Carolina, only informing the Military Board after doing so, and he later visited West Germany to become familiar with intelligence activities there, again without informing Wilton, who reacted angrily after finding out about it from a newspaper report. Meanwhile, in late 1963, Serong started to redeploy members of the team into combat advisory roles, and by February 1964 some officers and NCOs were working with Special Forces teams involved in <b>counter-insurgency</b> operations. Resulting in the first involvement of Australian personnel in combat during the conflict, this was a significant decision; it was retrospectively approved by Wilton, who lifted earlier restrictions on the role of AATTV personnel that had prevented them being involved in combat.|$|E
5|$|The Bush War {{involved}} <b>counter-insurgency</b> operations by the Rhodesian Security Forces {{against two}} rival guerrilla armies, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) {{attached to the}} Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), and the military wing of the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). Following its reorganisation as a specialised commando unit starting in late 1964, the RLI {{played a major role}} in the war during its early phase, effectively countering ZANLA and ZIPRA incursions.|$|E
5|$|While it {{achieved}} {{successes and}} proved itself competent in <b>counter-insurgency</b> operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia, the division {{earned a reputation}} for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone. Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia left many hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead by {{the spring and summer}} of 1944.|$|E
50|$|Civil-military {{operations}} or CMO are {{activities of}} a military force to minimize civil interference on and maximize civil support for military operations. CMO is conducted in conjunction with combat operations during wartime and becomes a central part {{of a military}} campaign in <b>counter-insurgencies.</b> Some militaries have specialized units dedicated to conduct CMO, such as civil affairs forces or form task forces specifically for this purposes, such as a joint civil-military operations task force in the U.S. Military. Also, some militaries have staff sections dedicated to planning and coordinating CMO for their command. CMO is often called civil-military co-operation or CIMIC in NATO operations and civil-military co-ordination in UN operations.|$|R
25|$|Operation Chanakya: This was the RAW {{operation}} in the Kashmir region to infiltrate various ISI-backed Kashmiri separatist groups and restore peace in the Kashmir valley. R operatives infiltrated the area, collected military intelligence, and provided evidence about ISI's involvement in training and funding Kashmiri separatist groups. RAW was successful not only in unearthing the links between the ISI and the separatist groups, but also in infiltrating and neutralising the militancy in the Kashmir valley. RAW is also credited for creating a split in the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen. Operation Chanakya also marked the creation of pro-Indian groups in Kashmir like the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen, Muslim Mujahideen etc. These <b>counter-insurgencies</b> consist of ex-militants and relatives of those slain in the conflict. Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen leader Kokka Parrey was himself assassinated by separatists.|$|R

5|$|After ZANLA spent 1971 and 1972 covertly subverting {{the local}} black {{population}} of north-eastern Rhodesia to their {{side in the}} Maoist fashion, it attacked two white farms near the north-eastern village of Centenary in December 1972. The RLI {{was one of the}} first units despatched to counter the infiltration, and Operation Hurricane, a major <b>counter-insurgency</b> action, was started in the country's north-east soon after. Hurricane would last for the rest of the war, eventually just one of seven operational areas defined across Rhodesia by the security forces—Operations Thrasher, Repulse and Tangent followed in 1976, Grapple began a year later and Splinter, covering Lake Kariba, started in 1978. SALOPS ("Salisbury Operations") covered the Rhodesian capital.|$|E
5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost <b>counter-insurgency</b> tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{independence}} from Britain in 1948, Burma had been fighting against ethnic unrest and Chinese Nationalist Kuomingtang irregulars, and several Burmese Army officers had trained in Australia in the 1950s. A Burmese staff officer, Major Muang Muang, later requested the assistance of Serong or another Australian officer. As a result Serong was sent to Burma as a <b>counter-insurgency</b> instructor with the Burmese armed forces, lecturing senior officers {{for a few months}} in 1957 before returning to Australia. Serong subsequently advocated the dispatch of a small team of Australian officers to assist in training the Burmese, but this did not occur. At the request of Muang Muang, Serong returned to Burma in 1960, serving in Rangoon as a strategic adviser to the Burmese armed forces. Muang Muang had resigned in early 1961, and as a consequence Serong's influence was limited from this time, During this period he worked to prepare the Burmese for a border war against China. While in Burma Serong's expertise brought him {{to the attention of the}} US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and as a result he was later invited to supervise <b>counter-insurgency</b> programs in Vietnam. In February 1962 he wrote to Pollard, by then CGS, to suggest the deployment of a small team of Australian officers under his command to South Vietnam to work with the US advisory group there. Soon after the Burmese Army staged a coup, seizing control and moving the country towards communist China, after which Serong made arrangements to leave.|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} a new type of unit became {{apparent}} to the Tactical Mobility Requirements Board (normally referred to as the Howze Board) of the U.S. Army in 1962. The Board met at a difficult time; the bulk of the military hierarchy were focused primary on the Soviet threat to Western Europe, primarily perceived as requiring heavy, conventional units. The creation of new, light airmobile units could only occur at the expense of heavier units. At the same time, the incoming Kennedy administration was placing a much greater emphasis on the need to fight 'small wars', or <b>counter-insurgencies,</b> and was strongly supportive of officers such as General Howze who were embracing new technologies. The Board concluded that a new form of unit would be required, and commissioned tests - but justified these at the time on the need to fight a conventional war in Europe.|$|R
40|$|The wars of {{decolonization}} fought by European {{colonial powers}} after 1945 had their {{origins in the}} fraught history of imperial domination, but were framed and shaped by the emerging politics of the Cold War. Militia recruited from amongst the local population was a common feature in all the <b>counter-insurgencies</b> mounted against armed nationalist risings in this period. Styled here as ‘loyalists’, these militia fought against nationalists. Loyalist histories have often been obscured by nationalist narratives, but their experience was varied and illuminates the deeper ambiguities of the decolonization story, some loyalists being subjected to vengeful violence at liberation, others actually claiming the victory for themselves and seizing control of the emergent state, while others still maintained a role as fighting units into the Cold War. This introductory essay discusses the categorization of these ‘irregular auxiliary’ forces that constituted the armed element of loyalism after 1945, and introduces seven case studies from five European colonialisms—Portugal (Angola), the Netherlands (Indonesia), France (Algeria), Belgium (Congo) and Britain (Cyprus, Kenya and southern Arabia) ...|$|R
40|$|This new {{handbook}} {{provides a}} wide-ranging {{overview of the}} current state of academic analysis and debate on insurgency and counterinsurgency, as well as an-up-to date survey of contemporary insurgent movements and <b>counter-insurgencies.</b> In recent years, and more specifically since the insurgency in Iraq from 2003, academic interest in insurgency and counterinsurgency has substantially increased. These topics have become dominant themes on the security agenda, replacing peacekeeping, humanitarian operations and terrorism as key concepts. The aim of this volume is to showcase the rich thinking that is available in the area of insurgency and counterinsurgency studies and act as a further guide for study and research. In order to contain this wide-ranging topic within an accessible and informative framework, the Editors have divided the text into three key parts: Part I: Theoretical and Analytical Issues Part II: Insurgent Movements Part III: Counterinsurgency Cases The Routledge Handbook of Insurgency and Counterinsurgency will be of great interest to all students of insurgency and small wars, terrorism/counter-terrorism, strategic studies, security studies and IR in general, as well as professional military colleges and policymakers...|$|R
5|$|In 1969, General António Augusto dos Santos was {{relieved}} of command, with General Kaúlza de Arriaga taking over officially in March 1970. Kaúlza de Arriaga favoured {{a more direct}} method of fighting the insurgents, and the established policy of using African <b>counter-insurgency</b> forces was rejected in favour of the deployment of regular Portuguese forces accompanied by {{a small number of}} African fighters. Indigenous personnel were still recruited for special operations, such as the Special Groups of Parachutists in 1973, though their role less significant under the new commander. His tactics were partially influenced by a meeting with United States General William Westmoreland.|$|E
5|$|The Australians had {{continued}} to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy province, and while the war had become a series of big unit search and destroy operations in a war of attrition for the Americans, they had pursued their own <b>counter-insurgency</b> campaign. Regardless, differences of opinion between Australian and American methods had produced friction, and increasingly impatient with the Australian approach, in early 1967 the Commander US MACV, General William Westmoreland, had complained to the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, demanding a more aggressive approach. However, the Australians were convinced that deliberate patrolling techniques were more effective in separating communist forces from {{the population in the}} villages while working towards slowly extending government control, and such urgings went largely unheeded.|$|E
5|$|The RLI {{was formed}} in February 1961 as a light {{infantry}} battalion made up exclusively of white recruits. After first seeing action in September 1961 on the Northern Rhodesian border with Katanga, it relocated to Cranborne Barracks, Salisbury the following year and remained there {{as part of the}} Southern Rhodesian Army after the Federation dissolved on 31 December 1963. Violent political intimidation of black Rhodesians by two rival communist-backed revolutionary parties, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), necessitated a specially trained <b>counter-insurgency</b> unit, and the RLI was accordingly reformed into a commando regiment during 1964 and 1965 under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Walls.|$|E
40|$|While {{economic}} agendas {{have been}} shown to be an important factor in shaping civil wars, there are several problems with prominent explanations centring on rebel ‘greed’, notably those put forward by Paul Collier. Among these are: the way proxies for ‘greed’ and ‘grievance’ have been used; the lack of attention to links between ‘greed’ and ‘grievance’; and the lack of attention to ‘greed’ among elements associated with <b>counter-insurgencies.</b> Why has Collier's analysis proven so popular, despite its flaws? I suggest that it represents an attractive over-simplification with a scientific aura. It achieves a degree of simplicity by excluding many of the most important features of civil wars, even to the extent of asserting that there is no point in asking rebels about their motivations. Furthermore, it is often politically convenient in that it tends to exclude a number of western governments—and (sometimes favoured) governments in poorer countries—from serious scrutiny. By contrast, the emphasis placed by Frances Stewart and her associates on the role of economic and political inequalities between groups offers a more nuanced understanding of how civil wars are caused and shaped, an understanding that is better able to take account of the nature of grievances and of the role of abusive government-affiliated actors in generating grievances...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning World War II, Chinese {{soldiers}} and guerrillas {{joined in the}} fight against the Japanese Imperial Forces during the Japanese Occupation in the Philippines (1941-1945). On April 9, 1942, many Chinese Filipino Prisoners of War were killed by Japanese Forces during the Bataan Death March after the fall of Bataan and Corregidor in 1942.

Thousands of Chinese Filipino Veterans are interred in the Shrine of Martyr's Freedom of the Filipino Chinese in World War II located in Manila. The new-found unity between the ethnic Chinese migrants and the indigenous Filipinos against a common enemy - the Japanese, served as a catalyst in the formation of a Chinese Filipino identity who started to regard the Philippines as their home.|$|R
5|$|The {{unity of}} NATO was {{breached}} early in its history, with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle's presidency of France from 1958 onwards. De Gaulle protested at the United States' strong {{role in the}} organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958, he argued {{for the creation of}} a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the United States and the United Kingdom, and also for the expansion of NATO's coverage to include geographical areas of interest to France, most notably French Algeria, where France was waging a <b>counter-insurgency</b> and sought NATO assistance.|$|E

5|$|Yusuf {{has built}} a largely subservient and loyal {{apparatus}} by putting his fellow Majerteen clansmen in strategic positions. The National Security Agency (NSA) under General Mohamed Warsame (“Darwish”) and the so-called “Majerteen militia” units in the TFG army operate in parallel and often above other security agencies. Their exact number is hard to ascertain, but estimates suggest about 2,000. They are well catered for, well armed and often carry out <b>counter-insurgency</b> operations {{with little or no}} coordination with other security agencies. In the short term, this strategy may appear effective for the president, who can unilaterally employ the force essentially as he pleases. However, it undermines morale in the security services and is a cause of their high desertion rates.|$|E
5|$|A modest force {{remained}} in Afghanistan over {{this time and}} was involved in <b>counter-insurgency</b> operations in Uruzgan Province in conjunction United States and other coalition forces, including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Diệm and the {{execution}} of Cẩn in May 1964, the VNQDD became more active in their strongholds in central Vietnam. Nevertheless, there was no coherent national leadership and groups at district and provincial level tended to operate autonomously. By 1965, their members had managed to infiltrate and take over the Peoples Action Teams (PATs), irregular paramilitary <b>counter-insurgency</b> forces organised by Australian Army advisers to fight the communists, and used them for their own purposes. In December, one VNQDD member had managed to turn his PAT colleagues towards the nationalist agenda, and the local party leadership in Quảng Nam approached the Australians {{in an attempt to}} have the 1000-man PAT outfit formally allied to the VNQDD. The overture was rejected. The politicisation of paramilitary units worked both ways; some province chiefs used the anti-communist forces to assassinate political opponents, including VNQDD members.|$|E
