Five-axis {{machine tool}} with two {{additional}} rotary axes {{has been widely}} used in defense, aerospace and the consumer industries, and is an important process of precision manufacturing. Traditional five-axis program depends on the machine tool’s configuration and machining setting. This leads to inconvenience of reprogramming five-axis NC code for the end users. This paper proposes a cutting point control algorithm for five-axis machining. Although the commercial advanced controllers provide this function, they are very expensive and restricted to export. The developed algorithm can be embedded to the PC-based controller so that the specific <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> <b>data</b> can be transformed and employed easily for different cutting tools.

An impeller {{is also one of the}} most important basic components of centrifugal compressor. When a three-axis CNC machining centre is used for producing an impeller, great difficulties, i. e. collisions between the cutting tool and the impeller, can occur. As the surface is normally twisted in design to achieve the required performance, it can cause overcut and collision problems during machining. To solve these problems, an integrated five-axis machining approach for a centrifugal impeller by combining related machining technologies is developed. As a result, <b>Cutter</b> <b>Location</b> <b>data</b> based on the geometry model of blade and hub of the impeller are generated. Finally, the <b>Cutter</b> <b>Location</b> <b>data</b> is verified through software simulation. The results prove that the machining methodology adopted is useful and efficient...|$|E

A manufacturing part {{is represented by}} mathematical curves and surfaces. Using the mathematical representation of the manufacturing part, we generate reliable and near optimal tool paths as well as <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> (CL) <b>data</b> file for postprocessing. This algorithm includes two components. First is the forward-step function which determines maximum distance called forward- step between two cutter contact (CC) points with given tolerance. This function is independent of the surface type and is applicable to all continuous parametric surfaces that are twice differentiable. The second component is the side-step function which determines maximum distance called side-step between two adjacent tool paths with a given scallop height. This algorithm reduces manufacturing and computing {{time as well as}} the CC points while keeping the given tolerance and scallop height in the tool paths. Several parts, for which the CC points are generated using the proposed algorithm, are machined using a three axes milling machine.

The goal of the project {{is to create a}} robot program that can manufacture a part by Metal Deposition from a 3 -D CAD model (Unigraphics) via a CAM module and a CAR program (IGRIP) to an ABB robot. Metal Deposition is a method to build new parts, add material to an existing part and repair components that have been damaged in earlier processes. The method can be used with different kinds of welding with powder or welding wire as the additive material. Three reference geometries were used; two bosses and a circular sweep. UG/CAM is used to create the CLS (<b>Cutter</b> <b>Location</b> Source) <b>data.</b> Different milling operations are used to emulate welding. The program which imports the coordinates from the CLS data to IGRIP, as well as the export program, was written in GSL (Graphics Simulation Language). GSL is a Pascal-like programming language used to control the behaviour of simulation models. The import program reads linear movement coordinates line by line until the whole CLS file has been converted into IGRIP. UG/CAM should only use linear movement when using this program.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{postprocessor}} creation process. When using standard commercially available postprocessors it is often very difficult to modify its internal source code, {{and it is a}} very complex process, in many cases even impossible, to implement the newly-developed functions.

The goal of our work is to verify the proposed method for creating a postprocessor. Postprocessor functions for multi-axis machiningare dealt with in this work. A file with CL data must be translated by the postprocessor into an NC program that has been customized for a specific production machine and its control system. The postprocessor is therefore verified by applications for machining free-form surfaces of complex parts, and by executing the NC programs that are generated on real machine tools.

The fabrication of high-quality freeform lens is based on ultra-precision freeform machining technology which allows direct machining of freeform surfaces with submicrometric form accuracy and nanometric surface finish. In this paper, the application of ultra-precision freeform machining to the fabrication of an optical freeform surface is addressed. The methodology {{for the development of the}} tool path generator for a progressive lens is discussed.

40|$|This paper {{makes it}} {{possible}} to predict the output motion of a parallel mechanism and proposes a method for generating a tool path of a machine tool consisting of the parallel mechanism. As a numerically controlled machine tool generally processes a work by interpolating an ideal shape with linear lines, a deviation between a path of tool and the ideal shape can be estimated easily. However, an input-output relation of the parallel mechanism is nonlinear, and accordingly an output pose of the parallel mechanism can be hardly determined by the direct kinematics. A prediction of the deviation of the parallel mechanism machine tool is therefore extremely difficult, so that a generation of its tool path that ensures a given allowance is not easy. Thus the present study proposes a simple method to predict the tool path of the parallel mechanism by approximating its motion with a spiral path. By using a prediction result, the study determines an efficiently optimal <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> <b>data</b> to realize the tool path that ensures a required deviation...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of the swept volume of {{a cutting tool}} is es-sential in NC verification algorithms for detecting deficiencies in a proposed tool path, such as gouging, undercutting and interfer-ence. This paper explores a new technique for generating the swept volume of a toroidal endmill, and analyzes the results ob-tained for two test cases. For a given tool location along a path, a curve on the cutting surface of the tool is identified that rs:presents the imprint of the tool on the machined surface. This curve will be designated a space curve as it is defined in 3 D spa. ce. The method relies on forward difference information obtained from a G-code or <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> <b>data</b> file in order to compute the space curves. Once several su. ccessive space curves have been identi-fied, a facetted surface model of the footprint of the tool along a pass may be readily calculated and compared with the design sur-face. The method has b,een verified for two test cases: a) 5 -axis tool path on a hemispherical cavity and b) a 5 -axis tool path on the complex surface of a turbine blade. Results from the new method are compared with the slow, but dependable my- casting technique. It is concluded that the new technique offers al fast and accurate method of verifying multi-axis tool paths.

40|$|This article {{provides}} a {{design for the}} real-time interpolator of the B-Spline free surface. The goal is to increase both the accuracy and the speed of manufacturing production by eliminating the bottleneck caused by the off-line interpolator of the CNC tool machines, by reducing manufacturing errors, and by resolving the issue of long numeric control code (NC code). The design of the surface interpolator includes location planning using the real-time cutter contact data, the interpolation of the cutter contact data, and the cutting compensation of the <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> <b>data.</b> This paper provides a surface interpolation method for reading the surface NC code of a three-dimensional surface and for implementing the surface interpolation. To simplify {{the complexity of the}} calculation, one can first use knot interpolation to decompose the B-Spline surface into sections of Bezier surface, which are then used as the surface for real-time surface interpolation. Subsequently, the approximation of the second order Taylor expansion is used to obtain the location interpolation points. Fixed machining parameters are adopted to avoid the low efficiency and low quality of manufacturing caused by variation of the feeding speed. The derived cutting locations are further combined to obtain the cutting locations of the original B-Spline surface. The verification of the experiments is shown with comparing the manufacturing profile errors and any variation of the feeding speed derived from computer simulation and the corresponding data obtained from the off-line interpolators...|$|E

40|$|Five-axis flank milling {{has been}} {{commonly}} used in the manufacturing of complex workpieces because of its greater productivity than that of three-axis or five-axis end milling. The advantage of this milling operation largely depends on effective <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> planning. The finished surface sometimes suffers from large geometrical errors induced by improper tool positioning, due to the non-developability of most ruled surfaces in industrial applications. In addition, a slender flank-milling cutter may be deflected when subjected to large cutting forces during the machining process, further degrading the surface quality or even breaking the cutter. This paper proposes a novel tool path planning scheme to address those problems. A simple but effective algorithm is developed to adaptively allocate a series of <b>cutter</b> <b>locations</b> over the design surface with each one being confined within an angular rotation range. The allocation result satisfies a given constraint of geometrical errors on the finished surface, which consists of the tool positioning errors at each <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> and the sweeping errors between consecutive ones. In addition, a feed rate scheduling algorithm is proposed to maximize the machining efficiency subject to the cutting force constraint and the kinematical constraints of a specific machine configuration. Simulation and experimental tests are conducted to validate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithms. Both the machining efficiency and finish surface quality are greatly improved compared with conventional <b>cutter</b> <b>locations...</b>|$|R
