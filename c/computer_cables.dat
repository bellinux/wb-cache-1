25|$|The {{work done}} by Erith and Terry in the 1960s and 1980s {{represent}} the most extensive remodelling of Number 10 in recent times. Since 1990 when the Terry reconstruction was completed, repairing, redecorating, remodelling, and updating the house has been ongoing as needed. The IRA mortar attack in February 1991 led to extensive work being done {{to repair the damage}} (mostly to the garden and exterior walls) and to improve security. In the summer of 1993 windows were rebuilt and in 1995 <b>computer</b> <b>cables</b> installed. In 1997, the building was remodelled to provide extra space for the Prime Minister's greatly increased staff. To accommodate their large families, both Tony Blair and David Cameron chose to live in the private residence above Number 11 rather than the smaller one above Number 10. In 2010, the Camerons completely modernised the 50-year-old private kitchen in Number 11.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second of}} three spacewalks was {{completed}} on flight day 7. Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick {{were able to}} complete all their planned tasks in 5 hours and 54 minutes. The tasks included installing ammonia coolant loops, thermal blankets to protect the ammonia hoses, outfitting the earth facing port of Tranquility for the Cupola, install handrails and a non-propulsive vent valve (NPV). During the connection {{of one of the}} ammonia hoses, a small amount of ammonia leaked out of a quick disconnect valve and floated towards Nick Patrick. Procedures called for a [...] "bake-out" [...] while Patrick worked during the sunlit portion of the orbit, and a contamination test in the airlock. The bake-out happened {{at the end of the}} spacewalk. While the spacewalk was happening, Terry Virts and Kay Hire along with ISS commander Jeff Williams, Soichi Noguchi and T.J. Creamer, continued outfitting the Tranquility module. This included setting up the ventilation system, connecting electrical and <b>computer</b> <b>cables</b> and configuring racks. They confirmed lights and computers were on in the node once the ammonia cooling system had been activated. The crew also received word the mission had been extended by one day in the morning.|$|E

50|$|Her first {{personal}} exhibition {{takes place}} in 1980 at Cérès Franco's Œil de Boeuf Gallery, {{with the support of}} a state subsidy for first exhibitions. There, she displays open bodies, reconstructed from resin and marble {{in the style of the}} anatomic waxes of the 18th century which she had closely studied at La Specola Museum of Florence. Fluctuating between realism ("Flesh and bones", 1980) and slight abstraction ("The Tarot Arcana", 1993) or total abstraction ("Limps", 2007), she develops her recurrent theme of human finitude. She illustrates it with bronze, wood, sponge, glass, rubber or <b>computer</b> <b>cables.</b> In 1984 she is a laureate of the General Council of Ile de France for a marble work integrating a hologram.|$|E

5000|$|After the incident, Duffy the {{administrator}} announces {{that all is}} safe and that mining operations will recommence soon. It is this that Professor Ingosol disagrees. He believes that they [...] "must evacuate immediately!" [...] to which Duffy replies, [...] "where to?" [...] "To KL-5." [...] KL-5 was the original set up ship to get to Io. It was designed to provide the colonists with all the systems necessary to begin the colony. However, the ship was also designed to {{not be used for}} long distance travel; most of the station has been gutted out to install the systems on Io. KL-5 is also a derelict station, not having been used for nearly 10 years. Michael talks his dad into taking up professor Ingosol to check out the station after hearing his and Duffy's exchange. Against his better judgment, they are soon jetting up to KL-5 on the tug with 2 stowaways, Michael and Kumiko. Due to the security system designed to monitor the colony and surrounding space, Duffy is alerted to an unauthorised tug takeoff. With this he tries to contact the tug. The explanation by the 'rogue pilot' is that he was giving the tug's engines a test fire. As they approach the station, the remote access system designed to reactivate the system does not respond. Professor Ingosol suggests that they go in through the garbage chute and reactivate the power. There's only one problem, it's too small for adults but just the right size for a pair of teenagers. Michael and Kumiko, who have now been discovered, become the reluctant explorers of the derelict station. There's also another catch: the power packs on the environmental suits are both very low; only 10 minutes of air is available. The location of the garbage chute is close to the stations hub so they should make it in time. Meanwhile, back on the colony, Carl and the other scientists run into the control station and explain to Duffy that the mining charges they were using to redirect the lava flow away from the main shaft have now fractured the substrata, and lava is now pouring into all of the tunnels. It is now just a race against time. Duffy recontacts the tug and orders them to reactivate the station. At this time, Michael and Kumiko have both made it into the station. However, the station was redesigned and no longer fits the layout as explained by Professor Ingosol. Just as they are about to turn back, Kumiko leads them following <b>computer</b> <b>cables</b> into the main hub. At this, the view screen back in the colony and in the tug of the operation is disrupted due to company security systems designed to secure the station. As they descend the stairs into the station, warning lights come on indicating that they only have 1 minute of air left. After getting to the main terminal and inserting the main boot disc, the system remains dead. After several tries, there is not much time left. Michael hits the computer and the station begins whirring to life. The station's magnificent solar sails open up to absorb the sunlight from the sun and to also restart the power and life systems. Soon the station has breathable oxygen and both Michael and Kumiko declare that [...] "KL-5 is ready for passengers." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to derive {{baseline}} statistics from a sample of Taiwan electronics companies, particularly information about the usage of traditional paper catalogs versus the emerging electronic or Internet based catalogs. The baseline study compares paper catalogs to website catalogs (e-catalogs) for the Taiwan computer and peripherals manufacturing industry but also looks at the usage and content of paper catalogs by manufacturers of portable computers or laptops, personal digital assistants, and electrical <b>computer</b> <b>cables</b> and connectors. Comprehensive catalog content information was collected using Internet searches, factory site visits, phone interviews, and mail-out requests for paper product catalogs. The paper catalogs and web-sites were analyzed using code sheets by a team of two analysts that double checked each other’s evaluations. The taxonomy of products was studied across five classification systems, as well as across local trade show classifications and association standards. As a result, this study identifies some of the problems with implementing Internet based catalogs and provides recommendations for promoting the use of generic e-catalog content to better expose prospective buyers to the items offered for sale by Taiwan electronics manufacturers...|$|E
40|$|PC-CUBE is an {{ensemble}} of IBM PCs or close compatibles connected in the hypercube topology with ordinary <b>computer</b> <b>cables.</b> Communication {{occurs at the}} rate of 115. 2 K-band via the RS- 232 serial links. Available for PC-CUBE is the Crystalline Operating System III (CrOS III), Mercury Operating System, CUBIX and PLOTIX which are parallel I/O and graphics libraries. A CrOS performance monitor was developed to facilitate the measurement of communication and computation time of a program and their effects on performance. Also available are CXLISP, a parallel version of the XLISP interpreter; GRAFIX, some graphics routines for the EGA and CGA; and a general execution profiler for determining execution time spent by program subroutines. PC-CUBE provides a programming environment similar to all hypercube systems running CrOS III, Mercury and CUBIX. In addition, every node (personal computer) has its own graphics display monitor and storage devices. These allow data to be displayed or stored at every processor, which has much instructional value and enables easier debugging of applications. Some application programs which are taken from the book Solving Problems on Concurrent Processors (Fox 88) were implemented with graphics enhancement on PC-CUBE. The applications range from solving the Mandelbrot set, Laplace equation, wave equation, long range force interaction, to WaTor, an ecological simulation...|$|E
40|$|FABLED EYE ACCOMMODATES REVELATION {{is an art}} {{system that}} {{highlights}} the combinatory possibilities of language in ʻdigital systemsʼ, and our collusion in such distributed literal systems in society, (such as google). It questions the ascendency of the image by contrasting screen-based outputs and hand screen-printed outputs from the system. This piece directly confronts Marshall McLuhanʼs idea of "The medium is the message" {{in the sense that}} the form of a medium embeds itself in the message, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived. The artist is interested in how the viewer’s response to communication, transported through text and phrases, is mediated by the medium. The work consists of a computer that randomly generates phrases in real-time with a set of screen-printed prints of phrases that were randomly generated, using the same computer algorithm. The physical quality of the screen-printed work and a challenging palette of colours have the potential to act as visual interference to the message. A version of FABLED EYE ACCOMMODATES REVELATION was exhibited as part of the group show Teaser at Baltic 39, curated by Christine Borland, (May-June, 2012).
