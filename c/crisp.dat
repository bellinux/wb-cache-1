5|$|After {{completing}} his collegiate career, <b>Crisp</b> began his long coaching {{career at the}} University of Alabama. There he served as the head basketball coach (1924–1942, 1945–1946), baseball coach (1928), track coach (1921–1927), as a line coach with the football team (1921–1941, 1945, 1950–1957) and as athletic director (1930–1940, 1954–1957). <b>Crisp</b> also served as an assistant and interim head coach with the Miami Seahawks (1946) and as a line coach at Tulane (1947–1949).|$|E

40|$|AbstractUnwashed, sliced, batch-fried potato <b>crisps</b> have {{a unique}} texture and are growing in {{popularity}} in the UK/EU premium snack food market. In this study, the storage stability of unwashed sliced (high surface starch) potatoes (<b>crisps)</b> fried in regular sunflower oil (SO) or in high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) was compared over accelerated shelf life testing (45 °C, 6 weeks); with and without nitrogen gas flushing. Primary oxidation products (lipid hydroperoxides) were measured with a ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange (FOX) assay and volatile secondary oxidation products (hexanal) were quantified by using solid phase micro-extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS). Results revealed that <b>crisps</b> fried in SO were the least stable. Flushing the stored <b>crisps</b> with nitrogen gas proved {{to be effective in}} slowing down the oxidation rate after frying with sunflower oil, significantly stabilizing the <b>crisps.</b> However, <b>crisps</b> fried in HOSO were the most stable, with the lowest rate of development of oxidation markers, and this has previously not been shown for <b>crisps</b> with a high free starch content...|$|R

5|$|As {{a member}} of the Gobblers {{football}} team, he was the team captain for the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA) champion 1918 VPI squad.

During his second tenure, <b>Crisp</b> hired Jennings B. Whitworth as football coach in 1954 and Eugene Lambert as basketball coach in 1956. In 1957, he resigned his post and hired Bear Bryant as his replacement as athletic director at Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a <b>crisp</b> coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. <b>Crisp</b> well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{effective}} porosity {{is an important}} quantitative parameter for food products that has {{a significant effect on}} taste and quality. It is challenging to quantify the apparent porosity of fried potato <b>crisps</b> as they have a thin irregularly shaped cross section containing oil and water. This study uses a novel micro-CT technique to determine the solid volume fraction and hence the {{effective porosity}} of three types of potato crisps: standard continuously fried <b>crisps,</b> microwaved <b>crisps,</b> and continuously fried ‘kettle’ <b>crisps.</b> Results It was found that continuously fried kettle <b>crisps</b> had the lowest effective porosity at 0. 54, providing the desired crunchy taste and lower oil contents. <b>Crisps</b> produced using a microwave process designed to mimic the dehydration process of standard continuous fried <b>crisps</b> had an effective porosity of 0. 65, which was very similar to the effective porosity of 0. 63 for standard continuously fried <b>crisps.</b> The results were supported by the findings of a forced preference consumer test. Conclusion The effective porosity affects the product taste and is therefore a critical parameter. This study shows that micro-CT analysis can be used to characterise the change in effective porosity of a thin irregularly shaped food product, caused by a change of cooking procedure...|$|R

After deep frying, the <b>crisps</b> were cooled to room temperature, packed in paper-lined high density polythene pouches and stored in a dark cupboard at room temperature for three months. During the storage period, the <b>crisps</b> were analyzed for proteins, fat and carotenoid content. Changes in sensory attributes were analyzed using a semi-trained panel.
