40|$|This study {{examines}} whether nonhomothetic preferences underlie the "missing trade" problem associated with factor content of trade models. We first find that {{per capita income}} {{goes a long way}} in explaining differences in goods consumption across countries. We then find a striking correlation between the factor content of consumption and per capita income, and show that accounting for this is a key part of resolving the case of the missing trade. However, nonhomothetic preferences over broad <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> play only a small role in this phenomenon. Rather, we find that as income grows, spending is directed towards the relatively capital-intensive version of a given good. Since recent research shows that capital intensity is correlated with quality (Schott, 2004), our results suggest that within-product quality differences are likely important for explaining the factor content of trade, whereas nonhomothetic preferences over broad <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> are much less so.

40|$|The decline, or stagnation, in broad-based social expenditure, {{so crucial}} to the well being of mother and child, occurs because of various reasons. First, the {{government}} may derive less utility from this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure,</b> compared to spending on its political support group, the military or other prestige projects. Second, the authorities may find that they have less revenue {{in the era of}} globalization because of international tax competition, falling domestic tax bases and capital flight. Third, in the interests of macroeconomic stability the government may have to balance its books. This usually means expenditure reduction rather than revenue expansion. In a setting of overall spending cuts, the burden borne by the social sector is often greater than in other areas such as defence. This paper is concerned with aspects of both the revenue and expenditure side in the provision of social services. It demonstrates that small and vulnerable developing can be seriously disadvantaged by international tax competition in mobile factors. This is most applicable to North-South tax competition, as well as competition between larger and smaller nations in the South. The very existence of mobile capital, and the danger of its exit, may induce developing countries in general to lower corporate tax rates below the OECD average. On the expenditure side, policy coherence amongst bilateral and multilateral donors is necessary {{in the context of the}} HIPC initiative, which aims to divert debt-servicing to social sector expenditure.

Recent national studies have compared the enrollment characteristics and operations of public and private schools. These studies, however, did not examine the financial aspects. ^ This study deals on a state-wide basis with the type of financial variables unavailable to national researchers. Expense and enrollment figures were collected for 1980 - 1981, from public, Catholic private, and independent private schools in Connecticut. ^ Three basic types of analytical procedures were used to answer the basic research question; is there a significant disparity in per pupil expenditures between public and private schools in Connecticut? First, descriptive statistics provided the distributional characteristics of each of the variables including measures of central tendency and variability. Second, a two-way ANOVA using per pupil expenditure as the dependent variable and school sector and grade level as the two independent variables were used to distinguish differences between public and private schools. And third, two repeated measures ANOVA 2 ̆ 7 s of the Lingquist Type III Design examined differences between public and private schools by grade level, by school sector, and by five comparable categories of expenditure. Repeated measures were across all five levels of the third independent variable. ^ The results of the two-way ANOVA indicate that there is a significant difference in per pupil expenditure between public schools and Catholic private schools but that grade level effects are the same for these two school sectors. ^ Follow-up analyses in the form of a Tukey HSD Multiple comparison test indicated significant differences in the categories of employee benefits, and expenses for other support and administrative/instructional salaries, between the public and the Catholic private schools. ^ Although there were no significant differences between the independent private schools and the public schools in the same town, by school type or by grade level, there were significant differences by <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure.</b> ^ A conclusion from the analyses is that Catholic schools spend considerably less per student than either the public schools or their private independent school counterparts, even after adjustments to reflect differences in services provided. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{undertaken}} a comprehensive {{theoretical and empirical}} analysis {{of the relationship between}} public spending and economic growth in a neoclassical framework. The focus of the analysis has been to underline two different rules that determine the allocation of public resources across different categories of expenditure. The first rule considers the effective needs of each category and their productivity, relative to the other categories and to private capital. This allows the effect of each <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> on the growth rate of the economy, when productive, to be determined. Following this line of argument, the standard model (a model which only includes this rule) pre- dicts a non-linear relationship between the components of public spending and economic growth, justifying both positive and negative impacts of these components on the economy’s growth rate. When applied to the defence sector, this model can show that the contradictory results found in the literature for the relationship between military burden and economic growth may be explained by an excessive amount of resources attributed to this sector, when its productivity level is lower than that of the other parts of the public sector. A second rule that drives public allocation decisions is not linked to any economic considerations, but to the possibility for the politician can collect bribes by misallocating public resources. As pointed out by many researchers, it is easier to collect bribes from infrastructure projects or highly sophisticated defence equipment than textbooks or teachers’ salaries. In other areas, such as health, this picture is less clear-cut, as opportunities to collect bribes may be abundant in the procurement of hospital buildings, but more limited in the payment of doctors’ and nurses’ salaries. This differential impact of corruption can be used to explain the non-linearities that emerge in the standard model. The underlying conjecture is that, since corruption has a nega- tive impact on growth and given that politicians may favour less productive public sectors, the complementarities between these two mechanisms may explain the low growth rates in those countries in which corruption is more endemic. A related contribution in the thesis is to consider the way corruption is introduced into estimated of growth equations. While several recent papers have considered the underlying causes and consequences of corruption, little (and only recent) attention has been given to the methodological question of how ”corruption” is measured by international organisations and whether there construction of indices may bias empirical results and suggestions for policy. The final part of the thesis considers these issues...|$|E

The paper shows that in a general equilibrium model with given exogenous fiscal policy, a nonlinear relation exists between the suboptimal longrun growth rate in a competitive economy and distortionary tax rates. When fiscal policy is endogenously chosen at a social optimum, the relation between the rate of growth and tax rates is always negative. These two conclusions suggest that the interaction between fiscal policy and growth may be complicated enough that it cannot be captured in a simple linear model using an aggregate measure of fiscal policy. The sources of nonlinearity include expectation and coordination of fiscal policy, impluse response of government policies, and the presence of positive externality due to government spending.
