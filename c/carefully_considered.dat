5|$|Diamond is the allotrope {{of carbon}} {{in which the}} carbon atoms are {{arranged}} in the specific type of cubic lattice called diamond cubic. Diamond is an optically isotropic crystal that is transparent to opaque. Diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Yet, due to important structural weaknesses, diamond's toughness is only fair to good. The precise tensile strength of diamond is unknown, however strength up to 60GPa has been observed, {{and it could be}} as high as 90–225GPa depending on the crystal orientation. The anisotropy of diamond hardness is <b>carefully</b> <b>considered</b> during diamond cutting. Diamond has a high refractive index (2.417) and moderate dispersion (0.044) properties which give cut diamonds their brilliance. Scientists classify diamonds into four main types according to the nature of crystallographic defects present. Trace impurities substitutionally replacing carbon atoms in a diamond's crystal structure, and in some cases structural defects, are responsible for the wide range of colors seen in diamond. Most diamonds are electrical insulators but extremely efficient thermal conductors. Unlike many other minerals, the specific gravity of diamond crystals (3.52) has rather small variation from diamond to diamond.|$|E

The goals that are reinforced through incentive pay should be <b>carefully</b> <b>considered</b> {{to make sure they}} are in alignment with the organizational objectives. If there are multiple rewards programs, it is important to consider if there might be any conflicting goals. For example, individual and team-based rewards can sometime work at cross-purposes.|$|E

In principle, uninformative and flat priors, that exaggerate our subjective ignorance about the parameters, may still yield reasonable parameter estimates. However, Bayes factors are highly sensitive to the prior distribution of parameters. Conclusions on model choice based on Bayes factor can be misleading unless the sensitivity of conclusions to the choice of priors is <b>carefully</b> <b>considered.</b>|$|E

25|$|Attack {{criteria}} and approval: The political {{dimensions of the}} attack were <b>carefully</b> <b>considered,</b> such as the timing of an election in the enemy camp, or the appointment of certain government officials. Planning involved a coordinated effort by military and logistics staff and the all-important political operatives, the party cadres who had the last word. Proposals for an operation were first sent up the chain of command. Depending {{on the scale of}} the planned operation, an idea to attack a certain village post might float up from Provincial, to Zone, to Interzone levels. Great stress was placed on a successful outcome that would be beneficial in terms of actual military results or propaganda. Numerical superiority was deemed essential.|$|E
25|$|Death {{in those}} with a GI bleed is more {{commonly}} due to other illnesses (some of which {{may have contributed to}} the bleed, such as cancer or cirrhosis) than the bleeding itself. Of those admitted to a hospital because of a GI bleed, death occurs in about 7%. Despite treatment, re-bleeding occurs in about 7–16% of those with upper GI bleeding. In those with esophageal varices, bleeding occurs in about 5–15% a year and if they have bled once, there is a higher risk of further bleeding within six weeks. Testing and treating H. pylori if found can prevent re-bleeding {{in those with}} peptic ulcers. The benefits versus risks of restarting blood thinners such as aspirin or warfarin and anti-inflammatories such as NSAIDs need to be <b>carefully</b> <b>considered.</b> If aspirin is needed for cardiovascular disease prevention, it is reasonable to restart it within seven days in combination with a PPI for those with nonvariceal upper GI bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Rejecting a {{work is a}} {{very serious}} action and one which we do not take lightly. Where {{possible}} we try to consider cuts or, in the case of games, modifications which remove the material which contravenes the Board's published Guidelines. In the case of Manhunt 2 this has not been possible. Manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone in an overall game context which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing. There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism {{in the way in which}} these killings are committed, and encouraged, in the game. Although the difference should not be exaggerated the fact of the game's unrelenting focus on stalking and brutal slaying and the sheer lack of alternative pleasures on offer to the gamer, together with the different overall narrative context, contribute towards differentiating this submission from the original Manhunt game. That work was classified '18' in 2003, before the BBFC's recent games research had been undertaken, but was already at the very top end of what the Board judged to be acceptable at that category. Against this background, the Board's <b>carefully</b> <b>considered</b> view is that to issue a certificate to Manhunt 2, on either platform, would involve a range of unjustifiable harm risks, to both adults and minors, within the terms of the Video Recordings Act, and accordingly that its availability, even if statutorily confined to adults, would be unacceptable to the public.|$|E

500|$|In 1843 Balzac placed Le Père Goriot in {{the section}} of La Comédie humaine {{entitled}} [...] "Scènes de la vie parisienne" [...] ("Scenes of life in Paris"). Quickly thereafter, he reclassified it– due to its intense focus on the private lives of its characters– {{as one of the}} [...] "Scènes de la vie privée" [...] ("Scenes of private life"). These categories and the novels in them were his attempt to create a body of work [...] "depicting all society, sketching it in the immensity of its turmoil". Although he had prepared only a small predecessor for La Comédie humaine, entitled Études de Mœurs, at this time, Balzac <b>carefully</b> <b>considered</b> each work's place in the project and frequently rearranged its structure.|$|E
500|$|Atlus's senior {{project manager}} Masaru Nanba commented {{it was decided}} that [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] was to be kept in the title of Persona 3 and Persona 4, as it was {{believed}} that {{they were part of the}} same series as however, the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] title was omitted from both Persona 4 Golden and Persona 4 Arena, as it would have been much too long. Similarly, Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena and Persona 4: The Golden were shortened to the previously stated titles. As with Persona 3, the honorifics used in the Japanese voice track were retained in the English dub, despite proving contentions among series fans. This was done as part of an intended trend to remain faithful to the original source material. The pronunciations of honorifics, along with the sounds of names, were a point that was <b>carefully</b> <b>considered</b> by the localization team and it took a while for the English cast to get used to them. A member of the English dub that also appeared in Persona 3 was Yuri Lowenthal. Though he had dubbed characters in Persona 3, Namba wanted him to have a larger part. His role as Yosuke ended up featuring 1000 more lines of dialogue than the other major characters. Important roles for the localization team were Teddie and Rise, as they would be the party's supports. Another element in the English script was that the use of swear words was increased over Persona 3: the first draft featured very strong language which was cut as it did not seem suited. The character Kanji was given a lot of swearing in his dialogue, due to his volatile nature. The use of swearing was <b>carefully</b> <b>considered</b> depending on the emotional situation.|$|E

500|$|Steinitz {{strove to}} be {{objective}} in his writings about chess competitions and games, for example he attributed to sheer bad luck a poor tournament score by Henry Edward Bird, whom he considered no friend of his, and was generous in his praise of great play by even his bitter enemies. He could poke fun at {{some of his own}} rhetoric, for example [...] "I remarked that I would rather die in America than live in England. ... I added that I would rather lose a match in America than win one in England. But after having <b>carefully</b> <b>considered</b> the subject in all its bearings, I {{have come to the conclusion}} that I neither mean to die yet nor to lose the match." [...] At a joint simultaneous display in Russia around the time of the 1895–96 Saint Petersburg tournament, Emanuel Lasker and Steinitz formed an impromptu comedy double act.|$|E
500|$|Pitchfork called Madvillainy [...] "inexhaustibly brilliant, with layer-upon-layer of <b>carefully</b> <b>considered</b> yet {{immediate}} hip-hop, forward-thinking {{but always}} {{close to its}} roots", noting that [...] "the samples are smart and never played-out, and the production and rhymes reveal a determined sense of cooperation, as MF Doom spouts off his most brilliant lyrical change-ups and production-conscious playoffs". Q called Madlib [...] "the most innovative beatsman since Prince Paul", who created [...] "an oddball, cartoon-heavy backdrop for MF Doom's mellifluous wordplay". Rolling Stone gave Madvillainy praised Madlib's tracks, [...] "fuzzy and crackling with dust", and MF DOOM, whose flow is [...] "a particularly elegant slur, with syllables speading over a beat, not crisply adhering to it". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine called it [...] "a chameleonic masterpiece that alone validates the artistry of sampler culture". Robert Christgau, writing for The Village Voice, praised the album as [...] "a glorious phantasmagoria of flow".

500|$|Although the Model 1897 {{was popular}} with American troops in World War I, the Germans {{soon began to}} protest its use in combat. [...] "On 19 September 1918, the German {{government}} issued a diplomatic protest against the American use of shotguns, alleging that the shotgun was prohibited by the law of war." [...] A part of the German protest read that [...] "t is especially forbidden to employ arms, projections, or materials calculated to cause unnecessary suffering" [...] as defined in the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare. This is the only known occasion in which the legality of actual combat use of the shotgun has been raised. However, the United States interpreted {{their use of the}} shotgun differently than Germany. The Judge Advocate General of the Army, Secretary of State Robert Lansing <b>carefully</b> <b>considered</b> and reviewed the applicable law and promptly rejected the German protest. [...] France and Britain considered using shotguns as trench warfare weapons during World War I. [...] The shotgun in question was a double-barreled shotgun, which was not used because they were unable to obtain high powered ammunition and that type of gun is slow to reload in close combat.|$|E

500|$|Barbauld edited {{several major}} works {{towards the end}} of her life, all of which helped to shape the canon as known today. First, in 1804 she edited Samuel Richardson's {{correspondence}} and wrote an extensive biographical introduction of the man who was perhaps the most influential novelist of the eighteenth century. Her [...] "212-page essay on his life and works [...] the first substantial Richardson biography." [...] The following year she edited Selections from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, and Freeholder, with a Preliminary Essay, a volume of essays emphasising [...] "wit," [...] "manners" [...] and [...] "taste." [...] In 1811, she assembled The Female Speaker, an anthology of literature chosen specifically for young girls. Because, according to Barbauld's philosophy, what one reads when one is young is formative, she <b>carefully</b> <b>considered</b> the [...] "delicacy" [...] of her female readers and [...] "direct her choice to subjects more particularly appropriate to the duties, the employments, and the dispositions of the softer sex." [...] The anthology is subdivided into sections such as [...] "moral and didactic pieces" [...] and [...] "descriptive and pathetic pieces"; it includes poetry and prose by, among others, Alexander Pope, Hannah More, Maria Edgeworth, Samuel Johnson, James Thomson and Hester Chapone.|$|E
500|$|Garnet's recent {{interrogation}} {{was only}} the first of many. [...] Generally, his answers were <b>carefully</b> <b>considered</b> and demonstrated a passive resistance to his questioners; {{the use of the}} rack was a distinct possibility, one which he answered with [...] "Minare ista pueris [...] ". [...] What information he did give up was of limited interest only. His jailer, a man named Carey, was employed by Waad to gain the priest's trust, offering to relay letters to his nephew in the Gatehouse Prison. [...] Carey then placed Garnet into a cell containing a hole through which he was able to converse with Oldcorne, who was in a neighbouring cell. [...] From [...] "a place which was made for this precise purpose", two government eavesdroppers were therefore able to record details of conversations between the two priests. Their communications were mostly innocent, although Garnet's admission that on one occasion he drank too much wine was later used against him, along with other incriminating evidence recorded during their stay. His communications with his nephew, and Anne Vaux, were also intercepted. Most of these letters found their intended recipient, but not before they had first been read by Waad, who also kept Salisbury informed. Although Garnet told Vaux that the Council's evidence constituted nothing but [...] "presumptions", insufficient for a state trial, early in March he confessed, possibly as a result of torture. Vaux too was arrested and interrogated twice, just as further questions were being asked of Garnet by the council and the king, the latter interested in his opinion on theological matters.|$|E
