5|$|When a <b>continuous</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{of energy}} is {{passed through a}} gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing {{electrons}} to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view {{that does not include}} the <b>continuous</b> <b>spectrum</b> in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.) Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E

There is a <b>continuous</b> <b>spectrum</b> from physiologic sensation to pain in disease. Pain is an unpleasant sensation caused by intense or damaging events. In a toothache, nerves are stimulated by either exogenous sources (for instance, bacterial toxins, metabolic byproducts, chemicals, or trauma) or endogenous factors (such as inflammatory mediators).|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the <b>continuous</b> <b>spectrum</b> and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E

He also discovered that the emission spectrum nebulae are nearly always associated with stars having spectral classifications of B1 or hotter (including all O-type main sequence stars), while nebulae with <b>continuous</b> <b>spectra</b> appear with cooler stars.

25|$|Beginning in 1864, William Huggins {{examined}} the spectra of about 70 nebulae. He found that roughly {{a third of}} them had the emission spectrum of a gas. The rest showed a <b>continuous</b> <b>spectrum</b> and thus were thought to consist of a mass of stars. A third category was added in 1912 when Vesto Slipher showed that the spectrum of the nebula that surrounded the star Merope matched the spectra of the Pleiades open cluster.

25|$|This {{definition}} {{applies to}} a Banach space, {{but of course}} other types of space exist as well, for example, topological vector spaces include Banach spaces, but can be more general. On the other hand, Banach spaces include Hilbert spaces, and it is these spaces that find the greatest application and the richest theoretical results. With suitable restrictions, much {{can be said about}} the structure of the spectra of transformations in a Hilbert space. In particular, for self-adjoint operators, the spectrum lies on the real line and (in general) is a spectral combination of a point spectrum of discrete eigenvalues and a <b>continuous</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|E

40|$|Several {{methods to}} improve the degree of {{approximation}} for the stationary character in variational methods, are discussed. By selecting a set of trial functions as prescribed in the present paper, it is shown that we can construct quite generally a super-stationary expression for the quantity we wish to find. By " super-stationary " we mean that, the first, second and third variations of that expression vanish for any infinitesimal variations of trial functions. The examples to which this method is applied are: I). To find the eigenvalue in the eigenvalue-problems with discrete spectra only, (for example, to find the potential depth in the deuteron problem). II). To find the discrete eigenvalues for the problems with both discrete and <b>continuous</b> <b>spectra,</b> (for example, to find the energy level of the deuteron). III). To solve problems for <b>continuous</b> <b>spectra</b> by integral equations. IV). To solve pro· blems for <b>continuous</b> <b>spectra</b> by differential equations.

25|$|Some natural {{questions}} are: {{under what}} circumstances does this formalism work, and for what operators L are expansions in series of other operators like this possible? Can any function f be {{expressed in terms of}} the eigenfunctions (are they a Schauder basis) and {{under what circumstances}} does a point spectrum or a <b>continuous</b> <b>spectrum</b> arise? How do the formalisms for infinite-dimensional spaces and finite-dimensional spaces differ, or do they differ? Can these ideas be extended to a broader class of spaces? Answering such questions is the realm of spectral theory and requires considerable background in functional analysis and matrix algebra.|$|E
25|$|Newton used a prism {{to split}} white light into a {{spectrum}} of color, and Fraunhofer's high-quality prisms allowed scientists to see dark lines of an unknown origin. In the 1850s, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen described the phenomena behind these dark lines. Hot solid objects produce light with a <b>continuous</b> <b>spectrum,</b> hot gasses emit light at specific wavelengths, and hot solid objects surrounded by cooler gasses show a near-continuous spectrum with dark lines corresponding to the emission lines of the gasses. By comparing the absorption lines of the sun with emission spectra of known gasses, the chemical composition of stars can be determined.|$|E

25|$|There is a <b>continuous</b> <b>spectrum</b> of {{different}} clinical presentations from incontinence of flatus (gas), through incontinence of mucus or liquid stool, to solids. The term anal incontinence often {{is used to}} describe flatus incontinence, however it is also used as a synonym for FI generally. It may occur together with incontinence of liquids or solids, or it may present in isolation. Flatus incontinence {{may be the first}} sign of FI. Once continence to flatus is lost, it is rarely restored. Anal incontinence may be equally disabling as the other types. Fecal leakage, fecal soiling and fecal seepage are minor degrees of FI, and describe incontinence of liquid stool, mucus, or very small amounts of solid stool. They cover a spectrum of increasing symptom severity (staining, soilage, seepage and accidents). Rarely, minor FI in adults may be described as encopresis. Fecal leakage is a related topic to rectal discharge, but this term does not necessarily imply any degree of incontinence. Discharge generally refers to conditions where there is pus or increased mucus production, or anatomical lesions that prevent the anal canal from closing fully, whereas fecal leakage generally concerns disorders of IAS function and functional evacuation disorders which cause a solid fecal mass to be retained in the rectum. Solid stool incontinence may be called complete (or major) incontinence, and anything less as partial (or minor) incontinence (i.e. incontinence of flatus (gas), liquid stool and/or mucus).|$|E

This time the resulting paper was published under his name alone. He was awarded his Master of Science (MSc) degree in 1912, and was appointed a Beyer Fellow. The following year he was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship, which allowed him to study and research at a university in continental Europe. He elected {{to go to the}} Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin in 1913, to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger. Using Geiger's recently developed Geiger counter, which provided more accuracy than the earlier photographic techniques, he was able to demonstrate that beta radiation did not produce discrete lines, as has been previously thought, but rather a <b>continuous</b> <b>spectrum</b> with peaks in certain regions.
