40|$|The {{inadequate}} of compaction of backfills near abutments, approach {{areas of}} culverts, and smaller widened portions of roads result in settlement of layers and premature failure of pavement. Compaction in these constrained areas {{is difficult because}} of the difficulty in maneuvering of <b>compacting</b> <b>equipment</b> such as heavy rollers. Various types of light <b>compacting</b> <b>equipment</b> like rammers, vibratory plate compactors, single-drum walk-behind rollers, and double-drum walk-behind rollers are being used for compaction of the materials in constrained areas. Locally available loamy soil was compacted to different layer thicknesses of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mm using selected plate compactors, single-drum walk-behind rollers, and double-drum walk-behind rollers. Field moisture-density relationships for this equipment are established. The studies indicate that the roller optimum moisture content (ROMC) is higher than the optimum moisture content (OMC) of Proctor compaction even after 10 passes for all the light <b>compacting</b> <b>equipment</b> used. The regression equations developed for predicting field density as a function of compacting moisture content in the field, number of passes, and thickness of layer for all the light <b>compacting</b> <b>equipment</b> can be used during construction.

50|$|Infantry {{survival}} gear {{includes all}} of the items soldiers require for day-to-day survival in the combat environment. These include basic environmental protections, medical supplies, food, and sundries. As the amount of equipment a soldier can carry is very limited, efforts {{have been made to}} make equipment light and <b>compact.</b> <b>Equipment</b> is carried in tactical gear (such as ALICE), which should be comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, hamper movement as little as possible and be compatible with other things a soldier can be expected to carry, such as field radios and spare ammunition. Infantry have suffered high casualty rates from disease, exposure, and privation—often in excess of the casualties suffered from enemy attacks. Better equipment of troops to protect against these environmental factors greatly reduces these rates of loss. One of the most valuable pieces of gear is the entrenching tool—basically a folding spade—which can be employed not only to dig important defenses, but also in a variety of other daily tasks and even as a weapon.|$|E

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{requests}} assistance in preventing deaths and injuries among workers who load, operate, or work near refuse <b>compacting</b> or baling <b>equipment.</b> Recent NIOSH investigations suggest that worker injuries and deaths could be prevented by using safe work procedures, appropriate safety devices, and hazardous energy control {{programs designed to}} address the hazards of operating, maintaining, and servicing <b>compacting</b> and baling <b>equipment.</b> This Alert describes five cases of fatal injuries that resulted when workers entered, fell, or were caught and pulled into energized <b>compacting</b> or baling <b>equipment.</b> All managers, supervisors, and workers in companies that use <b>compacting</b> or baling <b>equipment</b> should follow the recommendations in this Alert. NIOSH requests that equipment manufacturers, safety and health officials, industry associations, unions, and editors of trade journals bring the recommendations in this Alert {{to the attention of}} all employers and workers who use <b>compacting</b> and baling <b>equipment.</b> <b>Compacting</b> and baling <b>equipment</b> reduces large amounts of solid waste to smaller, more manageable units by means of powered rams. These machines may be used by manufacturing companies to compact and bale large amounts of scrap and waste materials such as paper, cotton, and metals, and by retail and service industries to compress paper and cardboard boxes. Compactors compress the refuse material into containers for transport. Baling equipment is designed to compress material and produce a bale (bound or unbound) that can be handled and transported as a material unit. <b>Compacting</b> and baling <b>equipment</b> are available in many sizes and configurations. These machines may have one or more rams for compressing materials or extruding bales. The rams may move vertically or horizontally. Some types of equipment allow direct access to the compression chamber. Others have a hopper or chute through which material feeds into the machine. In businesses where refuse processing is incidental to the primary operation (such as in retail and service industries), loading and compressing may be done as separate work activities-that is, material may be intermittently loaded until the chamber is full and then compressed. Alternatively, in businesses where compressing scrap and waste materials is the primary operation or where large volumes of refuse materials are processed daily, loading and compressing is a continuous operation. Machines may operate in a manual, semiautomatic, or automatic mode. In the manual mode, a switch operated by a worker controls ram motion. In the semiautomatic mode, an operator initiates the compression, after which the machine automatically completes the cycle. In the automatic mode, a sensor inside the compression chamber signals when the chamber is full and activates the compression cycle. Because of the widespread use of compactors and balers across varied industries, it is difficult to obtain exact numbers of workers who are exposed to the hazards of this equipment. The workers most likely to be exposed to risk from <b>compacting</b> and baling <b>equipment</b> are those in the wholesale trade and transportation/public utilities industries engaged in recycling and the collection and disposal of refuse. Employees working in manufacturing settings and in retail and service trades may also be at risk because of the large volume of waste generated and processed daily.

40|$|A {{study was}} done on the Municipal Waste Incinerator (MWI) located at the Public Works Center (PWC) Yokosuka, Japan. The {{facility}} consists of two incinerators with combustion capabilities of 3. 54 ton (3. 22 metric tons) per hour, each equipped with a quencher and a venturi tube where Ca(OH) 2 and Tesisorb are injected to remove HCI and S 02 from the gas stream, and a fabric filter to remove particulate matter.

Supporting facilities include waste segregation facilities, cardboard, aluminum, and plastic <b>compacting</b> <b>equipment,</b> and a wood shredder. The facility currently meets both Japanese and U.

This study investigated the feasibility of burning additional plastic and wood in the incinerator, methods of improving operations or decreasing costs, and evaluates the overall waste management program at the Yokosuka Base. Additional wood and plastic may be burned in the incinerator, but it will make controlling the temperatures within the incinerator more difficult, thus this proposal is not popular with the operators.
