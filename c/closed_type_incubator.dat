40|$|The {{influence}} of an incubation system on embryo development and subsequent survival of larvae was evaluated on eggs from two #P. hypophthalmus$ females. All tests were performed at a same temperature of 28. 5 - 29 °C, {{given by the}} water of a re-circulating system to which all incubation devices were connected. The following situations were tested : 1) Happa (adhesive eggs); 2) floating screen net (adhesive eggs); 3) McDonald <b>type</b> <b>incubator</b> (stickiness of eggs being suppressed with a clay suspension); 4) plastic basket with water from the re-circulating system (stickiness of eggs being suppressed with a clay suspension); 5) plastic basket with water from the re-circulating system (adhesive eggs); 6) plastic basket with mineral water (adhesive eggs). No {{significant difference was found}} in hatching rates whatever the conditions of egg incubation. The development time and hatching kinetic were very similar in all systems; at 28. 5 - 29. 5 °C, the first hatched larvae were observed between 19 and 21 h post-fertilisation and the duration of the hatching period lasted 6 to 8 h. However, hatching tended to occur slightly earlier in the McDonald <b>type</b> <b>incubator,</b> probably as a consequence of mechanical agitation of eggs. Up to the age of 4 days, no significant difference was found in the survival of larvae {{as a function of the}} <b>type</b> of <b>incubator</b> from which they were issued. All together, the results indicate that, when properly managed, the incubation methods can hardly be responsible for the variability of hatching rates or survival of larvae often observed in different reproduction trials or from farm to farm.

These incubators offered businesses different types of service, regardless of their sector of activity: traditional, high tech, service industry…. Then, two new <b>types</b> of <b>incubator</b> developed: economic development incubators in the 1980 s and technological incubators in the 1990 s. The former focused on reducing disparity between the various regions, while the latter were more oriented toward technological innovation. Aernoudt (2004) also highlighted the very recent emergence of two new <b>types</b> of <b>incubator.</b> The first, the social incubator, aims to encourage the development of projects with a highly social dimension, such as those aiming to integrate certain population categories, and preserve the environment. The second type corresponds to fundamental research incubators.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effect of broiler breeder age and <b>incubator</b> <b>type</b> on hatching parameters, hatch window, embryo diagnosis results, and hatchling physical quality. The treatments consisted {{of a combination of}} three broiler breeder ages (29, 35 and 59 weeks of age) and two <b>incubator</b> <b>types</b> (single stage, SS; or and multiple stage, MS). A completely randomized design in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement was applied. In Experiment I, 1, 896 eggs were used and 360 eggs in Experiment II. There was an interaction between breeder age and <b>incubator</b> <b>type</b> only for hatchling physical quality score. Independently of <b>incubator</b> <b>type,</b> hatchability rate, late embryo mortality, and egg contamination were higher in the eggs laid by older breeders (59 -wk-old). Early mortality (0 - 4 days) was higher in the embryos from young breeders (29 -wk-old). A shorter hatch window birth was obtained in the SS incubator, resulting in higher hatchling body weight relative to egg weight, and better hatchling physical quality score. Both <b>types</b> of <b>incubators</b> provide good conditions for embryo development; however, the physical quality of chicks derived from eggs from intermediate-aged breeders (35 -wk-old) is better when eggs are incubated in SS incubators...|$|R

Cholesteatomas were classified as <b>closed</b> <b>type,</b> open type, or mixed type based on intraoperative findings. The CT findings including cholesteatoma size, location, and shape were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsEight patients had <b>closed</b> <b>type</b> cholesteatomas, four had mixed type, and two had open type. The mean size of all cholesteatomas was 5. 1 mm. None of the cholesteatoma types indicated a tendency towards a certain location.

30|$|Let us take France as an example. In our opinion, {{there are}} no typologies that are {{perfectly}} suited to this context. We can explain this {{by the fact that}} a few typologies have been elaborated {{solely on the basis of}} the French context. Some are the result of comparisons between several countries. This is the case, for example, in the typology set out by Albert et al. (2003), which developed from a comparison of four countries: the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and France. Even though this typology obviously comes close to the French context, it is still not totally adapted. Two of the four <b>types</b> of <b>incubators</b> (business incubators and private investment incubators, to be specific) are, in fact, relatively underdeveloped in France. They are more common in the United States, where they represent a significant number of the incubators operating in the country.

40|$|We {{define a}} type system, which {{may also be}} {{considered}} as a simple Hoare logic, for a fragment of an assembly language that deals with code pointers and jumps. The typing is aimed at local reasoning in the sense that only the type of a code pointer is needed, and {{there is no need to}} know the whole code itself. The main features of the type system are separation logic connectives for describing the heap, and polymorphic answer types of continuations for keeping track of jumps. Specifically, we address an interaction between separation and answer types: frame rules for local reasoning in the presence of jumps are recovered by instantiating the answer type. However, the instantiation of answer types is not sound for all types. To guarantee soundness, we restrict instantiation to <b>closed</b> <b>types,</b> where the notion of closedness arises from biorthogonality (in a sense inspired by Krivine and Pitts).
