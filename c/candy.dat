Fudge, creams, and fondant are examples of crystalline <b>candies.</b> Amorphous <b>candies</b> have a disorganized crystalline structure. They usually have higher sugar concentrations, and the texture may be chewy, hard, or brittle. Hard <b>candies,</b> such as lollipops, caramels, nut brittles and toffees are all examples of amorphous <b>candies,</b> even though some of them are as hard as rocks and resemble crystals in their overall appearance.|$|R
