40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} {{overview}} perspectives of eco-neighbourhoods in Southern Europe. Emphasis {{is given to}} spatial planning system related issues as well as organisational, investment, financial and governance specificities in countries that belong to Southern Europe, thus governed by 'urbanism tradition' (ESPON, 2005). In Northern European eco-neighbourhoods, one can conclude on certain typologies and a North European model (Souami, 2007). The paper aims at exploring a South European 'model', presenting some already existing methodological tools and experiences from realised projects. The key findings of the paper are both lessons learned from Northern European examples of eco-neighbourhoods and trends in France, Italy and Greece. In Greece, developments vary from public, for worker's housing purposes to private ones mainly for marketing purposes. The paper concludes that implementation of an eco-district mostly depends {{on the degree of}} strategic spatial planning tradition and culture, community engagement, <b>catalytic</b> <b>investments</b> and the possibility of public-private partnerships. eco-neighbourhood models, spatial planning, resilience, social equity, spatial equity, Greece, strategic planning, Southern Europe, France, Italy, Greece, eco-districts, culture, community engagement, <b>catalytic</b> <b>investments,</b> public-private partnerships, eco-neighbourhoods,...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} collects {{intelligence and}} documents of emerging best practice in facilitating urban change for Victorian activity centres. Urban change facilitation, in this research, {{refers to the}} proactive activities undertaken by a dedicated public sector individual or team in support of an 'agreed vision' for a specific activity centre. Importantly, the defined activities are {{over and above the}} regulatory roles and capital expenditure programs traditionally delivered by local government. The research finds that the facilitation approach taken depends heavily on the policy priority afforded to a particular activity centre, as well as the centre's inherent barriers to urban change. The case study results indicate that the 'legitimacy' afforded to dedicated urban change teams supports their effectiveness. Often this is further enhanced by their enhanced access to key organisational decision makers. Interestingly, formal urban planning skills are considered to be subservient to the ability to communicate, to be politically sensitive and to operate effectively in private and public sector environments. The research suggests that urban change facilitation activities underway in Victoria could be more effective if: Expectations and responsibilities of government and non-government stakeholders are further clarified; Government infrastructure funding commitments are better used to attract private sector redevelopment resources; and Leverage funding is incorporated into operating models, enhancing the ability of urban change facilitators to influence <b>catalytic</b> <b>investments...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Federal Government’s Better Cities Program (BCP) of {{the early}} 1990 s is {{credited}} with providing the financial stimulus that facilitated the nation’s long term economic growth. This $ 814 m package was invested in 26 strategic projects around the country. In each case, this Federal investment was matched by state funding and provided the catalyst to unlock the economic growth potential of Australian cities and regions. Numerous evaluation reports were carried out {{at the completion of}} the BCP in the mid 1990 s. However, the flow on effects of this investment continued long after the program’s completion and have largely gone unreported. The Property Council of Australia (Queensland) has commissioned this report to examine the long term economic impacts of the BCP, some 20 years after its end. Two of the original 26 projects have been used as case studies, to demonstrate the ongoing impacts this <b>catalytic</b> <b>investment</b> has had across the nation: Newcastle’s Honeysuckle redevelopment and Brisbane’s urban renewal area. Both were derelict industrial wastelands in the early 1990 ’s.

40|$|In {{response}} to globalization and economic competitiveness, Malaysia launched six economic development corridors, covering all the potential areas in Malaysia, and Johor Bahru {{is one of}} them. Iskandar Malaysia was launched in 2006 for future economic development in the country {{as well as to}} cater the needs of Johor Bahru to modernize its urban and economic infrastructure. Situated in a strategic location and space, Iskandar Malaysia is targeted to be the player of <b>catalytic</b> <b>investment</b> role that will bring direct and indirect investment to Johor. The whole landscape of Johor Bahru is now transforming dramatically, thus worrying the locals and the environmentalists. Environmental issues as well as the concern for social inequality issues have been raised by the locals. Hence, the aim {{of this study is to}} address the issues created by the rapid development of Iskandar Malaysia, particularly in Johor Bahru and Nusajaya. The objectives of this paper are to assess the consequences of the coastal land reclamation for Danga Bay waterfront city development and to identify the impact of new-build gentrification towards the local people. The research identifies key social and economic issues and the impacts of these issues have also been identified. To achieve the objective of the study a detailed review on secondary data has been done. The study found that more cooperation and attention from the local authorities, stakeholders and public is needed to ensure urban regeneration and to achieve the objective of social inclusiveness as promised by the vision of Iskandar Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{decades have}} {{witnessed}} the proliferation of large-scale initiatives for improving health systems. Strategies such as the Bamako Initiative, the Sector-Wide Approach, Child Survival+ and many others were instituted with compelling rationales for improving the provision of essential health services. Yet, large-scale investments in untested health system initiatives have often been associated with disappointing results, or with little formal evidence that investments in organizational strategies have actually improved health. Interestingly, no prior study has tested {{the proposition that the}} six WHO health system building block subsystems (integrated health service delivery, health workforce, information for decision making, essential drug supplies and logistics, health financing and resources allocation and leadership and governance) can be strengthened with an integrated package of systems interventions in ways that can accelerate the pace of improvements in child health and survival. If such incremental effects can be demonstrated, prospects for expanding international and national commitment to health systems strengthening will be greatly enhanced and specific lessons from implementation research and operational experience of this nature will be invaluable to health planners. Health services delivery in Ghana is decentralized and in discharging its constitutional mandate to expand access to healthcare, the Government of Ghana has implemented policies that mandate a system of services, referral operations and supervisory roles for health care services that is provided in hospitals, sub-district health centres and community-based facilities. Health service innovations are provided at the community level through a policy known as the Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) Initiative that aims to mobilize community leadership, decision-making systems and resources in poor rural areas; relocate facility-based nurses to community service points called “CHPS zones” and orient these workers to the active provision of community-based outreach and doorstep healthcare. CHPS also supports nurses with logistics and community volunteer systems to provide services according to the principles of primary healthcare including integrated management of childhood illnesses, comprehensive immunization services and basic safe motherhood care. Despite efforts to implement this community-based health system, a number of challenges have emerged that limit access to service delivery using the six WHO health systems building block subsystems. Critically identified are the following challenges: 1. 	Governance: Leadership and governance systems are poorly understood and inadequately marshalled for health development at the local and community level. 2. 	Financing: Budgets and financial plans are largely determined by past budgets or external vertical programmes rather than resource allocation that is based on the configuration of need. 3. 	Information: Health information capability to support decentralized healthcare system has instead been a time consuming data extraction process for the health insurance and central health bureaucracy rather than a system for community-based healthcare workers that contributes to their work, decision-making, or supervisory support needs. 4. 	Logistics: Even though there is deemed to be a decentralized management of health services, there is still a centralized medical stores system, resulting in episodes of catastrophic breakdown in supply chains, with stock-outs that are exacerbated when district health service operations increase. 5. 	Human resources: Shortages in the district health management, midwifery, and nursing workforce arise, either because of their inappropriate posting location or inadequate numbers as well as poor leadership that seriously undermines efforts to strengthen the health systems. This work reviews the Ghana Essential Health Interventions Project (GEHIP), implemented in the Upper East Region of Ghana to contribute to the health systems strengthening policy by testing the health and survival impact of strengthening the primary health care system. GEHIP tested the hypothesis that integrated system initiatives cutting across the WHO “pillars” of health system strengthening can improve system performance to the point of having an impact on population and health outcomes and ensure that essential health interventions reach under-served populations and progress towards Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 can be achieved. The project essentially focused on strengthening district-level capacity to plan and set priorities using locally obtained burden of disease and cost-effectiveness data in order to increase the effectiveness of Ghana’s Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) programme, with the goal of accelerating the expansion of CHPS coverage and improving the quality of CHPS provided care. A mixed methodology was used to gauge the impact of the health system functioning according to a framework of interventions spanning the six WHO health systems building block subsystems. Aggregate impact of GEHIP on child survival was tested with the Heckman “difference of differences” procedure using results from a baseline survey that was conducted in 2010 and an endline survey conducted in 2015 in four treatment and seven comparison districts. Qualitative Systems Appraisal (QSA) in the form of in-depth interviews and focus group investigations of community stakeholders, frontline workers, supervisors, and district health managers was employed to gauge reactions to the GEHIP system, clarify inputs by the health subsystem, reactions to these inputs and recommendations for systems change. Regression methods were used to refine the Heckman procedure, adjusting for potential confounders and estimating net effects of household exposure to GEHIP improved care on the survival of children. GEHIP is a quasi-experimental study of a project designed to accelerate the scale up {{of one of the most}} effective health development experiments ever conducted in Africa –The “Navrongo Experiment”. It supplements the provision of effective primary healthcare strategies with leadership training, field demonstration, improved budgeting and resource mobilization. By means of these interventions, GEHIP sought to enhance health equity, mitigate social and monetary health care costs, foster parental health seeking behaviour and improve maternal and child survival. Training was designed to expand access to life saving technology that reduces neonatal, infant, and childhood mortality. Additional components for improving referral, neonatal survival, and maternal health rekindled Ghana’s legacy of generating evidence-based means of achieving affordable and accessible primary health care throughout Ghana. Findings from this work have shown that the combined effects of leadership training, <b>catalytic</b> <b>investment,</b> political engagement, and evidence-based budgeting are capable of solving CHPS start-up problem and accelerate scale up. At baseline, neonatal and maternal mortality rates were unacceptably high, but the rapid training of frontline workers proved to be inexpensive, operationally feasible, and potentially effective in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. Moreover, an innovative pilot referral system utilizing locally appropriate tri-car ambulances has been implemented and information systems have been reformed through the adoption of a simplified register system with impressive results. Accelerating CHPS scale-up is crucial to health development in Ghana where the expansion of CHPS has languished because district health systems strengthening requirements were unanticipated by national policies. Research results showed that the interventions had their intended impact on the pace of CHPS scale-up. This success translated into an impact on child mortality resulting in GEHIP providing a critically needed focus for national efforts to develop primary health care, and lessons for global health...|$|E
40|$|Commonalities and complementarities among {{approaches}} to conservation {{monitoring and evaluation}} (M&E) are not well articulated, creating the potential for confusion, misuse, and missed opportunities to inform conservation policy and practice. We examine the relationships among five {{approaches to}} conservation M&E, characterizing each approach in eight domains: the focal question driving each approach, when in the project cycle each approach is employed, scale of data collection, the methods of data collection and analysis, the implementers of data collection and analysis, the users of M&E outputs, and the decisions informed by these outputs. Ambient monitoring measures status and change in ambient social and ecological conditions, independent of any conservation intervention. Management assessment measures management inputs, activities, and outputs, {{as the basis for}} investments to build management capacity for conservation projects. Performance measurement assesses project or program progress toward desired levels of specific activities, outputs, and outcomes. Impact evaluation is the systematic process of measuring the intended and unintended causal effects of conservation interventions, with emphasis upon long-term impacts on ecological and social conditions. Systematic review examines existing research findings to assess the state of the evidence regarding the impacts of conservation interventions, and to synthesize the insights emerging from this evidence base. Though these five approaches have some commonalities, they complement each other to provide unique insights for conservation planning, capacity-building, adaptive management, learning, and accountability. Ambient monitoring, management assessment, and performance measurement are now commonplace in conservation, but opportunities remain to inform conservation policy and practice more fully through <b>catalytic</b> <b>investments</b> in impact evaluations and systematic reviews...|$|R
30|$|The {{availability}} of platinum {{is crucial for}} several products of our modern society. Areas of application are e.g. jewellery, automotive <b>catalytic</b> converters, <b>investments</b> (coins, bars), computers, mobile devices, fertilizers and cytostatic drugs. Economic risks are caused by limited sources and dynamic demand of new application areas like fuel cells and drugs. Platinum-containing drugs are used {{for the treatment of}} several kinds of cancer such as testicular, breast, colon and prostate. Currently the pharmaceutical industry requires 6, 9 tons per year (3 percent of the total demand of platinum). Due to the improvement of medical standards and the ageing society, especially in developing countries, the demand of platinum-containing drugs will rise significantly. The dissipation of toxic soluble salts and the lack of advanced waste-water treatment and recycling systems is a problem of the usage of platinum-containing drugs. Compared with cytostatic drugs (14.6 kg/a for Germany) the dissipation of platinum particles of mobile catalytic converters is much higher (5 - 20 tons/a only in North America, Europe and Japan; 184, 2 kg/a in Germany). On the other hand the emission of platinum nano-particles of automotive catalytic converters seems less critical. Furthermore advanced recycling technologies are already available for them.|$|R
