50|$|This {{is hardly}} a simple topic. In his 1976 text Immunology, Aging and <b>Cancer</b> <b>immunologist</b> and Nobel Prize winner Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet speculated that the immune system might one day be found to be as complex as the nervous system. As the {{production}} of lymphocytes {{is so close to}} the central role of the immune response it is wise to approach the study of it with some humility {{in the face of the}} task, although there are general principles that help in understanding.|$|E
40|$|Many {{standard}} and targeted therapies, {{as well as}} radiotherapy, {{have been shown to}} induce an anti-tumour immune response, and immunotherapies rely on modulating the host immune system to induce an anti-tumour immune response. However, the immune response to such therapies is often reliant on the immunogenicity of a tumour. Tumour immunogenicity varies greatly between cancers of the same type in different individuals and between different types of cancer. So, {{what do we know about}} tumour immunogenicity and how might we therapeutically improve tumour immunogenicity? We asked four leading <b>cancer</b> <b>immunologists</b> around the world for their opinions on this important issue...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Breast {{cancer is}} an {{immunogenic}} tumor. Over the last decade, investigations {{have shown that}} patients with breast cancer have pre-existent immune responses, both humoral and cellular, against a variety of proteins expressed in their tumors. Researchers using genomic and proteomic techniques have defined dozens of proteins that may serve as immunologic targets in breast cancer patients. In addition, other investigators focusing on a more directed approach of evaluating well-defined breast cancer proteins that are immunogenic have begun to translate some of the candidate antigens into human clinical trials of immunebased therapies in breast cancer. Immunogenic proteins associated with breast cancer are abundant. The major experimental question now facing breast <b>cancer</b> <b>immunologists</b> is how to prioritize these many candidate antigens for further evaluation for clinical use. Abbreviations: ADCC, antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; ECD, extracellular domain of HER- 2 /neu; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanagen; MHC, major histocompatibility complex...|$|R
40|$|A goal of <b>cancer</b> <b>immunologists</b> is {{to harness}} {{cellular}} immune responses to achieve anti-cancer responses. One {{of the strongest}} activating stimuli for the immune system is the encounter with cells expressing allogeneic HLA molecules. While alloreactive responses can negatively impact {{of the outcome of}} hematopoietic stem cell transplant because of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), these same responses can have anti-leukemic effects. Donor lymphocyte infusions have been used in an attempt to harness alloreactive responses to achieve anti-leukemic responses. Because this protocol is usually carried out in the absence of recipient anti-donor responses, this protocol often induces GVHD as well as anti-leukemic responses. A recent study indicated the infusion of large number of haploidentical donor cells (1 – 2 × 108 CD 3 + cells/kg) into patients with refractory hematological malignancies (100 cGy total body irradiation) resulted in 14 (7 major) responses/ 26 patients. A rapidly developing cytokine storm was observed, while no persisting donor cells could be detected at two weeks after infusion eliminating the possibility of GVHD. Characterization of the effector mechanisms responsible for the anti-leukemic responses in this protocol, should guide new approaches for achieving enhanced anti-leukemic responses using this protocol...|$|R
40|$|The fibroblastic {{element of}} the tumor {{microenvironment}} has been {{of great interest to}} cancer biologists but less so to <b>cancer</b> <b>immunologists.</b> Yet, the sharing of a common mesenchymal cell type in the stroma of tumors and at sites of chronic inflammatory lesions, some of which have an autoimmune basis, has been a strong hint that this cellular component of the tumor microenvironment may have an immunologic function. Recent studies have confirmed this possibility. These fibroblast-like cells, which are termed carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), can be identified by their expression of the membrane protein, fibroblast activation protein-a (FAP). The conditional depletion of the FAPþ CAF permits immune control not only of an artificial, transplanted tumor, but also of an autochthonous model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) that replicates the molecular, histologic, clinical, and immunologic characteristics of the human disease. Immune suppression by the FAPþ CAF is mediated by CXCL 12, the chemokine that binds to cancer cells and excludes T cells by a mechanism that depends on signaling by the CXCL 12 receptor CXCR 4. Inhibition of CXCR 4 leads to the elimination of cancer cells by enabling the rapid, intratumoral accumulation of preexisting, PDA-specific CD 8 þ T cells, and reveals the antitumor efficacy of the T-cell checkpoint antagonist anti–PD-L 1. Recent studies have also shown that the FAPþ CAF is related to FAP-expressing stromal cells of norma...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cancer {{immunotherapy}} {{is one of}} {{the emerging}} therapies for cancer treatment where immune cells are guided to fight against <b>cancer.</b> Clinical <b>immunologists</b> are proposing different ideas to stimulate the immune cells and dendritic cell therapy is one among them. Like, other treatment modalities, the challenge in dendritic cell therapy is when and how much dendritic cells should be administered. In this work we use a mathematical model which elucidates the activation of the helper T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells by the intervention of dendritic cells. The objective is to minimize the tumor cells for a given input of dendritic cells. Then multi-objective optimization is applied on the model to design the treatment planning in order to achieve the objective...|$|R
50|$|Avery August {{was born}} in Belize City, Belize. August {{attended}} government primary schools, and subsequently attended St. Michael's College for Boys (as High Schools in Belize are called), where he earned a High School Diploma. Following one year at the Belize Technical College, he emigrated {{with his family to}} Los Angeles, California. There he attended California State University, Los Angeles, where he earned a B.S. degree in Medical Technology. While at California State University, he got involved in undergraduate research in the laboratory of Dr. Phoebe Dea, then Professor of Chemistry & Biochemistry at California State University (see Scientific Career below for details). This first exposure to research pushed him to attend graduate school at Cornell University's Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences in New York City. There he worked at the Sloan Kettering Institute (an Institute within the Memorial Sloan Kettering <b>Cancer</b> Center) with <b>Immunologist</b> Dr. Bo Dupont, and where he earned PhD degree in Immunology. He then gained post-doctoral experience at The Rockefeller University, working with renowned virologist and National Academy of Science member, Dr. Hidesaburo Hanafusa.|$|R
