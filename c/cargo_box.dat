2500|$|Japanese {{manufacturers}} initially {{found they}} could export [...] "cab-chassis" [...] configurations (which included the entire light truck, less the <b>cargo</b> <b>box</b> or truck bed) {{with only a}} 4% tariff. A truck bed would subsequently {{be attached to the}} chassis in the United States and the vehicle could be sold as a light truck. Examples included the Chevrolet LUV and Ford Courier. The [...] "cab-chassis" [...] loophole was closed in 1980. From 1978–1987 the Subaru BRAT carried two rear-facing seats (with seatbelts and carpeting) in its rear bed to meet classification as a [...] "passenger vehicle" [...] and not a light truck.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, AMC was {{planning}} a compact coupé utility (pickup) {{based on the}} Hornet {{to compete with the}} increasing sales of Japanese compact pickup models. A prototype called the Cowboy was developed under the leadership of Jim Alexander. The prototype vehicle featured a modified AMC Gremlin front design and a <b>cargo</b> <b>box</b> with a Jeep logo on the tailgate. The standard I6 engine would be more powerful than the 4-cylinders found in the imported pickups. The only surviving prototype was built using a 1971 Hornet SC360 with the 360 V8 and 4-speed manual transmission. It was used by AMC on their proving grounds for several years before being sold to an employee, who later installed a 1973 Hornet updated front end. However, with the increasing sales of the Hornet models, and the 1970 acquisition of Jeep and no 4WD option ready for the Cowboy (at the time ALL Jeeps were 4WD), AMC's product planners shelved the Cowboy truck program. A 4WD system was developed and later used on the 1980 AMC Eagle, and the [...] "uniframe" [...] construction ("frame" [...] rails under the truck bed made of folded sheet metal and incorporated into the cab structure as one piece) resurfaced for the 1985 Jeep Comanche pickup, based on the unit body XJ Cherokee.|$|E

50|$|On {{the night}} of 6 October 1944, the five unit members parachuted from a {{captured}} B17 Flying Fortress flown by Luftwaffe KG 200 over the Jericho region in Wadi Qelt. Their equipment included submachine guns, dynamite, radio equipment, a dupliating machine, a German-Arabic dictionary, 5,000 Pound sterling in different currencies and explosives. It was the discovery of these dispersed <b>cargo</b> <b>boxes</b> on 9 October that alerted the British to the fact an operation was underway.|$|R
30|$|Removing {{the central}} {{handrail}} and adding more grab rails at head height increases space without compromising passenger comfort. An {{addition to the}} design would be to add portable shelving to {{the part of the}} carriage between the doors and pivoting bogie. The shelving would be mounted on wheels with brakes to allow easy entry and removal from the carriage. This shelving would be used for smaller, individual packages that would not be transported using the <b>cargo</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The correct English name {{should be}} [...] "wooden galloper with a {{free-standing}} cargo box" [...] since said device walks in a gallop form. It {{was equipped with}} two handles to make it walk by manpower. The swing <b>cargo</b> <b>box</b> is used to store useless work caused by the up-and-down motion of the walking machine. When the <b>cargo</b> <b>box</b> swung forward, the walking machine steps forward {{at the same time}} to raise efficiency.

These trucks featured conventional cabs and front sheet metal and the <b>cargo</b> <b>boxes</b> used on the 2WD models. Their 4WD mechanical components—axles, transfer cases and transmissions—were sourced from outside manufacturers. Chrysler Corporation owned the New Process Gear Company (competitors generally used Spicer (Dana) transfer cases and Borg-Warner or in-house transmissions).http://www.townwagon.com/ ...|$|R
30|$|There {{were three}} {{potential}} design scenarios researched in this study. The first being a design which utilised the current metro design by using bespoke <b>cargo</b> <b>boxes</b> {{in the open}} region of the carriage. This space provided enough room for freight equipments without the need to redesign the internal layout of the carriage. Design 1.2 shows how plywood sheet {{could be used as}} a temporary arrangement, providing a platform for freight storage. Through evaluation, it was clear that this method would not provide the same freight capacity as other designs; however, this method {{could be used as a}} pilot scheme in the short term by Nexus, to identify whether such a scheme is viable for further investment.|$|R
50|$|As {{the market}} evolved, however, Dodge {{realized}} that a bigger and stronger van line would be needed in the future. Thus the B Series, introduced for 1971, offered both car-like comfort in its Sportsman passenger line or expansive room for gear and materials in its Tradesman cargo line. A chassis-cab version was also offered, for use with bigger <b>cargo</b> <b>boxes</b> or flatbeds.Like the trucks, though, Chrysler's dire financial straits of the late 1970s precluded any major updates for the vans for many years. Rebadged as the Ram Van and Ram Wagon for 1981, this venerable design carried on for 33 years {{with little more than}} cosmetic and safety updates all the way to 2003.|$|R

5000|$|The Blackwood was {{delivered}} late, with first sales in October 2001, {{due to a}} supply problem with the <b>cargo</b> <b>box,</b> produced by Magna Steyr. Ford reportedly froze their contracts with Magna International for part of 2001 over the issue.|$|E
50|$|The car was aesthetically {{similar to}} a Diesel Rastrojero double cab, but the part where the <b>cargo</b> <b>box</b> should go had a trunk {{designed}} with a small slope, leaving aside the straight line of the box of the original model.|$|E
30|$|Design 1.1 {{involves}} bespoke <b>cargo</b> <b>boxes,</b> specifically dimensioned to {{fit within}} {{the constraints of}} the current metro. The boxes would have detachable shelving that can be rearranged as needed, to suit different freight sizes. Using shelving allows different goods to be stored in one box while being easily differentiated, acting similar to a bento box [10]. The height of the box is just under that of the average human height, to allow the user to see ahead when manoeuvring the box. The boxes will be mounted with swivel wheels possessing brakes to allow them to be moved onto the metro by hand. This application eliminates the need for forklifts as these {{would not be able to}} load the cargo onto the metro effectively.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve upon {{automated}} sensor performance for security applications {{in public and private}} settings, numerous alternative sensor designs have been developed to provide affordable and effective detection and identification performance. Radio frequency (RF) sensors offer a balanced approach to system design {{for a wide variety of}} geometries and threat targets. These threat targets include persons carrying weapons and explosives, portable containers with contraband including <b>cargo</b> <b>boxes,</b> suitcases, and briefcases and fixed structures including building or underground facilities harboring criminals, terrorist or enemy combatants. In order to achieve the resolution required for the detection and identification of threat targets, separation of interference from the target response is essential. High bandwidth offers a conventional approach to high resolution sensing of the threat. An alternative approach, one based upon wide angular bandwidth (spatial diversity) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{reasonably}} match suspension stiffness and realize the optimization of vehicle ride comfort, a time-domain virtual prototyping {{model of the}} 8 × 4 heavy vehicle is established based on dynamic software ADAMS, and its vertical vibration responses are simulated and analyzed on road level B. After that, an optimal design method for heavy vehicle’s suspension system is put forward. In this proposed method, the first, the second axle suspension stiffness and the balance suspension stiffness are taken as the optimal variables and the maximum values of Z-direction power spectral density (PSD) of the cab and <b>cargo</b> <b>boxes</b> mass center are chosen as the optimal target. By using SQP (Sequential Quadratic Programming) algorithms to conduct optimizing calculation, thus the optimal suspension stiffness parameters are obtained, which promotes and improves the heavy vehicle’s ride comfort...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the three-dimensional container packing problem (3 DCPP) under home delivery service, which predetermines an ordering of delivering ordered <b>cargo</b> <b>boxes</b> to customers, and aims to load {{a subset of}} those boxes according to the delivery ordering into a 3 D car container with maximal utilization ratio of the container space while prohibiting the process of delivering cargos to each customer from unloading and subsequent reloading of <b>boxes.</b> In practice, <b>cargos</b> can be taken out from not only the rear door of the delivery container but also the side door. Nonetheless, the previous research only considered the case with only a single door. Therefore, this paper establishes {{the model for the}} two-door 3 DCPP under home delivery service. Furthermore, the rule of invisible and untouchable items and the subvolume-based approach for the one-door problem are extended to resolve the two-door problem. Last, simulation analysis verifies performance of our approach...|$|R
5000|$|The Kubo is a cargo scooter design {{dubbed the}} [...] "pick-up truck of the {{developing}} world." [...] Initial designs were for a fully electric scooter run on lithium iron phosphate batteries, designed to carry <b>cargo</b> <b>boxes</b> measuring up to 22 in. by 22 in. by 22 in. and weighing up to 300 pounds. With {{a top speed of}} 35 mph, it would have a range of at least 50 miles per charge. In an interview from May 28, 2013, Kim detailed the Kubo as using lithium polymer batteries with a 40-45 mile range, with the ability to use the cargo space to hold additional batteries to extend the range to 200 miles. He claimed that by summer of 2013, a small production run of 5-10 units would occur, followed by 100-1000 units in another 6 months time, before ramping up to 50,000 - 200,000 units for full production. He also claimed a selling price of $500-$800USD in China, and $2000-4000 in the United States.|$|R
