5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actresses were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some <b>cases)</b> <b>was</b> listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of laws were invoked {{in the process of}} the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or {{demolishing}} houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. Most had only limited success, as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court. The last of these <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> resolved in 1387.|$|E
30|$|On SVAB, 35 (29.17 %) of 120 lesions were ADH or DCIS in 11 G group, and 3 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> excluded. In {{remaining}} 32 (26.7 %) <b>cases,</b> 10 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> ADH and 22 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> DCIS. In 8 G group, 26 (28.89 %) of 90 lesions were ADH or DCIS, and 4 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> excluded. In remaining 22 (24.4 %) <b>cases,</b> 8 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> ADH and 14 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> DCIS.|$|R
30|$|Cases with {{previous}} chemotherapy were 10 and chemotherapy naïve <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> 14. The regimen {{of the previous}} chemotherapy <b>was</b> that 7 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> administered platinum anti-cancer agent and the third generation anti-cancer agent, a <b>case</b> <b>were</b> administered gemcitabine (GEM) and vinorelbin (VNR), 2 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> given tegafur-uracil (UFT) as the first-line treatment, a <b>case</b> <b>was</b> administered pemetrexed (PEM) and a <b>case</b> <b>was</b> administered docetaxel (DTX) as the second-line treatment.|$|R
40|$|The {{thyroid gland}} in most animal species has two lobes, {{one on each}} lateral surface of the trachea. In pigs, the main lobe of the thyroid gland is on the midline in the ventral {{cervical}} region with dorsolateral projections from each side. The thyroid structural changes in gouts were investigated. About 386 pairs of thyroid glands collected from gout at the local municipal abattoir in Tabriz city of East Azerbaijan province. A total of 386 thyroid specimens examined, 8 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> follicular atrophy, 4 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> thyroid fibrosis, 71 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> diffuse hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells, 5 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> colloid goiter, 10 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> parenchymal cysts, 3 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> nodular hyperplasia, 1 <b>case</b> <b>was</b> C-cell adenoma and 1 <b>case</b> <b>was</b> C-cell carcinoma...|$|R
5|$|Another related {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fate of the children of captured pregnant guerrillas, who were given up for adoption by the military junta. An estimated 500 children were involved. The investigation became controversial during the Kirchner administration, as those involved had become adults and some of them refused to participate in DNA testing. One of those <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> the Noble siblings case, involving the adopted sons of Ernestina Herrera de Noble, owner of the Clarín newspaper. The Kirchners advanced a bill in Congress to make the genetic testing of suspected victims mandatory. Although the measure had popular support, critics considered it a breach of the right to privacy, and politically motivated because of a dispute between Kirchner and the Clarín newspaper. The Noble siblings tests in 2011 were negative, and the case was closed in January 2016, after Kirchner left the presidency. Hilario Bacca, a confirmed son of disappeared guerrillas, appealed a judicial ruling that sought to change his name, asking to keep the name he had been using.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, Vachss worked as an attorney, in New York City, specializing in child abuse cases; {{he also had a}} career as a novelist. The duality of Vachss' work as a lawyer prosecuting and {{defending}} real cases and as a crime fiction author writing about fictional criminals resulted in Vachss being compared to the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Vachss' eighth novel, Footsteps of the Hawk, in the Burke series featuring a vigilante private investigator of child abuse <b>cases,</b> <b>was</b> released just two months before the publication of Batman: The Ultimate Evil. He had wanted to approach the topic of sex tourism in southeast Asia, but had been unable to find a way for the Burke character to go there; the Batman character offered the chance for him to write about the topic.|$|E
5|$|Between the December {{meeting and}} second {{gathering}} in March 2011, {{prior to the}} ARG's launch, there was no direct verbal communication between Valve or the developers. Instead, the independent developers spent time, using a shared wiki provided by Valve, to plan out and coordinate the game. They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others {{had to go back}} to older programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort. The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm the plans for the launch of the ARG.|$|E
30|$|Of the 430 {{patients}} with PM, 298 (69.3 %) were cured, 113 (26.3 %) improved, 16 (3.7 %) self-discharged from hospital and 3 (0.7 %) died. On the other hand, 175 (40.7 %) cases had complications, among which 133 <b>cases</b> (76.0 %) <b>were</b> subdural effusion, 21 <b>cases</b> (12.0 %) <b>were</b> epilepsy, 7 <b>cases</b> (4.0 %) <b>were</b> hydrocephalus, 5 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> injury of facial nerve, 3 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> ependymitis, 3 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> alimentary tract hemorrhage, 2 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> encephalopyosis and 1 <b>case</b> <b>was</b> pleural effusion.|$|R

5|$|In April 1839, the {{accusation}} of poisoning the young prince in 1837, {{along with two}} other fabricated <b>cases,</b> <b>was</b> revived against Bhimsen and his party, and forged papers and evidence were produced professing to incriminate him. Bhimsen appealed for justice and tried to defend himself, but the King, blindly believing the forgeries, denounced him as a traitor {{and put him in}} house arrest in a room at the ground floor of his own Bagh Durbar. Although pardon had already been given, based on these forged evidence, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay were again arrested and tortured. Except for Mathabar Singh, who managed to escape to India, rest of the Thapa family were again arrested, their properties confiscated, were declared outcasts, and were proclaimed to be expelled from every public offices for seven generations.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to recommendations from the governor, the General Assembly enacted cost-saving {{reforms in the}} judicial system, including the abolition of criminal, chancery, and common pleas courts, dividing the state instead into 18 circuit court districts. The number of jurors required for certain <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting jury duty. Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by local law enforcement. Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state property tax was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actors were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some <b>cases)</b> <b>was</b> listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots. The following year, this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actor is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year.|$|E
30|$|Among the 430 {{cases of}} PM, 420 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> tested for CSF smear (including bacteria, Cryptococcus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis). There <b>were</b> 3 {{positive}} <b>cases</b> (0.7 %), where 2 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> Gram-positive cocci and one <b>case</b> <b>was</b> Gram-negative bacilli. 420 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> also tested for CSF bacterial culture.

5|$|Music and {{politics}} have been intertwined for centuries in Italy. Just as many {{works of art}} in the Italian Renaissance were commissioned by royalty and the Roman Catholic Church, much music was likewise composed on the basis of such commissions—incidental court music, music for coronations, for the birth of a royal heir, royal marches, and other occasions. Composers who strayed ran certain risks. Among the best known of such <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> the Neapolitan composer Domenico Cimarosa, who composed the Republican hymn for the short-lived Neapolitan Republic of 1799. When the republic fell, he was tried for treason along with other revolutionaries. Cimarosa was not executed by the restored monarchy, but he was exiled.|$|E
5|$|Over 160 {{structures}} {{have been}} mapped at Iximche. The structures {{were faced with}} stone blocks that were coated in lime plaster, which in some <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> then painted with Mixtec-Puebla style murals, although few traces of the murals survive today. The Mixtec-Puebla style originated around AD 900 in central Mexico and spread from there throughout Mesoamerica. The superstructures of buildings at Iximche were built from adobe blocks and once supported beam and mortar roofs but none have survived. The platform cores were generally built of rough stones set in a clay matrix. A few of the structures have been restored and the site core is kept clear of overgrowth. Residential structures built on platforms around the ceremonial plazas usually had built-in benches and hearths.|$|E
5|$|Persons {{suspected}} of having sexual relations with non-Aryans were charged with Rassenschande (racial defilement) and tried in the regular courts. Evidence provided to the Gestapo for such <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> largely provided by ordinary citizens such as neighbours, co-workers, or other informants. Persons accused of race defilement were publicly humiliated by being paraded through the streets with a placard around their necks detailing their crime. Those convicted were typically sentenced to prison terms, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps. As the law did not permit capital punishment for racial defilement, special courts were convened to allow {{the death penalty for}} some cases. From the end of 1935 through 1940, 1,911 people were convicted of Rassenschande. Over time, the law was extended to include non-sexual forms of physical contact such as greeting someone with a kiss or an embrace.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in Covington, Stevenson was elected county attorney for Kenton County. He was chosen as a delegate to the 1844 Democratic National Convention and was elected to represent Kenton County in the Kentucky House of Representatives the following year. He was reelected in 1846 and 1848. In 1849, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention that produced Kentucky's third state constitution. In 1850, he, Madison C. Johnson, and James Harlan were appointed as commissioners to revise Kentucky's civic and criminal code. Their work, Code of Practise in Civil and Criminal <b>Cases</b> <b>was</b> published in 1854. He was again one of Kentucky's delegates to the Democratic National Conventions in 1848, 1852, and 1856, serving as a presidential elector in 1852 and 1856.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Syndromes {{in which}} causes are not clearly {{identified}} {{are difficult to}} match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> made somewhat arbitrarily. The idiopathic (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes {{are included in the}} unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within the category idiopathic. Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.|$|E

5|$|The {{main focus}} of the Exchequer was the {{collection}} of royal revenue {{as part of the}} greater Exchequer, which was officially undertaken by the Lord High Treasurer. The Exchequer was unique in having jurisdiction in matters of both equity and the common law, the latter initially curtailed after the Magna Carta and reserved for the Court of King's Bench and Court of Common Pleas, although it later grew back. This process of common law and equity was reversed; during the 16th century the Exchequer was solely a common law body, with the equity jurisdiction only again becoming relevant {{near the end of the}} Tudor period. W. H. Bryson argues that this happened during the reign of Edward I. By 1590 the Exchequer's jurisdiction over equity <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> confirmed, and it was handling a significant number a year, including disputes over trusts, mortgages, tithes and copyholds; since taxation was ever-present, it was not difficult to show that the dispute prevented the payment of a debt to the monarch, allowing the Writ of Quominus.|$|E
5|$|Until {{after the}} Thirty Years' War, the territories of Brandenburg-Prussia were {{politically}} independent from each other, connected {{only by the}} common feudal superior. Frederick William, who envisioned {{the transformation of the}} personal union into a real union, started to centralize the Brandenburg-Prussian government with an attempt to establish the Geheimer Rat as a central authority for all territories in 1651, but this project proved to be unfeasible. Instead, the elector continued to appoint a governor (Kurfürstlicher Rat) for each territory, who in most <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> a member of the Geheimer Rat. The most powerful institution in the territories remained the governments of the estates (Landständische Regierung, named Oberratsstube in Prussia and Geheime Landesregierung in Mark and Cleves), which were the highest government agencies regarding jurisdiction, finances and administration. The elector attempted to balance the estates' governments by creating Amtskammer chambers to administer and coordinate the elector's domains, tax income and privileges. Such chambers were introduced in Brandenburg in 1652, in Cleves and Mark in 1653, in Pomerania in 1654, in Prussia in 1661 and in Magdeburg in 1680. Also in 1680, the Kreditwerk came {{under the aegis of the}} elector.|$|E
