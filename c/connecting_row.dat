40|$|AbstractWe propose an {{algorithm}} for {{the class}} of <b>connected</b> <b>row</b> convex constraints. In this algorithm, we introduce a novel variable elimination method to solve the constraints. This method is simple and able {{to make use of}} the sparsity of the problem instances. One of its key operations is the composition of two constraints. We have identified several nice properties of <b>connected</b> <b>row</b> convex constraints. Those properties enable the development of a fast composition algorithm whose complexity is linear to the size of the variable domains. Compared with the existing work including randomized algorithms, the new algorithm has favorable worst case time and working space complexity.

This characterization is exact for binary constraints.

The general method of matrix addressing consists of sequentially addressing one side of the matrix, for example by selecting the rows one-by-one and applying the picture information on the other side at the columns row-by-row.

We show that <b>connected</b> <b>row</b> convex (CRC) constraints, arc-consistent consecutive tree convex (ACCTC) constraints, etc fit this characterization, and are therefore amenable to extremely simple polynomial-time randomized algorithms—the complexities of which are shown to be much less than that of the corresponding (known) deterministic algorithms and the (generic) lower bounds for establishing path-consistency. On a related note, we also provide a simple polynomial-time deterministic algorithm for finding tree embeddings of variable domains (if they exist) for establishing tree convexity in pathconsistent networks...|$|R

In this paper, we examine the problem of reconstructing a discrete bidimensional set S satisfying some convexity conditions from its two orthogonal projections (H, V). We develop an algorithm that starts out from (H, V) and reconstructs set S, when S is a convex polyomino, in polynomial time. At the same time, we show that determining {{the existence of a}} row-convex (column-convex) polyomino or set with <b>connected</b> <b>rows</b> (columns) having assigned orthogonal projections (H, V) is an NP-complete problem. Moreover, by using the algorithm to reconstruct convex polyominoes from their two orthogonal projections we prove that the numerical matching with target sums problem can be solved in polynomial time if its sequences are unimodal...|$|R

This paper also presents a new path-consistency algorithm for CRC constraints running in time O(n 3 d 2) and space O(n 2 d), where n {{is the number of}} variables and d is the size of the largest domain, improving the traditional time and space complexity by orders of magnitude. The paper also shows how to construct CRC constraints by conjunction and disjunction of a set of basic CRC constraints, highlighting how CRC constraints generalize monotone constraints and presenting interesting subclasses of CRC constraints. Experimental results show that the algorithm behaves well in practice. ...|$|R
