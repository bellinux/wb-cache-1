25|$|Chargebacks: A <b>chargeback</b> is {{an event}} in which money in a {{merchant}} account is held due to a dispute relating to the transaction. Chargebacks are typically initiated by the cardholder. In {{the event of a}} <b>chargeback,</b> the issuer returns the transaction to the acquirer for resolution. The acquirer then forwards the <b>chargeback</b> to the merchant, who must either accept the <b>chargeback</b> or contest it.|$|E
25|$|Internet fraud may be by {{claiming}} a <b>chargeback</b> {{which is not}} justified ("friendly fraud"), or {{carried out by the}} use of credit card information which can be stolen in many ways, the simplest being copying information from retailers, either online or offline. Despite efforts to improve security for remote purchases using credit cards, security breaches are usually the result of poor practice by merchants. For example, a website that safely uses SSL to encrypt card data from a client may then email the data, unencrypted, from the webserver to the merchant; or the merchant may store unencrypted details in a way that allows them to be accessed over the Internet or by a rogue employee; unencrypted card details are always a security risk. Even encrypted data may be cracked.|$|E
2500|$|The PayPal Buyer Protection Policy {{states that}} the {{customer}} may file a buyer complaint {{if he or she}} did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described. The customer can open a dispute within 180 days (for registered UK residents 180 days, changed 14 June 2014) from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within 20 days from opening the dispute. [...] If the buyer used a credit card, he or she might get a refund via <b>chargeback</b> from his or her credit-card company. However, in the UK, where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections (that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation) under Section 75 Consumer Credit Act 1979, the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via PayPal.|$|E

5000|$|Cryptocurrency {{transactions}} are normally irreversible {{after a number}} of blocks confirm the transaction. One of the features cryptocurrency lacks in comparison to credit cards is consumer protection against fraud, such as <b>chargebacks.</b> This is, however, a non-issue because third-party multisignature-based escrow can be used to mediate a transaction, this is effectively equivalent to enabling <b>chargebacks.</b> This is also much easier than performing an irreversible transaction using a system with native <b>chargebacks,</b> so this aspect is actually an advantage.|$|R

50|$|<b>Chargeback</b> fraud, {{also known}} as {{friendly}} fraud, occurs when a consumer makes an online shopping purchase with their own credit card, and then requests a <b>chargeback</b> from the issuing bank after receiving the purchased goods or services. Once approved, the <b>chargeback</b> cancels the financial transaction, and the consumer receives a refund of the money they spent. When a <b>chargeback</b> occurs, the merchant is accountable, regardless of whatever measures they took to verify the transaction.|$|E
25|$|Finally, merchants {{assume the}} risk of <b>chargebacks</b> by consumers.|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} <b>chargebacks</b> {{are related to}} {{technical}} problems between the merchant and the issuing bank, for example when a customer was charged twice for a single transaction. Other <b>chargebacks</b> {{are related to the}} authorization process of a credit card transaction, for example, if a transaction is declined by its issuing bank but the account is still charged.|$|R
5000|$|Another common {{channel for}} <b>chargebacks</b> is mail order/telephone order (MOTO) payment {{processing}} through a call center. In this case, {{as with the}} two others listed here, the main problem {{is that this is}} a card not present transaction. To help eliminate call center purchase <b>chargebacks,</b> call centers are working to make the purchases more like [...] "card present" [...] purchases.|$|R
50|$|In all cases, a <b>chargeback</b> {{will cost}} the {{merchant}} the <b>chargeback</b> fee, typically $15-$30, plus {{the cost of the}} transaction and the amount processed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chargeback</b> to {{merchant}} - A merchant account {{could receive}} a <b>chargeback</b> because {{of making an}} improper credit or debit card charge to a customer or a customer making an unauthorized credit or debit card charge to someone else's account in order to [...] "pay" [...] for goods services from the merchant. It is possible for the <b>chargeback</b> and associated fee to cause an overdraft or leave insufficient funds to cover a subsequent withdrawal or debit from the merchant's account that received the <b>chargeback.</b>|$|E
50|$|If a {{merchant}} encounters a <b>chargeback</b> {{they may be}} assessed a fee by their acquiring bank. A potential <b>chargeback</b> is presented {{on behalf of the}} card holder's bank to the merchant's credit card processing bank.|$|E
50|$|To {{address these}} more effectively, {{technology}} companies have written code and built algorithms that help merchants determine if <b>chargebacks</b> are legitimate or fraudulent.|$|R

50|$|The phrase <b>chargeback</b> {{insurance}} is also sometimes {{used to describe}} the guarantee provided by online fraud prevention companies such as Forter, Riskified and Signifyd. Unlike with card present transactions, where the merchant is not liable for the cost of fraudulent transactions (unless they do not meet technological security requirements such as EMV), merchants are liable for card not present transactions which turn out to be fraudulent. For this reason, online fraud prevention companies who offer decisions (meaning, they provide an approve or decline decision for orders) rather than scores (where the merchant must themselves decide whether to approve or decline) sometimes offer {{to cover the cost of}} the <b>chargeback,</b> since the <b>chargeback</b> would not have occurred had their decision not been incorrect. This form of <b>chargeback</b> insurance, more properly called a <b>chargeback</b> guarantee, will typically cover all losses of the relevant type, not only through one gateway or processor.|$|E
50|$|With {{the rise}} of technology, and the {{resulting}} increase in online and telephone transactions and commerce, it has become easier to commit fraud via chargebacks. Chargebacks are an interesting concept because the process protects consumers from identity theft fraud, but {{opens the door for}} consumers to commit <b>chargeback</b> fraud. <b>Chargeback</b> fraud is also known as “friendly fraud.” Friendly fraud is the term for when a consumer authorizes a transaction for an online purchase on his or her credit card, receives the product or products the consumer paid for, but then later the same consumer files for a <b>chargeback.</b> The fraudulent filing for a <b>chargeback</b> results in a consumer keeping and avoiding paying for the products they ordered.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Fake {{antivirus}} (AV) {{programs have}} been utilized to defraud millions of computer users into paying {{as much as one}} hundred dollars for a phony software license. As a result, fake AV software has evolved {{into one of the most}} lucrative criminal operations on the Internet. In this paper, we examine the operations of three large-scale fake AV businesses, lasting from three months to more than two years. More precisely, we present the results of our analysis on a trove of data obtained from several backend servers that the cybercriminals used to drive their scam operations. Our investigations reveal that these three fake AV businesses had earned a combined revenue of more than $ 130 million dollars. A particular focus of our analysis is on the financial and economic aspects of the scam, which involves legitimate credit card networks as well as more dubious payment processors. In particular, we present an economic model that demonstrates that fake AV companies are actively monitoring the refunds (<b>chargebacks)</b> that customers demand from their credit card providers. When the number of <b>chargebacks</b> increases in a short interval, the fake AV companies react to customer complaints by granting more refunds. This lowers the rate of <b>chargebacks</b> and ensures that a fake AV company can stay in business for a longer period of time. However, this behavior also leads to unusual patterns in <b>chargebacks,</b> which can potentially be leveraged by vigilant payment processors and credit card companies to identify and ban fraudulent firms...|$|R
50|$|Overall, <b>chargebacks</b> {{intends to}} balance the {{inequality}} of power between consumers and businesses. It {{is regarded as a}} very efficient tool for consumers because the speed, accessibility and lack of charge for their clients, who would just have to notify their banks or card issuers to cancel a transaction. Thus, Edwards and Wilson suggested that it would be advisable to focus on developing <b>chargebacks</b> and other soft ODR methods because they are very effective amongst mainstream consumers. By contrast, the existing processes are considered largely inefficient and not transparent among businesses because puts businesses in bad light since the onus of the proof rests on them.|$|R

50|$|In addition, Visa and MasterCard may levy severe fines against {{acquiring}} {{banks that}} retain merchants with high <b>chargeback</b> frequency. Acquirers typically pass such fines {{directly to the}} merchant. Merchants whose ratios stray too far out of compliance may trigger card association fines of $100 or more per <b>chargeback.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The idea of <b>chargeback</b> in a {{traditional}} (non-virtualised) sense is not new, and references go {{as far back as}} the 1980s. Publications available on the Internet generally support the notion that <b>chargeback</b> involved literally charging departments based on actual resource consumption rather than forecast usage. <b>Chargeback</b> is most relevant to IT departments, simply because almost all areas of an organisation use computing resources. Rather than IT having to justify expenditures for another area of the organisation, the burden is on those departments who are actually planning on using the resource provided by IT.|$|E
5000|$|A {{consumer}} may {{initiate a}} <b>chargeback</b> by contacting their issuing bank and filing a substantiated complaint regarding {{one or more}} debit items on their statement. The threat of forced reversal of funds provides merchants with an incentive to provide quality products, helpful customer service, and timely refunds as appropriate. Chargebacks also provide a means for reversal of unauthorized transfers due to identity theft. Chargebacks can also occur {{as a result of}} friendly fraud, where the transaction was authorized by the consumer but the consumer later attempts to fraudulently reverse the charges. Card association <b>chargeback</b> rules are available online for public inspection and review. They comprise a system for adjudicating transaction disputes between cardholders and merchants, primarily where the issues can be resolved based on documentary evidence incident to the transaction. The rules provide for arbitration of issues by the card association. This may occur where the card issuer generates a second (or [...] "arbitration") <b>chargeback</b> against the merchant, after receiving the merchant's response to the initial <b>chargeback.</b> Normally this would require the cardholder to rebut elements of the merchant's response. The second <b>chargeback</b> results in a second crediting of the cardholder's account for the disputed funds, after having been credited back to the merchant with its response to the initial <b>chargeback.</b> The merchant's only recourse after the second <b>chargeback</b> is to initiate arbitration of the dispute by the card association. The fee for this is on the order of $250, and the arbitration loser is then obligated to pay the costs of the arbitration.|$|E

Compared to other account services offered by Nochex, with a merchant account a vendor can accept larger payments, and accept payments from registered international credit cards. Merchant account holders are required to maintain a minimum balance in their account to cover for the risk of any <b>chargebacks.</b> This amount can build up from initial trading {{and is based on}} account activity. After the account is closed, the retaining balance will be returned in full, providing that no <b>chargebacks</b> occur after the account is closed.

The definitive requirements will include serialization. Companies that focus purely on achieving compliance will miss the opportunity to use regulation as a business driver. The ability to track and serialize unit level saleable packages (e.g. bottle of 25 pills) not just cases or pallets can create business value in knowing exactly where their products are purchased can do the following: 1) Minimize cost of <b>chargebacks</b> through 100% accurate adjudication. <b>Chargebacks</b> account for 2-15% of gross revenue for a pharmaceutical manufacturer. 2) Minimize risk by increasing accuracy in Medicare/Medicaid pricing calculations by fully knowing all fees, rebates, and <b>chargebacks</b> that should be applied to a specific unit sale. Over $4B in fines have been handed down for improperly calculating Medicare/Medicaid pricing. 3) Limit liability of having to recall entire lots of product because a (non-serialized) shipment was stolen - see example: http://www.fdanews.com/newsletter/article?issueId=11679&articleId=1076874) Achieve visibility for manufacturers in the labyrinth that is the wholesale distribution network to more accurately forecast demand and measure sales & marketing programs.|$|R
