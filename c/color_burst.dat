50|$|The {{presence}} of chrominance {{in a video}} signal is indicated by a <b>color</b> <b>burst</b> signal transmitted on the back porch, just after horizontal synchronization and before each line of video starts. If the <b>color</b> <b>burst</b> signal were visible on a television screen, it would appear as a vertical strip of a very dark olive color. In NTSC and PAL, hue is represented by a phase shift of the chrominance signal relative to the <b>color</b> <b>burst,</b> while saturation {{is determined by the}} amplitude of the subcarrier. In SECAM (R′ − Y′) and (B′ − Y′) signals are transmitted alternately and phase does not matter.|$|E

Rather than hanging on the walls, Hamilton's earlier {{paintings}} were found resting safely stacked against them.Most of the paintings on display in Hamilton's lower level gallery were her later works: bright and energetic splashes of color with swirls, drips, and slashes of paint on canvases measuring six feet long and four or five feet high. A few of the canvases were round. Hamilton stated {{that she wanted to}} challenge herself and [...] "get out of the square thing."

The composite output's <b>color</b> <b>burst</b> signal circuit is an exception: because it still outputs the same number of cycles now at twice the clock rate, the <b>color</b> <b>burst</b> signal produced is too short for most monitors, yielding no or unstable color. Hence, IBM documentation lists the 80-column text mode as a [...] "feature" [...] only for RGBI and black-and-white composite monitors.

50|$|At Cal Arts, student Grace {{participated in}} the Paik/Abe {{apprenticeship}} along with six other students. Nam June Paik and Abe-san challenged the students {{to build their own}} Video Synthesizer. Grace then also became a close collaborator with Paik and Abe, traveling around the country, soldering and building machines with them. The three became a production team for the purpose of making the youth happy. By the end of the 70’s long after her collaboration with Paik-Abe, Grace created a video piece using the synthesizer she had built with Paik-Abe called “Metaphors”. It went on to win an NEA award and appreciated for its meditative aspect. She built the soundtrack by playing a Buddhist Meditation Bowl and filtering it through the synthesizer’s velocities and the sound would integrate video <b>color</b> <b>bursts</b> on a screen. She later donated her Paik/Abe Synthesizer in the Nam June Paik Art Center in Seoul, South Korea, now on permanent display and in working condition.|$|R

Fireworks {{were set}} {{off from the}} Henley Street Bridge (to a lesser extent Baptist Hospital and the Gay Street Bridge) and spectators could view the show from the riverfront, hillsides, or on boats from the Tennessee River. In 2006, Boomsday was expanded to a three-day event lasting through Labor Day weekend, causing Knoxville to lose money, and the city reverted to the one-day event in 2007. The fireworks display was choreographed to music with one such selection being Madonna's Lucky Star {{in which all the}} bursts were star shaped. The Tennessee Volunteer's fight song with the bursts being the team's <b>colors</b> <b>bursting</b> in front of Neyland Stadium was always a perennial crowd pleaser.

5000|$|SCH (Subcarrier to Horizontal) phase {{refers to}} the phase {{relationship}} between {{the leading edge of}} horizontal sync (at the 50% amplitude point) and the zero crossings of the <b>color</b> <b>burst</b> (by extrapolating the <b>color</b> <b>burst</b> to the leading edge of sync). The error is referred to as SCH phase and is expressed in degrees of subcarrier phase. For PAL, the definition of SCH phase is slightly different due to the more complicated relationship between the sync and subcarrier frequencies — the SCH phase relationship for a given line repeats only once every eight fields. Therefore, PAL SCH phase is defined, per EBU Technical Statement D 23-1984 (E), as “the phase of the +U component of the <b>color</b> <b>burst</b> extrapolated to the half-amplitude point of {{the leading edge of the}} synchronizing pulse of line 1 of field 1.” ...|$|E

50|$|The {{reference}} signal {{used for the}} vectorscope's display is the <b>color</b> <b>burst</b> that is transmitted before each line of video, which for NTSC is defined to have a phase of 180°, corresponding to the nine-o'clock position on the graticule. The actual <b>color</b> <b>burst</b> signal shows up on the vectorscope as a straight line pointing to the left {{from the center of}} the graticule. In the case of PAL, the <b>color</b> <b>burst</b> phase alternates between 135° and 225°, resulting in two vectors pointing in the half-past-ten and half-past-seven positions on the graticule, respectively. In digital (and component analog) vectorscopes, colorburst doesn't exist; hence the phase relationship between the colorburst signal and the chroma subcarrier is simply not an issue. A vectorscope for SECAM uses a demodulator similar to the one found in a SECAM receiver to retrieve the U and V colour signals since they are transmitted one at a time (Thomson 8300 Vecamscope).|$|E

The present paper is concerned with complementary near-infrared observations for a large sample of LSB dI and dE galaxies, and, in addition, with a few additional BCDG observations. In a discussion of dwarf elliptical galaxies, attention is given to an infrared color-color diagram, optical-infrared <b>colors</b> and <b>burst</b> ages, and the UVK color plane.

50|$|In {{broadcast}} systems, {{an analog}} generator-lock signal usually consists of {{vertical and horizontal}} synchronizing pulses together with chrominance phase reference {{in the form of}} colorburst.

40|$|GRB 090709 A {{is a long}} gamma-ray burst (GRB) {{discovered}} by Swift, featuring a bright X-ray afterglow {{as well as a}} faint infrared transient with very red and peculiar <b>colors.</b> The <b>burst</b> attracted a large interest because of a possible quasi-periodicity at P= 8. 1 s in the prompt emission, suggesting that it could have a different origin with respect to standard, long GRBs. In order {{to understand the nature of}} this burst, we obtained a target of opportunity observation with XMM-Newton. X-ray spectroscopy, based on XMM-Newton and Swift data, allowed us to model the significant excess in photoelectric absorption with respect to the Galactic value as due to a large column density (about 6. 5 E+ 22 cm^- 2) in the GRB host, located at z= 4. 2. Such a picture is also consistent with the infrared transient's properties. Re-analysis of the prompt emission, based on INTEGRAL and on Swift data, excludes any significant modulation at P= 8. 1 s. Thus, we conclude that GRB 090709 A is a distant, standard, long GRB. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables; MNRAS, in press. (V 3 : minor changes to match the final version. ...|$|R

40|$|We present 29 likely {{members of}} the young ρ Oph or Upper Sco regions of recent star {{formation}} that exhibit "accretion burst" type light curves in K 2 time series photometry. The bursters were identified by visual examination of their ~ 80 -day light curves, though all satisfy the M < - 0. 25 flux asymmetry criterion for burst behavior defined by Cody et al. The burst sources represent ≈ 9 % of cluster members with strong infrared excess indicative of circumstellar material. Higher amplitude burster behavior is correlated with larger inner disk infrared excesses, as inferred from WISE W 1 – W 2 <b>color.</b> The <b>burst</b> sources are also outliers in their large Hα emission equivalent widths. No distinction between bursters and non-bursters is seen in stellar properties such as multiplicity or spectral type. The frequency of bursters is similar between the younger, more compact ρ Oph region, and the older, more dispersed Upper Sco region. The bursts exhibit a range of shapes, amplitudes (~ 10 %– 700 %), durations (~ 1 – 10 days), repeat timescales (~ 3 – 80 days), and duty cycles (~ 10 %– 100 %). Our results provide important input to models of magnetospheric accretion, in particular, by elucidating the properties of accretion-related variability in the low state between major longer duration events such as EX Lup and FU Ori type accretion outbursts. We demonstrate the broad continuum of accretion burst behavior in young stars—extending the phenomenon to lower amplitudes and shorter timescales than traditionally considered {{in the theory of}} pre-main sequence accretion history...|$|R
