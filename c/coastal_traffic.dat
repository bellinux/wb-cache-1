25|$|The navy's radio {{stations}} at Tjøme and Flekkerøy were {{taken over by}} the Telegraphy Administration in 1910, free of charge. The conditions were that the navy would have full control of all coast {{radio stations}} during war, that the navy's telegrams have the highest priority after distress and that they be consulted for further development of the network. Værøy Radio opened the same year. The Telegraphy Administration launched a national plan in 1910 for building a network of coast radio stations, which would cover the coastline and included plans for a transatlantic service and a radio on Spitsbergen. The politician's main motivation were not tied to Norway having the world's third-largest merchant marine, but rather tied to the use by fisheries and <b>coastal</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Confederacy had the {{resources}} {{for a short}} war, {{but was unable to}} finance or supply a longer war. It reversed the traditional low-tariff policy of the South by imposing a new 15% tax on all imports from the Union. The Union blockade stopped most commerce from entering the South, and smugglers avoided the tax, so the Confederate tariff produced too little revenue to finance the war. Inflated currency was the solution, but that created distrust of the Richmond government. Because of low investment in railroads, the Southern transportation system depended primarily on river and <b>coastal</b> <b>traffic</b> by boat; both were shut down by the Union Navy. The small railroad system virtually collapsed, so that by 1864 internal travel was so difficult that the Confederate economy was crippled.|$|E

The light was intended to help <b>coastal</b> <b>traffic</b> trading limestone and coal to mid and north Wales but the light also helped long-distance and North American traffic identify the Bristol Channel and avoid confusion with the English Channel. The lighthouse is a squat, round, brick-lined limestone tower of 17m (56ft), with walls 0.9m (3ft) thick at the base and [...] thick at the top. The light stands 64m (210ft) above high-water mark. The lighthouse was automated in 1929. The lighthouse keeper's [...] cottages that flank the lighthouse are two-storey, with hipped roofs, octagonal chimneys, and a one-storey linking corridor.

2500|$|The [...] "Sons of Liberty" [...] {{destroyed}} British {{authority in}} New York City, and the Stamp Act Congress {{of representatives from}} throughout the Thirteen Colonies met in the city in 1765 to organize resistance to British policies. The city's strategic location and status as a major seaport made it the prime target for British seizure in 1776. General George Washington lost a series of battles from which he narrowly escaped (with the notable exception of the Battle of Harlem Heights, his first victory of the war), and the British Army controlled New York City and made it their base on the continent until late 1783, attracting Loyalist refugees. The city served as the national capital under the Articles of Confederation from 1785-1789, and briefly served as the new nation's capital in 1789–90 under the United States Constitution that replaced it. Under the new government the city hosted the inauguration of George Washington as the first President of the United States, the drafting of the United States Bill of Rights, and the first Supreme Court of the United States. The opening of the Erie Canal gave excellent steamboat connections with upstate New York and the Great Lakes, along with <b>coastal</b> <b>traffic</b> to lower New England, making the city the preeminent port on the Atlantic Ocean. The arrival of rail connections {{to the north and}} west in the 1840s and 1850s strengthened its central role.|$|E

Designed for offshore patrol and the control of <b>coastal</b> maritime <b>traffic,</b> the patrol gunboat was equipped with a combination diesel and gas turbine (CODOG) engine system.

The Second Coxswain Henry 'Downtide' West went aboard and showed the captain where {{he was on his}} charts and following the repair of the engines she set of on her way.

For {{the next eight}} months, the gunboat screened <b>coastal</b> merchant <b>traffic</b> on the New York-to-Guantanamo Bay, Cuba circuit. Early in May 1944, she added Key West, Florida, to her itinerary, but soon thereafter resumed her New York-Guantanamo Bay shuttles exclusively. In May 1945, she ceased voyages to Cuba when she was reassigned from the Atlantic Fleet to the Eastern Sea Frontier. For {{the remainder of the}} war, Alacrity served along the east coast—first at Staten Island, then at New York, and — by mid-July — at Charleston, South Carolina. By 1 August 1945, although still based at Charleston, she had been reassigned to the 6th Naval District.|$|R
50|$|Under the Act, British {{citizens}} {{resident in}} the UK and British companies {{registered in the}} UK must be treated on the same basis as Indian citizens and Indian registered companies unless UK law denies reciprocal treatment.

There are very detailed provisions requiring the Viceroy to intervene if, in his unappealable view, any India law or regulation is intended to, or will in fact, discriminate against UK resident British subjects, British registered companies and, particularly, British shipping interests.|$|R
