40|$|Wall failure has {{significantly}} altered {{the structure of}} virtually all large, fresh-appearing lunar craters. Terrace blocks exposed upon a crater's interior walls are interpreted to be sections of the transient cavity rim that slumped into the cavity during the terminal stages of crater formation. Impact excavation cavities have been reconstructed by restoring the innermost terrace block exposed within a crater to its inferred original position at the cavity rim and accounting for the volume of material that slumped into the cavity. Critical model assumptions include (1) the radial variation of topography near the initial cavity rim crest, (2) {{the structure of the}} failure surface along which terrace blocks slumped into the cavity, and (3) the geometric shape of the initial cavity. This terrace restoration model has been applied to 12 fresh lunar craters with observed rim crest diameters Do ranging from 19 to 137 km.
