40|$|AbstractWe {{review and}} discuss the {{application}} of Hadamard expansions to the hyperasymptotic evaluation of Laplace integrals∫Cexp(t) f(t) dt(x→∞),where, for simplicity, in this paper x is restricted {{to be a positive}} real variable. The integration path C can be taken over both finite and semi-infinite intervals in the complex plane. In general, these expansions take the form of <b>compound</b> <b>expansions,</b> each associated with a different exponential level, and involve absolutely convergent series containing the incomplete gamma function as a smoothing factor. The early terms in each convergent expansion possess a rapid asymptotic-like decay (when the variable x is large) with late terms that can be transformed into a rapid decay comparable with that of the early terms. The Hadamard expansion of the above integral when the phase function p(t) is linear is shown to depend significantly on the singularity structure of the amplitude function f(t). The application of the theory to Laplace-type integrals with quadratic, cubic and nonpolynomial phase functions is considered; in addition to the amplitude function, the location of the saddle points satisfying p′(t) = 0 also plays a role in the detailed structure of the different exponential levels in the resulting Hadamard expansion. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the accuracy that can be achieved with this new procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} of Indonesian cananga oil {{was carried out}} by a new process, instantaneous controlled pressure drop (DIC). Dry cananga flowers (Cananga odorata Hook. fil. et Thomson, forma macrophylla) were exposed for a short time to saturated steam and then the pressure was abruptly decreased to a vacuum level (about 5 kPa). This abrupt pressure drop provokes auto-vaporization of the superheated volatile <b>compounds,</b> <b>expansion</b> and breaking of the cell walls and instantaneous cooling. In this study, the effects of two parameters of DIC process namely pressure-drop rate and flowers moisture content on the yield of essential oil and its grouped compounds such as oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes and other light and heavy oxygenated compounds were studied. The oil composition was analyzed by GC coupled with MS. The availability of the volatile compounds in the residual flowers was analyzed using organic solvent extraction. The quantity of compounds obtained by DIC treatment increased with pressure-drop rate. At a rate of 1. 43 MPa/s the total amount of compounds in the direct and residual oils was greater than in the reference oil obtained by chloroform extraction (2 h) from untreated flowers. The hydration of dry cananga flowers had no effect on the essential oil yield...|$|R
