[...] As presently defined (this soil) occupies old terraces, fans, and valley plains of granitic origin, mainly {{on the east side of}} the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys. [...] Topography - sloping to undulating with 'hog wallow' microrelief. [...] Reddish brown topsoil over heavier (finer textured) subsoil containing an iron-cemented hardpan. [...] Redder in the surface and denser hardpan than associated Madera soil. [...] Used mostly for pasture and for dry-farmed grain.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{to derive}} the {{spatial distribution of}} <b>clay</b> <b>pans</b> from satellite microwave data is presented. Soil moisture has a different temporal signature in <b>clay</b> <b>pans</b> compared with other soils, which is directly reflected in the satellite-observed brightness temperatures. Three years of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) 6. 9 GHz microwave observations were compiled and analysed over continental Australia to identify <b>clay</b> <b>pans.</b> This {{led to the development}} of a brightness temperature variance index (BTVI), which shows a strong spatial correspondence to an existing soil texture map and the ability to map <b>clay</b> <b>pans</b> for semi-arid regions. This simple method emphasizes the potential use of passive microwave remote sensing for soil type mapping. © 2013 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

50|$|The <b>clay</b> <b>pan</b> {{was formed}} after rainfall, when the Tsauchab river flooded, {{creating}} temporary shallow pools where {{the abundance of}} water allowed camel thorn trees to grow. When the climate changed, drought hit the area, and sand dunes encroached on the pan, which blocked the river from the area.|$|E
5000|$|Sossusvlei (sometimes written Sossus Vlei) is a {{salt and}} <b>clay</b> <b>pan</b> {{surrounded}} by high red dunes, {{located in the}} southern part of the Namib Desert, in the Namib-Naukluft National Park of Namibia. The name [...] "Sossusvlei" [...] is often used in an extended meaning to refer to the surrounding area (including other neighbouring vleis such as Deadvlei and other high dunes), which is one of the major visitor attractions of Namibia.|$|E
50|$|Lake Lefroy is a <b>clay</b> <b>pan</b> {{covered with}} a crust of salt that {{supports}} little vegetation. It fills episodically in response to heavy rainfall. Following inundation, a drying phase is relatively rapid due to high evaporation rates and surface water may only last for a few months. When the lake contains water there may be relatively large fluctuations in water level over very short periods. The shallow surface water in the lake is blown {{back and forth across}} the lake bed by prevailing winds.|$|E
50|$|Habitats are {{varied and}} include: {{riparian}} Coolabah forest, tussock grassland, stony saltbush plains, mulga and savannah woodlands, chenopod shrubland and sandy ridges, and cracking <b>clay</b> <b>pans.</b>|$|R

50|$|Deadvlei {{is another}} <b>clay</b> <b>pan,</b> about 2 km from Sossusvlei. A notable feature of Deadvlei {{is that it}} used to be an oasis with several acacia trees; afterwards, the river that watered the oasis changed its course. The pan is thus punctuated by blackened, dead acacia trees, in vivid {{contrast}} to the shiny white of the salty floor of the pan and the intense orange of the dunes. This creates a particularly fascinating and surrealistic landscape, that appears in innumerable pictures and {{has been used as a}} setting for films and videos.|$|E
5000|$|A vlei [...] (...) is {{a shallow}} minor lake, mostly of a {{seasonal}} or intermittent nature. It even might refer to seasonal ponds or marshy patches where frogs and similar marsh dwellers breed. Commonly, vleis {{vary in their}} extent, {{or even in the}} presence or absence of water, according to the fall of rain or dryness of the season. In terms of water salinity, vleis may be freshwater, saltwater, or brackish. Over time a vlei may degrade into a salt pan or <b>clay</b> <b>pan,</b> such as Dead Vlei or Sossusvlei.|$|E
5000|$|King James VI of Scotland {{described}} Fife as a [...] "beggar's mantle fringed wi gowd", {{the golden}} fringe being {{the coast and}} its chain of little ports with their thriving fishing fleets and rich trading links with the Low Countries.

5000|$|Deadvlei {{is a white}} <b>clay</b> <b>pan</b> {{located near}} the more famous salt pan of Sossusvlei, inside the Namib-Naukluft Park in Namibia. Also written DeadVlei or Dead Vlei, its name means [...] "dead marsh" [...] (from English dead, and Afrikaans vlei, a lake or marsh in a valley between the dunes). The pan also is {{referred}} to as [...] "Dooie Vlei" [...] which is the (presumably original) fully Afrikaans name. In Google there are many references to the site, its name often being translated erroneously in terms such as [...] "dead valley"; a vlei is not a valley (which in Afrikaans is [...] "vallei"). Nor is the site a valley; the pan is a desiccated vlei.|$|E

50|$|Moqueca capixaba is {{native to}} the state of Espírito Santo and {{influenced}} by Native Brazilian mixed with Portuguese cuisine. It is considered a softer and tenderer version of moqueca. The healthier extra virgin Olive oil is used instead of palm oil (as in the Bahian version); urucum pigment is added, and it is always cooked in a traditional <b>clay</b> <b>pan.</b> Moqueca capixaba can be made with fish, shrimp, crabs, sea crab or lobsters. There is also a rare variety made with raw bananas, as a side plate. The dish is usually seasoned with onion, tomatoes, coriander, chives, and olive oil. It is usually accompanied by pirão, which is the paste made with yuca root flour ("farinha de mandioca") and the gravy from the stew.|$|E

5000|$|Sossusvlei {{is about}} 66 km past the Sesriem gate. The last 6 km {{can only be}} traversed with 4WD {{vehicles}} as the metalled road ends and sand begins (the place where the metalled road ends is known as [...] "2x4 parking" [...] as any non-4WD vehicle must stop there). Sossusvlei is a <b>clay</b> <b>pan,</b> of roughly elliptical shape, covered in a crust of salt-rich sand. While the pan has been shaped over time by the Tsauchab river, the actual flooding of the pan is a relatively rare event, and sometimes several years pass between one flood and the next one. The river is dry most of the year, and {{even when it is}} not, it carries relatively little water to the vlei. The vlei is surrounded by high orange-reddish dunes, partially covered by a vegetation comprising grass, bushes, and some tree (mostly of species Acacia erioloba).|$|E

40|$|E horizons {{form when}} {{percolating}} waters eluviate the fine clays, organic matter, free iron oxides and aluminum {{from them in}} sufficient quantities to leave the E horizon lighter in color compared to the A or B horizons. Some E horizons sit atop a <b>clay</b> <b>pan</b> implying that the <b>clay</b> <b>pan</b> formed {{as a result of}} the fine clay translocation from the E horizon. Investigations on the soils of Massie Lagoon were done to test this conceptual model, and also to ascertain whether the ferrolysis process had a role in the E horizon formation. ^ Field and laboratory data held clues that well developed clay pans were in place before the E horizons began forming. The clay pans were subsequently enriched with fine clay from the E horizons, but not formed by clay translocation from the E horizons. The most strongly expressed E horizons were found at the margins of Massie Lagoon. They were 5 to 10 cm thick and 15 to 30 cm below the surface. If the E horizons existed at all in the deeper parts of Massie Lagoon, they were thin (1 to 2 cm) and were at the surface. Soil material had been recently deposited at the margins of Massie Lagoon due to water erosion. This fresh deposition over a pre-existent <b>clay</b> <b>pan</b> provided the material essential for the formation of an E horizon. Studies of soil redox potential, soil solution pH, and iron in solution with soil cores indicated that ferrolysis did not play a large role in the formation of E horizons at Massie Lagoon. The soil redox potentials under saturated conditions were however, an important factor in the E horizon formation. The reduction of the insoluble ferric iron into the soluble ferrous form allows for the removal of iron through leaching from a saturated soil. The greatest amount of iron to go into solution took place near the surface of the soils. ...|$|E
40|$|Clay pans (playas) {{are common}} landforms of {{semi-arid}} and arid desert regions {{ranging in size}} from 1 to 2 km 2 to greater than 10, 000 km 2. The first observations of surface energy exchanges over a <b>clay</b> <b>pan</b> in central Australia using the eddy covariance method are presented. Measurements were obtained in the late dry season (September) before the onset of the Australian summer monsoon under clear skies and weak synoptic winds for five consecutive days. Sensible heat flux displayed an upward trend over the observation period reaching a peak of approximately 50 % of net radiation over the period, while latent heat flux declined as the <b>clay</b> <b>pan</b> became dryer. Ground heat flux was similar in magnitude to sensible heat flux reaching maximum values near noon, approximately 2 h before daily maximum sensible heat flux. Net radiation and ground heat flux both reached minimum values 1 – 2 h after sunset and then gradually increased towards sunrise, while sensible and latent heat flux remained close to zero. Bowen Ratio values increased from 4. 08 to 6. 12 over the study period as the surface dried. Results highlight clay pans as significant sources of sensible heat in desert landscapes...|$|E
