However, no temporal linkage has been proven between the impact and rifting events. Roberts rift lies between 22 and 32 km northeast of the Upheaval impact crater on a subradial trend. The fissure contains clasts that were carried as much as 1, 000 m upward from Paleozoic sources into the Mesozoic section. A plausible model for both the rifting and clast movement involves incremental loading of overpressured fluid compartments in the Pennsylvanian Paradox section and attendant hydraulic fracturing of the overlying <b>confining</b> <b>strata</b> during the impact event. The clasts were proppants entrained in upward moving fluids that originated from overpressured aquifers in the Pennsylvanian section or materials eroded from the fissure walls. Alteration halos and mineralization along the fissure reveal that there was upward leakage of reducing fluids from the overpressured zones following opening of the fissure. The fissure infillings became cemented with time, thus reducing fissure permeabilities to negligible...|$|R
40|$|In {{domestic}} and foreign practice of constructing underground gas storage facilities, industrial sewage, as a rule, is pumped back into the reservoirs-gas storage facilities. Underground disposal of liquid waste is the most rational way to maintain and improve the ecological environment. When selecting the horizon for disposal of industrial waste, the authors considered {{the lower part of}} the sedimentary cover and, in the first place, the Bobrikovian horizon, as well as carbonates of the Turnaisian stage. In the sedimentary cover of the Middle-Upper Carboniferous complex studied by drilling, there are twelve major water-bearing horizons and complexes, separated by regional and local <b>confining</b> <b>strata.</b> Regional water <b>confining</b> bodies in this sedimentary stratum are gypsum-anhydrite layers of the Upper and Lower Permian and mature packs of mudstones, argillaceous limestones and dense dolomites in carboniferous sediments. According to the degree of hydrodynamic activity, zones of active (free), hampered and very difficult (stagnant) regimes are distinguished in the section of the sedimentary cover. There are aquifers of Quaternary and Upper Permian sediments in the zone of active water exchange. The lower boundary of the active water exchange zone passes along the roof of the gypsum-anhydrite stratum of the Kazanian stage of the Upper Permian. As an object for industrial waste disposal in the operation of underground gas storage, the Bobrikovian is the most promising reservoir. It has the best reservoir properties and is reliably isolated from overlying deposits. Due to high mineralization, waters of the Bobrikovian horizon of the Librovichian superhorizon of the lower Visean stage are unsuitable for domestic, potable, production, technical and balneological purposes...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 -D) seismic volumes from {{southeast}} Brazil, southeast Japan, and borehole {{data from}} the Ocean Drilling and Integrated Ocean Drilling Programs are used to demonstrate a new method to distinguish mass-transport deposits (MTDs) from confining hemipelagites, quantify MTDs internal architecture, and assess their reservoir potential or seal competence—the contrast, directionality, energy (CDE) method. The CDE values extracted from 3 -D seismic data can be tied to any ground-truthed property of strata regardless of their depositional history, age, and lithology. The application of the CDE method is, however, dependent on seismic-data acquisition parameters and selected processing sequences and should be independently applied to different seismic volumes. Borehole data indicate contrast (C) to reflect MTDs lithological heterogeneity and degree of disaggregation, which increase proportionally to the absolute value of C. More uniform values of P-wave velocity (Vp) and peak shear strength are recorded in strata with lower contrast. Directionality (D) relates {{to the existence of}} syn- or postdepositional fabric such as compressional ridges, imbricated strata or faults. Energy (E) relates to the acoustic impedance of strata, with high-amplitude reflections correlating with strata with higher shear strength, i. e., high Vp and shear-wave velocity (Vs) values, or with abrupt contrasts in density (bright spots). This work shows that distinct values of C, D, and E reflect variable degrees of vertical and horizontal connectivity in strata and, consequently, their seal and reservoir potential. The CDE values are thus subdivided in nine classes, which are represented in ternary plots to cover the full spectrum of MTDs and any <b>confining</b> <b>strata.</b> As a result, the data in this article confirm that lower seal competence, and higher reservoir potential, is recorded in strata with large D or moderate CDE values...|$|R

40|$|The Rio Grande is a {{regionally}} important water source, but {{the smaller}} rift springs {{are also a}} vital resource for livestock and wildlife. Several springs are located on rift-bounding faults and exhibit a mixing of larger volume meteoric recharge with small volume, chemically potent "endogenic" fluids. It has been hypothesized that deep-seated faults within the rift provide conduits for the ascent of deeply derived fluids, possibly from the lithospheric/asthenospheric mantle, while others have proposed that upwelling sedimentary basin brines at interbasin constrictions represent a significant salinity input to the modern Rio Grande. 	This study (a) provides the first hydrochemical data on a comprehensive suite of springs and wells, and (b) tests and refines existing models for water quality in the rift using hydrochemistry (major, minor and trace elements, Cl/Br ratios, δ 18 O, δD, δ 13 C, and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios) and geochemical modeling along a series of transects within the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. 	In the rift, several potential flow systems can be envisioned: 1) exogenic fluids in shallow unconfined aquifers with recent meteoric recharge, which are characterized by low temperatures, CO 2 values, and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, 2) mesogenic fluids, categorized as subregional basin fluids in Tertiary rift fill, 3) regional/intermediate waters residing in the confined aquifers of Paleozoic/Mesozoic sedimentary strata, 4) deep sedimentary basin brines, also in <b>confined</b> <b>strata,</b> and 5) endogenic waters, defined as deeply-circulating regional fluids that may have mantle derivation, source from faults, and are characterized by elevated temperatures, salinity, CO 2 values, and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. 	Major ions indicate the interaction of five fluids with distinct hydrochemical facies: 1) Na-Cl, 2) mixed ion-HCO 3, 3) Ca-SO 4, 4) mixed cation/anion (corresponds with local precipitation chemistry), and 5) Na-mixed anion. δ 18 O and δD indicate mixing between brines and the Rio Grande, and δ 13 C values suggest a mixing of organic C and a mantle-derived C input in springs. Radiogenic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios indicate mixing between endogenic fluids and meteorically-derived waters and principal component analysis indicates a common deeply-derived source in select waters. These tracers conclude that endogenic fluids are a volumetrically small but potent addition to middle Rio Grande rift springs, and may contribute to river salinization.

40|$|Numerous {{petroleum}} engineering, mining, {{and enhanced}} geothermal energy operations involve cyclic ‎injection of fluids into geological formations. Geomechanics of injection operations in weakly ‎consolidated or unconsolidated reservoirs is complex, and means for analyzing the involved physical ‎processes are limited. The key feature {{that must be}} considered is parting of the formation during ‎injection, which occurs at near zero effective stresses when strength and stiffness of the medium ‎become effectively zero. Even if peculiarities of the granular media behavior at near zero effective ‎stresses are disregarded and a highly idealized Mohr-Coulomb behavior coupled with constant ‎permeability Darcy flow is assumed, the injection problem is still highly challenging. This type of ‎poroplastic formulation remains analytically intractable even for simplest geometries. Numerical ‎computations are highly challenging as well, due to high fluid-solid matrix stiffness contrast. ‎ Much effort has been devoted thus far to understand soil-fluid interactions in geological reservoirs ‎triggered by borehole excavation and production operations. With regards to injection operations ‎however, practically no comprehensive study has been performed to access the fundamental ‎geomechanical processes involved. Previous attempts to evaluate injection operations mainly ‎concentrate on describing fracture growth in hard brittle formations. In principle, the geomechanical ‎processes prior to fracture initiation are particularly complicated in weakly consolidated strata. This ‎dissertation presents analytical solutions and numerical models to examine geomechanics of high ‎pressure fluid injection in conditions when flow rates are high enough to induce plasticity yet not ‎parting of the formation. The study considers injection through a fully-penetrating vertical wellbore ‎into an isotropic, homogeneous unconsolidated geological layer confined between impermeable seal ‎rock layers. Axisymmetric conditions are assumed. The main objective is to evaluate the time ‎dependent geomechanical response of the unconsolidated reservoir in such conditions focusing on ‎failure mechanisms and permanent changes in stress conditions around the injection area. Results of ‎this research {{makes it possible to}} address the issue of integrity of <b>confining</b> <b>strata,</b> facilitate assessments ‎of potential leakage areas, and offer aid for optimization of injection operations as well as in ‎formulating monitoring strategies. ‎ First, rock-fluid interactions are evaluated prior to the state where limiting shear resistance is ‎reached during injection. Unlike previous studies, impacts of vertical confinement governed by the ‎stiffness of the overburden layer are incorporated. The Winkler spring model approximation is ‎implemented to describe the response of the <b>confining</b> <b>strata</b> in the plane perpendicular to the reservoir. ‎New poroelastic analytical solutions are derived to describe evolution of stress and strain components in ‎time as a function of induced pore pressures. Solutions are verified against fully-coupled numerical ‎models designed in this study. Next, novel insights into the geomechanics of parting in various stress ‎regimes is offered via a comprehensive assessment of stress perturbations surrounding vertical injection ‎wellbores. A thorough sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the effect of vertical confinement ‎and rock-fluid characteristic parameters on the reservoir response in the wellbore vicinity. Results ‎demonstrate a notable impact of seal rock stiffness on the near wellbore rock behavior in formations ‎with high intrinsic permeability (typically exceeding 0. 05 Darcy). The study shows that the key ‎parameter controlling the injection process in the poroelastic regime is the ratio of the overburden ‎Winkler stiffness to the reservoir’s bulk modulus, with the Winkler parameter reflecting the seal rock ‎stiffness. When this ratio approaches unity, practically no shear stress is induced in the reservoir while ‎for ratios exceeding unity, deviatoric stresses gradually increase. In situations when the stiffness ratio is ‎below unity, the porous formations can behave in a rather complicated manner depending on the initial ‎stress regime where redirection of the minimal principal stress occurs from a horizontal to a vertical ‎plane. Sensitivity analyses reveal that at the same injection rate rock failure occur more rapidly in ‎conditions of higher stress anisotropy, higher elastic moduli, lower permeability, higher degree of rock-‎fluid coupling, and a higher vertical confinement. ‎ Next, rock-fluid interactions are evaluated in an unconsolidated reservoir formation confined ‎between two stiff seal rock layers subjected to injection pressures high enough to induce plasticity yet ‎not parting of the formation. The injection process is first examined numerically by constructing a ‎fluid-coupled poro-elasto-plastic model in which propagation of the significant influence zone ‎surrounding the injection borehole is quantified by the extent of the plastic domain. A comprehensive ‎assessment of stresses, pore pressures, as well as failure planes is carried out throughout an entire ‎transient state of an injection cycle, at steady state, and also during the shut-in period. The numerical ‎solution describes five distinct zones evolving with time around the injection well and corresponding to ‎different stress states: liquefaction at the wellbore followed by three inner plastic domains where ‎directions of major principal stress changes from vertical to radial and failure planes change accordingly. ‎The plastic domains are followed by a region where stress states remain in the elastic range. Failure ‎mechanisms at the wellbore is found to be in shear initially, followed by development of a state of zero ‎effective stress, i. e. liquefaction. Next, a novel methodology is proposed based on which new weakly-‎coupled poro-elasto-plastic analytical solutions are derived for the stress/strain components during ‎injection. Unlike previous studies, extension of the plastic zone is obtained as a function of injection ‎pressure, incorporating the plasticity effects around the injection well. The derived loosely-coupled ‎solutions are proven to be good approximations of fully-coupled numerical models. These solutions ‎offer a significant advantage over numerical computations as the run time of a fully-coupled numerical ‎model is exceedingly long (requiring about six months for 661 million time computational steps using ‎FLAC 3 D 3. 0 code on Intel® i 7 3. 33 GHz CPU). ‎ The final part of this dissertation includes a brief chapter on the post-injection behavior of ‎unconsolidated reservoir formations confined with stiff seal rock layers. Pore pressure dissipation, stress ‎variations, and the transition behavior of the plastic domain surrounding the injection wellbore to an ‎elastic state are numerically evaluated. Results offer an original insight into the permanent ‎geomechanical effects of injection operations in such formations. ...|$|R

Skin scrapings from these areas were examined microscopically using 15 % potas-sium hydroxide with Parker blue–black ink. Thick fungal hyphae and grape-like bunches of spores were seen, consistent with Malassezia yeast. Although pityriasis (tinea) versicolor is com-mon, the atrophic form is unusual, with the first case reported in 1971. 1 The atrophy {{is limited to the}} area affected by the pityriasis versicolor. Case reports have suggested an association with the use of topical corticosteroids. The fungus, which is <b>confined</b> to the <b>stratum</b> corneum and follicles, is thought to disrupt the skin barrier, allowing better absorption of the steroid, which induces atrophy. Corticosteroid-induced atrophy is usually associ-ated with epidermal atrophy and telangiectasis. Our patient did not have this feature. In a case series involving 12 patients with atrophying pityriasis versicolor, long-term topical corticosteroid use was reported for only one patient. 2 In these cases, the atrophy was thought to have been induced directly by Malassezia yeast, which produce diffusible products that enhance dermal elastolysis, possibly by activating tissue histiocytes. Degeneration of elastic fibres has been noted on skin biopsies. 3 Following treatment of Malassezia, the atrophy usually resolves.

The lithofacies associations represent, in ascending order, shoreface, offshore, and nearshore (or lagoon) depositional environments along a wave- and storm-dominated shallow siliciclastic marine shelf. Major, trace, and rare earth element analyses of the siliciclastic component indicate derivation from a mainly granodioritic Archean upper continental crust with some contributions from mafic volcanic and/or sedimentary rocks.

Stable isotope and elemental analyses of whole-rock limestone samples reveal strongly and consistently negative carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions, generally high Mn and Fe concentrations, and low Sr and Mg concentrations, suggesting post-depositional diagenetic alteration and re-equilibration with hot meteoric waters or infiltrating metamorphic fluids. The carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions are spatially highly variable, indicating local rather than global control, with no clear systematic stratigraphic trends. Petrographic analysis also revealed evidence of intense diagenetic alteration, including recrystallization textures, stylolite structures, widespread dolomitization, and the presence of minerals known to be associated with contact metamorphosed carbonate-rich rocks, such as diopside and scapolite.

40|$|Integration of {{data from}} fully cored stratigraphic holes with an {{extensive}} grid of seismic reflection lines in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, has allowed the formulation of a new model {{for the evolution of}} the Cenozoic Victoria Land Basin of the West Antarctic Rift. The Early Rift phase (Eocene to Early Oligocene) is recorded by wedges of <b>strata</b> <b>confined</b> by early extensional faults, and which contain seismic facies consistent with drainage via coarse-grained fans and deltas into discrete, actively subsiding grabens and half-grabens. The Main Rift phase (Early Oligocene to Early Miocene) is represented by a lens of strata that thickens symmetrically from the basin margins into a central depocenter, and in which stratal events pass continuously {{over the top of the}} Early Rift extensional topography. Internal seismic facies and lithofacies indicate a more organized, cyclical shallow marine succession, influenced increasingly upward by cycles of glacial advance and retreat into the basin. The Passive Thermal Subsidence phase (Early Middle Miocene) is recorded by an evenly distributed sheet of strata that thickens somewhat into the depocenter but is continuous across and over the earlier rift strata to the margins of the basin. Internally, it contains similar facies to the underlying Main Rift, but preserves more evidence for clinoform sets and large channels, and in core comprises many short, condensed and strongly top-truncated stratal cycles with continued, periodic glacial influence. These patterns are interpreted to record accumulation under similar environmental conditions but in a regime of slower subsidence. The Renewed Rifting phase (Middle Miocene to Recent, largely unsampled by coring thus far) is represented by intervals that thicken significantly into the basin depocenter and that are complicated by evidence of magmatic activity (Mc- Murdo Volcanic Group). This succession is further divided into lower and upper intervals, separated by a major unconformity that displays increasing angular discordance towards the western basin margin and Transantarctic Mountain Front. The youngest part of the stratigraphy was accumulated under the influence of flexural loading imposed by the construction of large volcanic edifices, and was formed in an environment in which little sediment was supplied from the western basin margin, suggesting a change in environmental (glacial) conditions at possibly c. 2 Ma. The Cenozoic stratigraphy of the southern Victoria Land Basin preserves archives of both climate change and the complex rift history of the basin, and coincidences between key stratal surfaces in seismic data and evidence for environmental change in drillcores suggest that tectonic and climatic drivers may be causally linked...|$|R
