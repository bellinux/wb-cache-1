2500|$|In the 1970s, British Rail {{began to}} explore new {{technologies}} for enabling high-speed passenger rail services in the UK. While the Japanese and French railway authorities had decided to build completely new tracks for their respective Shinkansen and TGV high-speed rail systems, British Rail opted instead to develop a train capable of running on existing rail infrastructure: the Advanced Passenger Train (APT), with {{a top speed of}} [...] An experimental version, the APT-E was tested between 1972 and 1976. It was equipped with a tilting mechanism which allowed the train to tilt into bends to reduce <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> on passengers, and was powered by gas turbines (the first to be used on British Rail since the Great Western Railway, and subsequent Western Region utilised Swiss built Brown-Boveri, and British built Metropolitan Vickers locomotives (18000 and 18100) in the early 1950s). The 1970s oil crisis prompted a rethink in the choice of motive power (as with the prototype TGV in France), and British Rail later opted for traditional electric overhead lines when the pre-production and production APTs were brought into service in 1980-86.|$|E
50|$|The {{roll center}} of a vehicle is the {{notional}} {{point at which the}} <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> in the suspension are reacted to the vehicle body.|$|E
50|$|The Agera R {{can produce}} lateral <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> of 1.60 G, {{due to a}} {{combination}} of mechanical balance and high levels of grip from the specially developed Michelin Supersport tyres.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> is {{the lateral}} (i.e. {{parallel}} to the road surface) force produced by a vehicle tyre during <b>cornering.</b> <b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> coefficients of motorcycle tyres tends to decrease with increased vertical load, increased inflation pressure, and increased temperature.|$|R
50|$|While {{the tread}} element {{moves through the}} contact patch it is {{deflected}} further from the wheel mid-plane. This deflection {{gives rise to the}} slip angle, and to the <b>cornering</b> <b>force.</b> The rate at which the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> builds up is described by the relaxation length.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: An endless runway {{would be}} banked {{to manage the}} <b>cornering</b> <b>forces.</b> Brooklands was the first motor racing circuit to have banked corners and {{was also one of}} the first aerodromes.|$|E
5000|$|Reduction in <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> due {{to change}} in camber can lead to {{oversteer}} [...] - [...] a dynamically unstable condition where a vehicle can lose control and spin [...] - [...] and in extreme cases lift-off oversteer.|$|E
50|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of mountain biking can be greatly reduced by not riding on wet or sensitive trails, keeping speeds modest so as to minimize <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> and braking forces, not skidding, and by staying on the trail.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> is {{generated}} by tire slip and is proportional to slip angle at low slip angles. The rate at which <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> builds up is described by relaxation length. Slip angle describes the deformation of the tire contact patch, and this deflection of the contact patch deforms the tire in a fashion akin to a spring.|$|R
50|$|The diagram is {{misleading}} because the reaction force {{would appear to}} be acting in the wrong direction. It is simply a matter of convention to quote positive <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> as acting in the opposite direction to positive tire slip so that calculations are simplified, since a vehicle cornering under the influence of a <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> to the left will generate a tire slip to the right.|$|R
50|$|Relaxation length {{describes}} the delay between when a slip angle is introduced {{and when the}} <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> reaches its steady-state value.|$|R
50|$|Short spindle SLAs tend {{to require}} stiffer {{bushings}} at the body, as the braking and <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> are higher. Also {{they tend to}} have poorer kingpin geometry, due to the difficulty of packaging the upper ball joint and the brakes inside the wheel.|$|E
50|$|There is {{risk with}} trail braking because {{excessive}} use of the front brake {{can result in a}} loss of grip as the tire's adhesion is split between braking and <b>cornering</b> <b>forces.</b> Effective trail braking requires finesse from the rider, which can be difficult to learn.|$|E
50|$|Untripped rollovers {{occur when}} <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> destabilize the vehicle. As a vehicle rounds a corner, three forces act on it: tire forces (the {{centripetal}} force), inertial effects (the centrifugal force), and gravity. The <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> from the tire push the vehicle towards {{the center of}} the curve. This force acts at ground level, below the center of mass. The force of inertia acts horizontally through the vehicle's center of mass away from {{the center of the}} turn. These two forces make the vehicle roll towards the outside of the curve. The force of the vehicle's weight acts downward through the center of mass in the opposite direction. When the tire and inertial forces are enough to overcome the force of gravity, the vehicle starts to turn over.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> or {{side force}} is the lateral (i.e. {{parallel}} to the road surface) force produced by a vehicle tire during cornering.|$|R
50|$|Relaxation {{length is}} a {{property}} of pneumatic tires {{that describes the}} delay between when a slip angle is introduced and when the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> reaches its steady-state value.It is also described as the distance that a tire rolls before the lateral force builds up to 63% of its steady-state value.It can be calculated as the ratio of cornering stiffness over the lateral stiffness, wherecornering stiffness is the ratio of <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> over slip angle, andlateral stiffness is the ratio of lateral force over lateral displacement.|$|R
5000|$|As with {{deformation}} of a spring, {{deformation of}} the tire contact patch generates a reaction {{force in the}} tire; the <b>cornering</b> <b>force.</b> Integrating the force generated by every tread element along the contact patch length gives the total <b>cornering</b> <b>force.</b> Although the term, [...] "tread element" [...] is used, the compliance in the tire that leads to this effect is actually a combination of sidewall deflection and deflection of the rubber within the contact patch. The exact ratio of sidewall compliance to tread compliance {{is a factor in}} tire construction and inflation pressure.|$|R
50|$|Offset loads {{similarly}} {{cause the}} vehicle to lean until the centre of gravity lies above the support point. Side winds cause {{the vehicle to}} tilt into them, to resist them with a component of weight. These contact forces are likely to cause more discomfort than <b>cornering</b> <b>forces,</b> because they will result in net side forces being experienced on board.|$|E
50|$|Wheels {{and tires}} are {{much smaller than}} those used on a normal car. Rims are made of {{magnesium}} alloy, aluminum, or composite materials. Tires can support <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> in excess of 2 g (20 m/sÂ²), depending on chassis, engine, and motor setup. Some car tire manufacturers, such as Bridgestone, Dunlop, and Maxxis make tires for karts. There are also specific kart tire manufacturers, which include MG, MOJO, Vega, Hoosier and Burris.|$|E
5000|$|Prevention of {{the engine}} {{experiencing}} oil-starvation during high g-loads, which is particularly useful in racing cars, high performance sports cars, and aerobatic aircraft. Dry-sump designs are not susceptible to the oil movement problems from high <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> that wet-sump systems can suffer where {{the force of the}} vehicle cornering can cause the oil to pool {{on one side of the}} oil pan, possibly uncovering the oil pump pickup tube and causing cavitation and loss of oil pressure.|$|E
50|$|Roll steer. As {{the vehicle}} rolls the {{kinematics}} of the suspension provide {{a change in}} the steer angle of the tire. This generates a <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> in the normal way.|$|R
5000|$|In vehicle dynamics, {{slip angle}} or {{sideslip}} angle is the angle between a rolling wheel's actual {{direction of travel}} and the direction towards which it is pointing (i.e., {{the angle of the}} vector sum of wheel forward velocity [...] and lateral velocity [...] ). For a free-rolling wheel this slip angle results in a force parallel to the axle and the component of the force perpendicular to the wheel's direction of travel is the <b>cornering</b> <b>force.</b> This <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> increases approximately linearly for the first few degrees of slip angle, then increases non-linearly to a maximum before beginning to decrease.|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of pneumatic tires which {{are of interest}} to aircraft designers. The principal topics discussed are tire vertical-force-deflection characteristics; lateral, fore-and-aft, and torsional spring constants; footprint-area properties; relaxation lengths; rolling radius; <b>cornering</b> <b>force,</b> <b>cornering</b> power, self-alining torque, and pneumatic caster for yawed rolling conditions; effects of wheel tilt; and tire radial growth {{under the influence of}} centrifugal forces. NACA TN No. 4110. Includes bibliographical references. A study is presented of pneumatic tires which are of interest to aircraft designers.

50|$|Tires {{that are}} hollow {{but are not}} {{pressurized}} have also been designed for automotive use, such as the Tweel (a portmanteau of tire and wheel), which is an experimental tire design being developed at Michelin. The outer casing is rubber as in ordinary radial tires, but the interior has special compressible polyurethane springs {{to contribute to a}} comfortable ride. Besides the impossibility of going flat, the tires are intended to combine the comfort offered by higher-profile tires (with tall sidewalls) with the resistance to <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> offered by low profile tires. They have not yet been delivered for broad market use.|$|E
5000|$|To enhance {{stopping}} power extra wide diameter drum brakes {{too large to}} fit inside 16" [...] wheel rims were used, mounted inboard with short half shafts and two universal joints per wheel. Suspension was four-wheel independent. Torsion bars fitted inside the frame's tubes {{were used in the}} double wishbone front. To prevent <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> from raising the car, as occurs with short swing axles, the rear used a low-roll center system featuring off-centered beams spanning from each hub to {{the opposite side of the}} chassis crossing one-another over the centerline. Nevertheless, snap-oversteer could be still a notable problem at speed.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common uses for MEMS accelerometers is in airbag {{deployment}} systems for modern automobiles. In this case the accelerometers are used to detect the rapid negative acceleration of the vehicle to determine when a collision has occurred and the severity of the collision. Another common automotive use is in electronic stability control systems, which use a lateral accelerometer to measure <b>cornering</b> <b>forces.</b> The widespread use of accelerometers in the automotive industry has pushed their cost down dramatically. Another automotive application is the monitoring of noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH), conditions that cause discomfort for drivers and passengers and may also be indicators of mechanical faults.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} {{pneumatic}} tires, bicycle tires generate <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> that varies with slip angle and camber thrust that varies with camber angle. These {{forces have been}} measured by several researchers since the 1970s, and {{have been shown to}} influence bicycle stability.|$|R
5000|$|Load {{transfer}} {{effect and}} cornering stiffness of tire. As load transfers across the vehicle the tire's {{ability to provide}} <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> for a given slip angle changes. The latter {{is known as the}} cornering stiffness of the tire. See also Tire load sensitivity ...|$|R
30|$|In {{equilateral}} polygons, the superposed corners {{are independent}} of each other, but they are inscribed in the same circle. However, in natural pores, the cross sections are more irregular, and the complex structure of the polygonal <b>corners</b> <b>forces</b> the fluid distributions to be more complicated.|$|R
5000|$|Improved pump {{efficiency}} to maintain oil {{supply to the}} engine. Since scavenge pumps are typically mounted at the lowest point on the engine, the oil flows into the pump intake by gravity {{rather than having to}} be lifted up into the intake of the pump as in a wet-sump. Furthermore, scavenge pumps can be of a design that is more tolerant of entrapped gasses than the typical pressure pump, which can lose suction if too much air mixes into the oil. Since the pressure pump is typically lower than the external oil tank, it always has a positive pressure on its suction regardless of <b>cornering</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Tramontana has a {{monocoque}} chassis {{made out}} of impregnated carbon fibre/honeycomb, as the Formula One safety cell that cocoons the driver protecting them from injuries. This allows weight reduction for the car, while also combining carbon fibre for the body. Its Formula One inspired style generates more than 250 kg of downforce, and lateral <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> of 1.3 G at high speeds. The Tramontana is fully customizable by the client, but as standard package comes with forged aluminum wheels, measuring 20". Other highlights include different aerodynamic options available to be chosen depending {{on the use of}} the car and a single canopy door that allows access to the tandem structured cockpit. If the two seat option is chosen, the passenger sits directly behind and slightly higher than the driver remembering the fighter-jets tandem position.|$|E
50|$|In a re-run {{of a film}} shown during Series 5 of the show, Hammond and May {{travelled}} to Lillehammer in 2004 to {{make use}} of the 2 km bobsleigh course. Their aim was to see if a bobsleigh team aided by Hammond, who would be subject to <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> of up to 5G, could beat a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution rally car, which would be driven by Norwegian Henning Solberg with May as co-driver. For the rally car, it would run on a snowy dirt road that had exactly the same length of the course, not only starting and stopping the same places, but also consisting of slippery surfaces and sharp corners. While the bobsleigh would be time by the course officials, May would be timing the rally car. Despite a close race, the bobsleigh turned in a time of 59.68 at the end, beating the rally car by just over 2 seconds after it came in with a time of 1:02.24.|$|E
50|$|Pneumatic {{trail is}} a trail-like effect {{generated}} by compliant tyres rolling {{on a hard}} surface and subject to side loads, as in a turn. It is the distance that the resultant <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> of side-slip occurs behind the geometric centre of the contact patch.|$|R
5000|$|Production car tires {{typically}} {{develop this}} maximum lateral <b>force,</b> or <b>cornering</b> <b>force,</b> at a slip angle of 6-10 degrees, although this angle increases as the vertical {{load on the}} tire increases. [...] Formula 1 car tires may reach a peak sideforce at 3 degrees ...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of four model aircraft tires of various construction were evaluated experimentally and compared with available theory. The experimental investigation consisted of measuring the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> and the self-aligning torque {{developed by the}} tires undergoing sinusoidal steering inputs while operating on a small scale, road-wheel tire testing apparatus. The force and moment data from the different tires are compared with both finite- and point-contact patch string theory predictions. In general, agreement between finite contact patch theory and experimental observation is good. A modified string theory is also presented in which coefficients for <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> and self-aligning torque are determined separately. This theory improves the correspondence between the experimental and analytical data, particularly on tires with relatively high self-aligning torques...|$|R
