5|$|The Carroll {{rearrangement}} is a rearrangement {{reaction in}} organic chemistry and involves {{the transformation of}} a β-keto allyl ester into a α-allyl-β-ketocarboxylic acid. This organic reaction is accompanied by decarboxylation and the final product is a γ,δ-allylketone. The Carroll rearrangement is an adaptation of the <b>Claisen</b> rearrangement and effectively a decarboxylative allylation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Claisen</b> {{rearrangement}} (not to {{be confused}} with the <b>Claisen</b> condensation) is a powerful carbon–carbon bond-forming chemical reaction discovered by Rainer Ludwig <b>Claisen.</b> The heating of an allyl vinyl ether will initiate a -sigmatropic rearrangement to give a γ,δ-unsaturated carbonyl.|$|E
25|$|Unlike typical <b>Claisen</b> rearrangements {{which require}} heating, {{zwitterionic}} <b>Claisen</b> rearrangements {{take place at}} or below room temperature. The acyl ammonium ions are highly selective for Z-enolates under mild conditions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Claise</b> Brook is {{a stream}} which empties into Claisebrook Cove before {{running into the}} Swan River in Perth, Western Australia. The area {{surrounding}} the stream is {{on the outskirts of}} the Perth CBD and is part of the suburb of East Perth. <b>Claise</b> Brook was once an important water course from which the numerous interconnected fresh water lakes north of Perth emptied into during the wet season before entering the Swan River.|$|R

25|$|The Overman {{rearrangement}} (named after Larry Overman) is a <b>Claisen</b> rearrangement of allylic trichloroacetimidates to allylic trichloroacetamides.|$|E
25|$|Discovered in 1912, the <b>Claisen</b> {{rearrangement}} is {{the first}} recorded example of a -sigmatropic rearrangement. Many reviews have been written.|$|E
25|$|The first {{reported}} <b>Claisen</b> rearrangement is the -sigmatropic rearrangement of an allyl phenyl ether to intermediate 1, which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho-substituted phenol.|$|E

50|$|East Perth is {{an inner}} suburb of Perth, Western Australia, located {{next to the}} Perth CBD. <b>Claise</b> Brook and Claisebrook Cove are within the suburb.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the latter}} half of the 1800s until the mid-1980s, the area around <b>Claise</b> Brook and Claisebrook Cove was used for mainly {{industrial}} purposes and the water quality and surrounds were badly degraded. During this period it was also widely referred to as Claisebrook Drain. In the late 1800s and early 1900s it had become an effluent outlet into the river. In 1906 the Claisebrook and Burswood Sewerage Treatment Works was built. Sewerage was pumped across the river from <b>Claise</b> Brook to ponds and filter beds on Burswood Island.|$|R
25|$|The enzyme chorismate mutase (EC 5.4.99.5) catalyzes the <b>Claisen</b> {{rearrangement}} of chorismate to prephenate, a key intermediate in the shikimate pathway (the biosynthetic pathway {{towards the}} synthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine).|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{the natural}} enzyme chorismate mutase, which catalyzes the <b>Claisen</b> {{rearrangement}} of chorismate, features many other interactions {{in addition to}} the hydrogen bonds involved in stabilizing the enolate-like fragment, which {{is an example of the}} anionic fragment stabilization strategy discussed above. A key interaction is the stabilization of the other cationic allyl fragment through a cation-pi interaction in the transition state. The use of many additional hydrogen bonds has several putative purposes. The stabilization of multiple hydrogen bonds to the enzyme helps overcome the entropic cost of binding. Additionally, the interactions help hold the substrate in a reactive conformation, and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction has near-zero entropy of activation, while typical <b>Claisen</b> rearrangements in solution have very negative entropies of activation.|$|E
25|$|There are {{substantial}} solvent effects {{observed in the}} <b>Claisen</b> rearrangement, where polar solvents tend to accelerate the reaction to a greater extent. Hydrogen-bonding solvents gave the highest rate constants. For example, ethanol/water solvent mixtures give rate constants 10-fold higher than sulfolane. Trivalent organoaluminium reagents, such as trimethylaluminium, {{have been shown to}} accelerate this reaction.|$|E
50|$|Clashmore (An Clais Mór) is a {{scattered}} township in Assynt, in Sutherland, in the Highland {{council area}} of Scotland. It is {{situated on the}} Rubha Stoer, 10 km north west of Lochinver, overlooking the Loch na <b>Claise.</b>|$|R
50|$|Glas Maol {{is often}} climbed in {{conjunction}} with Creag Leacach to the south or Cairn of <b>Claise</b> to the north. The broad ridge linking these peaks is topped by a Dry-stone dyke, which approximately corresponds to {{the border of the}} Angus council area.|$|R
5000|$|The works was {{situated}} on the north bank of <b>Claise</b> Brook and operated until its decommissioning in 1971. It was dismantled {{over a number of}} years, and the landmark 20-sided gasometer known as the [...] "No. 2 Cityholder" [...] was removed in 1985.|$|R
25|$|Meta-substitution {{affects the}} regioselectivity of this rearrangement. For example, {{electron}} withdrawing groups (e.g. bromide) at the meta-position direct the rearrangement to the ortho-position (71% ortho-product), while electron donating groups (e.g. methoxy), direct rearrangement to the para-position (69% para-product). Additionally, presence of ortho-substituents exclusively leads to para-substituted rearrangement products (tandem <b>Claisen</b> and Cope rearrangement).|$|E
25|$|The Chen–Mapp {{reaction}} {{also known}} as the -Phosphorimidate Rearrangement or Staudinger–Claisen Reaction installs a phosphite in the place of an alcohol and takes advantage of the Staudinger reduction to convert this to an imine. The subsequent <b>Claisen</b> is driven by the fact that a P=O double bond is more energetically favorable than a P=N double bond.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Claisen</b> {{rearrangement}} is an exothermic, concerted (bond cleavage and recombination) pericyclic reaction. Woodward–Hoffmann rules show a suprafacial, stereospecific reaction pathway. The kinetics are of {{the first}} order and the whole transformation proceeds through a highly ordered cyclic transition state and is intramolecular. Crossover experiments eliminate {{the possibility of the}} rearrangement occurring via an intermolecular reaction mechanism and are consistent with an intramolecular process.|$|E
50|$|Bunbury Bridge was a single-track, timber {{railway bridge}} in East Perth in Western Australia. The bridge crossed the Swan River near <b>Claise</b> Brook and {{was built for}} {{passenger}} and freight traffic to Bunbury on the South Western Railway, and was {{also part of the}} Armadale railway line.|$|R

50|$|The {{area of the}} {{department}} is 5880 km2 and it is some 100 km {{from north to south}} and some 90 km wide. The land is undulating and slopes gently towards the northwest. The main rivers are the Creuse, the <b>Claise</b> and the Indre. The Creuse, a tributary of the Vienne, is 264 km long and has been impounded in several places; {{at the time it was}} built in 1926, the Eguzon Dam was the largest dam in Europe. The <b>Claise</b> is 88 km long and is a tributary of the Creuse. The Indre is a longer waterway and flows centrally through {{the department}} from south to north, through the major towns of La Châtre, Châteauroux and Loches. It is a tributary of the Loire, joining it at Chinon in the neighbouring department of Loir-et-Cher.|$|R
25|$|In the 19th century, it {{was known}} that nitric acid oxidizes camphor into camphoric acid. Haller and Blanc {{published}} a semisynthesis of camphor from camphoric acid. Although they demonstrated its structure, {{they were unable to}} prove it. The first complete total synthesis of camphoric acid was published by Gustaf Komppa in 1903. Its inputs were diethyl oxalate and 3,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, which reacted by <b>Claisen</b> condensation to yield diketocamphoric acid. Methylation with methyl iodide and a complicated reduction procedure produced camphoric acid. William Perkin published another synthesis a short time later. Previously, some organic compounds (such as urea) had been synthesized in the laboratory as a proof of concept, but camphor was a scarce natural product with a worldwide demand. Komppa realized this and began industrial production of camphor in Tainionkoski, Finland, in 1907.|$|E
25|$|Biosynthesis of this 31-membered macrocycle {{begins as}} the loading domain is primed with the starter unit, 4,5-dihydroxocyclohex-1-ene-carboxylic acid, which {{is derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Note that the {{cyclohexane}} ring of the starting unit is reduced during the transfer to module 1. The starting unit is then modified by a series of <b>Claisen</b> condensations with malonyl or methylmalonyl substrates, which are attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and extend the polyketide by two carbons each. After each successive condensation, the growing polyketide is further modified according to enzymatic domains that are present to reduce and dehydrate it, thereby introducing the diversity of functionalities observed in rapamycin (figure 1). Once the linear polyketide is complete, L-pipecolic acid, which is synthesized by a lysine cycloamidase from an L-lysine, is added to the terminal end of the polyketide by an NRPS. Then, the NSPS cyclizes the polyketide, giving prerapamycin, the first enzyme-free product. The macrocyclic core is then customized by a series of post-PKS enzymes through methylations by MTases and oxidations by P-450s to yield rapamycin.|$|E
500|$|Discovered in 1912 by Rainer Ludwig <b>Claisen,</b> the <b>Claisen</b> {{rearrangement}} is {{the first}} recorded example of a -sigmatropic rearrangement. This rearrangement is a useful carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction. An example of <b>Claisen</b> rearrangement is the [...] rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether, which upon heating yields a γ,δ-unsaturated carbonyl. The formation of a carbonyl group makes this reaction, unlike other sigmatropic rearrangements, inherently irreversible.|$|E

500|$|A sigmatropic {{reaction}} in organic chemistry is a pericyclic reaction wherein {{the net result}} is one σ-bond is changed to another σ-bond in an uncatalyzed intramolecular process. The name sigmatropic {{is the result of a}} compounding of the long-established sigma designation from single carbon–carbon bonds and the Greek word tropos, meaning turn. In this type of rearrangement reaction, a substituent moves from one part of a π-bonded system to another part in an intramolecular reaction with simultaneous rearrangement of the π system. True sigmatropic reactions are usually uncatalyzed, although Lewis acid catalysis is possible. Sigmatropic reactions often have transition-metal catalysts that form intermediates in analogous reactions. The most well-known of the sigmatropic rearrangements are the [...] Cope rearrangement, <b>Claisen</b> rearrangement, Carroll rearrangement and the Fischer indole synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|Evans and his {{co-workers}} [...] has developed a strategy that relies heavily on asymmetric aldol methodology {{for the production of}} the polypropionate backbone. Interestingly, they used a <b>Claisen</b> condensation reaction to construct the C(13)–C(14) trisubstituted Z-olefin. The Evans synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 6.4% with a longest linear sequence of 31 steps and 49 total steps.|$|E
2500|$|The 3-aza-Cope {{reaction}} was discovered {{soon after the}} 2-aza-Cope rearrangement was identified, due to its analogous relationship to the <b>Claisen</b> rearrangement. [...] Indeed, in early papers, {{this version of the}} aza-Cope rearrangement {{is often referred to as}} the amino-Claisen rearrangement, a misrepresentation of the rearrangement, as this would imply that both a nitrogen and oxygen are in the molecule. [...] This rearrangement can be used to form heterocyclic rings involving carbon, most commonly piperidine.|$|E
25|$|Between Perth and Guildford {{the river}} goes through several loops. Originally, areas {{including}} the Maylands Peninsula, Ascot and Burswood, through <b>Claise</b> Brook {{and north of}} the city to Herdsman Lake were swampy wetlands. Most of the wetlands have since been reclaimed for land development. Heirisson Island, upon which The Causeway passes over, was once a collection of small islets known as the Hierrison Islands.|$|R
50|$|Other {{lakes and}} swamps in the {{immediate}} northern vicinity of the early Perth township were Lake Kingsford (site of the current Perth railway station), Lake Irwin (Perth Entertainment Centre) and further north were Stone's Lake (Perth Oval), Lake Poullet (First Swamp, {{part of what is}} now Birdwood Square), Lake Thomson (Mews Swamp, between Lake, Brisbane and Beaufort streets) and Lake Henderson (parts of what is now Robertson Park and Dorrien Gardens). Further north still lay Second Swamp (Bulwer Street, east of Lake Street), Third Swamp (Hyde Park) and Three Island Lake and Smith's Lake (now Charles Veryard Reserve). Many of these lakes formed a natural interconnected drainage system which found its way into the Swan River at East Perth through <b>Claise</b> Brook.|$|R
50|$|<b>Claise</b> Brook - named Clause's Brook {{on early}} maps, after Frederick Clause. This was a fresh water creek which emptied {{the network of}} natural lakes north of the city. Before an {{effective}} sewerage system was built, it became an open sewer which dumped waste directly into the river for many years during the 1800s and early 1900s. The area surrounding has been mainly industrial {{for most of the}} period of European settlement and it {{has a long history of}} neglect. Since the late 1980s, the East Perth redevelopment has dramatically tidied up the area and works include a landscaped inlet off the river large enough for boats. The area is now largely residential and the brook exists in name only with the lakes having been either removed or managed by man-made drainage systems.|$|R
