40|$|It {{is known}} that when a colored surface is viewed {{for some time and}} a blank screen is {{presented}} afterwards, an afterimage can be perceived in the <b>complementary</b> <b>color.</b> Color appearances in afterimages are due to adaptation of retinal cones and they are especially vivid when contours, presented after the adapting image, coincide with the blurred edges of the afterimage [1]. We report here that one and the same <b>colored</b> <b>stimulus</b> can induce multiple, differently colored afterimages, and that colored afterimages can also be perceived at regions that were not adapted to color. The observed filling-in of afterimage colors strongly depends on contours presented after the <b>colored</b> <b>stimulus,</b> revealing colorcontour interactions that resemble filling-in of real colors...|$|R
40|$|Complementary afterimages {{are often}} modeled as illusory Hering {{opponent}} hues {{generated by the}} visual system {{as a result of}} adaptation. Yet, the empirical evidence suggests a different picture—Complementary afterimages are localized RGB filtered perception based on <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> pairs. The article aims to bring to the fore an ongoing ambiguity about red/green afterimages and then to address all cases of complementary afterimages. A simple model of afterimages based both on empirical data and the available literature is reconsidered and discussed: The afterimage color A depends both on the <b>color</b> <b>stimulus</b> S and on the ensuing background color B as estimated by the relation, A = B – kS...|$|R
40|$|After {{fixating}} on {{a colored}} pattern, observers see {{a similar pattern}} in <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> when the <b>stimulus</b> is removed [1 – 6]. Afterimages were important in disproving the theory that visual rays emanate from the eye, in demonstrating interocular interactions, and in revealing the independence of binocular vision from eye movements. Afterimages also prove invaluable in exploring selective attention, filling in, and consciousness. Proposed physiological mechanisms for color afterimages range from bleaching of cone photopigments to cortical adaptation [4 – 9], but direct neural measurements have not been reported. We introduce a time-varying method for evoking afterimages, which provides precise measurements of adaptation and a direct link between visual percepts and neural responses [10]. We then use in vivo electrophysiological recordings to show that all three classes of primate retinal ganglion cells exhibit subtractive adaptation to prolonged stimuli, with much slower time constants than those expected of photoreceptors. At the cessation of the stimulus, ganglion cells generate rebound responses that can provide afterimage signals for later neurons. Our results indicate that afterimage signals are generated in the retina but may be modified like other retinal signals by cortical processes, so that evidence presented for cortical generation of color afterimages is explainable by spatiotemporal factors that modify all signals...|$|R

For example, one could use yellow, purple, red, and green. Tetrad colors can be found by putting a square or rectangle on the color wheel.|$|R

50|$|<b>Complementary</b> <b>colors</b> {{also have}} more {{practical}} uses. Because orange and blue are <b>complementary</b> <b>colors,</b> life rafts and life vests are traditionally orange, {{to provide the}} highest contrast and visibility when seen from ships or aircraft over the ocean.|$|R

5000|$|Other {{scientists}} {{looked more}} closely at the use of <b>complementary</b> <b>colors.</b> In 1828, the French chemist Eugene Chevreul, making a study of the manufacture of Gobelin tapestries to make the colors brighter, demonstrated scientifically that [...] "the arrangement of <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> is superior to any other harmony of contrasts." [...] His 1839 book on the subject, De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs et de l'assortiment des objets colorés, showing how <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> can be used in everything from textiles to gardens, was widely read in Germany, France and England, and made <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> a popular concept. The use of <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> was further publicized by the French art critic Charles Blanc in his book Grammaire des arts et du dessin (1867) and later by the American color theorist Ogden Rood in his book Modern Chromatics (1879). These books were read with great enthusiasm by contemporary painters, particularly Georges Seurat and Vincent van Gogh, who put the theories into practice in their paintings.|$|R

40|$|A {{corollary}} of Grassman’s linearity law is formally derived, and states: If {{a number}} of colors have a corresponding color appearance A in different illuminants, then their <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> have a corresponding color appearance B.

50|$|<b>Complementary</b> <b>colors</b> {{can create}} some {{striking}} optical effects. The shadow {{of an object}} appears to contain some of the <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> of the object. For example, {{the shadow of a}} red apple will appear to contain a little blue-green. This effect is often copied by painters who want to create more luminous and realistic shadows. Also, if you stare at a square of color {{for a long period of}} time (thirty seconds to a minute), and then look at a white paper or wall, you will briefly see an afterimage of the square in its <b>complementary</b> <b>color.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to {{traditional}} color theory based on subtractive primary colors and the RYB color model, which {{is derived from}} paint mixtures, yellow mixed with violet, orange mixed with blue, or red mixed with green produces an equivalent gray and are the painter's <b>complementary</b> <b>colors.</b> These contrasts {{form the basis of}} Chevreul's law of color contrast: colors that appear together will be altered as if mixed with the <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> of the other color. Thus, a piece of yellow fabric placed on a blue background will appear tinted orange, because orange is the <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> to blue.|$|R
50|$|The tetradic (double <b>complementary)</b> <b>colors</b> {{scheme is}} the richest {{of all the}} schemes because it uses four colors {{arranged}} into two <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> pairs.

50|$|It is {{generally}} accepted across all current research that infants prefer high contrast and bold colors at their earlier stages of infancy, rather than saturated colors. One {{study found that}} newborn infants looked longer at checkered patterns of white and <b>colored</b> <b>stimuli</b> (including red, green, yellow) than they did at a uniform white color. However, infants failed to discriminate blue from white checkered patterns. Another study - recording the fixation time of infants to blue, green, yellow, red, and gray at two difference luminance levels - found that infants and adults differed in their color preference. Newborns and one month did not show any preference among the <b>colored</b> <b>stimuli.</b> It was found that three-month-old infants preferred the longer wavelength (red and yellow) to the short-wavelength (blue and green) stimuli, while adults had the opposite. However, both adults and infants preferred <b>colored</b> <b>stimuli</b> over non-colored stimuli. According this study, it was suggest that infants had a general preference for <b>colored</b> <b>stimuli</b> over non-colored stimuli at birth; however, infants {{were not able to}} distinguish between the different <b>colored</b> <b>stimuli</b> until after three months of age.|$|R

2500|$|Chevreul also {{realized}} that the [...] "halo" [...] that one sees after looking at a color is the opposing color (also known as <b>complementary</b> <b>color).</b> For example: After looking at a red object, one may see a cyan echo/halo of the original object. This <b>complementary</b> <b>color</b> (as an example, cyan for red) is due to retinal persistence. Neoimpressionist painters interested in the interplay of colors made extensive use of <b>complementary</b> <b>colors</b> in their paintings. In his works, Chevreul advised artists to think and paint not just {{the color of the}} central object, but to add colors and make appropriate adjustments to achieve a harmony among colors.
