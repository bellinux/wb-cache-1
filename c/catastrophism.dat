5|$|In 1796, Georges Cuvier {{published}} his {{findings on the}} differences between living elephants and {{those found in the}} fossil record. His analysis identified mammoths and mastodons as distinct species, different from any living animal, and effectively ended a long-running debate over whether a species could become extinct. In 1788, James Hutton described gradual geological processes operating continuously over deep time. In the 1790s, William Smith began the process of ordering rock strata by examining fossils in the layers while he worked on his geologic map of England. Independently, in 1811, Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart published an influential study of the geologic history of the region around Paris, based on the stratigraphic succession of rock layers. These works helped establish the antiquity of the Earth. Cuvier advocated <b>catastrophism</b> to explain the patterns of extinction and faunal succession revealed by the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|In Cuvier's {{landmark}} 1796 {{paper on}} living and fossil elephants, {{he referred to}} a single catastrophe that destroyed life {{to be replaced by}} the current forms. As a result of his studies of extinct mammals, he realized that animals such as Palaeotherium had lived before the time of the mammoths, which led him to write in terms of multiple geological catastrophes that had wiped out a series of successive faunas. By 1830, a scientific consensus had formed around his ideas as a result of paleobotany and the dinosaur and marine reptile discoveries in Britain. In Great Britain, where natural theology was very influential in the early 19th century, a group of geologists that included Buckland, and Robert Jameson insisted on explicitly linking the most recent of Cuvier's catastrophes to the biblical flood. <b>Catastrophism</b> had a religious overtone in Britain that was absent elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In 1796 Georges Cuvier {{presented}} {{a paper on}} living and fossil elephants comparing skeletal remains of Indian and African elephants to fossils of mammoths and of an animal he would later name mastodon utilizing comparative anatomy. He established {{for the first time}} that Indian and African elephants were different species, and that mammoths differed from both and must be extinct. He further concluded that the mastodon was another extinct species that also differed from Indian or African elephants, more so than mammoths. Cuvier made another powerful demonstration of the power of comparative anatomy in paleontology when he {{presented a}} second paper in 1796 on a large fossil skeleton from Paraguay, which he named Megatherium and identified as a giant sloth by comparing its skull to those of two living species of tree sloth. Cuvier’s ground-breaking work in paleontology and comparative anatomy led to the widespread acceptance of extinction. It also led Cuvier to advocate the geological theory of <b>catastrophism</b> to explain the succession of organisms revealed by the fossil record. He also pointed out that since mammoths and wooly rhinoceros were not the same species as the elephants and rhinoceros currently living in the tropics, their fossils could not be used as evidence for a cooling earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{emerging}} {{discipline of}} geology also brought {{natural history and}} natural philosophy closer together; {{the establishment of the}} stratigraphic column linked the spatial distribution of organisms to their temporal distribution, a key precursor to concepts of evolution. Georges Cuvier and others made great strides in comparative anatomy and paleontology in the late 1790s and early 19th century. In a series of lectures and papers that made detailed comparisons between living mammals and fossil remains Cuvier was able to establish that the fossils were remains of species that had become extinct—rather than being remains of species still alive elsewhere in the world, as had been widely believed. Fossils discovered and described by Gideon Mantell, William Buckland, Mary Anning, and Richard Owen among others helped establish that there had been an 'age of reptiles' that had preceded even the prehistoric mammals. These discoveries captured the public imagination and focused attention on the history of life on earth. Most of these geologists held to <b>catastrophism,</b> but Charles Lyell's influential Principles of Geology (1830) popularised Hutton's uniformitarianism, a theory that explained the geological past and present on equal terms.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of fossils of extinct species was explained by theories such as <b>catastrophism.</b> <b>Catastrophism</b> claimed that {{animals and plants}} were periodically annihilated {{as a result of}} natural catastrophes and then replaced by new species created ex nihilo (out of nothing). The extinct organisms could then be observed in the fossil record, and their replacements were considered to be immutable.|$|E
25|$|Charles Lyell {{may have}} lost the battle over progressionism to Darwinism, but through rhetoric he won a battle against <b>catastrophism,</b> which enabled his {{hypothesis}} of the uniformity of rate to become a textbook shibboleth.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} Cuvier's {{principal}} palaeontological and geological investigations ultimately {{were given to}} the world in the form of two separate works: Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles de quadrupèdes (Paris, 1812; later editions in 1821 and 1825); and Discours sur les revolutions de la surface du globe (Paris, 1825). In this latter work he expounded a scientific theory of <b>Catastrophism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Flood {{could explain}} extinctions of species at that date, on the {{hypothesis}} that the Ark had not contained all species of animal. A Flood that was not universal, on the other hand, had implications for the biblical theory of races and Noah's sons. The theory of <b>catastrophism,</b> which was as much secular as theological in attitude, could be used in analogous ways.|$|E
25|$|The Swiss-American {{paleontologist}} Louis Agassiz opposed evolution. He {{believed that}} there had been a series of catastrophes with divine re-creations, evidence of which could be seen in rock fossils. Though uniformitarianism dominated ideas from the 1840s onwards, <b>Catastrophism</b> remained a major paradigm in geology until replaced by new models that allowed for both cataclysms (such as meteor strikes) and gradualist patterns (such as ice ages) to explain observed geologic phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Sir Charles Lyell first {{published}} his famous book, Principles of Geology, in 1830. This book, which influenced {{the thought of}} Charles Darwin, successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism. This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the Earth's history and are still occurring today. In contrast, <b>catastrophism</b> is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.|$|E
25|$|Hutton's ideas, called uniformitarianism or gradualism, were {{popularized by}} Sir Charles Lyell {{in the early}} 19th century. The {{energetic}} advocacy and rhetoric of Lyell led {{to the public and}} scientific communities largely accepting an ancient Earth. By this time, the Reverends William Buckland, Adam Sedgwick and other early geologists had abandoned their earlier ideas of <b>catastrophism</b> related to a biblical flood and confined their explanations to local floods. By the 1830s, mainstream science had abandoned a young Earth as a serious hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} creationism {{relates to the}} history of thought {{based on the premise that}} the natural {{universe}} had a beginning, and came into being supernaturally. Natural theology sought evidence in nature supporting an active role of God, and attempts were made to reconcile new knowledge with the biblical deluge myth and story of Noah's Ark. The development of modern geology in the 18th and 19th centuries found geological strata and fossil sequences indicating a very ancient Earth. The diluvial cosmogonies fell victim to their own success, as the spirit of scientific inquiry they had stimulated, gradually led to discoveries that undercut the biblical premises of flood geology and <b>catastrophism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cuvier's work is {{considered}} the foundation of vertebrate paleontology, and he expanded Linnaean taxonomy by grouping classes into phyla and incorporating both fossils and living species into the classification. Cuvier is also known for establishing extinction as a fact—at the time, extinction was considered by many of Cuvier's contemporaries to be merely controversial speculation. In his Essay on the Theory of the Earth (1813) Cuvier was interpreted to have proposed that new species were created after periodic catastrophic floods. In this way, Cuvier became the most influential proponent of <b>catastrophism</b> in geology in the early 19th century. His study of the strata of the Paris basin with Alexandre Brongniart established {{the basic principles of}} biostratigraphy.|$|E
25|$|This led Cuvier {{to become}} an active proponent of the {{geological}} school of thought called <b>catastrophism,</b> which maintained {{that many of the}} geological features of the earth and the history of life could be explained by catastrophic events that had caused the extinction of many species of animals. Over the course of his career, Cuvier came to believe there had not been a single catastrophe, but several, resulting in a succession of different faunas. He wrote about these ideas many times, in particular he discussed them in great detail in the preliminary discourse (an introduction) to a collection of his papers, Recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupèdes (Researches on quadruped fossil bones), on quadruped fossils published in 1812.|$|E
25|$|Hutton's {{main line}} of {{argument}} was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen {{in a short period}} of time by means of catastrophe, but that the incremental processes of uplift and erosion happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, in order to allow time for the changes to occur. While his ideas of Plutonism were hotly contested, scientific inquiries on competing ideas of <b>catastrophism</b> pushed back the age of the Earth into the millions of years – still much younger than commonly accepted by modern scientists, but a great change from the literalist view of an Earth that was only a few thousand years old.|$|E
25|$|Young Earth creationists {{believe that}} the flood {{described}} in Genesis 6–9 did occur, was global in extent, and submerged all dry land on Earth. Some Young Earth Creationists go further and advocate a kind of flood geology which relies on the appropriation of late eighteenth and early nineteenth century {{arguments in favor of}} <b>catastrophism</b> made by such scientists as Georges Cuvier and Richard Kirwan. This approach which was replaced by the mid-nineteenth century almost entirely by uniformitarianism was adopted most famously by George McCready Price and this legacy is reflected in the most prominent YEC organizations today. YEC ideas to accommodate the massive amount of water necessary for a flood that was global in scale included inventing such constructs as an orbiting vapor canopy which would have collapsed and generated the necessary extreme rainfall or a rapid movement of tectonic plates causing underground aquifers or tsunamis from underwater volcanic steam to inundate the planet.|$|E
25|$|As well as combating the Neptunists, he also {{opened up}} the concept of deep time for {{scientific}} purposes, in opposition to <b>Catastrophism.</b> Rather than accepting that the earth {{was no more than}} a few thousand years old, he maintained that the Earth must be much older, with a history extending indefinitely into the distant past. His main line of argument was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen in a short period of time by means of catastrophe, but that processes still happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, to allow time for the changes. Before long, scientific inquiries provoked by his claims had pushed back the age of the earth into the millions of yearsstill too short when compared with the accepted 4.6 billion year age in the 21st century, but a distinct improvement.|$|E
25|$|Gradualism had its {{basis in}} the works of the geologists James Hutton and Charles Lyell. Hutton's view {{suggests}} that profound geological change was the cumulative product of a relatively slow continuing operation of processes which can still be seen in operation today, as opposed to <b>catastrophism</b> which promoted the idea that sudden changes had causes which can no longer be seen at work. A uniformitarian perspective was adopted for biological changes. Such a view can seem to contradict the fossil record, which often shows evidence of new species appearing suddenly, then persisting in that form for long periods. In the 1970s paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed a theoretical model that suggests that evolution, although a slow process in human terms, undergoes periods of relatively rapid change (ranging between 50,000 and 100,000 years) alternating with long periods of relative stability. Their theory is called punctuated equilibrium and explains the fossil record without contradicting Darwin's ideas.|$|E
500|$|In Britain, William Paley's Natural Theology saw {{adaptation}} {{as evidence}} of beneficial [...] "design" [...] by the Creator acting through natural laws. All naturalists in the two English universities (Oxford and Cambridge) were Church of England clergymen, and science became a search for these laws. Geologists adapted <b>catastrophism</b> to show repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the biblical flood. Some anatomists such as Robert Grant were influenced by Lamarck and Geoffroy, but most naturalists regarded their ideas of transmutation {{as a threat to}} divinely appointed social order.|$|E
500|$|Another {{form of this}} {{objection}} is that fossil {{evidence is}} not reliable. This {{is based on a}} much wider range of claims. These include that there are too many [...] "gaps" [...] in the fossil record, that fossil-dating is circular (see the Unfalsifiability section above), or that certain fossils, such as polystrate fossils, are seemingly [...] "out of place." [...] Examination by geologists have found polystrate fossils to be consistent with in situ formation. It is argued that certain features of evolution support creationism's <b>catastrophism</b> (cf. Great Flood), rather than evolution's gradualistic punctuated equilibrium, which some assert is an ad hoc theory to explain the fossil gaps.|$|E
500|$|The sudden {{appearance}} of most {{species in the}} geologic record {{and the lack of}} evidence of substantial gradual change in most species—from their initial appearance until their extinction—has , including by Charles Darwin who appealed to the imperfection of the record as the favored explanation. When presenting his ideas against the prevailing influences of <b>catastrophism</b> and progressive creationism, which envisaged species being supernaturally created at intervals, Darwin needed to forcefully stress the gradual nature of evolution in accordance with the gradualism promoted by his friend Charles Lyell. He privately expressed concern, noting in the margin of his 1844 Essay, [...] "Better begin with this: If species really, after catastrophes, created in showers world over, my theory false." ...|$|E
500|$|Darwin's contemporaries {{eventually}} came {{to accept the}} transmutation of species based upon fossil evidence, and the X Club was formed to defend evolution against the church and wealthy amateurs. At that time the specific evolutionary mechanism which Darwin provided of natural selection was actively disputed by scientists in favour of alternative theories such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis. Darwin's gradualistic account was also opposed by saltationism and <b>catastrophism.</b> Lord Kelvin led scientific opposition to gradualism {{on the basis of}} his thermodynamic calculations that the Earth was between 24 and 400 million years old, and own views favoured a version of theistic evolution accelerated by divine guidance. [...] This age of the earth was disputed by geological estimates, which gained strength in 1907 when radioactive dating of rocks showed that the Earth was billions of years old. [...] The specific hereditary mechanism Darwin hypothesized of pangenesis that supported gradualism also lacked any supporting evidence and was disputed by the empirical tests of Francis Galton. [...] Although evolution was unchallenged, uncertainties about the mechanism in the eclipse of Darwinism persisted from the 1880s until the 1930s [...] inclusion of Mendelian inheritance and the rise of the modern evolutionary synthesis. The modern synthesis rose to universal acceptance among biologists with the help of new evidence, such as genetics, which confirmed Darwin's predictions and refuted the competing theories.|$|E

2500|$|In early nineteenth-century Britain, <b>catastrophism</b> {{was adapted}} {{with the aim}} of {{reconciling}} geological science with religious traditions of the biblical Great Flood. In the early 1820s English geologists including William Buckland and Adam Sedgwick interpreted [...] "diluvial" [...] deposits as the outcome of Noah's flood, {{but by the end of}} the decade they revised their opinions in favour of local inundations. Charles Lyell challenged <b>catastrophism</b> with the publication in 1830 of the first volume of his book Principles of Geology which presented a variety of geological evidence from England, France, Italy and Spain to prove Hutton’s ideas of gradualism correct. He argued that most geological change had been very gradual in human history. [...] Lyell provided evidence for Uniformitarianism; a geological doctrine that processes occur at the same rates in the present as they did in the past and account for all of the Earth’s geological features. Lyell’s works were popular and widely read, the concept of Uniformitarianism had taken a strong hold in geological society.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{paleontology}} {{began with}} the work of Georges Cuvier. Cuvier noted that, in sedimentary rock, each layer contained a specific group of fossils. The deeper layers, which he proposed to be older, contained simpler life forms. He noted that many forms of life from the past are no longer present today. One of Cuvier’s successful contributions {{to the understanding of the}} fossil record was establishing extinction as a fact. In an attempt to explain extinction, Cuvier proposed the idea of [...] "revolutions" [...] or <b>catastrophism</b> in which he speculated that geological catastrophes had occurred throughout the Earth’s history, wiping out large numbers of species. Cuvier's theory of revolutions was later replaced by uniformitarian theories, notably those of James Hutton and Charles Lyell who proposed that the Earth’s geological changes were gradual and consistent. However, current evidence in the fossil record supports the concept of mass extinctions. As a result, the general idea of <b>catastrophism</b> has re-emerged as a valid hypothesis for at least some of the rapid changes in life forms that appear in the fossil records.|$|E
2500|$|In 1929, {{a book by}} one of George McCready Price's former students, Harold W. Clark {{described}} Price's <b>catastrophism</b> as [...] "creationism" [...] in Back to Creationism. Previously anti-evolutionists {{had described}} themselves as being [...] "Christian fundamentalists" [...] "Anti-evolution" [...] or [...] "Anti-false science." [...] The term creationism had previously referred {{to the creation of}} souls for each new person, as opposed to traducianism, where souls were said to have been inherited from one's parents.|$|E
2500|$|Lyell {{saw himself}} as [...] "the spiritual saviour of geology, freeing the science from the old {{dispensation}} of Moses." [...] The two terms, uniformitarianism and <b>catastrophism,</b> were both coined by William Whewell; in 1866 R. Grove suggested the simpler term continuity for Lyell's view, but the old terms persisted. In various revised editions (12 in all, through 1872), Principles of Geology was the most influential geological work {{in the middle of}} the 19th century, and did much to put geology on a modern footing. For his efforts he was knighted in 1848, then made a baronet in 1864.|$|E
2500|$|One {{student had}} seen the gradual {{abandonment}} of diluvialism: Charles Darwin had attended Jameson's geology lectures in 1826, and at Cambridge became {{a close friend of}} Henslow before learning geology from Sedgwick in 1831. [...] At the outset of the Beagle voyage Darwin was given a copy of Lyell's Principles of Geology, and at the first landfall {{began his career as a}} geologist with investigations which supported Lyell's concept of slow uplift while also describing loose rocks and gravel as [...] "part of the long disputed Diluvium". Debates continued over the part played by repeated exceptional catastrophes in geology, and in 1832 William Whewell dubbed this view <b>catastrophism,</b> while naming Lyell's insistence on explanations based on current processes uniformitarianism.|$|E
2500|$|Flood geology is {{a concept}} {{based on the belief}} that most of Earth's {{geological}} record was formed by the Great Flood described in the story of Noah's Ark. Fossils and fossil fuels are believed to have formed from animal and plant matter which was buried rapidly during this flood, while submarine canyons are explained as having formed during a rapid runoff from the continents at the end of the flood. Sedimentary strata are also claimed to have been predominantly laid down during or after Noah's flood and orogeny. Flood geology is a variant of <b>catastrophism</b> and is contrasted with geological science in that it rejects standard geological principles such as uniformitarianism and radiometric dating. For example, the Creation Research Society argues that [...] "uniformitarianism is wishful thinking." ...|$|E
