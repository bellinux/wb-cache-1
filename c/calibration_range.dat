25|$|For {{refractory}} materials (e.g. platinum, tungsten, tantalum, some carbides and nitrides, etc.) the extremely {{high melting point}} (typically considered to be above, say, 1800°C) may be determined by heating the material in a black body furnace and measuring the black-body temperature with an optical pyrometer. For the highest melting materials, this may require extrapolation by several hundred degrees. The spectral radiance from an incandescent body {{is known to be}} a function of its temperature. An optical pyrometer matches the radiance of a body under study to the radiance of a source that has been previously calibrated as a function of temperature. In this way, the measurement of the absolute magnitude of the intensity of radiation is unnecessary. However, known temperatures must be used to determine the calibration of the pyrometer. For temperatures above the <b>calibration</b> <b>range</b> of the source, an extrapolation technique must be employed. This extrapolation is accomplished by using Planck's law of radiation. The constants in this equation are not known with sufficient accuracy, causing errors in the extrapolation to become larger at higher temperatures. However, standard techniques have been developed to perform this extrapolation.|$|E

The latest tool that the spatial scientist can use is the terrestrial laser scanner. Terrestrial laser scanners are the latest development in the spatial science industry. They are becoming more popular throughout the industry and new applications for their use are constantly being developed. One {{of the most popular}} applications is to remotely capture large amounts of data in a short space of time or from locations where it would be dangerous for a human to occupy. For clients to have confidence in the spatial science profession it needs to have a testing procedure that ensures instruments are measuring correctly. It is the purpose of this research project to conduct investigations into developing a <b>calibration</b> <b>range</b> and calibration procedure at the University of Southern Queensland. There are many design criteria that need to be considered when developing a <b>calibration</b> <b>range.</b> The first major criteria are to have targets located at high and low vertical angles for accurate estimation of the collimation axis error and a vertical angle correction. Having targets in a 360 degree circle around each scanner station is the second design criteria, which is used to calculate a horizontal angle correction. For the calculation of the scale error, multiple distance ranges are required. Finally at least two (2) scanner stations {{are required to}} be able to perform the calibration. This project will develop a <b>calibration</b> <b>range</b> at USQ {{that can be used to}} estimate corrections to TLS instruments. The results of this project have found appropriate station geometry that can be used for the calibration of terrestrial laser scanners.
