50|$|The five {{original}} locomotives {{were kept}} as spare locomotives until 1971 {{when they were}} either sold or transferred to other Kaiser operations. Locomotives 1025 and 1026 were sold in March 1972 to Railway Supply Company of Montgomery, Alabama. There they were rebuilt for Peabody Coal Company for use at its River King Mine in Marrisa, Illinois. 1025 was later sold for scrap to Hyman-Michaels in Alton, Illinois and was scrapped in August 1978. 1026 was sold in August 1978 to Koppel Bulk Terminal at Long Beach, California. It was then sold in early 1980 to Chrome <b>Cranshaft</b> in Alhambra, California and was scrapped in late 1980.|$|E

The mechanisms have been ascertained; the mathematical simulators, which present the influence of chemical composition, of metallurgical and production factors, of heat treatment modes and of plastic deformation on the structure and on the properties of SCI and BSCI, have been developed. The foundations of comprehensive thermal-plastic treatment of SCI have been developed. The production foundations have been developed, the <b>cranshafts</b> and the gear wheels for the heavy-load lorry {{have been made in}} the high-duty SCI instead of die forgings in the high-alloy steels. The production of crankshafts and gear wheels for the heavy-duty lorry has been organized with the SCI use instead of die forginings in the alloy steelsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
