NH 4 + photoproduction (photoammonification) increased with time-integrated irradiance {{during the course of}} irradiations. Photoammonification rates around local noon were 0. 4 – 2. 9 nmol L − 1 h − 1. Normalised to time integrated irradiance, these rates were 0. 9 – 3. 8 pmol L − 1 h − 1 /(W m − 2) and were significantly correlated with Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) absorbance at 300 nm normalised to Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC). These results are consistent with the notion that successive CDOM photobleaching in the surface mixed layer results in decreased DOC-normalised light absorbance concurrent with decreased dissolved organic matter reactivity with regard to photochemical NH 4 + release. Combining our experimental data with estimates of annual solar irradiance and water <b>column</b> <b>light</b> attenuation yields an annual photoammonification rate for the Cyprus Gyre of 40 ± 17 mmol m − 2 a − 1, equivalent to ~ 12 ± 5 % of the previously estimated annual nitrogen requirement of new production and in the same order of magnitude as atmospheric N deposition in this region.

In support of this work, remote-sensing data were utilised to provide a broad view of the spatial and temporal chlorophyll concentration dynamics, to support in situ observations, and to help "fill the gaps" inherent in in situ point sampling. In situ validation of remote-sensing products was carried out monthly off Perth over a 27 -month period. Biological and physical measurements were made along a 40 km east-west transect, 20 km north of Perth. Results of the study have shown that in water deeper than 30 - 35 m, and where viewing conditions were suitable, the in situ measurements of chlorophyll concentration were within the 35 % uncertainty of the SeaWiFS product. An increase in the in situ measurements of near-coastal chlorophyll concentration was evident during the 1998 winter period (May-July), but the apparent seasonal increase was not evident in the in situ data for 1997.

Water <b>column</b> <b>light</b> availability was less than 2 % of ambient light in emergent vegetated areas due to canopy cover, small floating plants (lemnids), and plant litter. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations were significantly lower and varied less diurnally in vegetated areas. Photosynthesis and aerobic respiration rates {{in the water column}} were much greater in open water than emergent vegetation zones. CH 4 concentrations in the water column were lower in open water than in emergent vegetation zones. But CH 4 flux rates differences were not different due to increased plant cover and thicker stagnant boundary layers in the emergent zones which slow gas. Three habitat zones could be identified based on patterns in vegetation and dissolved oxygen: (1) a zone of dense emergent macrophytes providing significant submerged structure but with nearly or completely anoxic water, (2) a transition zone of sparse emergent macrophytes providing less structure but with more aerobic water, and (3) an open water zone with consistently aerobic water but with little submerged structure. A summary of the carbon budgets for the different zones indicates that the emergent zone was autotrophic while the open water and transitional zones were heterotrophic. Vegetation patterns are likely to control major aspects of wetland biogeochemistry and trophic dynamics. As a result, wetlands should be viewed as complex mosaics of habitats with distinct structural and functional characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen is {{most often}} {{considered}} to be the limiting nutrient for plant growth in marine waters. As a result, knowledge of nitrogen loading and ambient water-column concentrations are considered to be critical to understanding the response of aquatic ecosystems to nutrient over-enrichment—a process known as eutrophication when it results in the excess production of organic matter. Plant production in many estuarine systems may also be limited by light availability as a result of high levels of turbidity in the water resulting from sediments, dissolved organic matter, and phytoplankton in the water <b>column.</b> <b>Light</b> limitation resulting from human-induced increases in turbidity is known to be particularly deliterious to seagrass production/distribution in some ecosystems and also {{play an important role in}} determining how phytoplankton respond to nutrient enrichment. EPA is developing water qulaity criteria for estuaries that require knowledge of both total nitrogen and light availability (measured as photsynthetically active radiation, PAR). Through the National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP), inorganic nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll-a concetration, and a number of hydrographic and water quality parameters are sampled on a monthly basis at 7 sites in the Great Bay system. In addition, these same parameters, as well as bacteria concentrations, are measured at a number of sites in Great Bay and Hampton Harbor through the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) funded through the EPA. This project takes advantage of these existing monitoring activities to collect and analyze for particulate organic nitrogen (PON), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at a up to 10 existing sample sites in the New Hampshire seacoast region.

40|$|Enhanced {{nutrient}} load to estuaries and coastal waters due to anthropogenic activities is damaging aquatic ecosystems, resulting in water pollution and eutrophication prob- lems. It {{is important to}} quantify the production of photosynthetic organisms, as they {{play an important role}} in controlling nitrogen removal and nitrogen fluxes between the sediments and the water column. In turbid estuaries, such as those on the NE Atlantic coast of Europe, benthic primary producers such as macroalgae may play an important part in carbon fixation and nutrient removal, since pelagic production is often strongly light-limited. Estuarine seaweeds are primarily located in intertidal areas, which are characterised by shallow waters and strong tidal currents. Due to high concentrations of suspended particulate matter in the water <b>column,</b> <b>light</b> is rapidly attenuated, limiting macroal- gae production during part of the tidal cycle. An accurate representation of sediment dynamics is essential for the determination of the light energy available for the algae, which is a key factor in reliable primary production estimates. In tidal flats, the sedi- ment dynamics is made more complex by the formation of tidal pools during low tide, where water quickly becomes clear, allowing more light to penetrate through the water column. In the present work a model is developed to calculate macroalgae production in the intertidal areas of estuaries, considering the factors mentioned above. The model is tested for the Tagus estuary (Portugal), and a Gross Primary Production of 3300 g m- 2 y- 1 was obtained. That results in a total nitrogen removal of 440 gN m- 2 y- 1. The results show that the macroalgae community plays an impor- tant role in the nitrogen cycle in estuaries and nutrient export to the open sea, acting as a biorremediation for the increased {{nutrient load}}ing problem...|$|E

Six cruises were undertaken to investigate the response of an inshore site in this system to these high nutrient levels via a comparison with a site in the seasonally nutrient-depleted southern North Sea. The seasonal cycle of chlorophyll concentrations in both environments was similar, consisting of higher chlorophyll a levels in spring than in summer. A spring bloom of diatoms occurs in both environments; in the plume it is succeeded by low chlorophyll levels and a diatom-dominated community at low silicate levels and at the offshore site by a non-siliceous community at similar silicate levels. The low summer chlorophyll levels and diatom dominance, which occur at the inshore site despite an abundance of nitrate and phosphate {{may be due to}} a simultaneous inhibition of non-siliceous growth and silicate limitation of diatom growth. We hypothesise that this is caused by the high turbidity at the inshore site reducing water <b>column</b> <b>light</b> levels such that they become adequate for diatom growth but inadequate for non-siliceous growth; however, we have inadequate data to confirm this suggestion. The benthic silicate flux cannot support the inferred diatom silicate requirement at the inshore site suggesting that silicate mineralisation in the water column may occur and control diatom growth.

40|$|Remote sensing {{of primary}} {{production}} in the euphotic zone has been based mostly on visible-band and water-leaving radiance measured with the coastal zone color scanner. There are some robust, simple relationships for calculating integral production based on surface measurements, but they also require knowledge for photoadaptive parameters such as maximum photosynthesis which currently cannot be obtained from spave. A 17, 000 -station data set is used to show that space-based estimates of maximum photosynthesis could improve predictions of psi, the water <b>column</b> <b>light</b> utiliztion index, which is an important term in many primary productivity models. Temperature is also examined as a factor for predicting hydrographic structure and primary production. A simple model is used to relate temperature and maximum photosynthesis; the model incorporates (1) the positive relationship between maximum photosynthesis and temperature and (2) the strongly negative relationship between temperature and nitrate in the ocean (which directly affects maximum growth rates via nitrogen limitation). Since these two factors relate to carbon and nitrogen, 'balanced carbon/nitrogen assimilation' was calculated using the Redfield ratio, It is expected {{that the relationship between}} maximum balanced carbon assimilation versus temperature is concave-down, with the peak dependent on nitrate uptake kinetics, temperature-nitrate relationships,a nd the carbon chlorophyll ration. These predictions were compared with the sea truth data. The minimum turnover time for nitrate was also calculated using this approach. Lastly, sea surface temperature gradients were used to predict the slope of isotherms (a proxy for the slope of isopycnals in many waters). Sea truth data show that at size scales of several hundred kilometers, surface temperature gradients can provide information on the slope of isotherms in the top 200 m of the water column. This is directly relevant to the supply of nutrients into the surface mixed layer, which is useful for predicting integral biomass and primary production...|$|E

40|$|Advances in our {{knowledge}} of eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) coral reef biogeography and ecology {{during the past two}} decades are briefly reviewed. Fifteen ETP subregions are recognized, including mainland and island localities from the Gulf of California (Mexico) to Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile). Updated species lists reveal a mean increase of 4. 2 new species records per locality or an overall increase of 19. 2 % in species richness during the past decade. The largest increases occurred in tropical mainland Mexico, and in equatorial Costa Rica and Colombia, due mainly to continuing surveys of these under-studied areas. Newly discovered coral communities are also now known from the southern Nicaraguan coastline. To date 47 zooxanthellate scleractinian species have been recorded in the ETP, of which 33 also occur in the central/south Pacific, and 8 are presumed to be ETP endemics. Usually no more than 20 – 25 zooxanthellate coral species are present at any given locality, with the principal reef-building genera being Pocillopora, Porites, Pavona, and Gardineroseris. This compares with 62 – 163 species at four of the nearest central/south Pacific localities. Hydrocorals in the genus Millepora also occur in the ETP and are reviewed in the context of their global distributions. Coral community associates engaged in corallivory, bioerosion, and competition for space are noted for several localities. Reef framework construction in the ETP typically occurs at shallow depths (2 – 8 m) in sheltered habitats or at greater depths (10 – 30 m) in more exposed areas such as oceanic island settings with high water <b>column</b> <b>light</b> penetration. Generally, eastern Pacific reefs do not reach sea level with the development of drying reef flats, and instead experience brief periods of exposure during extreme low tides or drops in sea level during La Niña events. High rates of mortality during El Niño disturbances have occurred in many ETP equatorial areas, especially in Panama and the Galápagos Islands during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Remarkably, however, no loss of resident, zooxanthellate scleractinian species has occurred at these sites, and many ETP coral reefs have demonstrated significant recovery from these disturbances {{during the past two decades}}.
