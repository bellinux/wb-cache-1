Emotivity and expressiveness are claimed to be the key concepts of a new branch of linguistics called text emotivity, for they render emotions of the author into the text. The article pays specific attention to emotivity of <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse.</b> Two types of written <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse</b> are characterized in the article regarding their lexical, grammatical, stylistic and iconographic differences. It has been demonstrated that emotivity spectrum and the way it is expressed in the written <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse</b> depends on its type.

Such devices influence emotivity of the whole text, and reflect the author's pragmatic intentions as well as his or her emotions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} popularisation of {{specialised}} knowledge via TED (Technology, Entertainment, and Design) Talks. In particular, it explores the linguistic characteristics of talks dated 2010 - 2015 whose topics involve scientific knowledge. The paper aims to show, {{on the one}} hand, the popularising effects of the Internet on <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse</b> and, on the other hand, the contribution of TED to science popularisation and ESP. In particular, it focuses on three aspects of TED Talks: 1) reduced technicality in both content and vocabulary (vs. the specificity of scientific language or jargon), 2) the informal register and conversational or humorous tone (vs. the serious tone of, e. g., medical discourse concerning health risks), and 3) the preference for narrative (vs. informative, expository, or argumentative) text type. In line with popularisation Discourse Analysis, these features contribute to <b>convey</b> <b>scientific</b> knowledge to a wider audience. Hence, they qualify scientific TED Talks as a novel popularisation genre that disseminates specialised knowledge worldwide, by addressing to specialists {{as well as to}} non-expert recipients. The investigation of scientific TED Talks also shows how the Internet revolutionises specialised discourse and its relevant participants, turning one-way scientific communication into public conversations with multiple participants...|$|R

The <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse</b> was oriented towards the searching of curricular models that guarantee the correspondence between the professional formation and employment in the international framework.
