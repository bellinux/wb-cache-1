40|$|International audienceWhile {{companies}} contribute {{in different}} ways to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues they support, {{little is known about}} the effects of varying CSR contribution types on consumers’ evaluations of the contributing company. This paper examines consumer reactions to two basic contribution types – money versus in-kind – in the CSR domain of disaster relief to demonstrate, through five studies, that while consumers evaluate a company more favorably when it makes in-kind rather than monetary contributions of equivalent value to CSR issues that are perceived to be less controllable, the pattern reverses when the company’s contributions are made to CSR issues that are perceived to be more controllable. This interaction between <b>contribution</b> <b>type</b> and perceived issue controllability is more likely to manifest when controllability is accessible in the minds of consumers. The underlying process is driven by the extent to which the disparate emotionality of each <b>contribution</b> <b>type</b> matches the intensity of felt emotion evoked by CSR issues of varying perceived controllability, producing processing fluency...|$|E

In this paper, we apply systematic mapping study to classify the granular computing researches to discover relative derivations to specify its research strength and quality. Our search scope {{is limited to the}} Science Direct and IEEE Transactions papers published between January 2012 and August 2014. We defined four perspectives of classification schemes to map the selected studies that are focus area, <b>contribution</b> <b>type,</b> research type and framework. Results of mapping the selected studies show that almost half of the research focused area belongs to category of data analysis. In addition, most of the selected papers belong to proposing the solutions in research type scheme. Distribution of papers between tool, method and enhancement categories of <b>contribution</b> <b>type</b> are almost equal. Moreover, 39 % of the relevant papers belong to the rough set framework. The results show that there is little attention paid to cluster analysis in existing frameworks to discover granules for classification. We applied five clustering algorithms on three datasets from UCI repository to compare the form of information granules, and then classify the patterns and define them to a specific class based on their geometry and belongings. The clustering algorithms are DBSCAN, c-means, k-means, GAk-means and Fuzzy-GrC and the comparison of information granules are based on the coverage, misclassification and accuracy. The survey of experimental results mostly shows Fuzzy-GrC and GAk-means algorithm superior to other clustering algorithms; while, c-means clustering algorithm shows inferior to other clustering algorithms...|$|E

40|$|As {{scientific}} research and development become more collaborative, the diversity of skills and expertise involved in producing scientific data are expanding as well. Since recognition of contribution has significant academic and professional impact for participants in scientific projects, it is important to integrate attribution and acknowledgement of scientific contributions into the research and data lifecycle. However, defining and clarifying contributions and the relationship of specific individuals and organizations can be challenging, especially when balancing the needs and interests of diverse partners. Designing an implementation method for attributing scientific contributions within complex projects that can allow ease of use and integration with existing documentation formats is another crucial consideration. To provide a versatile mechanism for organizing, documenting, and storing <b>contributions</b> to different <b>types</b> of scientific projects and their related products, an attribution and acknowledgement matrix and XML schema have been created as part of the Attribution and Acknowledgement Content Framework (AACF). Leveraging the taxonomies of <b>contribution</b> roles and <b>types</b> that have been developed and published previously, the authors consolidated 16 <b>contribution</b> <b>types</b> that could be considered and used when accrediting team memberâ€™s contributions. Using these <b>contribution</b> <b>types,</b> specific information regarding the contributing organizations and individuals can be documented using the AACF. This paper provides the background and motivations for creating the current version of the AACF Matrix and Schema, followed by demonstrations of the process and the results of using the Matrix and the Schema to record the contribution information of different sample datasets. The paper concludes by highlighting the key feedback and features to be examined in order to improve the next revisions of the Matrix and the Schema. ...|$|R

The work seeks to introduce a holistic approach to examining decision making across the key stages of retirement wealth provision, namely: accumulation; conversion; and, decumulation.

This investigation led to the identification of ten core roles within the community, based on three key elements: object of interest (product, practice, and community), main <b>contribution</b> <b>type</b> (sharing information and seeking information), individual orientation (factual, emotional). We propose an explanation about how these roles, through their positioning, participate in the community dynamics and how they participate to the creation and diffusion of cookery as a social practice, shaping the periphery around this practice...|$|E

Two promising models were selected and extended with group contribution parameters to be able to predict solubility data. The first model, a modified Flory–Huggins based predictive model (termed MFH), needs only 15 general parameters to describe the data with a relative deviation of less than 3. 4 %.

In this dissertation we study the management of pension funds of the defined <b>contribution</b> <b>type</b> in the presence of inflation-recession. We study how the fund manager maximizes his fund's wealth when the salaries and stocks are affected by inflation. In this regard, we consider the case of a pension company which invests in a stock, inflation-linked bonds and a money market account, while basing its investment on the contribution of the plan member. We use a benchmarking approach and martingale methods to compute an optimal strategy which maximizes the fund wealth. South Afric...|$|E
