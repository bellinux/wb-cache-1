Now students must arrive by 8 a.m. and remain until noon, or arrive by 1 p.m. and stay until 5 p.m. Exceptions are granted for students in job programs, or who must {{take care of their}} family. To meet student needs the school has social workers, counselors, special education teachers, educational assistants, and on-the-job training.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers of {{the time}} {{reported}} that the society promoted free love, but the society promoted free love only {{in the sense that}} consenting adults had a right to change partners and even to have more than one partner at a time. Rather than promiscuousness, though, the society promoted tolerance, including tolerance of homosexuality. The Spirit Fruit Society, unlike most other communitarian groups of that time, did not seek to convert or recruit others to the group. Members were permitted to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> they pleased. The goal of the commune was not to convert or to expand membership in the society—it was simply to live as the adherents wished to live.|$|E

25|$|Society changed {{quickly after}} World War I. For example, customs, technology, and {{manufacturing}} all moved {{quickly into the}} 20th century after the interruption of the war. The rise of the automobile was {{an important factor in}} flapper culture, as cars meant a woman could <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> she pleased, travel to speakeasies and other entertainment venues, and use the large vehicles of the day for their popular activity, petting parties. Also, the economic boom allowed more people the time and money to play golf and tennis and to take vacations, which required clothing adapted to these activities; the flapper's slender silhouette was very suitable for movement.|$|E
25|$|The Shahnameh {{provides}} a poetic {{account of the}} prehistory and history of Iran, beginning {{with the creation of}} the world and the introduction of the arts of civilization (fire, cooking, metallurgy, law), and ending with the Islamic Conquest of Persia. The work is not precisely chronological, but there is a general movement through time. Some of the characters live for hundreds of years but most have normal life spans. There are many shāhs who <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> <b>as</b> well as heroes and villains, who also come and go. The only lasting images are those of Greater Persia itself, and of a succession of sunrises and sunsets, no two ever exactly alike, yet illustrative of the passage of time.|$|E

500|$|The abbey also {{provided}} elegant apartments to highborn women seeking independence from families or difficult marriages. [...] The ladies {{were free to}} <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> they liked, with constraints on the hours allowed outside the convent, often had their children and servants with them, and spent their evenings socializing and commiserating in the abbey's salons. [...] One such resident was Joséphine de Beauharnais, the future Empress of France, during her separation from her first husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais. [...] The court granted her temporary independence from her husband and required her to stay at Pentemont with her children {{at the expense of}} Alexandre. It is also speculated that James Smithson, the founder of the Smithsonian Institution, who was born in Paris the illegitimate son of the Duke of Northumberland, was born in the Pentemont Abbey, as it had strong connections to the Duke, whose illegitimate daughters it educated.|$|E
500|$|Relatively {{minor changes}} to the form and venue of an {{entertainment}} continue to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology, and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a music hall, a movie theatre, a multiplex, or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a tablet computer. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a theatre, auditorium, or stadium. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the Colosseum, [...] "dedicated AD80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators," [...] and in it audiences [...] "enjoyed [...] "blood sport with the trappings of stage shows". Spectacles, competitions, races, and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences.|$|E

Congressman Ryan traveled to Jonestown with 17 Bay Area relatives of Peoples Temple members, several newspaper reporters and an NBC TV team. When the legal counsel for Jones attempted to impose several restrictive conditions on the visit, Ryan responded that he would be traveling to Jonestown whether Jones permitted it or not. Ryan's stated position was that a [...] "settlement deep in the bush might be reasonably run on authoritarian lines". However, residents of the settlement must be allowed to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> they pleased. He further asserted that if the situation had become [...] "a gulag", he would do everything he could to [...] "free the captives".|$|E
50|$|The {{demeanour}} {{and interaction}} between the priests and worshippers reflected an air of individual focus. The priests were constantly absorbed on the prayers, chanting, and rhythm and ignored all other matters. Many other worshippers <b>came</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>as</b> the ceremony progressed and paid their respects to the three purities and the two adjoining altars {{on either side of}} the main altar, at which the ceremony was held. The worshippers made no appearance of solemnity towards the ceremony <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>as</b> they pleased, leaving incense offerings and praying. In the following of Tao, each of these worshippers had their own inner harmony and this in no way intruded on the Tao of the ceremony, or the Tao of the priests.|$|R

After Scott had considered various possible wintering spots, he chose a cape remembered from the Discovery days as the [...] "Skuary", about [...] north of Scott's 1902 base at Hut Point. Scott hoped that this location, which he renamed Cape Evans after his second-in-command, would be free of ice in the short Antarctic summer, enabling the ship to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go.</b> <b>As</b> the seas to the south froze over, the expedition would have ready access over the ice to Hut Point and the Barrier. At Cape Evans the shore parties disembarked, with the ponies, dogs, the three motorised sledges (one of which was lost during unloading), and {{the bulk of the}} party's stores.

500|$|Justice Scalia {{also criticized}} the majority's {{conclusion}} that the tip provided reasonable suspicion that Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette were driving while drunk, because [...] "the truck might have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a jaywalking pedestrian .... Or, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster off the road because of some personal animus, or hostility to her 'Make Love, Not War' bumper sticker." [...] Furthermore, Justice Scalia argued that one discrete instance of irregular driving does not give rise to the reasonable suspicion of an ongoing threat of an intoxicated driver on the road. Justice Scalia also argued that the anonymous tip's claims of reckless driving were ultimately discredited {{by the fact that}} officers followed Lorenzo and Jose for five minutes, but observed nothing suspicious. He wrote, [...] "I take it as a fundamental premise of our intoxicated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve once can be expected to swerve again — and soon. If he does not, and if the only evidence of his first episode of irregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorroborated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amendment requires that he be left alone." [...] In his concluding remarks, Justice Scalia wrote [...] "runken driving is a serious matter, but so is the loss of our freedom to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> we please without police interference .... After today’s opinion all of us on the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of having our freedom of movement curtailed on suspicion of drunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a single instance of careless driving." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{awaiting}} {{his trial}} date, Short {{was free to}} <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>as</b> he pleased. He was feeling well enough by May 21, 1891 to board a train for Chicago with Johnson. This {{was going to be}} an extensive stay, as his wife accompanied Short on the trip. The racing season was about to begin and Johnson and Short both owned a string of horses that would be running at Washington Park in Chicago. During his several visits to Chicago, Short and Hattie always stayed at the Leland Hotel. Short was accosted in the lobby of the Leland by a drunken attorney named James J. Singleton during late October 1891. According to the report, Short did not have his pistol, but managed to give Singleton a few kicks which knocked him down, and then Short picked him up, and pushed him out [...] "into the frosty night air." [...] Short then went upstairs for his gun in case Singleton decided to return. While Short was gone, an actor named William F. Hoey (1854–1897) walked into the hotel lobby. The actor turned out to resemble closely the lawyer Short had just kicked out. Short saw Hoey, thought he was Singleton, and charged at him with his pistol. A quick-thinking hotel clerk named Ed Kennedy jumped between the two men and prevented a homicide. When Short realized his mistake, he apologized to the actor and treated him to drinks and a late supper.|$|E
