40|$|Percolation {{analysis}} {{has long been}} used to quantify the connectivity of the cosmic web. Most of the previous work is based on density fields on grids. By smoothing into fields, we lose information about galaxy properties like shape or luminosity. Lack of mathematical model also limits our understanding of percolation analysis. In order to overcome these difficulties, we have studied percolation analysis based on discrete points. Using a Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm, we generate the S-bb relation, between the fractional mass of the largest connected group (S) and the FoF linking length (bb). We propose a new model, the Probability Cloud Cluster Expansion Theory (PCCET) to relate the S-bb relation with correlation functions. We show that the S-bb relation reflects {{a combination of all}} orders of correlation functions. Using N-body simulation, we find that the S-bb relation is robust against redshift distortion and incompleteness in observation. From the Bolshoi simulation, with Halo Abundance Matching (HAM), we have generated a mock galaxy <b>catalogue.</b> <b>Good</b> matching of the projected two-point correlation function with observation is confirmed. However, comparing the mock catalogue with the latest galaxy catalogue from SDSS DR 12, we have found significant differences in their S-bb relations. This indicates that the mock galaxy catalogue cannot accurately retain higher order correlation functions than the two-point correlation function, which reveals the limit of HAM method. As a new measurement, S-bb relation is applicable {{to a wide range of}} data types, fast to compute, robust against redshift distortion and incompleteness, and it contains information of all orders of correlation function.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of our {{statistical}} study of the POINT-AGAPE CNe catalogue. The first Sloan $r'$ and $i'$ analysis of the MMRD relationship in M 31 is performed using the resulting POINT-AGAPE CN <b>catalogue.</b> <b>Good</b> fits are produced to the MMRD in the two filters. However, we are unable to verify the $t_{ 15 }$ relationship for either Sloan filter. The subsequent analysis of our automated CN detection pipeline has provided us with the most thorough knowledge of the completeness of a CN survey to-date. In addition, the large field of view of the survey has permitted us to probe the outburst rate well into the galactic disk, unlike previous CCD imaging surveys. Using this analysis we are able to probe the CN distribution of M 31 and evaluate the global nova rate. Using models of the galactic surface brightness of M 31, we show that the observed CN distribution consists of a separate bulge and disk population. We also show that the M 31 bulge CN eruption rate per unit $r'$ flux is more than five times greater than that of the disk. We deduce a global M 31 CN rate of $ 65 ^{+ 16 }_{- 15 }$ year$^{- 1 }$, a value much higher than found by previous surveys. Using the global rate, we derive a M 31 bulge rate of $ 38 ^{+ 15 }_{- 12 }$ year$^{- 1 }$ and a disk rate of $ 27 ^{+ 19 }_{- 15 }$ year$^{- 1 }$. Given our understanding of the completeness and an analysis of other sources of error, we conclude that the true global nova rate of M 31 is at least 50 % higher than was previously thought and this has consequent implications for the presumed CN rate in the Milky Way. We deduce a Galactic bulge rate of $ 14 ^{+ 6 }_{- 5 }$ year$^{- 1 }$, a disk rate of $ 20 ^{+ 14 }_{- 11 }$ year$^{- 1 }$ and a global Galactic rate of $ 34 ^{+ 15 }_{- 12 }$ year$^{- 1 }$.

In this thesis, a survey of the literature is made to establish a set of characteristics for object orientation in general. This set of characteristics is then applied to the educational setting of introducing novices to object oriented problem solving and programming, resulting in a number of heuristics for educational purposes, called He[d]uristics.

This region, at galactic latitudes from ~ 17 deg to ~ 37 deg, has poor coverage in modern CCD-based surveys. The observations are performed with the Wise Observatory one-meter reflector and with a new mosaic CCD camera (LAIWO) that images in the Johnson-Cousins R and I bands a one-square-degree field with subarcsec pixels. The images are treated using IRAF and SExtractor to produce a final catalogue of sources.

Case-Hamburg OB star surveys and their extension (LS, LSS, and LSE catalogues) and IRAS (point source) <b>catalogues</b> are <b>good</b> sources for detecting new hot post-AGB candidates from low resolution spectroscopy.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work {{is to determine the}} cluster members of 1876 open clusters, using positions and proper motions of the astrometric catalogue UCAC 4. For this purpose we apply three different methods, all them based on a Bayesian approach, but with different formulations: a purely parametric method, another completely non-parametric algorithm, and a third, recently developed by Sampedro & Alfaro, using both formulations at different steps of the whole process. The first and second statistical moments of the members phase-space subspace, obtained after applying the three methods, are compared for every cluster. Although, on average, the three methods yield similar results, specific differences between them, as well as for some particular clusters, are also present. The comparison with other published <b>catalogues</b> shows <b>good</b> agreement. We have also estimated {{for the first time the}} mean proper motion for a sample of 18 clusters.

This agreement refutes the claim by Kashti (2009) that the KKKST catalogue is not suited for studies of UHECR anisotropy due to its dependence on photometric redshift estimates. In order to quantify the effect of galaxy catalogues on flux predictions, we develop a measure of anisotropies associated with model flux maps.
