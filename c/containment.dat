The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary <b>containment</b> (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary <b>containment</b> (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The {{investigation found}} secondary and tertiary <b>containment</b> to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the <b>containment</b> building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of <b>containment</b> inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E
5000|$|Advanced containments; {{the present}} models of BWR <b>containments</b> for the ABWR and the ESBWR are harkbacks to the {{classical}} Mark I/II style of being quite distinct from the PWR on the outside {{as well as the}} inside, though both reactors incorporate the Mark III-ish style of having non-safety-related buildings surrounding or attached to the reactor building, rather than being overtly distinct from it. These <b>containments</b> are also designed to take far more stress than previous <b>containments</b> were, providing advanced safety. In particular, GE regards these <b>containments</b> as being able to withstand a direct hit by a tornado beyond Level 5 on the Old Fujita Scale with winds of 330+ miles per hour. Such a tornado has never been measured on earth. They are also designed to withstand seismic accelerations of [...]2 G, or nearly 2 meters per second2 in any direction.|$|R

Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political <b>containment,</b> his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global <b>containment.</b>|$|E

40|$|Changing world {{conditions}} and changing technologies suggest that serious consideration {{should be given}} to siting of nuclear power plants underground. Underground siting is not a new concept. Multiple research reactors, several weapons production reactors, and one power reactor have been built underground. What is new are the technologies and incentives that may now make underground siting a preferred option. The {{conditions and}} technologies, along with their implications, are discussed herein. Underground <b>containments</b> can be constructed in mined cavities or pits that are then backfilled with thick layers of rock and soil. Conventional above-ground <b>containments</b> resist assaults and accidents because of the strength of their construction materials and the effectiveness of their safety features that are engineered to reduce loads. However, underground <b>containments</b> can provide even more resistance to assaults and accidents because of the inertia of the mass of materials over the reactor. High-technology weapons or some internal accidents can cause existing strong-material <b>containments</b> to fail, but only very-high energy releases can move large inertial masses associated with underground <b>containments.</b> New methods of isolation may provide a higher confidence in isolation that is independent of operator action...|$|R

According to a Forest Service Spokesman, the final 7% of the perimeter was in extremely rough terrain that was close to impossible for hand crews or bulldozers to reach. Due {{to the difficulty of}} access the fire remained only 96% contained on July 9 and the estimated <b>containment</b> date was pushed back to July 21. Due to favorable conditions, on July 12, the Sherpa fire was 100% contained ahead of schedule. Because of the threat of flare ups within the burn area, patrols continued for several days.|$|E
5|$|This {{exothermic}} reaction is very slow below 100°C, but at temperature above 900°C {{the reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the <b>containment</b> building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations {{and at least one}} of the <b>containment</b> buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor (PWR) <b>containment</b> buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises.|$|E
