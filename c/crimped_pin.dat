50|$|Speaker wire {{terminations}} {{facilitate the}} connection of speaker wire to both amplifiers and loudspeakers. Examples of termination include soldered or <b>crimped</b> <b>pin</b> or spade lugs, banana plugs, and 2-pin DIN connectors. The type of termination {{is determined by the}} connectors on the equipment {{at each end of the}} wire. Some terminations are gold plated.|$|E
5000|$|Crimp {{contacts}} are {{assembled by}} inserting a stripped wire end into a cavity {{in the rear}} of the contact, then crushing the cavity using a crimp tool, causing the cavity to grip the wire tightly at many points. The crimped contact is then inserted into the connector where it locks into place. Individual <b>crimped</b> <b>pins</b> can be removed later by inserting a special tool into the rear of the connector.|$|R
50|$|The cap {{at the end}} of a cane or {{umbrella}} as well as the ring, often <b>crimped,</b> sometimes <b>pinned,</b> {{that prevents}} an umbrella's canopy from sliding off the end when open.|$|R
50|$|Within a {{cathodic}} protection system {{there are a}} multitude of connection requirements for anode cables, measuring posts etc., being extremely versatile, the pin brazing system is ideally suited to this. Attachments can be made vertically, horizontally or even overhead. If preferred, threaded pins with nuts can be attached or cable bonded directly onto the pipe {{by means of a}} special cable lug which can be crimped on site or supplied complete as a unique integrally <b>crimped</b> attachment. The <b>pin</b> brazing unit contains all the equipment and tools required to make safe cable connections. A welding generator may also be utilized as a power source wherever a battery unit may be impractical or a great many connections need to be made in such places as pipe-coating yards or lay-barges etc.|$|R
