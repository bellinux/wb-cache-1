Median levels of PCBs in precipitation differed one order of magnitude between stations. When analyzing all data together to obtain regional trends, concentrations of PCBs in precipitation decreased with increasing temperature. This relationship was the same for all stations but differed in the magnitude of the slope for individual <b>congeners.</b> Low chlorinated PCB <b>congeners</b> showed steeper slopes for the temperature relationship than did high chlorinated <b>congeners,</b> a result explained by high atmospheric concentrations of the low chlorinated <b>congeners</b> during low temperatures. Annual wash out ratios were between 31 and 72 x 103 and tended to be higher for the high chlorinated <b>congeners.</b> Wash out ratios decreased with increasing temperature for all <b>congeners</b> except PCB- 33. At snow scavenging events, the wash out ratio of PCBs increased with a factor of 2. Latitudinal trends for PCB concentrations in precipitation and deposition were generally not statistically significant. The calculated yearly deposition of PCBs to the Baltic Sea was 390 and 5 - 18 kg for individual <b>congeners,</b> with PCB- 138 having the highest flux.

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as {{environmental}} contaminants often cannot be adequately described {{by reference to}} Aroclors or to total PCBs. Although there are 209 possible PCB configurations (<b>congeners),</b> perhaps half that number account for {{nearly all of the}} environmental contamination attributable to PCBs. Still fewer <b>congeners</b> are both prevalent and either demonstrably or potentially toxic. If potential toxicity, environmental prevalence, and relative abundance in animal tissues are used as criteria, the number of environmentally threatening PCB <b>congeners</b> reduces to about thirty-six. Twenty-five of these account for 50 to 75 % of total PCBs in tissue samples of fish, invertebrates, birds, and mammals. A few PCB <b>congeners</b> that are sterically similar to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD) are directly toxic. Other PCB <b>congeners,</b> as well as those that are directly toxic, may also be involved in toxicity indirectly by stimulating the production of (inducing) bioactivating enzyme systems. The most consequential of these have the ability to induce aryl hydrocarbon metabolizing mixed-function oxidases (MFOs). A result can be an increased capacity for bioactivation of otherwise nontoxic foreign compounds such as certain polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) to cytotoxic or genotoxic metabolites. The effectiveness of specific PCB <b>congeners</b> as inducers of different types of cytochrome P- 450 -dependent MFO systems is determined by their stereochemistry. Although MFO induction is not a proximate cause, it is a strong correlate of certain kinds of toxicities. Structural patterns can thus be used to discriminate among PCB <b>congeners</b> on the basis of toxic potential, if not entirely on toxicity per se. <b>Congeners</b> that demonstrate 3 -methylcholanthrene-type (3 -MC-type) and mixed-type MFO induction have the greatest toxic potential. These <b>congeners</b> most closely resemble 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD in their structures and in their toxic effects. The larger group of phenobarbital-type (PB-type) inducers have considerably less potential for contributing to toxic effects. Weak inducers and noninducing <b>congeners</b> have the least potential for toxicity. Using the rationale described in this paper, we assigned the most evironmentally threatening PCB <b>congeners</b> to four groups. <b>Congeners</b> assigned to Group 1 are considered most likely to contribute to adverse biological effects attributable to PCBs in an environmental sample. Group 1 A contains the three most potent (pure 3 -MC-type inducer) <b>congeners,</b> IUPAC numbers 77, 126, and 169.

The PCB profiles of the different compartments of transfer consisted mainly of <b>congeners</b> 153, 138, 180, 187, 170 and 101, which made up 85 % of the total PCB burden.

During the whole process, bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of PCBs ranged from 1180 to 15670. For most PCB <b>congeners,</b> the highest and lowest bioconcentrations of the kinetic curves were found to be remarkably simultaneous, respectively. All 141 PCB <b>congeners</b> under the same experimental conditions had no linear correlation on the 1 gBCF versus 1 gK(ow) relationship.
