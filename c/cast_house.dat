40|$|Primary {{aluminum}} production {{brings about}} severe environmental burden {{due to its}} energy intensive process.   Secondary aluminum production contributes to cutting off high energy demand around 90 - 95 % and greenhouse gas emission by remelting scraps. However, previous research indicates melting furnace’s energy efficiency in secondary plant is still very low, which is around 26 - 29 % and more than 70 % heat is lost in different way. The objective of this project is to investigate energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in secondary aluminum <b>cast</b> <b>house</b> through process analysis. The result offers a comprehensive overview to aid decision-maker to compare energy consumption and environmental impacts caused by different product or process. This project {{has been done in}} collaboration with SAPA Heat Transfer. This project consists of two tasks. First task is aimed to give an overview of annual energy distribution and carbon footprint of per ton aluminum slab in SAPA <b>cast</b> <b>house.</b> In order to analyze energy distribution, mass and energy conservation has been applied for calculation. Meanwhile, International standard method, life cycle assessment, has been used to evaluate greenhouse gas contribution of the whole production process. The second task intends to investigate two effects (melting furnace type, raw material type) on products’ energy consumption and carbon footprint.  Melting furnace’s effect is compared by selecting electric induction furnace and oxy-fuel furnace. On the other hand, raw material’s effect is studied by comparison of four different <b>cast</b> <b>house</b> products which have different raw material recipe. Calculation and analysis results indicates that per ton Sapa <b>cast</b> <b>house</b> aluminum slab consumes energy 3826 MJ and contributes to 306 kgCO 2 eq. green house gas. Meanwhile, comparison results show that oxy-fuel melting furnace has higher energy efficiency than electric induction furnace, however, it contributes much more GHG due to consumption of propane fuel. In addition, primary ingot has been concluded as distinct carbon footprint contribution than others contributors (i. e. fuel) for Sapa cast house’s slab...|$|E
40|$|Hot tear {{susceptibility}} in VDC casting {{is strongly}} {{affected by the}} chemical additions of alloys, hardeners and grain refiners. This paper assesses a few different approaches to reducing hot tearing in the <b>cast</b> <b>house.</b> Grain refinement is one commonly used approach, including dosing at cast start. Another technique is to control the alloy content, through the additions of Si, Mg, Mn or Fe which can influence the type and amount of intermetallics present during {{the final stages of}} solidification when hot tearing occurs. This paper summarizes experimental findings which assess the influence of additions on a hot tear rating, particularly in 6 xxx series alloys. Strategies which could be used in the <b>cast</b> <b>house</b> are discussed. While changes to the bulk metal can have consequences for alloy specification and quality control, additions at cast start could be used to reduce scrap from hot tearing without changing the composition of the saleable product...|$|E
