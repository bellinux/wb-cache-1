However, a year later Percy Alden of the Labour Party unseated him. He regained the seat a year later, with a majority of 1,501 votes. At the next election in 1929, an increase in the Labour vote saw Malone lose the seat to Frederick Messer in a four-cornered contest, with Liberal and Communist candidates also taking part.|$|E
40|$|The impact {{response}} of a varying fly ash bearing epoxy system was studied. It is observed {{that with the}} increase in filler volume fraction there is a net reduction in the impact strength, fracture area and time to maximum load. The Ductility Index of the system, on the other hand, shows an increase with filler level. From visual observations on the failed samples, analyses of the crack length, shift of crack and point at which the slope of the crack reaches 45 degrees are made. The work clearly shows that a curvilinear path for the crack gives place to straighter ones as the ash content in the matrix increases. Consequently, the crack shift also gets reduced when filler particles are introduced in larger quantities into the resinous system. The SEM pictures unambiguously demonstrate how the initiation, propagation and termination regions have distinct appearances whose features vary with ash content, thereby demonstrating that ash particles do influence the crack at all stages, viz., from its development to final rupture of the test <b>coupon</b> <b>due</b> to impact.

40|$|MATERIAUX:SURFACES+FMOIn {{the context}} of {{hydrogen}} risk mitigation in nuclear power plants (NPPs), experimental studies of a possible poisoning of Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PARS) by fission products (FPs) and aerosols released during a core meltdown accident were mainly conducted in the past with non-radioactive fission product surrogates (e. g., in the H 2 PAR facility at Cadarache, France). The decision was taken in 1997 to complete these studies by a test in the Phebus facility, a research nuclear reactor also at Cadarache: {{it was a rare}} opportunity to expose catalyst samples to an atmosphere as representative as possible of a core meltdown accident, containing gaseous fission products and aerosols released during the degradation of an actual irradiated nuclear fuel bundle. Before testing in Phebus during the FPT 3 experiment, reference and qualification tests were performed in the H 2 PAR facility using the same samples the so-called "coupons" and coupons holder to check that the apparatus was functional and correctly designed for avoiding to tamper with the thermal-hydraulics and chemical conditions in the Phebus containment. The correct operation of catalysts was checked by measuring the surface temperature increase of the <b>coupons</b> <b>due</b> to the exothermic reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. After the Phebus FPT 3 test (November 2004), REKO- 1 tests were initiated at Julich, Germany, to confirm the discrepancy in coupons temperature observed in Phebus FFT 3 and H 2 PAR PHEB- 03 tests, and to study the operation behaviour of PARs. Besides, before REKO- 1 tests, a first interpretation of H 2 PAR and Phebus experiments was led to the conclusion that their difference during the operation was due to the different experimental conditions. Samples of catalysts (IRSN/IRCELYON coupon) similar to those used in Phebus and H 2 PAR facilities were exposed in REKO- 1 facility to an atmosphere {{similar to that of the}} Phebus model containment. During the REKO- 1 experiments, the temperatures of the coupon surface, together with the oxygen and hydrogen recombination kinetics, were measured as a function of the oxygen fraction in the feed. In these conditions, the inlet oxygen fraction was shown to be the main parameter affecting the recombination rate. The presence of steam was also taken into account during the IRSN/IRCELYON coupon operation in REKO- 1. Finally, the PAR surface temperatures during the REKO- 1 tests (both optical and thermocouple measurements) are compared with those obtained during the FPT 3 and PHEB- 03 tests. Then, the experimental observations (from the Phebus FFT 3, H 2 PAR PHEB 03 and REKO- 1 tests) were corroborated by numerical calculations using the SPARK code developed at IRSN for catalytic reactors and recombiners applications. Despite the loss of performance experienced by the coupons in the FPT 3 test, as compared with the PHEB- 03 test, this study does not challenge the qualification of PARs for risk mitigation in Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) NPPs, and suggests that they could still be efficient in the rich burn conditions of partially inerted (oxygen depleted) Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) containments.

40|$|The main {{goals of}} the present study was to {{ascertain}} the role of surface preconditioning in the biofilm sanitation (removal and disinfection) ability of the cationic surfactant benzalkonium chloride (BC) and to investigated whether BC preconditioning can be a factor of the increased resistance of the Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms to the surfactant. Prior to biofilm formation, coupons of two distinct materials (stainless steel and silicone rubber) currently used on medical and industrial processing facilities were exposed to several sub-effective concentrations of BC for 30 min. Afterwards, these conditioned coupons were used as the surfaces to form biofilms in a chemostat for 6 days. The antimicrobial action of BC on the biofilms was assessed by means of respiratory activity, due to oxygen consumption, and biofilm mass. The results showed that BC preconditioning, by itself, did not prevent or impair biofilm formation. In general, the mass and respiratory activity of the biofilms developed on the conditioned coupons increased with the increase of the BC concentration used in the preconditioning. The data related with BC application to the bacterial biofilms formed on the conditioned metal and rubber coupons showed that biofilms became more difficult to inactivate, especially those that have been developed in the coupons preconditioned with the higher BC concentrations. Thus, it can be concluded that the antimicrobial ability of BC was considerably disturbed when the surfaces are preconditioned with the surfactant. Based merely on this data, it can be speculated that, in the initial adhesion stage, the contact of the P. fluorescens with the BC residues adsorbed on the <b>coupons</b> surface, <b>due</b> to preconditioning, induces bacteria resistance when they are entrapped in a developed biofilm and submitted to BC aggression.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringThe {{orthotropic}} {{nature of}} composites provides excellent {{performance in the}} fiber direction, but it is susceptible to failure in the orthogonal direction. Failure due to the delamination is limited to composites, and has an adverse consequence on its mechanical properties. The interlaminar tensile (ILT) strength of a composite part is compromised by delamination failure caused mainly by the applied loads and environmental factors. This phenomenon creates a challenge in design and manufacturing of composite parts for the aerospace industry. This study is focused on improving the ILT strength of a curved composite laminate by suppressing failure modes associated with free edge effects and to evaluate the ILT strength of a curved section with various porosities. Composite panels were built on an angle bend tool using the fiber reinforced carbon/epoxy tape pre-pregs. The manufactured panels were machined using a water jet to produce test coupons as required by ASTM 6415. The curved sections of the test coupons were reinforced with metal clamps manufactured from aluminum 7075 -O alloy and another pre-preg material (glass fiber reinforced pre-preg). The observed ILT strength of the reinforced coupons {{was found to be}} much higher than the baseline because the reinforcement reduces the effects of the stresses induced by the free edge of the composite specimen. There was a 25 % increase in the interlaminar tensile strength for the coupons reinforced by the metal clamps and a 21 % increase in strength for the coupons reinforced with the glass pre-preg material. We also observed that with various percentages of porosity, the ILT strength varied significantly, which needs to be addressed in the future studies. The failure of the <b>coupons</b> occurred <b>due</b> to the delaminations caused by the interlaminar stresses under the applied loads. This study may open up new possibilities to reinforce the various fiber reinforced composites used in many manufacturing industries in the field...|$|R
40|$|Biofilms {{comprise}} {{an assembly}} of microbial communities {{attached to a}} surface and enclosed in a polysaccharide matrix. Biofilms are a problem in dairy manufacturing plants where they cause biofouling of the stainless steel surface, resulting in product contamination {{and the need to}} shorten manufacturing runs for frequent cleaning. The equipment has to be thoroughly cleaned at regular intervals to remove biofilms. Clean-In-Place (CIP) procedures used in dairy manufacturing plants are not effective enough to remove all the biofilm cells as the extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), an integral part of a biofilm, reduces the penetration of cleaning agents. One possible alternative method to control biofilm growth involves surface modification of the stainless steel by implanting silver ions to prevent the attachment of viable bacteria that would otherwise form biofilms. Stainless steel coupons, implanted with 1 × 1016 silver ions per cm 2, and control stainless steel coupons were tested for the attachment of Streptococcus thermophilus and Pseudomonas fluorescens in various media for up to 30 minutes. Biofilm formation and EPS production for up to 24 hours was studied on the silver-implanted and control coupons in whole milk, skimmed milk and whey. It was found that there was higher attachment (0. 49 and 0. 18 log CFU per cm 2 of S. thermophilus and P. fluorescens, respectively) on the stainless steel coupons than on the silver-implanted coupons in saline. In the presence of milk and whey, the difference in the attachment of bacteria on the two coupons reduced. Biofilm studies showed that the number of bacteria colonising both types of coupons was not statistically significantly different (P > 0. 05). While the Live/Dead® BacLight™ Bacterial Viability stain showed that there were a few dead cells on the silver-implanted surfaces, scanning electron micrographs showed that the bacteria attached to a conditioning layer formed by the milk and whey proteins. Furthermore, both bacteria produced EPS, which, along with the conditioning film, might have masked the effect of silver ions from bacteria, resulting in similar numbers of bacteria present on the test and control <b>coupons.</b> Thus, <b>due</b> to the shielding effect of EPS and the conditioning film, the silver-implanted surfaces may be of limited practical value in the dairy industry...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies of}} sewer {{corrosion}} are performed in accelerated {{conditions that are}} not representing the actual corrosion processes. This study investigated the effects of various factors over 3. 5 years under controlled conditions simulating the sewer environment. Concrete coupons prepared from precorroded sewers were exposed, both in the gas phase and partially submerged in wastewater, in laboratory controlled corrosion chambers. Over the 45 month exposure period, three environmental factors of H 2 S concentration, relative humidity and air temperature were controlled at different levels in the corrosion chambers. A total of 36 exposure conditions were investigated to determine the long term effects of these factors by regular retrieval of concrete coupons for detailed analysis of surface pH, corrosion layer sulfate levels and concrete loss. Corrosion rates were also determined for different exposure periods. It {{was found that the}} corrosion rate of both gas-phase and partially-submerged coupons was positively correlated with the H 2 S concentration in the gas phase. Relative humidity played also a role for the corrosion activity of the gas-phase coupons. However, the partially-submerged coupons were not affected by humidity as the surfaces of these <b>coupons</b> were saturated <b>due</b> to capillary suction of sewage on the coupon surface. The effect of temperature on corrosion activity varied and possibly the acclimation of corrosion-inducing microbes to temperature mitigated effects of that factor. It was apparent that biological sulfide oxidation was not the limiting step of the overall corrosion process. These findings provide real insights into the long-term effects of these key environmental factors on the sewer corrosion processes...|$|R

The metal coupons, Brass, Titanium and Brass were exposed {{for a period}} of six months (October 2005 to March 2006). The PVC and SS were suspended in the sea for two months (February and March 2006). Sea water samples were also collected from the study area using water sampler to estimate the physiochemical and nutrients were analyzed. The population of HB and MHB on PVC was registered as 3. 62 x 107 CFU/cm 2 and 2. 87 x 107 CFU/cm 2, respectively while on Stainless Steel the population density of HB and MHB was recorded as 3. 79 x 105 CFU/cm 2 and 1. 34 x 105 CFU/cm 2. The PVC and titanium coupons were recorded relatively higher values comparing with other coupons, and it {{may be due to the}} non-toxic nature of the substratum. Brass also recorded higher bacterial population density compared to copper. The least population density observed in copper <b>coupons</b> could be <b>due</b> to it toxic nature. The generic composition of heterotrophic bacterial strains isolated from biofilm samples, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative groups were noted on all the materials studied. The notable thing was that Gram-positive group was fond to be dominant.

40|$|Microbially-influenced {{corrosion}} (MIC) {{contributes to}} the general corrosion rate (CR), which is typically measured with carbon steel coupons. Here we explore the use of carbon steel ball bearings, referred to as beads (55. 0 ± 0. 3 mg; Ø = 0. 238 cm), for determining CRs. CRs for samples from an oil field in Oceania incubated with beads were determined by the weight loss method, using acid treatment to remove corrosion products. The release of ferrous and ferric iron was also measured and CRs based on weight loss and iron determination were in good agreement. Average CRs were 0. 022 mm/yr for 8 produced waters with high numbers (105 /ml) of acid-producing bacteria (APB), but no sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Average CRs were 0. 009 mm/yr for 5 central processing facility (CPF) waters, which had no APB or SRB due to weekly biocide treatment and 0. 036 mm/yr for 2 CPF tank bottom sludges, which had high numbers of APB (106 /ml) and SRB (108 /ml). Hence, corrosion monitoring with carbon steel beads indicated that biocide treatment of CPF waters decreased the CR, except where biocide did not penetrate. The CR for incubations with 20 ml of a produced water decreased from 0. 061 to 0. 007 mm/yr when {{increasing the number of}} beads from 1 to 40. CRs determined with beads were higher than those with <b>coupons,</b> possibly also <b>due</b> to a higher weight of iron per unit volume used in incubations with coupons. Use of 1 ml syringe columns, containing carbon steel beads and injected with 10 ml/day of SRB-containing medium for 256 days gave a CR of 0. 11 mm/yr under flow conditions. The standard deviation of the distribution of residual bead weights, a measure for the unevenness of the corrosion, increased with increasing CR. The most heavily corroded beads showed significant pitting. Hence the use of uniformly sized carbon steel beads offers new opportunities for screening and monitoring of corrosion including determination of the distribution of corrosion rates, which allows estimation of the probability of high rate events that may lead to failure...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the study}} of Koselka (1990), in the United States, nearly 100 billion dollars of coupon was issued through {{newspaper}} in 1989. From Hume (1993), In 1992, coupon, total value up to 350 billion, was distributed by the manufacturer in the United States. From Brown (2001), consumers obtained 248 billion dollars of issued coupon in 2000. Total 4. 5 billion value of that was redeemed and the amount of 3. 6 billion dollars was saved by these coupons. According to these studies, it shows that use of coupons have been affecting our daily life. Moreover, reducing price has been evolved into a significant strategy in marketing discount, which further stimulating the desire of the use of coupon (Monroe, 2003). Blattberg & Neslin (1990) also propose that coupon plays an important role on price promotion and product purchasing. The impact of coupon on consumer purchasing power is definitely an important issue which needs a lot research effort. Several different opinions have been proposed regarding whether a product retail price should be adjusted when coupons are issued. According to the theory of targeted couponing, while coupons issued for a product, manufacturer should raise the retail price of the product to obtain the benefit of price discrimination among different buyers. A seller price can be distinguished because the market can be classified as different categories of consumers by transaction cost and the price that buyer is willing to pay (Hal Varian, 1980; Narasimhan, 1984; Gerstner & Holthausen, 1986). The study of Petrakis & Organ (1996) proposes the idea that the intensity of the competition between companies will be increased by issuing <b>coupons.</b> However, <b>due</b> to price discrimination and oligopolistic competition, the price and profit of products would both decrease. Anderson & Song (2004) propose that along with issuing coupons, lowering product price is an attractive strategy to attract customers. This strategy may make higher profit comparing with that of raising the price, especially considering the redemption cost of customers. In this study, we not only improve the model of Anderson & Song, but also further explore the corresponding change of profit, product price and consumer population following coupon issued for products. Several important points are introduced from our study. 1). While a company issues coupons via direct channel, the price of the products will increase. 2). As the redemption cost increasing, the possible optimized strategy is to raise coupon value and therefore increase the population of consumers who redeem coupons. 3). By issuing coupons via indirect channel, the product price may be decreased as the redemption cost and the price that consumer is willing to pay are moderate. This argument is true for the cases of retailer and manufacturer issuing coupons. 4). With regard of issuing coupon, retailer has lower wholesale price than manufacturer. 根據Koselka (1990) 研究調查發現 1989 年將近有價值一千億的折價券，在美國透過報紙發送給消費者； 1992 年美國境內製造商配銷總額價值達三千五百億的折價券 (Hume, 1993) ， 2000 年有 2480 億的折價券配銷出去，有 45 億折價券被兌換，在金額上的節省達到 36 億元 (Brown, 2001) ，由這些資料可看出折價券的影響在人們日常生活中是很鉅大的。 由於透過價格促銷給予折扣已經在市場中變成很重要的一部分，因此人們越來越常使用折價券 (Monroe, 2003) ，所以折價券對人們生活衝擊越來越大，折價券在價格促銷和產品購買上扮演很重要的角色 (Blattberg & Neslin, 1990) 。 對於發行折價券時，產品零售價格是否該有所變動，學者看法很多元，根據theories of targeted couponing： 當發行折價券時，廠商應該提高產品的零售定價,藉此來達到在高、低價消費者之間進行差別取價， 而之所以可以進行差別取價的動作，是因為市場可以根據消費者的異質性來區分，例如願付價格以及交易成本來劃分 (Hal Varian, 1980; Narasimhan, 1984; Gerstner & Holthausen, 1986) 。此外，Petrakis & Organ (1996) 研究發現，廠商發行折價券時會增加廠商間競爭的強度，由於差別取價以及寡占性競爭的結果，使得廠商的產品定價降低，廠商利潤也因此會比較低，最後得利的是消費者。Anderson & Song (2004) ，提出發行折價券時，零售價格有可能降低也是不錯的選擇,尤其是考慮到消費者都有贖回成本 (redemption cost) ，可以吸收到更多的顧客群，甚至利潤會比提高價格時還來得更大。因此本研究修正Anderson & Song之模型之外，且探討發行折價券時，產品定價的變化以及消費者數量之改變及利潤的多寡。 本研究發現 1). 當在直接通路下的廠商發行折價券，產品定價是提高的； 2). 隨著消費者贖回成本增加，廠商之最適策略為提高折價券面額進而增加使用折價券之消費者數量； 3). 在間接通路時，不管是零售商或製造商發折價券，當贖回成本適中、消費者願付價格適中，產品定價都有可能降價； 4). 相較於製造商發折價券，零售商發折價券時的批發價會比較低。目錄 中文摘要	i SUMMARY	ii 表目錄	v 圖目錄	vi 第壹章 緒論	 1 第一節 研究背景與動機	 1 第二節 研究目的	 3 第三節 研究問題	 3 第貳章 文獻探討	 4 第一節 折價券定義及影響	 4 第二節 折價券的類型	 5 第三節 折價券的功用及效果	 7 第四節 兌現對折價券的影響及該注重的市場區隔	 8 第五節 折價券面額之重要性	 10 第六節 折價券進行差別取價的議題探討	 11 第參章 直接通路	 13 第一節 模型設定與假設	 13 第二節 模型分析	 14 第肆章 間接通路	 22 第一節 模型設定與假設	 22 第二節 模型分析	 22 第伍章 結論與建議	 43 第一節 研究結論與發現	 43 第二節 研究貢獻	 43 第三節 管理上之應用與建議	 45 第四節 研究限制與未來研究方向	 46 參考文獻	 48 附錄	 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{activity}} {{was to provide a}} bounding estimate of the volume of hydrogen gas generated during Enhanced Chemical Cleaning (ECC) of residual sludge remaining in a Type I or Type II treatment tank as well as to provide results independent of the sludge volume in the waste tank to be cleaned. Previous testing to support Chemical Cleaning was based on a 20 : 1 oxalic acid to sludge ratio. Hydrogen gas evolution is the primary safety concern. Sealed vessel coupon tests were performed to estimate the hydrogen generation rate due to corrosion of carbon steel by 2. 5 wt. % oxalic acid. These tests determined the maximum instantaneous hydrogen generation rate, {{the rate at which the}} generation rate decays, and the total hydrogen generated. These values were quantified based on a small scale methodology similar to the one described in WSRC-STI- 2007 - 00209, Rev. 0. The measured rates support identified Safety Class functions. The tests were performed with ASTM A 285 Grade C carbon steel coupons. Bounding conditions were determined for the solution environment. The oxalic acid concentration was 2. 5 wt. % and the test temperature was 75 C. The test solution was agitated and contained no sludge simulant. Duplicate tests were performed and showed excellent reproducibility for the hydrogen generation rate and total hydrogen generated. The results showed that the hydrogen generation rate was initially high, but decayed rapidly within a couple of days. A statistical model was developed to predict the instantaneous hydrogen generation rate as a function of exposure time by combining both sets of data. An upper bound on the maximum hydrogen generation rate was determined from the upper 95 % confidence limit. The upper bound confidence limit for the hydrogen generation rate is represented by the following equation. ln (G{sub v}) = - 8. 22 - 0. 0584 t + 0. 0002 t{sup 2 }. This equation should be utilized to estimate the instantaneous hydrogen generation rate per unit surface area, G{sub v}, at a given time, t. The units for G{sub v} and t are ft{sup 3 }/ft{sup 2 }/min and hours, respectively. The total volume of hydrogen gas generated during the test was calculated from the model equation. An upper bound on the total gas generated was determined from the upper 95 % confidence limit. The upper bound limit on the total hydrogen generated during the 163 hour test was 0. 332 ft{sup 3 }/ft{sup 2 }. The maximum instantaneous hydrogen generation rate for this scenario is greater than that previously measured in the 8 wt. % oxalic acid tests due to both the absence of sludge in the test (i. e., greater than 20 : 1 ratio of acid to sludge) and the use of polished coupons (vs. mill scale <b>coupons).</b> However, <b>due</b> to passivation of the carbon steel surface, the corrosion rate decays by an order of magnitude within the first three days of exposure such that the instantaneous hydrogen generation rates are less than that previously measure in the 8 wt. % oxalic acid tests. While the results of these tests are bounding, the conditions used in this study may not be representative of the ECC flowsheet, and the applicability of these results to the flowsheet should be evaluated for the following reasons: (1) The absence of sludge results in higher instantaneous hydrogen generation rates than when the sludge is present; and (2) Polished coupons do not represent the condition of the carbon steel interior of the tank, which are covered with mill scale. Based on lower instantaneous corrosion rates measured on mill scale coupons exposed to oxalic acid, lower instantaneous hydrogen generation rates are expected for the tank interior than measured on the polished coupons. Corrosion rates were determined from the coupon tests and also calculated from the measured hydrogen generation rates. Excellent agreement was achieved between the time averaged corrosion rate calculated from the hydrogen generation rates and the corrosion rates determined from the coupon tests. The corrosion rates were on the order of 18 to 28 mpy. Good agreement was also observed between the maximum instantaneous corrosion rate as calculated from the hydrogen generation rate and the corrosion rate determined by previous electrochemical tests...|$|R
40|$|A {{corrosion}} study involving high-alloy {{materials and}} concentrated hydrofluoric acid (HF) {{was conducted in}} support of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment Conversion Project (CP). The purpose of the test was to obtain a greater understanding of the corrosion rates of materials of construction currently used in the CP vs those of proposed replacement parts. Results of the study will help formulate a change-out schedule for CP parts. The CP will convert slightly less than 40 kg of {sup 233 }U from a gas (UF{sub 6 }) sorbed on sodium fluoride pellets to a more stable oxide (U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 }). One by-product of the conversion is the formation of concentrated HF. Six moles of highly corrosive HF are produced for each mole of UF{sub 6 } converted. This acid is particularly corrosive to most metals, elastomers, and silica-containing materials. A common impurity found in {sup 233 }U is {sup 232 }U. This impurity isotope has several daughters that make the handling of the {sup 233 }U difficult. Traps of {sup 233 }U may have radiation fields of up to 400 R at contact, a situation that makes the process of changing valves or working on the CP more challenging. It is also for this reason that a comprehensive part change-out schedule must be established. Laboratory experiments involving the repeated transfer of HF through 1 / 2 -in. metal tubing and valves have proven difficult due to the corrosivity of the HF upon contact with all wetted parts. Each batch of HF is approximately 1. 5 L of 33 wt% HF and is transferred most often as a vapor under vacuum and at temperatures of up to 250 C. Materials used in the HF side of the CP include Hastelloy C- 276 and Monel 400 tubing, Haynes 230 and alloy C- 276 vessels, and alloy 400 valve bodies with Inconel (alloy 600) bellows. The chemical compositions of the metals discussed in this report are displayed in Table 1. Of particular concern are the almost 30 vendor-supplied UG valves that have the potential for exposure to HF. These valves have been proven to have a finite life due to failure, most often at the bellows flange ring. It was discovered that the entire bellows assembly was not all alloy 600 but that alloy 600 bellows had been welded to a stainless steel alloy 316 (SS- 316) flange ring. A previous study documents and addresses this problem. 1 The fabricators of the valves immediately corrected the problem and began fabricating all wetted parts of the bellows assembly from alloy 600. At the same time, the fabricators began to make alloy C- 276 valve bodies and stem tips available for sale. This material is known to be superior to the alloy 400 valve bodies and stem tips of the standard UG valves that had already been installed in the CP. A decision was made to purchase alloy C- 276 bodies and stem tips and to change out those alloy 400 components that had already been installed. Due to the enormity of this task (both in terms of time and money), it was desirable to determine the longevity of alloy C- 276 vs alloy 400 components in a side-by-side comparison. Also of interest was the question of how long the new (all-alloy 600) bellows would last in comparison with the original alloy 600 /SS- 316 bellows. A basic HF corrosion test was proposed to compare corrosion rates of several high-alloy materials. Because much of the alloy 400 in the system had been gold plated, some gold-plated alloy 400 <b>coupons</b> were included. <b>Due</b> to time and funding limitations, actual CP variables such as temperature and pressure were not duplicated. Instead, a simple partial-immersion test at ambient temperature was conducted. The purpose of this test was to gain information on the rate of corrosion of different alloys in the CP and to attempt to derive some idea of their expected lifetimes in the operating environment...|$|R
