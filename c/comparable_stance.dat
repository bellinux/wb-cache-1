5000|$|Carla Schulz-Hoffmann {{makes an}} attempt at characterising the painter:“An artist such as Erwin Pfrang inhabits an {{alternative}} world, a tiny microcosm of subjectivity, and lives that life uncompromisingly, with all the limitations and hardships that it entails. Among twentieth-century artists a <b>comparable</b> <b>stance</b> can be encountered perhaps in Jean Fautrier, but certainly in Wols. The succinct characterization of the latter’s manner of working by his friend Henry Pierry Roché applies equally well to Pfrang: ‘Wols sheds his drawings as a snail does its shell - naturally and painfully.’” ...|$|E
50|$|A {{major event}} for the German {{military}} was the suspension of the compulsory conscription for men in 2011. In 2011/12, a major reform of the Bundeswehr was announced, further {{limiting the number of}} military bases and soldiers. As of December 2012, the number of active military personnel in the Bundeswehr was down to 191,818, corresponding to a ratio of 2.3 active soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants. Military expenditure in Germany was at €31.55 billion in 2011, corresponding to 1.2% of GDP. Both the number of active soldiers and the military expenditure placed Germany below comparable countries of the European Union such as France and the United Kingdom. While this was already true in absolute terms, the difference was even more pronounced when taking into account Germany's larger population and economy. Thus, Germany appears less prepared to pay for the military and to attach less importance to defense than <b>comparable</b> countries. This <b>stance</b> often draws criticism from Germany's military allies, especially the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Hintikka is {{regarded}} as the founder of formal epistemic logic and of game semantics for logic. Early in his career, he devised a semantics of modal logic essentially analogous to Saul Kripke's frame semantics, and discovered the now widely taught semantic tableau, independently of Evert Willem Beth. Later, he worked mainly on game semantics, and on independence-friendly logic, known for its [...] "branching quantifiers", which he believed do better justice to our intuitions about quantifiers than does conventional first-order logic. He did important exegetical work on Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Charles Sanders Peirce. Hintikka's work {{can be seen as a}} continuation of the analytic tendency in philosophy founded by Franz Brentano and Peirce, advanced by Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell, and continued by Rudolf Carnap, Willard Van Orman Quine, and by Hintikka's teacher Georg Henrik von Wright. For instance, in 1998 he wrote The Principles of Mathematics Revisited, which takes an exploratory <b>stance</b> <b>comparable</b> to that Russell made with his The Principles of Mathematics in 1903.|$|R
5000|$|The critic Helen Vendler gave Sexual Personae a {{negative}} review in The New York Review of Books, writing that while Paglia could be [...] "enlightening and entertaining" [...] {{when dealing with}} a subject congenial to her, she failed in her discussions of subjects that demanded more than appreciation of images and stories. In response to a letter of protest from Paglia, Vendler denied that Sexual Personae constituted poetry criticism. The critic Terry Teachout, writing in The New York Times, described Sexual Personae as flawed, but [...] "every bit as intellectually stimulating as it is exasperating". The novelist Anthony Burgess wrote of Sexual Personae, [...] "A fine, disturbing book. It seeks to attack the reader's emotions as well as his/her prejudices. It is very learned. Each sentence jabs like a needle." [...] Harold Bloom wrote, [...] "Sexual Personae will be an enormous sensation of a book, {{in all of the}} better senses of ’sensation.’ There is no book <b>comparable</b> in scope, <b>stance,</b> design, or insight. It compels us to rethink the question of the literary representation of human sexuality." [...] In The American Religion (1992), Bloom described Paglia's book as a [...] "masterwork" [...] and credited her with a [...] "shrewd and alarming sexual definition of charisma", though he also wrote that its [...] "powerful sexual reductiveness ... necessarily produces distortions when applied to the personality of any prophet whosoever." ...|$|R
