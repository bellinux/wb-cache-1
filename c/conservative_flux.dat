In particular, we show that the continuous Galerkin method can be interpreted as the limit of a discontinuous Galerkin method when a stabilization parameter tends to infinity. Based on this observation we derive a method for computing a conservative approximation of the flux on the the boundary of each element for the continuous Galerkin method. The <b>conservative</b> <b>flux</b> is then obtained by actually computing the limit of the natural <b>conservative</b> <b>flux</b> provided by the discontinuous Galerkin method.
