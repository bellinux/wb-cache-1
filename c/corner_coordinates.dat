Covariance is an essential indicator of how much the deviation {{of two or more}} variables match.

Each point of the integral image corresponds to the summation of all point values inside the feature image rectangle bounded by the upper left corner and the point of interest. Using this representation, any rectangular region sum can be computed in constant time. We follow a similar idea for fast calculation of region covariance. We construct integral images for all separate features as well as integral images of the multiplication of any two feature combinations.

40|$|Using pre-defined {{models to}} extract spatial {{information}} of the building, called model-based building extraction, {{has been considered}} as a convincible approach to improve the existing photogrammetric techniques. However, {{there is still a}} bottleneck on the practical efficiency and accuracy. This paper proposed a semi-automated approach to extracting buildings from multiple aerial images as well as close-range images by a tailored least-squares model-image fitting (LSMIF) algorithm. Compare to the floating mark which is used by conventional photogrammetric techniques, we proposed a naval measuring tool of “floating models ” for building extraction. The floating model is an abstract representation of the real object, which can be a point, a line segment, a surface plane, or a volumetric model. Each floating model is associated with a set of pose parameters and a set of shape parameters. By fitting the model to images, these parameters will not only reveal the location of the building but also describe the shape of the building. The semi-automated strategy for building extraction includes following five steps: (1) manually select an appropriate model, (2) manually locate and adjust the model for approximate fitting, (3) automatically compute the optimal fitting, (4) manually edit, and (5) compose the fitted models according to the Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). An ad hoc computer program which was developed to implementing the proposed semi-automated approach was tested by extracting 10 selected buildings around the NCKU campus.

As test area the TERENO alpine and prealpine Ammer observatory is chosen since this initiative {{is associated with the}} installation of instruments for measuring meteorological and hydrological quantities. Gravimetric and geometric signals, which occur in the TERENO area, are estimated from available measured data. At the beginning the theory of signals from solid Earth tide, ocean loading, pole tides, atmosphere and hydrology is outlined. The magnitudes of the expected signals are compared. It is distinguished between direct effects due to Newtonian attraction and indirect effects due to mass loading variations. Therefore the basics of mass loading calculations using Green’s functions are described. Hydrologic and atmospheric signals shall be measured with different measurement techniques; the other mentioned effects can be reduced by models. As gravimetric measurement techniques different gravimeter types and the GRACE mission are introduced. For measuring geometric signals spaceborne SAR (TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X) and GNSS are presented. The Scintrex CG- 3 M gravimeter, owned by the IAPG, was used for test measurements. First it was utilized as stationary instrument to investigate the influence of air pressure and drift.

In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} we can use a {{modified}} version of the h-p spectral element method proposed in [6, 7, 13, 14] to solve elliptic problems with general boundary conditions to exponential accuracy on polygonal domains using nonconforming spectral element functions. A geometrical mesh is used in a neighbourhood of the corners. With this mesh we seek a solution which minimizes the sum of a weighted squared norm of the residuals in the partial differential equation and the squared norm of the residuals in the boundary conditions in fractional Sobolev spaces and enforce continuity by adding a term which measures the jump in the function and its derivatives at inter-element boundaries, in fractional Sobolev norms, to the functional being minimized. In the neighbourhood of the <b>corners,</b> modified polar <b>coordinates</b> are used and a global coordinate system elsewhere. A stability estimate is derived for the functional which is minimized based on the regularity estimate in [2]. We examine how to parallelize the method and show that the set of common boundary values consists of the values of the function at the corners of the polygonal domain. The method is faster than that proposed in [6, 7, 14] and the h-p finite element method and stronger error estimates are obtained...|$|R
