40|$|The major {{limitation}} of a convolution processor designed with <b>CCD</b> <b>memory</b> chips is {{the inability to}} operate in real time except for slow aircraft speeds or coarse resolutions. Two methods of summing the products were evaluated with respect to speed, power, and space requirements. A convolution processor was designed, {{and the number of}} chips as well as the power and volume requirements were determined using 4, 6, and 8 bit data words. The processor is flexible because range samples may be traded for additional azimuth samples by altering the control signals. The processor is also modular, and additional range or azimuth may be processed by adding more cards...|$|E

CCD shift register memories (8 K bit) were used to construct a feasibility model 128 K-bit buffer memory system. Serial data that can have rates between 150 kHz and 4. 0 MHz can be stored in 4 K-bit, randomly-accessible memory blocks. Peak power dissipation during a data transfer is less than 7 W, while idle power is approximately 5. 4 W. The system features automatic data input synchronization with the recirculating <b>CCD</b> <b>memory</b> block start address. System expansion to accommodate parallel inputs or a greater number of memory blocks can be performed in a modular fashion. Since the control logic does not increase proportionally to increase in memory capacity, the power requirements per bit of storage can be reduced significantly in a larger system...|$|E
40|$|The design, fabrication, {{and testing}} of a state-of-the-art, {{high-throughput}} on-focal plane infrared-image signal processor is described. The processing functions performed are frame differencing and thresholding. The final focal plane array will consist of a 128 x 128 -pixel platinum-suicide detector bump-mounted to an onchip CCD multiplexer. The processor is in a 128 -channel parallel-pipeline format. Eh channel consists of a pixel regenerator (charge differencer), 128 -pixel frame store <b>CCD</b> <b>memory,</b> pixel differencer, second pixel regenerator, thresholder (analog comparator), and digital latch. Four parallel analog outputs and four parallel digital outputs are included. The digital outputs provide a bit map of the image. All analog clock signals (128 KHz, 256 KHz, and 5 MHz) are generated by on-chip TFL-input clock drivers. TTL clock driver inputs are generated off-chip. The technology is low-temperature surface and buried channel CCD,MOS/inthum bump. It is believed {{that this is the}} first time that all of these technologies are integrated into one device. The design goal was 8 -bit resolution at 77 K and 1000 frames per second. The chip is 890 x 900 mils 2. Applications include point- or extended-target motion detection with thresholding. Design trade-offs and enhancements (such as on-chip detector gain compensation and a simple window processor) are discussed. I...|$|E

Converse is an interoperable parallel programming environment which combines asynchronous {{message handling}} and user level scheduler. It supports message-driven style of programming where messages trigger computations as opposed to explicit receive of messages in traditional messagepassing programming. In this paper, we discuss an efficient implementation of Converse environment on Parsytec <b>CC</b> distributed <b>memory</b> machines and present performance results of a few collective communication operations implemented in message-driven (using Converse) and in message passing styles. 1 Introduction The delays due to communication are {{the major source of}} performance degradation in message passing parallel computers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parallel algorithm for rendering ultrasonic volume data based on image space subdivision, {{along with its}} implementation and a performance analysis for a Parsytec <b>CC</b> distributed <b>memory</b> platform. The parallel rendering performance has been evaluated with special focus from the application's point of view which demands an "interactive" frame rate (about 2 rendered images per second). The algorithm distrubutes single rows of the image to be rendered on single computing nodes based on a farmer/worker paradigm. Once distributed, the processing nodes perform concurrent ray casting on their local copyof the replicated volume data. The generated subimage is then {{sent back to the}} farming process for compositing. There is no communication among the rendering processes necessary. The assignment of tasks to workers is done dynamically, because of the data dependent rendering time of a single task. Results are given in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algori thm in a medical application environment with its specific requirements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Designing {{of system}} on chip with the current {{algorithm}} and design methodology cannot {{meet the requirements of}} accommodating billion-transistor area in VLSI technology. There is a need of plat form based design and computing system design. It is to implement FPGA based reconfigurable Multiple Processor Network on Chip (MPNOC) which consists of Multiple Processing Units (MPUs),Communication controller (<b>CC)</b> and <b>Memory</b> Units (MU). The processing units are System on Chips; they are communicated each and other or connected with Routers. In this work NoC designed for processing the signals of wireless sensor networks, such as GPS, RF sensor, RFID, and Zigbee outputs. The proposed System was thus designed and simulated in ALTERA IDE’s platform. In this work, the SOPC Builder component editor has been used to configure the node elements and to create Custom network interface component. In order to implement the designed Noc in FPGA chip, Altera Quartus II CAD tool was used, which compiles HDL written for configuring NoC, also generates RTL View and timing analyzer for the main components...|$|R
50|$|Program stores also {{contained}} permanent data, {{and could not}} be written online. Instead, the aluminum memory cards, also called twistor planes, had to be removed in groups of 128 so their permanent magnets could be written offline by a motorized writer, an improvement over the non motorized single card writer used in Project Nike. All memory frames, all busses, and all software and data were fully dual modular redundant. The dual CCs operated in lockstep and the detection of a mismatch triggered an automatic sequencer to change the combination of <b>CC,</b> busses and <b>memory</b> modules until a configuration was reached that could pass a sanity check. Busses were twisted pairs, one pair for each address, data or control bit, connected at the CC and at each store frame by coupling transformers, and ending in terminating resistors at the last frame.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new {{solution to the}} group mutual exclusion problem, recently posed by Joung. In this problem, processes repeatedly request access to various "sessions". It is required that distinct processes are not in different sessions concurrently, that multiple processes {{may be in the}} same session concurrently, and that each process that tries to enter a session is eventually able to do so. This problem is a generalization of the mutual exclusion and readers-writers problems. Our algorithm and its correctness proof are substantially simpler than Joung's. This simplicity is achieved by building upon known solutions to the more specific mutual exclusion problem. Our algorithm also has various advantages over Joung's, depending on the choice of mutual exclusion algorithm used. These advantages include admitting a process to its session in constant time in the absence of contention, spinning locally in Cache Coherent (<b>CC)</b> and Non-Uniform <b>Memory</b> Access (NUMA) systems, an [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In Sec 14.1 von Neumann proposes {{the format}} for orders, {{which he calls}} a code. Order types include the basic {{arithmetic}} operations, moving minor cycles between CA and M (word load and store in modern terms), an order (s) that selects one of two numbers based on {{the sign of the}} previous operation, input and output and transferring <b>CC</b> to a <b>memory</b> location elsewhere (a jump). He determines the number of bits needed for the different order types, suggests immediate orders where the following word is the operand and discusses the desirability of leaving spare bits in the order format to allow for more addressable memory in the future, as well as other unspecified purposes. The possibility of storing more than one order in a minor cycle is discussed, with little enthusiasm for that approach. A table of orders is provided, but no discussion of input and output instructions was included in the First Draft.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} compare {{the role of the}} fornix (FX) and cingulate cortex (<b>CC)</b> in <b>memory,</b> rats were trained in a series of discriminations using {{procedures}} that were the same as those used for monkeys (Murray et al. 1986, 1988). A spatial delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS) discrimination tested recent memory for spatial location in a T maze using interrun intervals (IRI) that varied from 5 s to 15 min. FX and CC lesions produced a substantial impairment in the performance of this task during postoperative testing. Three conditional discriminations (CD) followed. In each one, the rat was presented with two objects, only one of which was correct. The nature of the conditional stimuli changed in each discrimination: the place of the maze in the room; the direction that the rat moved to approach the objects; the side (left or right) to which the rat turned. Control rats learned all three types of conditional discriminations. FX and CC lesions did not impair choice accuracy. In a subsequent repetition of the spatial DNMS procedure, FX and CC lesions again produced a substantial impairment, indicating that the lack of an impairment in the three CDs was not due to recovery of function. These data indicate that the hippocampal system and its connections through the fornix are importantly involved in spatial working memory in both rats and monkeys, and that the CDs do not require this type of memory. The results are discussed in the context of different theories of the brain mechanisms involved in memory...|$|R
40|$|Mental health {{problems}} are increasing in Swedish adolescents and mortality rates are higher {{in this age}} group than among younger. 10 - 20 % of all adolescents suffer from a chronic medical condition (CC). Few protective factors (PF) and clustering of health-risk behaviours (HRB) are frequent among adolescents with CCs. One of the most common CC in Swedish adolescents is type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM). Metabolic control often deteriorates during adolescence, especially in girls. Poor metabolic control is associated with increased risk for long-term complications, of which cognitive problems are common. However, the implication of cognitive/executive problems in patients with T 1 DM has not been sufficiently studied. Neither has the impact of neurodevelopmental problems (NDP), such as ADHD, on HRB in adolescents with CCs been analysed. Methods: In paper I and II the questionnaire ”Life and Health in Youth” was distributed to all students in year nine and year two of the upper secondary school in the county of Sörmland, 2008 (n= 5771) and 2011 (n= 5550). Adolescents with CCs were compared to healthy peers with regard to PFs and HRBs. In paper III, the ”Five to Fifteen” questionnaire was used in 175 paediatric patients with T 1 DM. Patients with indications of NDPs were compared with patients without such problems with regard to metabolic control. In paper IV, the BRIEF questionnaire and the ADHD Rating Scale as well as data from the Swedish Childhood Diabetes Registry was used in 241 adolescents with T 1 DM. Patients with indications of executive problems were compared with patients without such problems with regard to diabetes control. Results: CCs were associated with few PFs and clustered HRBs. The combination of CCs and low numbers of PFs was found to be associated with an increased risk of clustered HRBs. In the presence of coexisting ADHD the pattern of few PFs and clustering of HRBs was aggravated. ADHD was more common among adolescents with other <b>CCs.</b> Definite <b>memory</b> and learning problems as well as mild executive problems were associated with poor metabolic control, especially among adolescents. Executive problems were also associated with many outpatient visits and low physical activity. Girls with T 1 DM tended to self-report executive problems to a larger extent than boys, while parents more often reported these problems in boys. Conclusion: Knowledge about factors influencing treatment adherence and life in general is essential in the work with chronically ill adolescents. Focus must be put on enhancing PFs in order to avoid HRBs. Identification of coexisting NDPs, such as ADHD, is crucial, since such problems can adversely influence treatment adherence, HRBs and school achievement...|$|R
