2500|$|During {{the period}} of Cold War détente, {{relations}} between Australia and the Soviet Union were seen as stronger during the Whitlam government. On 3 July 1974, then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, as Acting Foreign Minister, took the decision to grant de jure recognition of the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the USSR. The Australian ambassador to Moscow visited Tallinn, Estonia, on 28–30 July 1974, effectively according de jure recognition. Soviet authorities subsequently leaked this information on 3 August 1974, confirmed by {{a spokesperson for the}} Ministry of Foreign Affairs a day later. Whitlam had neither informed nor consulted with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Willesee, who had been absent abroad, the Cabinet, Caucus, nor Parliament. In taking this controversial decision Whitlam also reneged on pre-election commitments made in correspondences to organizations representing emigrees from all three Baltic nations. Willesee, who upon his return supported Whitlam's decision and subsequently confirmed Whitlam's decision as [...] "unilateral," [...] was eventually censured by the Australian Parliament on 18 September 1974 for his part: [...] "That the Minister for Foreign Affairs is deserving of censure and ought to resign because: in breach of a clear undertaking to the contrary given by the Prime Minister the Government shamefully and furtively extended recognition to the incorporation of the Baltic States in the U.S.S.R., the Minister withholding any announcement or explanation of the decision." [...] During Question Time in October 1974, Whitlam explained his decision to recognise the de jure incorporation the Baltic states into the Soviet Union was one which did not imply approval {{of the way in which}} former states were incorporated, but an acknowledgement of existing realities at the time. Whitlam, ascribed by his political opposition as [...] "want a good response when he visits Russia", became the first Australian Prime Minister to visit Moscow in January 1975. Whitlam was not received by General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Leonid Brezhnev, who for [...] "reasons of health" [...] was unable to meet him, but instead by Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the Soviet of Ministers of the USSR. During Whitlam's visit to the USSR, two agreements were signed between the two countries on 15 January 1975: the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on Scientific-Technical Co-operation and the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on <b>Cultural</b> <b>Co-operation.</b> Following the dismissal of the Whitlam government in 1975 and the resultant election which saw the installation of a conservative Liberal-Country Party coalition government under the leadership of Malcolm Fraser, recognition of the incorporation of the three Baltic states by the Soviet Union was rescinded by Australia in December 1975, and relations became more pragmatic.|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} many {{researches}} {{in the field of}} management, but none of them touches the area of Chinese management of Swedish staff, as far as we know. This is a rather new phenomenon ever since China decided for outward expansion. Cultural myopias and the lack of cultural competency are contributions to the failures of many cross <b>cultural</b> <b>co-operations.</b> The purpose of this dissertation was to detect the management issues in terms of relationships, and shed light on the perceptual differences between the cultures within the chosen companies. To measure the values the employees had, from cultural aspects, we conducted a survey developed by Professor Geert Hofstede. The survey was used as a complement to our qualitative data, and the results demonstrated that the Chinese within these companies seem to adopt a rather “Swedish like” mentality. The qualitative results, however, prove that there are cultural differences causing operational frictions at these firms. The perceptual differences initiate cultural distance between the cultures, preventing comprehension. We believe the reason is failure to apply measures to educate and integrate the members within the firms...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn Turkey as elsewhere, {{exchanges and}} circulations played an {{important}} role in the construction of national culture and the way of conceiving the role of culture and cultural policies. Nowaday, the debates on cultural policy are renewed in the context of globalisation or of the negotiation for Turkey’s adhesion to the European Union. In parallel, culture has now a great economic dimension and is more and more used as a tool of development, of growth, or of tourism. The initiatives aiming to encourage ‘democratization’, ‘cultural diversity’, or the localisation of cultural policies also go hand in hand with. One witnesses a diversification of actors involved in the making of cultural policies (private, associative, international); one also witnesses the circulation of objects, ideas, instruments, or practices and modes of action, bringing together new stakes for culture and cultural policies. This contribution aims to question the ways in which the circulations participate in the construction of cultural policies in Turkey today in order to rethink the co-production of cultural policies, of their spaces and territories, as well as the plurality of the conceptions of culture carried by cultural policies. It is also a way of deconstructing the operations of transfer of policies and to question the “models” of cultural policies, the “best practices”, the phenomena of <b>cultural</b> <b>co-operations,</b> or of translations. cette communication analyse l'évolution de la politique culturelle turque ces dernières années à la suite d'un certain nombre de réformes initiées par le gouvernement de l'AKP.
