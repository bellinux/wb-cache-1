According {{to a report}} by the U.S. EPA, during meetings in spring 1970, Ash at first expressed a preference for a single department to oversee both environmental and natural resource management; by April he had changed his mind; in a memorandum to the President he advocated a separate regulatory agency devoted solely to anti-pollution programs.

50|$|The {{commission}} {{emerged from}} public debates concerning {{the place of}} the hijab in French public life in relation to the principles of laïcité, in particular whether its was appropriate in state schools. In addition the commission sought to more clearly define the application of laïcité in the workplace, public services and public spaces. To this end the Stasi <b>Commission</b> <b>lead</b> to the introduction of the French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools. Despite this apparent resolution to the questions concerning laïcité, the controversy surrounding the wearing of the hijab and the media attention paid to it has meant that it remains a source of disagreement within the political class.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to explain {{variation}} between member states {{in compliance with}} provisions of a European Union (EU) law. Predictions are derived {{about the effects of}} technical fit, discretion, Commission warnings, and conflict in the Council on the probability of member-state transposition of separate EU policy requirements. Hypotheses are tested on the level of compliance of 15 member states with 27 major provisions laid down in the Framework Equality Directive (2000 / 78 /EC). Extensive analysis of documents and reports from key informants provided information on member-state transposition progress at the end of 2004 and 2006. Results show that the domestic adaptation costs to a provision play an important role for member-state transposition success: high levels of fit and provisions granting discretion improve member-state transposition success. Formal warnings by the <b>Commission</b> <b>lead</b> to a better compliance record, while conflict in the Council does not affect the successful transposition of provisions...|$|E

40|$|From the {{acclaimed}} South African novelist, a lyrical tale of self-discovery in post-apartheid cape town. Set in a beautifully rendered 1990 s Cape Town, Playing in the Light revolves around Marion, {{a woman of}} Afrikaner background, who hates traveling but nonetheless runs a travel agency, and her complex relationship with Brenda, {{the first black woman}} she has ever employed. In writing as finely detailed and attuned to psychological nuance as Anita Brookner's, Wicomb depicts the life of a complicated, single woman in a changing and complicated place. Caught up in the narrow world of private interests and self-advancement, Marion eschews national politics until the exposures of the Truth and Reconciliation <b>Commission</b> <b>lead</b> to the discovery of a skeleton in the family cupboard. While her aging father is unable and unwilling to supply the truth, Marion's young employee becomes implicated in the piecing together of Marion's past, leading to a defining transformation and widening of Marion's world.

40|$|We devise an algebra of {{currents}} and their first time-derivatives designed to damp at high momentum the asymptotic behavior of leptonpair scattering amplitudes from hadrons consequent {{from the local}} current algebra of Gell-Mann. Given certain criteria, the algebra we find is unique, and the commutators are expressed linearly {{in terms of the}} currents themselves, The Jacobi identity, however, is’formally violated for this algebra; we argue that this does not invalidate it. A possible realization of this “minimal ” algebra is found in terms of the formal limit of a massive Yang-Mills theory as g 0, m 0 - 0; go/m: [...] constant # 0. With this algebra, all electromagnetic masses of hadrons are finite. Experimental consequences, the strongest of which occurs in inelastic lepton-hadron scattering, are outlined. (to be submitted to Phys. Rev.) Work supported in part by the U. S. Atomic Energy <b>Commission.</b> <b>lead</b> to a unique set of commutators of currents with their time derivatives. In Section IV the minimal algebra is shown to result from a limit of a massive Yang-Mills theory as mo-+ 0 and go/m:- constant. In Section V, we discuss the experimental implications of the minimal algebra. II. CRITERIA FOR THE MINIMAL ALGEBRA According to the Gell-Mann”philosophy of current algebra, matrix-elements of time-ordered products of two currents = M $ are considered as observables, because they can in principle be related to S-matrix elements for scattering of lepton pairs or photons from hadrons: 12 Sfi cc. ppQv Mp...|$|E
40|$|There are {{fundamental}} difficulties currently existing {{with mental health}} provision for all children including LAC at this time within the UK. Investment into service provision is highlighted as the main barrier in providing support or intervention for children or adolescents, {{there appears to be}} little regard for the longer term costs of not providing support or intervention. This includes a deterioration mental wellbeing, and overall health as portrayed within the ACE study. These factors directly correlate to any future employment and adult service need. More concerning are the wider impact indicators for LAC as they progress throughout adolescence. It is well documented that LAC individually and collectively achieve less academically than their peers, {{and are more likely to}} be excluded within behaviour policies for schools in addition to being identified as having SEN compared to their peers. Within the Youth Justice system there are proportionally more LAC than their non LAC peers and higher levels of substance misuse. All recommendations addressing early intervention for the mental wellbeing of not only LAC but all children, highlight the positive outcomes in economic terms for the Government and for the individual both short and long term. Whilst a review of current provision may be urgently required, this appears to be a repetition of what is already known. This report argues that it is now time for change not more of the same and whilst on the 9 th January 2017 Theresa May, Prime Minister for the UK, announced new approaches to Mental Health for Children and Young People asking that the Care Quality <b>Commission</b> <b>lead</b> a review of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to ascertain what works well and what does not.
