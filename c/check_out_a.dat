25|$|The Double Cone Trek was {{conceived}} in 1966 by Camp Director Chet Frisbie and Program Director Red Bryan. They sent three summer camp staff and Eagle Scouts—Bill Roberts, Terry Trotter, and Martin Woodward—to <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> multi-day hike around the camp. Roberts secured a measuring wheel from the Sierra Club. Trotter conducted nature surveys, noting the various {{flora and fauna}} at campsites, and took photographs. Woodward was tasked with noting all the campsite amenities or lack thereof, and all three brainstormed about the merit badges that might be worked on during the trek. The hike circles the Boy Scout camp, beginning at Bottcher's Gap, eastward around the Ventana Double Cone though Hiding Canyon and over the Pine Ridge Trail, west over the Big Sur River to Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, and then back east through Pico Blanco Public Camp to the Boy Scout camp.

She additionally lost [...] on a nonfat diet, conducted throughout the film's six-month shoot. Actor and former Israeli commando Uzi Gal provided her with training for her action scenes.

2500|$|In the 21st century, bicycling {{has grown}} in popular in Miami Beach as well. Due to its dense, urban nature, and pedestrian-friendly streets, many Miami Beach {{residents}} get around by bicycle. Locally, South Beach has implemented many BikeShare units all around the neighborhood in a system known as DecoBike, which launched in March 2011. The initial rollout of the program included [...] "approximately 100 solar-powered stations and 1,000 custom-designed bikes available to residents and visitors." [...] This public bicycle sharing and rental program is {{owned and operated by}} DecoBike, LLC, a Miami-based company, and operates under a long-term agreement with the City of Miami Beach. The service is available to both residents and visitors – any adult with a major credit card can <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> bike to pedal to their next location.

2500|$|Lopez and Azalea {{performed}} the remix {{version of the}} track {{together for the first}} time live during the latter's set at the 2014 We Can Survive Concert held at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on October 24, 2014. The song's first televised performance was during the 2014 American Music Awards, where both closed out the show, with Lopez also previewing a new song entitled [...] "Throw Your Hair Back." [...] The performance started out with Lopez in a black and white leotard [...] "that showed off her famous assets", as cited by Allison Takeda from Us Magazine. Takeda continued the description, adding that [...] "later, she was joined onstage by Azalea, who rocked a glittery metallic leotard. As they danced, patterened lights flashed across the stage, covering them in polka dots, stripes, and diamonds. During the performance, Lopez stopped singing to <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> ringing cell phone, which she dismissed with the offhand observation, [...] "Just a booty call." [...] Daniel D'Addario of Time named that the performance [...] "was the most dynamic of the night," [...] while Joe Lynch of Billboard called it [...] "a perfect showstopper." [...] Billy Johnson Jr. of Yahoo! Music pointed out that it [...] "demonstrated why she deserved the headlining spot of what was otherwise a rather uneventful telecast." [...] Carey Ganz of Rolling Stone selected it as one of the best, praising Lopez for showing that it was her performance, although Azalea was also featured. Ganz noted that [...] "she got to hit all the contortionist high spots, and was the beneficiary of the best production moments. When she and Azalea did share the stage, it was still clear who was in charge. Then, just to further cement her status, Lopez closed the show solo, strutting and shaking her way across the stage before backing it up to Pitbull to send the show home." [...] Lopez has {{performed the}} track regularly since its release as a part of her live shows set list, including on her Mawazine headlining show on May 29, 2015, and on her Las Vegas residency show [...]|$|E
