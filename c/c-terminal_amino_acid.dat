40|$|Hypertonicity-induced binding of the {{transcription}} factor TonEBP/OREBP to its cognate DNA element, ORE/TonE, {{is associated with}} increased transcription of several osmotically regulated genes. Previously, {{it was found that}} hypertonicity rapidly causes nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP and, more slowly, increases TonEBP/OREBP abundance. Also, the C terminus of TonEBP/OREBP was found to contain a transactivation domain (TAD). We have now tested for tonicity dependence of the TAD activity of the 983 <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of TonEBP/OREBP. HepG 2 cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct and one of several TAD expression vector constructs. The reporter construct contained GAL 4 DNA binding elements, a minimal promoter, and the Photinus luciferase gene. TAD expression vectors generate chimeras comprised of the GAL 4 DNA binding domain fused to (i) the 983 <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of TonEBP/OREBP, (ii) 17 glutamine residues, (iii) the TAD of c-Jun, or (iv) no TAD. All TAD-containing chimeras were functional at normal extracellular osmolality (300 mosmol/kg), but the activity only of the chimera containing the 983 <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of TonEBP/OREBP varied with extracellular NaCl concentration, decreasing by > 80 % at 200 mosmol/kg and increasing 8 -fold at 500 mosmol/kg. The chimera containing the 983 <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of TonEBP/OREBP was constitutively localized to the nucleus and showed tonicity-dependent posttranslational modification consistent with phosphorylation. The activity at 500 mosmol/kg was reduced by herbimycin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and by 5, 6 -dichloro- 1 -β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, a protein kinase CK 2 inhibitor.

The latter is {{identical}} to the former except for the presence of additional 19 <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> at the C terminus. While SHDAg is required for HDV replication, LHDAg inhibits replication and, together with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), is required for the assembly of HDV. The last 19 <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of LHDAg are essential for HDV assembly. Most of LHDAg (<b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> 19 to 146 and 163 to 195) had been shown to be dispensable for packaging with HBsAg. To discern whether the last 19 <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> solely constitute the signal for packaging with HBsAg, we constructed two LHDAg deletion mutants and tested their abilities to be packaged with HBsAg in cotransfection experiments. We found that deletion of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> 2 to 21 and 142 to 165 did not affect LHDAg packaging. This result suggested that only the last 19 <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of LHDAg are required for packaging. We further constructed two plasmids which expressed c-H-ras with or without additional 19 <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> identical to those in LHDAg. Only c-H-ras with additional 19 <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> could be cosecreted with HBsAg in the cotransfection experiment.

We developed specific antibodies to discriminate tyrosinated vs detyrosinated forms of EB 1 and detected only tyrosinated EB 1 in fibroblasts, astrocytes, and total brain tissue. Over-expressed EB 1 was not detyrosinated in cells and chimeric EB 1 with the eight <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of α-tubulin was only barely detyrosinated.

50|$|Peptaibols are biologically active {{peptides}} containing between {{seven and}} twenty amino acid residues, {{some of which are}} non-proteinogenic amino acids.

They are produced by certain fungi, mainly in the Trichoderma genus, as secondary metabolites which function as antibiotics and antifungal agents. Some are referred to as trichorzianines. They are amphipathic which allows them to form voltage-dependent ion channels in cell membranes which create holes in the membrane making them leaky and leading to the death of the cells.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{method for}} {{the synthesis of}} proteins relied on tert-butyloxycarbonyl (or more simply [...] "Boc") to temporarily protect the α-amino group. In this method, the Boc group is covalently bound to the amino group to suppress its nucleophilicity. The <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> is covalently linked to the resin through a linker. Next, the Boc group is removed with acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). This forms a positively charged amino group (in the presence of excess TFA; note image on the right illustrates neutral amino group), which is neutralized (via in-situ or non-in-situ methods) and coupled to the incoming activated amino acid. Reactions are driven to completion {{by the use of}} excess (2- to 4-fold) activated amino acid. After each deprotection and coupling step, a wash with dimethylformamide (DMF) is performed to remove excess reagents, allowing (by year 2000) for high yields (~99%) during each cycle.|$|E
50|$|Since its {{introduction}} over 40 years ago, SPPS has been significantly optimized. First, the resins themselves have been optimized. Furthermore, the 'linkers' between the <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> and polystyrene resin have improved attachment and cleavage {{to the point}} of mostly quantitative yields. The evolution of side chain protecting groups has limited the frequency of unwanted side reactions. In addition, the evolution of new activating groups on the carboxyl group of the incoming amino acid have improved coupling and decreased epimerization. Finally, the process itself has been optimized. In Merrifield's initial report, the deprotection of the α-amino group resulted in the formation of a peptide-resin salt, which required neutralization with base prior to coupling. The time between neutralization of the amino group and coupling of the next amino acid allowed for aggregation of peptides, primarily through the formation of secondary structures, and adversely affected coupling. The Kent group reported that concomitant neutralization of the α-amino group and coupling of the next amino acid led to improved coupling. Each of these improvements has helped SPPS become the robust technique that it is today.|$|E

5000|$|Tyrosine {{phosphorylation}} {{sites in}} growth factor receptors serve two major purposes--to control {{the state of}} activity of the kinase and to create binding sites for downstream signal transduction molecules, which in many cases also are substrates for the kinase. The {{second part of the}} tyrosine kinase domain in the PDGFβ receptor is phosphorylated at Tyr-857, and mutant receptors carrying phenylalanine at this position have reduced kinase activity. Tyr-857 has therefore been assigned a role in positive regulation of kinase activity. Sites of tyrosine phosphorylation involved in binding signal transduction molecules have been identified in the [...] domain, the kinase insert, and in the C-terminal tail in the PDGFβ receptor. The phosphorylated tyrosine residue and in general three adjacent <b>C-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues form specific binding sites for signal transduction molecules. Binding to these sites involves a common conserved stretches, denoted the Src homology (SH) 2 domain and/or Phosphotyrosine Binding Domains (PTB). The specificity of these interactions appears to be very high, since mutant receptors carrying phenylalanine residues in one or several of the different phosphorylation sites generally lack the capacity to bind the targeted signal transduction molecule. The signal transduction molecules are either equipped with different enzymatic activities, or they are adaptor molecules, which in some but not all cases are found in complexes with subunits that carry a catalytic activity. Upon interaction with the activated receptor, the catalytic activities become up-regulated, through tyrosine phosphorylation or other mechanisms, generating a signal that may be unique for each type of signal transduction molecule.|$|E
