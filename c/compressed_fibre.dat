40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} of Kevlar 49 fibres to thermal, ultrasonic and chemical environments have been analysed. Both the tensile strength and the tensile modulus deteriorate with thermal exposures. However, the former is more sensitive than the latter. The prominent crystal structural changes induced by thermal exposures are 13; reduction in crystallinity, molecular misalignment about the fibre axis, increase in the inter layer distance, changes in crystallite size and/or microstrain. Thermally induced macro changes include introduction of surface holes, partial hollowness near the core, localised thinning, material loss {{in the vicinity of}} surface impurities etc. The structural changes could be satisfactorily correlated with the corresponding changes in tensile properties. All the thermally induced effects are controlled by two parameters, viz., the temperature (T) and the duration of the cumulative exposure to T, tcum(T). The T-tcum(T) effect leads to the observation of isothermal decomposition of Kevlar over a range of temperatures which include Ts, far below the reported decomposition temperature of 500 / 550 xB 0;C. A hitherto unknown direct correlation between X-ray diffraction peak positions and the tensile strength has also been identified. Exposure to ultrasonic waves introduces axial compression, evinced by the formation of kink bands, fibrillation and macro buckling. The unit cell of axially <b>compressed</b> <b>fibres</b> manifests an anisotropic deformation. The process of moisture uptake by Kevlar 49 fibres is controlled by the relative humidity (RH) of ambient atmosphere. The saturation moisture content is, however, determined by structural characteristics such as the degree of crystallinity, molecular alignment etc. The uptake of common organic solvents by Kevlar is dependent on the molar volume of the former...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} concern over asbestos, more companies are considering {{the possibility of}} changing to asbestos-free, non-metallic gaskets. However, caution should be exercised when adopting alternative materials because their applicational requirements are sig@-cantly different. Specifically, when compared with premium quality compressed asbestos jibre grades, the calendered asbestos-free grades generally have: lower temperature and pressure ratings, temperature and pressure ratings which do not co-exist (that is as the temperature increases, the maximum internal pressure sealable decreases), higher minimum surface stress requirements, lower maximum surface stress values, lower creep resistance, diflerent chemical resistance, poorer performance in steam and less tolerance to the deleterious effects of jointing compounds. This paper attempts to demonstrate why this new group of materials {{should not be considered}} as a direct replacement for <b>compressed</b> asbestos <b>fibre</b> but rather as a limited substitute. It also offers some hope for the future with the prediction of the development of a calendered asbestos-free grade with similar properties to the best traditional asbestos-based grades but without the large cost penalty involved in selecting exfoliated graphite. ...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{information}} on the three-dimensional dispersion of collagen fibres within layers of healthy and diseased soft biological tissues has been reported recently.

In addition, a computational implementation of that model in a general purpose finite element program has been investigated and verified with the standard fibre-reinforcing model for fibre contributions. In this study, we develop the proposed fibre dispersion model further using an exponential form of the strain-energy function for the fibre contributions. The finite element implementation of this model with a rotationally symmetrical dispersion of fibres is also presented. This includes explicit expressions for the stress and elasticity tensors. The performance {{and implementation of the}} new model are demonstrated by means of a uniaxial extension test, a simple shear test, and an extension–inflation simulation of a residually stressed carotid artery segment.

50|$|Manufacture then {{follows the}} same route as with other kinds of fibers such as viscose. The strands pass to a {{finishing}} area, where a lubricant, which may be a soap or silicone or other agent depending on the future use of the fibre, is applied. This step is basically a detangler, prior to carding and spinning into yarn. The dried, finished fibres are {{at this stage in}} a form called tow, a large untwisted bundle of continuous lengths of filament. The bundles of tow are taken to a crimper, a machine that <b>compresses</b> the <b>fibre,</b> giving it texture and bulk. The crimped fibre is carded by mechanical carders, which perform an action like combing, to separate and order the strands. The carded strands are cut and baled for shipment to a fabric mill. The entire manufacturing process, from unrolling the raw cellulose to baling the fibre, takes about two hours. After this, the Lyocell may be processed in many ways. It may be spun with another fibre, such as cotton or wool. The resulting yarn can be woven or knitted like any other fabric, and may be given a variety of finishes, from soft and suede-like to silky.|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{explain the}} complete sequence of shapes of deflated spherical shells. Decreasing the volume, the shell remains spherical initially, then undergoes the classical buckling instability, where an axisymmetric dimple appears, and, finally, loses its axisymmetry by wrinkles developing {{in the vicinity}} of the dimple edge in a secondary buckling transition. We describe the first axisymmetric buckling transition by numerical integration of the complete set of shape equations and an approximate analytic model due to Pogorelov. In the buckled shape, both approaches exhibit a locally compressive hoop stress in a region where experiments and simulations show the development of polygonal wrinkles, along the dimple edge. In a simplified model based on the stability equations of shallow shells, a critical value for the compressive hoop stress is derived, for which the <b>compressed</b> circumferential <b>fibres</b> will buckle out of their circular shape in order to release the compression. By applying this wrinkling criterion to the solutions of the axisymmetric models, we can calculate the critical volume for the secondary buckling transition. Using the Pogorelov approach, we also obtain an analytical expression for the critical volume at the secondary buckling transition: The critical volume difference scales linearly with the bending stiffness, whereas the critical volume reduction at the classical axisymmetric buckling transition scales with the square root of the bending stiffness. These results are confirmed by another stability analysis in the framework of Donnel, Mushtari and Vlasov (DMV) shell theory, and by numerical simulations available in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Compressed {{air driven}} {{vehicles}} have two advantages over their rival electro-chemical battery driven {{vehicles in the}} locally non-polluting transport market, namely the much shorter recharging time possible and the long life of the high-pressure storage vessels.

Lightweight carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>compressed</b> air storage vessels are now practical but, if compressed air driven vehicles are to compete successfully further weight and efficiency savings must be made.

When we contract the chest and expel the air, there is a retardation of the blood in the veins of the neck and head; and in the more powerful acts of expulsion, the blood not only distends the vessels, but is even regurgitated into the minute branches. Were the eye not properly compressed at that time, and a resistance given to the shock, irreparable injury might be inflicted on the delicate textures of the interior of the eye." [...] He further adds, [...] "If we separate the eyelids of a child to examine the eye, while it cries and struggles with passion, by taking off the natural support to the vascular system of the eye, and means of guarding it against the rush of blood then occurring, the conjunctiva becomes suddenly filled with blood, and the eyelids everted." ...|$|R
50|$|Pulp {{acts as a}} {{security}} and alarm system for a tooth. Slight decay in tooth structure not extending to the dentin may not alarm the pulp but as the dentin gets exposed, either due to dental caries or trauma, sensitivity starts. The dentinal tubules pass the stimulus to odontoblastic layer of the pulp which in turns triggers the response. This mainly responds to cold. At this stage simple restorations can be performed for treatment. As the decay progresses near the pulp the response also magnifies and sensation to a hot diet as well as cold gets louder. At this stage indirect pulp capping might work for treatment but at times {{it is impossible to}} clinically diagnose the extent of decay, pulpitis may elicit at this stage. Carious dentin by dental decay progressing to pulp may get fractured during mastication (chewing food) causing direct trauma to the pulp hence eliciting pulpitis. The inflammation of the pulp is known as pulpitis. Pulpitis can be extremely painful and in serious cases calls for root canal therapy or endodontic therapy. Traumatized pulp starts an inflammatory response but due to the hard and closed surroundings of the pulp pressure builds inside the pulp chamber <b>compressing</b> the nerve <b>fibres</b> and eliciting extreme pain (acute pulpitis). At this stage the death of the pulp starts which eventually progresses to periapical abscess formation (chronic pulpitis).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the process of damage and failure in small diameter high performance synthetic fibre ropes namely Dyneema, Vectran and Technora ropes. This study was prompted by a series of fatal accidents on paragliders {{as a result of the}} line failure. All the different rope materials, including the rope with cover, without cover and the core with different number of strands, have been tensile tested. The transfer of loading and subsequent damage in different rope constituents, fibres and strands, are also discussed. The residual strength of the rope after static and cyclic preloading regimes is discussed and possible mechanisms for the damage accumulation in the rope are given. The acoustic emission monitoring of the tensile and residual strength tests shows distinctive differences between the different types of rope and permits the identification of characteristic effects of preloading on the tensile damage and failure mechanisms of all three materials. The process of damage in the Dyneema and Vectran is similar, in which damage progresses in steps during the loading history whereas Technora rope accumulates gradual increase in damage until the catastrophic failure. The application of the static preloading improves the strength of Dyneema and Vectran ropes whereas it deteriorates the mechanical properties of Technora rope. The cyclic response of Dyneema rope shows a dramatic downturn at lives in excess of 1000 cycles, but moderate cyclic loading improves the strength. The variation in surface temperature of Dyneema rope during tensile loading has been measured analysed and related to the process of damage. Dyneema fibres melt and fuse together under loading, since Dyneema is disadvantaged by its low melting temperature. Rope on rope abrasion tests, carried out on covered and uncovered Dyneema and Technora ropes, show that Dyneema rope has superior abrasion properties compared to Technora. This is due to the low compression properties of Technora, as abrasion process involves <b>compressing</b> the <b>fibres.</b> The effect of exposure to different environments, including natural weathering, - 22 'C, + 54 'C and seawater on tensile performance is discussed. The tensile properties of the Dyneema ropes are little affected by the environmental conditioning except the effect of synthetic sea water, in which case the salt crystals damage the rope fibres, once the water has evaporated. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{deformation}} behaviour of chrome tanned {{crust leather}} (with or without fatliquor) and finished leather has been measured in three-point bend, tensile and compression tests. Relations between the experimental {{results and the}} perceived softness of the leather were investigated. The instrumentally assessed softness {{of a set of}} leathers was represented by parameters obtained from these tests and compared with a quantified subjective assessment. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to analyse the water status in crust leathers. The influence of water content prior to staking on its softening effect was investigated. An orthogonal experiment was applied to investigate the influence of various factors (e. g. amplitude and frequency) on the softening effect of mechanical action to obtain an optimum combination of these factors. The bending force, F, increased in a linear way with increasing sample width, w, in accordance with the standard theory of beam bending. However the change in F with increasing sample thickness, t, departed (markedly in some cases) from the standard theory. The theory of laminated materials offered a quantitative description of the dependency provided that the grain and corium layers were regarded as the laminae. F was approximately proportional to the actual bending length raised to a power between - 2 and - 3. An empirical equation {{based on the results of}} the bend testing was developed. A parameter, Se/tn, can be used to rank the softness of leather, where Se is equivalent to the bending stiffness in standard bending theory, and n is the approximate index in the power function describing the relationship of the bending force F to the sample thickness t for a particular type of leather. A model describing the compression behaviour of crust leather is proposed which involves four stages of compression: (i) hair-like fibres being bent flat onto the surface and buckling of vertical fibre bundles, (ii) closing up of voids between fibre bundles, (iii) closing up of voids between <b>fibres,</b> and (iv) <b>compressing</b> of solid <b>fibres.</b> DSC results indicate that water has a stronger interaction with collagen molecules in an unfatliquored leather than in a fatliquored one. Fatliquor appears to function as a shield between water and collagen. The influence of water content prior to staking on the resulting softening effect was clearly reflected in bending and tensile tests, but was not nearly so evident in a compression test. It is shown that a maximum softening effect can be obtained in the staking process when moisture content is about 30 - 40 %...|$|R
