40|$|The {{increment}} of {{the required}} lifetime for structural components commonly used in different machinery applications (aerospace, automotive, railway and energy applications) has recently led to a more detailed investigation on the Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) response of metallic materials. Experimental tests showed that specimens made of high-strength steels may fail at stress amplitudes below the <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> (106 - 107 cycles) and that fatigue failures {{may be due to}} two different types of crack nucleation. If the stress amplitude is above the <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> cracks nucleate at the specimen surface; if the stress amplitude is below the <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> cracks nucleate from inclusions or internal defects (internal nucleation) and failures occur at very high number of cycles (up to 1010 cycles). The VHCF response of high-strength steels is therefore significantly influenced by the inclusion population (inclusion dimension and quantity). In the present paper, the VHCF response of an Örvar Supreme steel characterized by a high level of cleanliness was investigated. Fully reversed tension-compression tests were carried out with an ultrasonic testing machine capable to reach a loading frequency equal to 20 kHz (ultrasonic tests) and allowing for a significant reduction of the testing time (109 cycles in 14 hours). Fracture surfaces were observed through a Scanning Electron Microscope. Experimental results showed that, even with a high-strength steel characterized by a high level of cleanliness, VHCF failures indeed occur and internal nucleation of cracks {{must be taken into account}} in order to prevent unexpected failures at stress amplitudes below the conventional fatigue limi...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) {{behavior}} of metallic materials {{has become a}} major point of interest for researchers and industries. The needs of specific industrial fields (aerospace, mechanical and energy industry) for structural components with increasingly large fatigue lives, up to 1010 cycles (gigacycle fatigue), requested for a more detailed investigation on the experimental properties of materials in the VHCF regime. Gigacycle fatigue tests are commonly performed using resonance fatigue testing machines with a loading frequency of 20 kHz (ultrasonic tests). Experimental results showed that failure is due to cracks which nucleate at the specimen surface if the stress amplitude is above the <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> (surface nucleation) and that failure is generally due to cracks which nucleate from inclusions or internal defects (internal nucleation) when specimens are subjected to stress amplitudes below the <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> Following the experimental evidence, the Authors recently proposed a new probabilistic model for the complete description of S-N curves both in the High-Cycle Fatigue (HCF) and in the VHCF fatigue regions (duplex S-N curves). The model differentiates between the two failure modes (surface and internal nucleation), according to the estimated distribution of the random transition stress (corresponding to the <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit).</b> No assumption is made about the statistical distribution of the number of cycles at which the transition between surface and internal nucleation occurs (i. e., the Transition Fatigue Life TFL). In the present paper, the TFL distribution is obtained. The resulting distribution depends on the distance between the HCF and the VHCF regions and on the distribution of the random transition stress. It is also shown that the statistical distribution of the fatigue strength at the median TFL (i. e., the Transition Fatigue Strength TFS) has median which corresponds to the mean transition stress. Finally, a procedure for computing Likelihood Ratio Confidence Intervals (LRCIs) for both the median TFL and the median TFS is given in the paper. The estimated TFL and TFS distributions can be effectively used for properly choosing the duration of HCF tests in terms of number of cycles and the stress amplitude below which VHCF failures more probably occur. LRCIs for the median TFL and TFS can be usefully computed for assessing uncertainty in the estimation procedure when a limited number of experimental data is available. A numerical example based on an experimental dataset taken from the literature is provided...|$|E

Results {{reveal that the}} fatigue cracks were initiated from the material cast shrinking cavities with hot ties. Distinct fatigue striations, river-like flowers, and second cracks appeared on the fracture surface in perpendicular to the fatigue crack path. Lots of dimples in the transient fracture district indicate that present material is ductile. Considering both the scattered S-N relations and no <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> under variable loads, the S-N {{relations are}} measured probabilistically in terms of continuous declined probabilistic S-N curves including super-long life regime (SLLR) of> 107 cycles. Affordable novel approach, i. e. concurrent probability extrapolation method, was applied. The test S-N data in mid-long life regime (MLLR) and <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> are used.

40|$|Fatigue is an {{irreversible}} process, {{accompanied by}} microstructural changes, localized plastic strains and energy dissipation. The temperature increase of a metallic material undergoing a fatigue test is {{a manifestation of}} the thermal energy dissipation and it was experimentally observed that the higher the applied stress amplitude the more pronounced the temperature increase of the material. Moreover, the trend of the observed temperature increase versus the applied stress amplitude presents a more or less abrupt positive change at a certain stress level. This characteristic stress amplitude was associated to the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> [1 - 7]. Since the load-increasing tests are fast and a single specimens can be used to estimate the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> Risitano and co-workers set-up a rapid experimental methodology to determine the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> based on load-increasing tests monitored with an infrared camera, according to the so-called Risitano method [5]. It is known that due to plasticity, the stress amplitude and the material temperature waves present a phase shift. Therefore, taking advantage of the lock-in thermography, temperature oscillations due to dissipated energy, T 2, can be obtained as the component having double frequency of the load signal sine wave by using the classical Fourier analysis, as suggest by Krapez et al [8]. They proposed to use T 2, instead of the stabilized material temperature measured during a fatigue test in order to estimate the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> However, they noticed that the applicability of the method depends on the material under analysis. In particular, satisfactory results were found in the case of AISI 1050 steel and AISI 316 L stainless steel, while the approach was useless while investigating the fatigue behavior of 7010 aluminum alloy, since temperature signal associated with the dissipated energy was very weak in relation to the available experimental equipment. Aaki et al [9] proposed to use the dissipated energy, evaluated by using the lock-in thermography, to assess the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> They pointed out that satisfactory results were found in the case of AISI 316 L, while in the case of AISI 304 the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> estimated by dissipated energy measurements provided a conservative value as compared to that evaluated by means of <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> test. The phase shift angle was proposed as a suitable damage index for the rapid determination of material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> by Shiozawa et al [10]. They validated the approach against experimental results obtained from AISI 306 L stainless steel specimens and noticed a satisfactory agreement with the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> determined by the conventional stair-case tests. Recently, Shiozawa et al [11] proposed a new experimental technique for <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> estimation based on the phase 2 f lock-in infrared method, where a single fatigue test was performed on AISI 316 steel specimens by increasing the applied stress amplitude, a, and by measuring the in-creasing rate of the dissipated energy, dq/da. By plotting dq/da versus a, an abrupt increase is seen when a exceeds the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> Meneghetti [12] proposed an experimental technique for the direct evaluation of the heat energy density per cycle dissipated by a material undergoing a fatigue tests (the Q parameter). Q can be easily evaluated by stopping the fatigue test at t = t* after thermal equilibrium has been reached and by measuring the cooling gradient immediately after t*. Originally adopted to rationalise the notch effect in finite-life fatigue of stainless steel specimens [13], it is envisaged that the specific heat loss Q may be used also to estimate the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> This paper analyses all previous thermal methods for the rapid experimental estimation of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> In particular, the rapid engineering techniques proposed by La Rosa and Risitano [5], by Shiozawa et al [10] as well as by using the Q parameter [12] will be applied to estimate the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of cold-drawn AISI 304 L stainless steel bars and critical issues in practical applications of the analysed techniques will be singled out...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{knowledge}} of statistic characteristics in mechanical properties {{is important for}} designers {{in order to assess}} the reliability of structures. Scatter characteristics of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength for magnesium alloy were investigated in this study. At least 20 specimens were tested to obtain the scatter data of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength, respectively. The probability distributions of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength were evaluated by using Normal distribution and Weibull distribution function. The values of the Weibull modulus, m were 159, 10, 175 for <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that scatter of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is small and almost coincides with that of tensile strength, while scatter of fatigue life is significantly large compared to those of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> and tensile strength. The large scatter of fatigue life will be due to crack nucleation and small crack growth processes, which strongly depend on local microstructure near the crack nucleation region...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT•To {{examine a}} {{possible}} contribution of hydrogen on the crack initiation and propagation behaviour of high strength bolt steel, ASTM A 490, fatigue tests {{was carried out}} under hydrogen environment. The <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> in air that is 300 MPa, disappears in hydrogen environment and shows unexpectedly low stress level around 50 MPa at 107 due to the subsurface development of mechanistic damage caused by hydrogen.

A thermomechanical treatment (TMT) in the temperature range of maximal dynamic strain ageing is an auspicious way to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of bearing steel SAE 52100. Successful attempts have been published for various materials states. The present investigation deals with the influence of non-metallic inclusions on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> and the possibility to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> by TMT. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of high strength steels increases by reducing {{the size of the}} non-metallic inclusions during steelmaking.

In the case of high cleanliness of the steel the origin of the fatigue cracks may be at any position in the matrix.

The reasons for this behaviour will be explained and the border of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of high strength steels will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractExperimental {{results have}} {{recently}} shown that failures at stress amplitude below the <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> and at Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) are possible. In case of high-strength steels, VHCF failures generally originate from defects/inclusions present within the material and, consequently, the defect population properties (size and quantity) significantly affect the VHCF response of high-strength steels. Different refinement processes are commonly adopted {{in order to}} improve steel cleanliness: among the other, the ElectroSlag Remelting (ESR) process allows to obtain very clean high-strength steels, thus possibly inducing a significant enhancement of the VHCF response. The present paper aims at investigating the actual effect of the ESR process on the VHCF behavior of an AISI H 13 steel. Fully reversed ultrasonic tension-compression tests are carried out on hourglass specimens manufactured with and without the ESR process.

To rapidly reach the VHCF regime, the ultrasonic fatigue technique has been used with the hourglass shaped plate specimen in commercial CuOF 99. 95 % copper.

40|$|AbstractTo {{achieve a}} high <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> {{the most common}} {{approach}} {{is to increase the}} static strength and hardness of a material. This is realized mostly by decreasing microstructural dimensions as the grain size or the spacing between phases in more phase materials. According to the Hall-Petch-relationship the static strength is increased by that way. Simultaneously, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> which is defined by the non-propagation of cracks, increases with decreasing microstructural dimensions. The reason is that microstructurally small cracks are stopped at microstructural barriers so that smaller distances between neighboring barriers reduce the length of non-propagating cracks and increase the intrinsic <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> But this increase of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is confined by the dimensions of the flaws within the material, such as non-metallic inclusions or geometrical notches, which reduce the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of high strength materials significantly. The trade-off between small microstructural dimensions and the dimensions of the flaws will be discussed on the basis of experimental results in three examples. Firstly, commercial pure titanium shows a distinct change of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> not before the notches are larger than the grain sizes, although the stress intensity at the notches is significant [1]. Secondly, micro notches in high strength materials always result in a huge decrease of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> [2]. Thirdly, as bulk metallic glasses do not possess microstructural barriers like grain boundaries notches are a crucial factor in this class of materials [3]. On the basis of these examples and the modified Kitagawa-Takahashi diagram [4] a new approach to explain the microstructure and notch influence on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> will be presented. This could be the basis for future developments to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of metals...|$|R

Since two different fracture modes, i. e. surface slip type and fish-eye type, coexisted, fatigue life distribution was scattered at the stress level of the horizontal line.

Results show that this steel represents the duplex S-N (stress-number of cycles) characteristics without <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> related to 107 cycles.

Especially laser additive manufacturing (LAM) enables the production of metallic parts with mechanical properties comparable to conventionally manufactured components. Due to the high geometrical freedom in LAM the technology enables the production of ultra-light weight designs and therefore gains increasing importance in aircraft and space industry. The high quality standards of these industries demand predictability of material properties for static and dynamic load cases. However, fatigue properties especially in the very high cycle fatigue regime until 10 9 cycles have not been sufficiently determined yet. Therefore this paper presents an analysis of fatigue properties of laser additive manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V under cyclic tension-tension until 10 7 cycles and tension-compression load until 10 9 cycles. For the analysis of laser additive manufactured titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V Woehler fatigue tests under tension-tension and tension-compression were carried out in the high cycle and very high cycle fatigue regime. Specimens in stress-relieved as well as hot-isostatic-pressed conditions were analyzed regarding crack initiation site, mean stress sensitivity and overall fatigue performance.

This COV value was comparable to that of 0. 6 for the tensile strength of the same material. Therefore, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for the extruded material has small enough scatter to be considered as the material property similar to the tensile strength that can be determined from the average value of 2 - 3 samples...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the effect of defect {{orientation}} on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of three types of steels; JIS-S 15 C, JIS-S 45 C and JIS-SNCM 439, a small semi-circular slit was introduced into {{the surface of a}} round specimen. The slits were tilted at 0 ∘, 30 ∘ or 60 ∘ with respect to the plane normal to the loading axis, but all of them had the same defect size, a⃗r⃗e⃗a⃗ See Formula in PDF = 188 [*]μm, where the area denotes the area of the domain defined by projecting the defect on a plane normal to the loading axis. In all the combinations of the materials and tilting angles, a non-propagating crack was found at the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> i. e. the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was determined by the non-propagation condition of crack initiated from the defect. In JIS-S 15 C and JIS-S 45 C, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was nearly independent of the tilting angle, which was in good agreement with the predicted value by the a⃗r⃗e⃗a⃗ See Formula in PDF parameter model. On the other hand, in JIS-SNCM 439, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was also in agreement with the prediction at the tilting angle of 0 ∘, but it increased with an increase in the tilting angle. These results indicated that the a⃗r⃗e⃗a⃗ See Formula in PDF parameter model can predict a conservative <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for the tilted defects. In this paper, the mechanistic reason for the effect of the tilting angle on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> will be discussed by paying special attention to the crack path and length of non-propagating crack...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB and aimed {{to optimize the}} effect of shot peening {{in order to increase}} the bending <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of planetary gears. In this project three parameters affecting the performance of the shot peening were examined in more detail, specifically the hardness of the shot peening media, the hardness of the material and the amount retained austenite. Shot peening and measurements were performed on carburized gears consisting of ss 92506 steel. In order to find out how the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is affected by the material hardness, a number of gears were tempered whereas other remained untempered. Similarly the retained austenite content was altered in some of the gears with a cryotreatment. The shot peening of these gears {{was performed}} by dual shot peening using media of two different hardness. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was evaluated by a servo hydraulic material testing machine. The results show that the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is enhanced when the shot peening was performed with hard media. This was expected since the harder media can cause larger plastic deformation in the material giving rise to larger compressive residual stresses which is known to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was also improved for samples with lower surface hardness. The amount of retained austenite does not seem to affect the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for samples shot peened with media of sufficient hardness in order to cause adequate plastic deformation. The surface roughness remained unchanged for samples shot peened by different media, which indicates that this parameter should not hinder a change of media...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} increment of {{the required}} design lifetime for many machinery components and the experimental evidence that materials could fail at stress amplitudes below the <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> {{have led to a}} growing interest {{in the study of the}} Very-High-Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) behavior of materials. Experimental results showed that materials in the VHCF regime could fail generally due to cracks nucleating around defects within the material (internal nucleation). Therefore, it is generally acknowledged in the literature that the VHCF response of materials is strongly affected by the defect population and, in particular, by the characteristic defect size, which statistically increases with the material volume. According to this well-known dependency, experimental results showed that the larger the loaded volume (risk-volume), the smaller the VHCF strength (size effect). However, a significant increment of the risk-volume is not possible with common specimen shapes used for ultrasonic tests. As a consequence, size effect at large risk-volumes is generally statistically predicted, without any experimental validation. The thesis proposes a new experimental approach for the assessment of size effect in the VHCF regime. Fully reversed tension-compression tests were carried out on specimens with significantly different risk-volumes (hourgalss and Gaussian specimens) by using the ultrasonic testing machines developed at Politecnico di Torino during the Ph. D. The experimental results were analyzed by considering and integrating the well-known statistical models proposed in the literature. A methodology for obtaining reliable and conservative predictions of the VHCF response of materials at different risk-volumes is proposed and discussed in the thesis. Finally, a simple numerical-experimental procedure for the design of components subjected to VHCF failures and characterized by large risk-volumes is propose...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhen ductile {{single-phase}} {{metallic materials}} {{are subjected to}} stress magnitudes lower than the <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> the number of cycles to failure is higher than 109, the so-called very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime. This works aims at studying the mechanism leading to crack initiation. The main challenge of this work results {{from the fact that}} the manifestations of the mechanisms of interest give rise to very low and localized signal owing to the very low stress magnitudes involved. To rapidly reach the VHCF regime, the ultrasonic fatigue technique has been used with the hourglass shaped plate specimen in commercial CuOF 99. 95 % copper. Using infrared thermography techniques, the temperature field at the specimen surface was measured during the fatigue test up to 108 cycles. Then, the dissipation in the variable section part of the specimen was calculated using a diffusion model. Moreover, the other surface was observed using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) after interrupted tests at 106, 107 and 108 cycles, respectively. At stress lower than 35 MPa, we did not observe any change of the specimen surface despite a significant self-heating induced by dissipation, whatever the number of cycles. For stress higher than 35 MPa, localized slip band appeared on the specimen surface and high dissipation zones were detected. The dissipation was found to increase higher and faster with increasing applied stress. The amount of slip bands observed on the specimen surface followed the same trend. In addition, two types of slip bands were observed: straight, concentrated, intensive slip bands and fine, spreading slip bands. These results suggested different plasticity behaviors of material which were correlated to the work of Stanzl-Tschegg and Schönbauer [9] who determined VHCF Persistent Slip Bands threshold at 45 MPa...|$|E
40|$|The DISFAT {{project is}} a French project financially {{supported}} by the French National Agency for Research (ANR). It aims at {{a deeper understanding of}} mechanisms leading to crack initiation in metals and alloys under Very High Cycle Fatigue loading (VHCF). The VHCF regime is associated with stress magnitudes lower than the <b>conventional</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> and as a result, numbers of cycles higher than 109. Tests were carried out using an ultrasonic technique at loading frequency of 20 kHz. In the case of pure copper polycrystals, we previously showed that slip band (SB) activity and intrinsic dissipation were closely related. Dissipation and slip band amount increased with the number of cycles. At very small stress amplitudes, no slip band appeared at the specimen surface up to 108 cycles but the material was found to dissipate energy. These results revealed that the material never reached a steady state and so could break at higher number of cycles. In this paper, the morphology and the location of slip bands were characterized. Different types of slip bands depending on the stress amplitudes appeared at the specimen surface. The stress amplitude required to show the first slip bands decreases with the number of cycles. It is twice lower than the stress amplitude required to break the specimen for the same number of cycles. At the smallest stress amplitudes, slip bands were mostly found at twin boundaries. Quasi 3 D finite element simulations taking into account the polycrystalline nature of the material emphasized the key role of the elastic anisotropy in slip band initiation. A criterion for slip band appearance was finally proposed.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a new <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> {{estimation}} {{scheme for}} {{austenitic stainless steel}} based on the dissipated energy is proposed. The new scheme utilizes the phase 2 f lock-in infrared method which is a technique for improving the accuracy of a dissipated energy measurement, and evaluates the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> based on the increasing rate of dissipated energy. This scheme {{is applied to the}} pre-strained austenitic stainless steel specimen. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of austenitic stainless steel specimen is increased by the plastic forming process. The phase 2 f lock-in infrared method can remove the apparent dissipated energy which is caused by thermoelastic temperature change due to harmonic vibration of fatigue testing machine. The estimation scheme based on the increasing rate of dissipated energy against the stress level can evaluate the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of the pre-strained specimen with greater accuracy than the conventional scheme...|$|R

Low frequency loading (to the 200 Hz) has nearly no influence on the fatigue properties in almost all cases. Hight frequency loading (1 and more kHz) has major influence on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of the structural materials. This interference will disply like increasing of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> For example <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of steel is more affected by hight frequency loading than the cast-iron. Important aspect at hight frequency loading is rising temperature in the loading process. Rising temperature has negative influence on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of materials. Important aspect of the loading high frequency is possibility to achieved gigacycle regime of the fatigue (109 and more cycles), where should appear crack from below surface.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the estimation of}} the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of components weakened either by U- and V-shaped notches or by defects, all under mode I stress distributions. When {{the influence of the}} opening angle is absent, a single formula is able to summarise both the notch sensitivity and the sensitivity to defects. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> assessments need two material parameters, namely the plain <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> and the threshold value of the long crack stress intensity factor range. The formula is compared with about 90 <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> taken from the literature. Material properties and specimen geometries are given in detail. Afterwards, in the case of V-notches with large opening angles, the formula is modified, but without involving additional material parameters. A generalised Kitagawa diagram is obtained, that encompasses fatigue behaviour of stress raisers of different size, opening angle and notch tip radius...|$|R
