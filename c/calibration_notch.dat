40|$|Recent work on model-based inverse methods with {{eddy current}} {{inspections}} of surface breaking discontinuities has shown some sizing error due to variability in probes {{with the same}} design specifications [1]. This is an important challenge for model-based inversion crack sizing techniques, to be robust to the varying characteristics of eddy current probes found in the field [1 - 2]. In this paper, a model-based calibration process is introduced that estimates {{the state of the}} probe. First, a carefully designed surrogate model was built using VIC- 3 D® simulations covering the critical range of probe rotation angles, tilt in two directions, and probe offset (liftoff) for both tangential and longitudinal flaw orientations. Some approximations and numerical compromises in the model were made to represent tilt in two directions and reduce simulation time; however, this surrogate model was found to represent the key trends in the eddy current response {{for each of the four}} probe properties in experimental verification studies well. Next, this model was incorporated into an iterative inversion scheme during the calibration process, to estimate the probe state while also addressing the gain/phase fit and centering the <b>calibration</b> <b>notch</b> indication. Results are presented showing several examples of the blind estimation of tilt and rotation angle for known experimental cases with good agreement within +/- 2. 5 degrees. The RMS error was found to be significantly reduced by fitting the probe state and, in many instances, probe state estimation addresses the previously un-modelled characteristics (model error) with real probe inversion studies. Additional studies are presented comparing the size of the <b>calibration</b> <b>notch</b> and the quality of the calibration fit, where calibrating with too small or too large a notch can produce poorer inversion results. Once the probe state is estimated, the final step is to transform the base crack inversion surrogate model and apply it for crack characterization. Because of the dimensionality of this problem, simulations were made at a limited set of select flaw sizes with varying length, depth and width, and an interpolation scheme was used to address the effect of the probe state at intermediate solution points. Using this process, results are presented demonstrating improved crack inversion performance for extreme probe states...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear Fuel {{cladding}} pipes {{are long}} and thin tubes made of zirconium-alloy whose purpose is to confine the fissile material in a nuclear reactor. During their 3 year cycle in the reactor 2 ̆ 7 s core they must maintain their integrity while enduring severe stresses (heat, corrosion and irradiation). Nondestructive evaluations are performed at several stages of the manufacturing process. ASTM International provides recommendations regarding the Ultrasonic Testing (UT) of zirconium cladding pipes {{at the end of}} the production line[1]. The recommended setup is a pulse-echo immersion testing at frequency higher than 5 MHz where transverse and longitudinal calibration notches are used for defining alert levels with sufficient margins. AREVA NP 2 ̆ 7 s project is to build a numerical model of this UT in order to enhance the selectivity of the tests and reduce the cost of over-quality. This model is based on the hybridization of a semi-analytic method and a Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. They are used in conjunction with a time domain reciprocity equation which allows to back-propagate the signal from a line close to the metallic pipe as well as around a potential crack (fig. 1). Results for two positions of the back-propagation line are compared with an experimental signal recorded in a water tank (fig. 2). The flaw used in this study case is a rectangular longitudinal <b>calibration</b> <b>notch.</b> This result is the first step towards an efficient computation of received signals for many different crack positions and geometries...|$|E

They are subject to instability issues due to acoustic feedback, and are often installed permanently in large halls, sometimes at great cost. In this paper, we explore the possibility of implementing a cost-effective reverberation enhancement system to control the acoustics of typical rooms {{using a combination of}} spatial filtering, automatic <b>calibration,</b> adaptive <b>notch</b> filters, howling detection and manual adjustments. The effectiveness of the system is then tested inside a small soundproof booth. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Eddy current {{nondestructive}} testing methods are effective {{for the detection}} of cracks in conducting materials. However, to insure that the detection is reliable an accurate reference standard must be used in instrument <b>calibration.</b> Electrical-discharge-machined (EDM) <b>notches</b> have been used as a reference standard for fatigue cracks (1, 2). However, many researchers argue that an EDM notch gives a larger signal than an actual fatigue crack (3, 4) and thus cannot be used as an equivalent model. Much of the previous research on this topic was done with a probe over a flat block. This paper discusses the case of a probe inside a tube with cracks growing from the outer diameter. The focus of this investigation is to compare actual fatigue crack signals with signals from EDM notches and a finite element simulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{numerical}} simulations {{and experimental}} tests are {{performed on the}} Al 6061 laser welded joints. In order to identify the dimensions of different weld regions, hardness tests are performed across the welded joint. Mechanical properties of different weld regions are obtained from tensile test results of flat specimens extracted from the base material (BM), the fusion zone (FZ) and from the heat affected zone (HAZ), respectively. Fracture toughness tests are performed on compact tension specimens (C(T)) with the initial crack located in the BM, {{in the center of}} the FZ and at the interface between the FZ and the HAZ, respectively. The Rousselier model is employed to study the ductile fracture behavior of Al 6061 laser welded joints numerically. Based on metallographic investigations and numerical <b>calibration</b> results for <b>notched</b> round specimens, the initial void volume fraction () and the average void distance (lc) for the Rousselier model can be fixed for the BM, the FZ and the HAZ. The same Rousselier parameters are used to predict crack propagation in C(T) specimens with different initial crack positions. Computer simulations are compared to the experimental results in terms of force vs. Crack Opening Displacement (COD) as well as fracture resistance JR curves. It is concluded that the Rousselier model can predict well ductile crack growth in the weld joint...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey is}} made of analytic, {{experimental}} and numerical techniques {{in the field of}} the dynamic initiation, and early propagation, of cracks. As no closed form analytic solutions exist for finite geometries, even in the elastic case, numerical and experimental techniques have to be developed. In instrumented impact tests plasticity often occurs. The specific problem of the Instrumented Charpy Test is discussed in detail by virtue of its technological significance and the extensive literature available for the test. Although a standard for the test has been proposed there are still outstanding questions to be answered, for which the techniques described above can be used. The problem of the dynamic <b>calibration</b> of various <b>notched</b> geometries is addressed in the original work of the thesis. The Charpy, Izod, Slender Cantilever and Double Notched Bar geometries are studied using dynamic photoelasticity and 8000 fps photography. It is shown that the response of the DNB is more straightforward than the Charpy geometry. Further photoelastic study of the latter two geometries, using epoxy model material and 10 6 fps photography, gives a quantitative measure of the growth of stress intensity factor at the notch tips and hence a dynamic calibration is deduced. An explicit finite difference code is used to supplement photoelastic data. Having achieved progress in the derivation of the dynamic calibration of the two selected geometries, corresponding instrumented impact tests are then undertaken. The Hopkinson Pressure Bar method of loading is used. It is concluded that the proposed standard for the Instrumented Charpy Test is valid within limits but that there is a requirement for a dynamic calibration. Such a calibration is complex {{in the case of the}} Charpy geometry whereas a simpler geometry, viz. DNB, could prove to be more amenable to analysis and hence be more practical from the technological point of view. </p...|$|R
