5|$|Caroming the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> off {{one or both}} object {{balls and}} then into the bottle {{knocking}} onto its base results in an automatic win.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{sometimes}} {{played with the}} larger and heavier (and unnumbered) carom billiard balls instead of pocket billiard balls. Such is the case at the Union Club and was also at the University of Michigan Billiards & Games Room, where the faculty devoted {{most of their time}} to bottle pool. Not incidentally three-cushion billiards, which uses these larger balls, was also a mainstay in that room and touring three-cushion professional Carl Conlon was a fixture there until his death in 1997. In this variation, a solid-yellow (or dotted) second <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> is used in place of the 1 ball, and the red ball, known traditionally as the , is used in place of the 2 ball. The use of such balls makes scoring by caroms easier, but makes pocketing balls (and scratching) more difficult because the larger balls must still be made in the ordinarily-sized pool pockets.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{initially}} achieve a sliding <b>cue</b> <b>ball,</b> a middle-ball hit is employed. The more {{speed with which}} the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> is hit in this manner, the longer the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> will slide before picking up natural forward roll from cloth friction. However, because of this tendency of the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> to acquire follow from friction, in order to deliver a sliding <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> to an object ball at a distance, the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> must be precisely hit with the necessary degree of draw {{so that by the}} time it reaches the object ball, the draw has dissipated and the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> is sliding at the moment of impact.|$|E

5000|$|Carom billiards {{balls are}} larger than pool balls, having a {{diameter}} of 61.5 mm ( [...] in), and come {{as a set of}} two <b>cue</b> <b>balls</b> (one colored or marked) and an object ball (or two object balls {{in the case of the}} game four-ball).|$|R

25|$|If the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> hits {{an object}} ball {{at an angle}} and has follow on it, the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> will first travel on the tangent line and then parabolically arc forward from the tangent line in the {{direction}} of <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> travel. By the same token, when such impact is made and the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> has draw on it, the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> will first travel on the tangent line and then parabolically arc backward from the tangent line in the opposite direction of <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> travel. Whether follow or draw is on the <b>cue</b> <b>ball,</b> the faster the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> is traveling at the moment of impact, the farther it will travel on the tangent line before arcing forward or backward.|$|E
25|$|Much steeper {{curves and}} even {{reversal}} of <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> direction {{can be achieved}} with a massé (below).|$|E

5000|$|In goriziana, nine pins sit in {{the center}} of the table. Three balls are used, of which two are <b>cue</b> <b>balls.</b> The game is played by two teams of one or two players. Each team or player aims to hit the opponent's ball and, from there, score points by {{striking}} the red ball, or by making the opponent's balls or the red ball knock over the pins.|$|R
5000|$|Cushion caroms (or cushion carom billiards) {{sometimes}} called by its original name, the indirect game, is a carom billiards discipline generally {{played on a}} cloth-covered, 5 foot × 10 foot, pocketless table with two <b>cue</b> <b>balls</b> and a third red-colored ball. The game is sometimes incorrectly referred to as one-cushion or one-cushion billiards, which is the direct translation of its name into English from various other languages such as Spanish ("una banda") and German ("Einband").|$|R
5000|$|Until {{the late}} 1980s, the game (with some rules differences) {{was a form}} of pocket billiards, known in English as Italian skittle pool, and was principally played in pubs, with an object ball that was smaller than the two <b>cue</b> <b>balls.</b> [...] Professional and {{regulated}} amateur play today exclusively uses pocketless tables and equal-sized balls. Professional competition began in 1965, and play is centered in billiard parlors, with players competing in provincial, regional, and national federations. [...] The pocket version is still favored by some in amateur play.|$|R
25|$|Follow also {{increases}} {{the rate of}} <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> travel, {{both before and after}} object-ball impact, and actually imparts a small amount of draw to the object ball.|$|E
25|$|Kinetic energy can {{be passed}} from one object to another. In the game of billiards, the player imposes kinetic energy on the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> by {{striking}} it with the cue stick. If the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> collides with another ball, it slows down dramatically and the ball it collided with accelerates to a speed as the kinetic energy is passed on to it. Collisions in billiards are effectively elastic collisions, in which kinetic energy is preserved. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is dissipated in various forms of energy, such as heat, sound, binding energy (breaking bound structures).|$|E
25|$|A shorter baton {{that fits}} over, or screws into, {{the back end}} of the cue, {{effectively}} lengthening it. Is used for shots where the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> is a long distance from the player.|$|E
50|$|Cowboy is {{very similar}} to thirty-eight, with the major {{difference}} being that thirty-eight requires the use of two <b>cue</b> <b>balls</b> and is played to just 38 points, thus its name. It is unknown how thirty-eight transitioned to the modified ruleset mandated by cowboy pool, nor the derivation of its name. What is known is that its first mention is in a 1908 rule book, published about the same time the well-known game eight-ball (under a prior name) was first gaining popularity. Although popular enough that its rules remain listed in authoritative rule books alongside just a handful of other games, apart from a small sanctioned tournament held in 1914, cowboy pool is strictly an amateur game.|$|R

50|$|Jerry then {{runs away}} as Tom shoots {{a stream of}} balls at him, which chase Jerry {{in and out of}} various pockets. The balls then chase Jerry on their own accord, but Jerry jumps on Tom and opens his mouth, causing Tom to swallow all seven balls. Jerry then flees into a corner pocket, and Tom pokes his cue through it, but Jerry {{attaches}} a hatpin to the tip of the cue, which strikes Tom when he pokes again, causing Tom to rise yelling in pain and then fall into the hole at a corner. Jerry then tidies the rack, with all fifteen balls inside it, and hits them all. The <b>cue</b> <b>balls</b> all fall into holes except for the 1-ball; when Jerry whacks Tom with the cue, Tom screams and ends up swallowing it before the cartoon closed.|$|R
25|$|Both {{varieties}} of throw are highly influenced by speed. Generally, the less momentum the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> possesses {{at the time}} of impact, the more that throw will affect the object ball's resultant path of travel.|$|E
25|$|Draw {{applied to}} a non-dead-on shot will cause the angle of {{departure}} of the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> from the object ball to narrow shortly after impact. Similarly, it will cause a narrowing of the cue ball's rebound angle after impact with a rail cushion.|$|E
25|$|Because swerve and {{deflection}} (for {{very different}} reasons) each cause the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> {{to take a}} different path than aimed, but each does so in the opposite direction of the other, under the right conditions swerve and deflection can cancel each other out.|$|E
50|$|In October 2010, {{the prison}} was placed under {{lockdown}} {{after a night}} of violence and rioting involving more than 70 inmates. It started when a number of prisoners attacked three prison officers with pool <b>cues</b> and <b>balls</b> during recreation. Reinforcements were brought in from around Dublin to quell the riot and a number of Alsatians from the riot unit were also deployed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final element}} was the [...] (or [...] ) shot, {{which came from}} carom or carambole billiards, a three-ball game popular in various {{countries}} of western Continental Europe, especially popularized by France (and today also popular {{in many parts of}} Asia and South America). In the 1700s, the carambole game added a red [...] to the two white <b>cue</b> <b>balls,</b> and dispensed with the pockets. This ball was adopted into the English game, which retained the pockets, and the goal was to cannon off both the red and the opponent's ball on a single shot, earning 2 points. This influence on the English game appears to have come about through the popularity of French tables in English coffee houses; London alone had over two thousand such establishments in the early 18th century. One period advertisement read: [...] "A very good French Billiard Table, little the worse for wearing, full size, with all the materials fit for French or English play".|$|R
500|$|Carom billiard cues have {{specialized}} refinements {{making them}} {{different from the}} typical pool cue with which many people are more familiar.

The specialization makes the cue significantly stiffer, which aids in handling the larger and heavier billiard balls as compared with pool cues. It also acts to reduce [...] (sometimes called [...] "squirt"), which may be defined as displacement of the <b>cue</b> <b>ball's</b> path away from the parallel line formed by the cue stick's direction of travel. It is a factor that occurs every time [...] (...) is employed, and its effects are magnified by speed. In some carom games, deflection plays a large role because many shots require extremes of , coupled with great speed; this is a combination typically minimized as much as possible, by contrast, in pool. The wood used in carom cues can vary widely, and most quality carom cues are handmade.|$|R
25|$|Usually housed {{underneath}} {{the side of}} the table, the half butt is a combination of a table length rest and cue which is rarely used unless the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> needs to be struck {{in such a way that}} the entire length of the table is the actual obstacle.|$|E
25|$|In carom games, an {{advanced}} player's aim on most shots {{is to leave}} the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> and the object balls in position so that the next shot is of a less difficult variety to make the requisite , and so that the next shot is in position to be manipulated in turn for yet another shot; ad infinitum.|$|E
25|$|Ranked 11 at {{the start}} of the 2001/2002 season, White {{performed}} steadily in the ranking events without reaching a semi-final. In the invitational 2002 Masters he beat Matthew Stevens 6–1 and came back from 2–5 behind to defeat O'Sullivan 6–5 in the quarter-finals. He similarly recovered from 2–5 down in his semi-final with Mark Williams but lost 5–6. He lost 3–13 in his second-round match with Matthew Stevens at the 2002 World Championship and issued an immediate apology after hitting the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> off the table in frustration when trailing 2–5.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of self-talk on motor learning in beginners. The learning task was the forehand stroke in tennis. Eighty-four students were assigned into five self-talk groups and one control group. One of the self-talk groups used four cues for directing attention to key elements of the forehand stroke. The other self-talk groups made use of only one of the four <b>cues</b> (<b>ball,</b> bounce, hit, and ready), and the control group received only general instructions. In the acquisition phase, all groups performed 180 trials over three days. Then they performed a transfer test of 10 trials involving a change in the target direction. After five days they performed a retention test in the same conditions of the acquisition phase. The performance was analysed in terms of rates of success and consistency of the forehand hit to the target located on the opponent’s court. Results showed that all groups improved their performances in the acquisition phase, and that they maintained the improvement in the retention and transfer tests. However, no differences were found between the groups. It was concluded that self-talk did not affect the learning of forehand stroke in tennis. In addition, learning with self-talk with four cues was similar to that with selftalk with only one cue...|$|R

25|$|Unintentional small jumps are {{ubiquitous}} to billiards. In most billiards shots, a player's cue {{is slightly}} elevated. Whenever a ball is struck with an elevated cue, a jump, {{no matter how}} slight, occurs. An oft-used way to illustrate this principle is to lay a coin on the table approximately an inch {{in front of the}} <b>cue</b> <b>ball.</b> When shot very softly, the player will audibly hear the coin being struck and see the cue ball's reaction to that collision. When the same shot is performed with any degree of speed no sound or collision is evident, and {{it is clear that the}} coin is being jumped.|$|E
25|$|His record {{break of}} 4,137 {{was made in}} a match he lost against Joe Davis at Thurston Hall on 19 January 1932. However, this precipitated {{a change in the}} rules of the game. As this break mostly {{consisted}} of long runs of close cannons (a total of 902 cannons were scored), the Billiards Control Council established the first version of the baulk-line-rule, in which the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> had to cross the baulk line every 200 points during a break. A 1932 tour of the United States and Canada by several players, including Lindrum, proved a disaster, with disappointing attendances and financial losses by the players.|$|E
25|$|In {{physical}} simulation, we wish {{to conduct}} experiments, such as playing billiards. The physics of bouncing billiard balls are well understood, {{under the umbrella of}} rigid body motion and elastic collisions. An initial description of the situation would be given, with a very precise physical description of the billiard table and balls, as well as initial positions of all the balls. Given a force applied to the <b>cue</b> <b>ball</b> (probably resulting from a player hitting the ball with his or her cue stick), we want to calculate the trajectories, precise motion, and eventual resting places of all the balls with a computer program. A program to simulate this game would consist of several portions, one of which would be responsible for calculating the precise impacts between the billiard balls. This particular example also turns out to be ill conditioned: a small error in any calculation will cause drastic changes in the final position of the billiard balls.|$|E

50|$|Cue Club 2 expands on the {{original}} game with new artwork, additional characters, table designs, <b>cues</b> and <b>ball</b> sets. Both the size and design of the <b>cues</b> and <b>balls</b> can be modified. The table cloth, pockets and rails can also be customized, along {{with the speed of}} the table. The method of cueing may also be adjusted. Additionally, players are able to choose from a selection of colored chalk. The developers state that the physics engine has been overhauled and the A.I. of the computer opponents significantly improved. Two new bonus games have been added, including a revised Slam mode, where balls can be swung round on a length of cord, and also Detonator mode where the balls explode on impact (which was formerly a cheat option in {{the original}} Cue Club). Players can save shots and replay them at a variety of speeds, and also save their highest snooker breaks and speed pool times in the Hall of Fame, and watch these performances back later. A selection of nine new soundtracks were also composed for the title, serving as background music to complement gameplay. In an attempt to stay true to its roots the developers retained recognizable styling elements from the first game, but made several important technical improvements to enable support for widescreen and touchscreen monitors, and also 1080p High Definition graphics and 4K displays. The software is capable of supporting multiple resolutions depending on the user's current Windows desktop settings, and adaptive scaling ensures that the table fills the screen, irrespective of the aspect ratio, with no stretching or image distortion.|$|R
