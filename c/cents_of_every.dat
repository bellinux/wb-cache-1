500|$|During {{the first}} year of implementation, the FairTax {{legislation}} would apply a 23% federal retail sales tax on the total transaction value of a purchase; in other words, consumers pay to the government 23 <b>cents</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> dollar spent in total (sometimes called tax-inclusive, and presented this way to provide a direct comparison with individual income and employment taxes which reduce a person's available money before they can make purchases). The equivalent assessed tax rate is 30% if the FairTax is applied to the pre-tax price of a good like traditional U.S. state sales taxes (sometimes called tax-exclusive; this rate is not directly comparable with existing income and employment taxes). [...] After {{the first year}} of implementation, this tax rate would be automatically adjusted annually using a formula specified in the legislation that reflects actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.|$|E
2500|$|Mississauga Mayor Hazel McCallion {{went further}} by issuing a {{challenge}} to Flaherty to publicly debate the need for permanent federal funding for the repair and upkeep of municipal roads and bridges. McCallion said [...] "Flaherty has stated in the media {{that some of the}} municipalities have not kept up with infrastructure and did not establish adequate reserves. Well, I can tell him that he is dead wrong. The facts are that Mississauga has carefully set aside reserves for infrastructure for years." [...] McCallion noted that cities are trying to maintain 58 per cent of public infrastructure with eight <b>cents</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> tax dollar. Flaherty did not accept Hazel McCallion's offer to debate.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2013, Pierre Lavallée, {{president}} of BPR Inc., {{testified before the}} Charbonneau Commission on corruption in Montreal's construction sector. He stated that his firm had tried to expand its Montreal operations in the early 2000s, but {{had been unable to}} make much progress until meeting with political fundraiser Bernard Trépanier and being told to funnel three per <b>cent</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> project they won to the Union Montreal municipal party. Lavallée testified that he found this arrangement [...] "shameful and degrading" [...] but had been advised by a prominent employee that his firm would not otherwise be successful. BPR allegedly agreed to the kickback scheme and funneled between $145,000 and $155,000 to the party.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLet Pn(m) be the {{proportion}} of the (m!) n n-tuples of linear orders on a set of m candidates {{in which there is a}} candidate x who is ranked ahead of candidate y in more than n/ 2 of the orders in the n-tuple for each y ≠ x. New approaches are used to extend significantly the known values of Pn(m) for small odd n and for small m. The new values along with previously computed values are used to construct a simple approximation for Pn(m) that applies to all odd n ≥ 3 and all 3 ≤ m < 50. The approximation is within one-half <b>of</b> one per <b>cent</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> known value <b>of</b> Pn(m) for which n ≥ 3 and 3 ≤ m < 50...|$|R
50|$|The {{rift between}} Williams and Patton became {{permanent}} during negotiations {{over the state}} budget in 1999. Patton proposed to Williams a 7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, with 1 <b>cent</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> 7 dedicated to counties with the most unpaved roads - usually heavily Republican counties ignored by past Democratic governors. Patton claimed Williams {{told him he had}} 10 votes in the Senate for the increase. But gas prices spiked before the measure came to a vote in the Senate, and Williams failed to deliver his votes after the House passed the tax. The administration and key Republican senators reached a compromise that saved Patton's budget with tax changes that were mostly revenue-neutral. Patton believed Williams had deliberately misled him, however, and the two never reconciled.|$|R

30|$|The {{situation}} is similar {{with respect to}} EITCs. Many studies - mainly for the US - have exploited the natural experiment that only some groups (mainly single mothers) have received the tax credit. Using difference-in-differences techniques, large employment effects on the extensive margin (the number of employed persons) have been identified (see e.g. Hotz and Scholz [2003] and Eissa and Hoynes [2006]). The effects have been interpreted as labour supply effects even though higher labour force participation can be translated into higher employment only if wages fall such that an increased labour demand is forthcoming. Indeed, a few studies, including Rothstein ([2008]), Azmat ([2009]) and Leigh ([2010]), have found that EITCs cause substantial wage reductions. Rothstein finds that low-skilled mothers in the US keep only 70 per <b>cent</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> dollar they receive in EITC because of wage falls. Azmat {{comes up with a}} similar estimate for male claimants of the Working Family Tax Credit in the UK. Leigh’s finding is that a 10 per cent increase in the generosity of the EITC in the US causes wage reductions <b>of</b> 5 per <b>cent</b> for high-school drop-outs and 2 per cent for those with only a high-school diploma.|$|R
60|$|For {{the next}} six weeks the {{movements}} of the two forces resembled a game of hide-and-seek. Ahmed Fedil, concealed in the dense forest and jungle of the east bank, raided the surrounding villages and worked his way gradually towards the Rosaires Cataract. Colonel Lewis, perplexed by false and vague information, remained halted at Karkoj, despatched vain reconnaissances in the hopes of obtaining reliable news, revolved deep schemes to cut off the raiding parties, or patrolled the river in the gunboats. And meanwhile sickness fell upon his force. The malarial fever, which is everywhere prevalent on the Blue Nile in the autumn, was now at its height. More than 30 per <b>cent</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> garrison and every post were affected. The company holding Rosaires were stricken to a man, and only the two British officers remained fit for duty. The cavalry force which had marched through the Ghezira suffered the most severely. One after another every British officer was stricken down and lay burning but helpless beneath the palm-leaf shelters or tottered on to the friendly steamers that bore the worst cases north. Of the 460 men who composed the force, ten had died and 420 were reported unfit for duty within a month of their arrival at Karkoj.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the federal}} level, Johnson {{believes}} the Department of Education should be abolished because federal control of state education funding negatively affects the states: {{he claims that}} 11 <b>cents</b> out <b>of</b> <b>every</b> dollar states spent on education comes from the Department of Education, but accepting the money comes with 16 <b>cents</b> <b>of</b> [...] "strings attached." [...] Johnson believes that block-granting education funds to the states without strings, thereby returning all control of education to the states, is the best choice, because it would create [...] "50 laboratories of innovation" [...] from which best practices would emerge. He believes that the No Child Left Behind Act and other [...] "federal mandates" [...] create a [...] "terrible" [...] system of education, and believes they should be repealed. He says that a [...] "homogenous" [...] national education system does not work.|$|R
