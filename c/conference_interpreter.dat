2500|$|Kolya Vasin, {{the founder}} of The Beatles museum and the Temple of Love, Peace and Music in St. Petersburg, commented that The Beatles [...] "were like an {{integrity}} test. When anyone said anything against them, we knew just what that person was worth. The authorities, our teachers, even our parents, became idiots to us." [...] Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union's government {{to prevent the spread}} of the Beatles' popularity amongst their citizens, the band proved to be as popular in the USSR as it was in Britain. The government went as far as censoring the expression of all Western ideals, including the Beatles' bourgeois eccentricity, limiting the Soviet citizens' access to their music. Leslie Woodland, a documentary film maker, commented regarding what the Russian people were told about the West – [...] "Once people heard the Beatles' wonderful music, it just didn't fit. The authorities' prognosis didn't correspond to what they were listening to. The system was built on fear and lies, and in this way, the Beatles put an end to the fear, and exposed the lies." [...] Pavel Palazchenko, Mikhail Gorbachev's <b>conference</b> <b>interpreter,</b> stated that the Beatles' music was a [...] "source of musical relief. They helped us create a world of our own, a world different from the dull and senseless ideological liturgy that increasingly reminded me of Stalinism...". Like Gorbachev, many Russian youth agreed that the Beatles were a way to overcome the cultural isolation imposed by the Cold War and reinforced by their current political system.|$|E

50|$|Conference {{interpretation}} is divided between two markets: institutional and private. International institutions (EU, UN, EPO, et cetera), which hold multilingual meetings, often favor interpreting several foreign languages into the interpreters' mother tongues. Local private markets {{tend to have}} bilingual meetings (the local language plus another), and the interpreters work both {{into and out of}} their mother tongues. These markets are not mutually exclusive. The International Association of <b>Conference</b> <b>Interpreters</b> (AIIC) is the only worldwide association of <b>conference</b> <b>interpreters.</b> Founded in 1953, its membership includes more than 2,800 professional <b>conference</b> <b>interpreters,</b> in more than 90 countries.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} status {{has so far}} {{received}} scant attention as a research topic in Interpreting Studies. Although several authors refer to conference interpreting as “one of the fairest and loftiest occupations in the world” (Herbert 1952 : 3), no empirical investigation {{has been carried out}} so far to assess the validity of the myths attached to the profession. Even though the majority of studies have focused almost exclusively on the status of translators, an empirical study carried out by Dam and Zethsen (2013) revealed that <b>conference</b> <b>interpreters</b> do not place themselves {{at the top of the}} status continuum, which means that conference interpreters’ considerations on status do not correspond to the assumptions found in literature on the high standing of the interpreting profession. This paper illustrates the findings of a global survey addressed to <b>conference</b> <b>interpreters</b> worldwide, filled out by 803 respondents, whose objective was to assess how <b>conference</b> <b>interpreters</b> perceive their occupational status and how they believe that conference interpreting is regarded in society. The theoretical framework draws insights from Social Theory and the Sociology of the Professions, which seek to shed light both on interpreters’ self-perception of their work and on how the interpreting profession is socially represented. status: publishe...|$|R
