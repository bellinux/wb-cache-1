In 1963, the first prototype, XP831, publicly crashed at the Paris Air Show; the accident had been caused by a speck of dirt in the air feed lines of the nozzle <b>control</b> <b>motor,</b> which had caused the engine nozzles to stick. XP831 was later fully repaired and resumed development flying. All the pilots involved survived.|$|E
25|$|The use of BMIs {{has also}} led to a deeper {{understanding}} of neural networks and the central nervous system. Research has shown that despite the inclination of neuroscientists to believe that neurons have the most effect when working together, single neurons can be conditioned through the use of BMIs to fire at a pattern that allows primates to <b>control</b> <b>motor</b> outputs. The use of BMIs has led to development of the single neuron insufficiency principle which states that even with a well tuned firing rate single neurons can only carry a narrow amount of information and therefore the highest level of accuracy is achieved by recording firings of the collective ensemble. Other principles discovered with the use of BMIs include the neuronal multitasking principle, the neuronal mass principle, the neural degeneracy principle, and the plasticity principle.|$|E

2500|$|The {{magazine}} wrote, [...] "In fact, the LFA hits 100 mph four-tenths {{faster than}} the GT-R — and just keeps going. As both flash past the quarter-mile marker, the LFA never looks back". The magazine also found the LFA to be superior in dynamic handling. Regarding challenges in launching the LFA with its automated transmission without having {{the ability to use}} its launch <b>control,</b> <b>Motor</b> Trend noted, [...] "It works, but not all of the time. A great launch means only a chirp of the tires and blistering acceleration, but vary the rpm just bit and the LFA torches its rubber before rocketing down the strip. A slight delay between paddle actuation and SMG response further complicates a fast start." [...] Motor Trend awarded the win in this comparison to Lexus LFA.|$|E
2500|$|Hyperkinesia, {{also known}} as hyperkinesis, refers to an {{increase}} in muscular activity that can result in excessive abnormal movements, excessive normal movements, or a combination of both. The word hyperkinesis comes from the Greek hyper, meaning [...] "increased," [...] and kinein, meaning [...] "to move." [...] Hyperkinesia is a state of excessive restlessness which is featured in a large variety of disorders that affect the ability to <b>control</b> <b>motor</b> movement, such as Huntington's disease. It is the opposite of hypokinesia, which refers to decreased bodily movement, as commonly manifested in Parkinson's disease. Many hyperkinetic movements are the result of improper regulation of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry. Overactivity of a direct pathway combined with decreased activity of an indirect pathway results in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons, resulting in increased motor output. Often, hyperkinesia is paired with hypotonia, a decrease in muscle tone. Many hyperkinetic disorders are psychological in nature and are typically prominent in childhood. Depending on the specific type of hyperkinetic movement, there are different treatment options available to minimize the symptoms, including different medical and surgical therapies.|$|E
