40|$|A new Volvo Penta {{carbureted}} 4. 3 GL engine underwent {{emissions and}} dynamometer durability testing from break-in to expected {{end of life}} using an accelerated ICOMIA marine emissions cycle and E 15 fuel. Only ethanol content was controlled. All aging used splash-blended E 15 fuel. Exhaust emissions, exhaust gas temperature, torque, power, barometric pressure, air temperature, and fuel flow were measured at five intervals using site-blended E 15 aging fuel and certification fuel (E 0). The durability test cycle showed no noticeable impact on mechanical durability or engine power. Emissions performance degraded beyond the certification limit for this engine family, mostly occurring by 28 % of expected life. Such degradation is inconsistent with prior experience. Comparisons showed that E 15 resulted in lower CO and HC, but increased NOX, as expected for non-feedback-controlled carbureted engines with increased oxygen in the fuel. Fuel consumption also increased with E 15 compared with E 0. Throughout testing, poor starting characteristics were exhibited on E 15 fuel for hot re-start and cold-start. Cranking time to start and smooth idle was roughly doubled compared with typical E 0 operation. The carburetor was factory-set for lean operation to ensure emissions compliance. Test protocols did not include <b>carburetor</b> <b>adjustment</b> to account for increased oxygen in the E 15 fuel...|$|E
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the results of a test made upon a B. M. W. Engine in the {{altitude}} chamber of the Bureau of Standards, where controlled conditions of temperature and pressure can be made to simulate those of the desired altitude. A remarkably low value of fuel consumption - 041 per B. H. P. hour - is obtained at 1, 200 revolutions per minute at an air density of 0. 064 pound per cubic foot and a brake thermal efficiency of 33 per cent and an indicated efficiency of 37 per cent at the above speed and density. In {{spite of the fact that}} the <b>carburetor</b> <b>adjustment</b> does not permit the air-fuel ratio of maximum economy to be obtained at air densities lower than 0. 064, the economy is superior to most engines tested thus far, even at a density lower than 0. 064, the economies superior to most engines tested thus far, even at a density (0. 03) corresponding to an altitude of 25, 000 feet. The brake mean effective pressure even at full throttle is rather low. Since the weight of much of the engine is governed more by its piston displacement than by the power developed, a decreased mean effective pressure usually necessitates increased weight per horsepower. The altitude performance of the engine is, in general, excellent, and its low fuel consumption is the outstanding feature of merit...|$|E
50|$|On some vehicles, a {{temperature}} sensing switch will apply manifold vacuum to the vacuum advance system when {{the engine is}} hot or cold, and ported vacuum at normal operating temperature. This is a version of emissions control; the ported vacuum allowed <b>carburetor</b> <b>adjustments</b> for a leaner idle mixture. At high engine temperature, the increased advance raised engine speed to allow the cooling system to operate more efficiently. At low temperature the advance allowed the enriched warm-up mixture to burn more completely, providing better cold-engine running.|$|R

The range of mixtures was that normally used in flight. Plain aviation gasoline, a mixture consisting of 30 per cent (by v_ol-ume) of commercial benzol and 70 per cent gasoline, and a mixture of 65 per cent benzol and 35 per cent gasoline mere used.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{some results}} obtained during an investigation {{to determine the}} effect of high inlet air temperature on the performance of a Liberty 12 aviation engine. The purpose of this investigation was to ascertain, for normal service <b>carburetor</b> <b>adjustments</b> and a fixed ignition advance, the relation between power and temperature for the range of carburetor air temperatures that may be encountered when supercharging to sea level pressure at altitudes of over 20, 000 feet and without intercooling when using plain aviation gasoline and mixtures of benzol and gasoline. The results show that for the conditions of test, both the brake and indicated power decrease with increase in air temperature at a faster rate than given by the theoretical assumption that power varies inversely as the square root of the absolute temperature. On a brake basis, the order of the difference in power for a temperature difference of 120 degrees F. Is 3 to 5 per cent. The observed relation between power and temperature when using the 30 - 70 blend was found to be linear. But, although these differences are noted, the above theoretical assumption may be considered as generally applicable except where greater precision over a wide range of temperatures is desired, in which case it appears necessary to test the particular engine under the given conditions.

5000|$|Ways {{to check}} <b>carburetor</b> mixture <b>adjustment</b> include: {{measuring}} the carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and oxygen {{content of the}} exhaust using a gas analyzer, or directly viewing {{the color of the}} flame in the combustion chamber through a special glass-bodied spark plug sold under the name [...] "Colortune"; the flame color of stoichiometric burning is described as a [...] "Bunsen blue", turning to yellow if the mixture is rich and whitish-blue if too lean. Another method, widely used in aviation, is to measure the exhaust gas temperature, which is close to maximum for an optimally adjusted mixture and drops off steeply when the mixture is either too rich or too lean.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} carburetor {{needs to}} be adjusted, i. e. when operating in high or low altitudes, or their fuel oil-to-gasoline ratios must be adjusted to run properly. Electrically influenced <b>carburetors</b> make all <b>adjustments</b> automatically. These systems are provided by most large chain saw producers. Husqvarna calls its [...] "Autotune," [...] and it is commonly standard on most saws of the 5XX saw series.|$|R
2500|$|As {{illustrated}} under production numbers, SM sales declined {{starting in}} 1972. This {{appears to be}} attributable to maintenance issues. [...] Like an exotic Italian car, the Weber <b>carburetors</b> require frequent <b>adjustment.</b> Many engines experienced failure at 60,000km - it was unclear to most owners that the interference engine design has timing chains that require manual adjustment, an issue not corrected until long after production ceased. The 90° engine timing was unfamiliar to mechanics in the 1970s. Only Buick (1962–66; 1975-) and Jeep (1966–71) used a V6 with 90° between banks of cylinders. Another issue that has been resolved with retrofit was unreliable ignition breaker cassettes.|$|R
5000|$|The 360, of 360.7 cuin L actual displacement, was {{introduced}} in 1968 and phased {{out at the end}} of the 1976-year run; it was used in the Ford F Series trucks and pickups. It has a bore of a 390 (4.05 in) and used the 352's 3.5 in rotating assembly. 360s were also constructed with heavy duty internal components for truck use. Use of a standard 352/390 cam for use in passenger cars along with <b>carburetor</b> and distributor <b>adjustment</b> allowed the 360 to give performance similar to that of the 352 and 390 car engines. Rated at [...] at 4100 rpm and 375 lbft Nm of torque @2600 rpm (2-barrel carb, 1968). The 360 used the same block, heads and other parts as a 390, this makes them indistinguishable from each other unless the stroke is measured.|$|R
