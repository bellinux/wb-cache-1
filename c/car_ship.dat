40|$|The {{automation}} {{level has}} been improved rapidly {{with the introduction}} of large-scale measurement technologies, such as indoor global positioning system, into the production process among the fields of <b>car,</b> <b>ship,</b> and aerospace due to their excellent measurement characteristics. In fact, the objects are usually in motion during the real measurement process; however, the dynamic measurement characteristics of indoor global positioning system are much limited and still in exploration. In this research, we focused on the dynamic tracking performance of indoor global positioning system and then successfully built a mathematical model based on its measurement principles. We first built single and double station system models with the consideration of measurement objectsâ€™ movement. Using MATLAB simulation, we realized the dynamic measurement characteristics of indoor global positioning system. In the real measurement process, the experimental results also support the mathematical model that we built, which proves a great success in dynamic measurement characteristics. We envision that this dynamic tracking performance of indoor global positioning system would shed light on the dynamic measurement of a motion object and therefore make contribution to the automation production...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} continuously progress advancing their design approaches {{based on the}} changing market constraints. Examples such as <b>car,</b> <b>ship</b> and airplane manufacturing industries utilize process setups and techniques, that differ significantly from the processes and techniques used by the traditional building industry. One important difference between the building and other industries is that no prototypes are trialed and tested before manufacturing. This fact causes the design stages to be highly iterative without implementing prototype performance data into the global design process. Evolutionary design i. e. is one technique that aims to adapt the biologic process of evolution to engineering. This technique could have the potential benefit of reducing the design iteration from concept creation to construction. The paper identifies possible differences between the industries and {{the analysis of the}} benefits from adapting Evolutionary design to concept creation, evaluation and optimization based on building performance criteria.

40|$|The {{trajectory}} data {{of moving}} objects contain {{huge amounts of}} information pertaining to traffic flow. It is incredibly important to extract valuable knowledge from this particular kind of data. Trajectory clustering {{is one of the}} most widely used approaches to complete this extraction. However, the current practice of trajectory clustering always groups similar subtrajectories that are partitioned from the trajectories; these methods would thus lose important information of the trajectory as a whole. To deal with this problem, this paper introduces a new trajectory-clustering algorithm based on sampling and density, which groups similar traffic movement tracks (<b>car,</b> <b>ship,</b> airplane, etc.) for further analysis of the characteristics of traffic flow. In particular, this paper proposes a novel technique of measuring distances between trajectories using point sampling. This distance measure does not divide the trajectory and thus conserves the integrated knowledge of these trajectories. This trajectory clustering approach is a new adaptation of a density-based clustering algorithm to the trajectories of moving objects. This paper then adopts the entropy theory as the heuristic for selecting the parameter values of this algorithm and the sum of the squared error method for measuring the clustering quality. Experiments on real ship trajectory data have shown that this algorithm is superior to the classical method TRACLUSS in the run time and that this method works well in discovering traffic flow patterns...|$|E
40|$|View-invariant object {{recognition}} is a challenging {{problem that has}} attracted much attention among the psychology, neuroscience, and computer vision communities. Humans are notoriously good at it, even if some variations are presumably more difficult to handle than others (e. g. 3 D rotations). Humans are thought {{to solve the problem}} through hierarchical processing along the ventral stream, which progressively extracts more and more invariant visual features. This feed-forward architecture has inspired a new generation of bio-inspired computer vision systems called deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), which are currently the best models for {{object recognition}} in natural images. Here, for the first time, we systematically compared human feed-forward vision and DCNNs at view-invariant object recognition task using the same set of images and controlling the kinds of transformation (position, scale, rotation in plane, and rotation in depth) as well as their magnitude, which we call variation level. We used four object categories: <b>car,</b> <b>ship,</b> motorcycle, and animal. In total, 89 human subjects participated in 10 experiments in which they had to discriminate between two or four categories after rapid presentation with backward masking. We also tested two recent DCNNs (proposed respectively by Hinton's group and Zisserman's group) on the same tasks. We found that humans and DCNNs largely agreed on the relative difficulties of each kind of variation: rotation in depth is by far the hardest transformation to handle, followed by scale, then rotation in plane, and finally position (much easier). This suggests that DCNNs would be reasonable models of human feed-forward vision. In addition, our results show that the variation levels in rotation in depth and scale strongly modulate both humans' and DCNNs' recognition performances. We thus argue that these variations should be controlled in the image datasets used in vision research...|$|E

Arsenic exhibits {{properties of}} metal and non metal. Due to both natural and anthropogenic sources, arsenic is the 20 th the most abundant elements in the earth s crust and is a component of morethan 245 minerals. These are mostly ores containing sulfide, along with copper, nickel, lead, cobalt, or other metals. Arsenic exists in nature in the oxidation states +V (arsenate), +III (arsenite), 0 (arsenic) and -III (arsine). Commonly inorganic arsenic appears {{in the aqueous environment}} in the states +V and +III as arsenous acid (As(III)), arsenic acid (As(V)), and their salts. It is usually found in the environment combined with the elements such as oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur. Arsenic combined with these elements is called inorganic arsenic. On the other hand if arsenic combined with carbon and hydrogen is called organic arsenic. Inorganic arsenic compounds can be methylated by bacteria, fungi, and yeasts to the organic compounds such as monomethylarsenic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and arsine. Arsenic compounds are used in wood preservation and insecticides, as an additive to lead and copper for hardening, glass manufacturing, in small quantities in semi-conductor manufacturing. Arsenic is carcinogenic and may cause lung cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer, renal cancer, and skin cancer. It is also harmful to the nervous system. Other health effects may include vessel damage, high blood pressure, anemia, stomach sickness, and diabetes. The toxicity of arsenic depends on its binding form. Organic arsenic compounds are less toxic than inorganic arsenic compounds. It has been estimated that {{tens of millions of people}} are at risk exposing to excessive levels of arsenic from both contaminated water and arsenic-bearing coal from natural sources. Humans are exposed to this toxic by breathing, eating, or drinking the substance, or by skin contact. The current World Health Organization recommended value for arsenic in drinking water is 0. 010 mg/Land in wastewater is 0, 5 mg/L. Arsenic cannot be destroyed in the environment. It can only change its form, or become attached to or separated from particles. Therefore it is one of the main problems considering underground and ground source waters in recent years, because of its toxicity and carcinogenic. On the other side, aluminium is the second-most used metal after steel, largely because of its use in a wide variety of products. It is estimated that aluminium composes about 8 % of the earth s crust. Aluminium is a light silvery-white metallic element and it is resistant to corrosion. it is very reactive but forms a tough layer of oxide when exposed to air, preventing further corrosion and it is ductile and easily malleable. It is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. Aluminium is used electrical equipments such as <b>car,</b> <b>ship,</b> aircraft construction; metallurgical and chemical processes; domestic and industrial construction; packaging and kitchen utensils. Aluminium is non-toxic (as the metal) nonmagnetic and non-sparking. It occurs naturally in many foods in very concentrations and is also present in many pharmaceuticals and drinking water. High levels in the body can be toxic. Production of aluminium from ore is dependent upon alumina, which is extracted from bauxite ore which contains 30 - 60 % alumina. The production of alumina consumes more than 90 % of the world s production of bauxite. The main minerals in bauxite are gibbsite (Al 203. 3 H 20), boehmite (Al 203. H 20), and diaspore. Bauxite ore refers to bauxite that contains sufficiently high levels of Al 203 and suitably low levels of Fe 203 and silica to be economically mineable. Red Mud is a waste left after alumina has been extracted from bauxite in Bayer process for refining bauxites into alumina via digestion with sodium hydroxide. This process can be separated into two parts; firstly the extraction of alumina from bauxite, and secondly the smelting of aluminum metal from alumina. Sodium hydroxide is used to dissolve the aluminum oxide. This produces a sodium-aluminium solutionfrom precipitated &# 12310;Al(OH) &# 12311;_ 3. Afterwards it is calcined to produce oxide, from which the metal is recovered. The remaining waste product of bayer process is called red mud due to the colour of the original bauxite ore and the iron oxide it contains. In addition to iron, it contains other particles include silica, unleached residual aluminium, and titanium oxide. For each tonne of alumina produced, the process can leave behind about two tonnes of red mud. However, This ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite used in the refining process. The red mud is a complex chemical soup, a watery slurry of fine rock particles and salts, containing toxic heavy metals. The red mud also has a high pH because of the sodium hydroxide solution used in the refining process. Therefore it is strong enough to kill plant and animal life, and to cause burns and damage to airways if it is breathed. Parallel to the increase in population and urbanization, the demand of aluminum is also increasing and as a consequence, storage and removing red mud becomes more and more important for the facilities produce aluminum. Therefore, cosidering the facts of both arsenic and red mud issues, in this study, the influence of red mud on removing arsenic from waters is investigated. The aim was, by using red mud as a low cost adsorbent, having a good efficiency of arsenic removal from waters and waste waters. Primarily, optimal pH for arsenic removal, stiring duration, and amount of red mud are determined. In the course of this study in a range from pH 2. 5 to pH 10 have been studied in many different values and the best in synthetic absorbable s concentration of arsenic is observed at pH 5. 5. Also it has been concluded that even 0, 5 gr/L red mud is enough effective for arsenic removal at pH 5, 5 with a concentration of 10 ppm arsenic. In other experiment, instead of synthetic arsenic, 38, 5 ppm arsenic contaminated water taken from Eti Mine Emet Boron facilityis used. The experiment performed in the original pH 9 and despite incresing the amount of red mud, good results couldn t be achieved which shows the importance of pH arrangement in the arsenic removal process. This study also investigates different arsenic concentrations, enough high yields is obtained up to 100 ppm. In order to increase the arsenic efficiency the heat, acid, and red mud are activated at concentrations as high as 100 ppm. While desired results could not be obtained by acid activation, with heat activation at 600 Â°C the yield increase is achieved with high concentrations. Pyrite is another adsorbant to remove arsenic. Although pyrite s removal effect together with red mud has been elaborated as well, it has been found that red mud alone is more effective to remove arsenic. In order to apply the data obtained by sentetic arsenic concentration to the waste water, some experiments has been conducted with natural pH 9 and 38, 5 ppm arsenic concentration obtained by Eti Maden Emet boron facility. As a result, it has been determined that at natural pH value, even 4 gr/L of red mud is not enough, but the yield quite rises at pH 5. It has been also worked with another waste sample from Eti Maden Emet boron facility which has a 81, 66 ppm arsenicconcentration. With this sample, it has been tried to see the effects of the amount of red mud in arsenic removal with a value of pH 5 in wastewater. As a result, with 4 gr/L red mud, it has been able to reduce the arsenic concentration to a level below 0, 5 ppm, which is the limit for permitted levels of arsenic in waste waters. For the application and the transportation with ease, red mud transformed to the red mud pellets by using starch. The adsorption experiments in a colunm system with two different size of these pellets show that with the fine pellets, better results are obtained. While the course sized pellet has a 42 % of arsenic removal efficiency in the samples taken after 30 minutes, the fine sized pellet has about 60 % of arsenic removal efficieny. On the other hand, these efficiencies are reduced with increasing sampling time. When the fine sized pellets are worked with the real arsenic contaminated water taken from Emet boron facility, about 80 % of arsenic removal efficiency is achieved. As a result, red mud which is the biggest waste problem of aluminum production either with the storage necessity or the disposal difficulties, is used for removing arsenic from the waters within the scope of waste utilization.
