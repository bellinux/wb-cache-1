Charles Martel was the firstborn son of Charles II of Naples and Charles II's wife, Mary, who was a {{daughter}} of Stephen V of Hungary.

5000|$|Lipotomy, or hypo-osmolar treatment, is a {{technique}} which <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> enable cellulite to be reduced and which <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> involve intra-cellular hyperhydration, membrane weakening or potassium tonicity of adipocytes in order to permit their destruction. That technique is <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> {{be based on the}} principle of diluting the interstitial liquid in which the adipocytes lie in order to induce differences in osmotic pressure {{on each side of the}} adipocyte membrane. Those differences in osmotic pressure result in a flow of liquid from the compartment of lower osmolarity (the interstitial liquid) towards the compartment of higher osmolarity (the cytoplasm of the adipocytes). The lipotomy technique conventionally used comprises the intra-fatty administration of a so-called [...] "destruction" [...] solution, which is highly hypotonic and which is <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> bring about hyperhydration of adipocytes. The increase in volume of the adipocytes is <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> bring about a weakening of their membrane, and is also <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> cause cell lesions.
