40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{estimate}} the relationship between bank efficiency and the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> shareholders' <b>value.</b> Annual financial statement reports are used to estimate technical, allocative and cost efficiency with the aid of two Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models (one mainly income statement-based and the other mainly balance sheet-based) for five banks listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) over a 10 -year period. The <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> shareholders' <b>value</b> is estimated by using Economic Value Added (EVA). The study found that {{there appears to be a}} weak relationship between EVA values and the efficiency estimates of the two DEA models. In addition, neither of the two DEA models is significantly superior as a driver for shareholders' value. Further research is needed to estimate why the efficient operation of a bank does not necessarily contribute to the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> shareholders' <b>value.</b> Researchers may consider including different variables in their DEA model(s) or use variables with time lags.

40|$|In Nietzsche, ‘European nihilism' has at {{its core}} valuelessness, meaninglessness and senselessness. This article argues that Nietzsche is not {{replacing}} God with the nothing, but rather that he regards ‘European nihilism' as an ‘in-between state' that is necessary for getting beyond Christian morality. An important characteristic of a Nietzschean philosopher is his ‘will to responsibility'. One of his responsibilities consists <b>of</b> the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>values</b> and the concepts that are {{needed in order to}} overcome the intermediate state of nihilism. For prevailing over nihilism in science, Nietzsche suggests drawing on philosophy for the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>values</b> and drawing on art in order to create beautiful surfaces that are based on these values. He regards science as a cultural system that rests on contingent grounds. Therefore, his work is concerned with the responsible construction of the narratives of science {{in such a way that}} they enhance agency and promote a life-affirming futur...|$|R

The implementation of Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan has been taken as a case study. This allows {{for the analysis of}} the nature of the buyer-supplier interactions. The different partners in this relationship were asked to fill out questionnaires. Correlation and regression analyses were used to quantify the relationship between the governance strategy which is most dominant and the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> shared <b>value.</b> It is concluded that cooperative strategies rather than coordinating strategies are best able to create shared value. This is supported by strong information transfer between supply chain partners and the content of the message. The <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> shared <b>value</b> requires that both parties already see and experience the benefits of the implementation of the sustainability requirements during the implementation, and not only afterwards. environmental issues; social responsibility; supply chain management; SCM; survey methods; quantitative data analysis; regression analysis; value creation; shared values; buyer-supplier relationships; sustainability requirements; governance strategies; supplier involvement; Unilever; Sustainable Living Plan; case study; cooperation; coordinating strategies; information transfer; message content...|$|R
