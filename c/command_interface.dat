SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards.|$|E

TinyMUCK version 2 contained a full programming language named MUF (Multi-User Forth), while MUSH greatly expanded the <b>command</b> <b>interface.</b> To distance itself from the combat-oriented traditional MUDs {{it was said that}} the [...] "D" [...] in TinyMUD stood for Multi-User [...] "Domain" [...] or [...] "Dimension"; this, along with the eventual popularity of acronyms other than MUD (such as MUCK, MUSH, MUSE, and so on) for this kind of server, led to the eventual adoption of the term MU* to refer to the TinyMUD family. UberMUD, UnterMUD, and MOO were inspired by TinyMUD but are not direct descendants.|$|E
