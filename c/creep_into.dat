5|$|Arsenal {{scored the}} game's only {{goal in the}} 24th minute; set-up by Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain managed to cut inside César Azpilicueta {{on the right and}} shoot the ball into the top-left corner of Courtois's net. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded against Arsenal in 506 minutes. Most of the action in the first half was {{conducted}} in a congested midfield, with Fàbregas attempting to sedate the rhythm and the Arsenal midfielders forcing their opponents to play narrow. This favoured Arsenal, who had space to counter-attack had Chelsea lost the ball. Ramires nearly levelled the scoreline in the 33rd minute, but his curling effort failed to <b>creep</b> <b>into</b> the bottom right-hand corner. Ramires then missed another chance, heading the ball high and over the Arsenal goal after good work by Rémy. Arsenal created another chance to score four minutes before the break, when Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found Monreal, who under pressure from Ivanovic headed over. Rémy, often a lone figure upfront, was ruled offside late on.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the War of the First Coalition, Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. Unfortunately for him, military rations were insufficient to satisfy his appetite. He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their rations and scavenge on the dungheap for scraps, but this was not enough to satisfy him. Suffering from extreme exhaustion, he was admitted to the military hospital at Soultz-Haut-Rhin. He was granted quadruple rations but remained hungry; he would scavenge for garbage in gutters and refuse containers, eat the scraps of food left by other patients, and <b>creep</b> <b>into</b> the apothecary's room to eat the poultices. Military surgeons could not understand his appetite; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr.Courville (surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment) and George Didier, Baron Percy, surgeon-in-chief of the hospital.|$|E

25|$|The Pisani Dossi Ms. was {{published}} in facsimile by Francesco Novati in 1902, including the only reproductions of {{a copy of the}} Flower of Battle that are clearly in the public domain. However, it is unclear how accurate this facsimile is as evidence suggests that Novati may have hired an artist to create a tracing of the original manuscript rather than reproducing it directly. This would have provided ample opportunity for errors to <b>creep</b> <b>into</b> the images, and might also account for the significant divergences from the artistic style of the Getty and the Morgan.|$|E
25|$|The {{action in}} this year's Tour Championships {{began with the}} Red Group with Wimbledon {{champion}} Petra Kvitová and 2008 finalist Vera Zvonareva. Having lost to Zvonareva in straight sets {{just a few weeks}} ago in Tokyo, Kvitová had her work cut out for her, but this time it was different - Kvitová hadn't lost an indoor match all year and her huge serve, powerful groundstrokes and strong net play were working like a charm as she raced out to a 6–2, 4–1 lead. Things got tougher as the unforced errors began to <b>creep</b> <b>into</b> Kvitová's game, and Zvonareva closed the gap to 4–all in the second set; but the No.3-seeded Kvitová broke again for 5–4 and served it out, getting two errors in a row from the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to get to match point then knifing a forehand volley. The series between the two is now knotted at 3–3. Kvitová ended with an even differential, 24 winners to 24 errors; she won 17 of 23 net points (including match point). Zvonareva was −9 (eight winners, 17 errors).|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the season, Sue Ellen gets drunk {{after having}} seen J.R. {{in bed with}} Holly Harwood. She gets into a car and Ray Krebbs' cousin Mickey Trotter tries to stop her and they are {{involved}} in an accident, in a car belonging to J.R., just outside Southfork. Sue Ellen emerges with nothing worse than bruises, but Mickey is paralyzed from the neck down and in a coma. In the final episode of the season, Ray finds out that the driver of the other car was Walt Driscoll, J.R.'s rival. He also learns that Driscoll deliberately caused the accident, thinking that J.R. was driving, as a means of revenge for being put in jail by J.R. earlier in the year. An angered Ray comes to Southfork late at night demanding answers from J.R., who was not expecting to see him. J.R. asks him what is going on and Ray says he's going to kill J.R. for what happened. J.R. throws a candle holder at Ray, which misses him and knocks over another candle holder with lit candles in it. As the two brawl, the candles ignite a fire and the smoke starts to <b>creep</b> <b>into</b> both John Ross and Sue Ellen's bedrooms as they sleep. Sue Ellen had been given a sedative by the doctor earlier in the day so she doesn't wake up. J.R. notices the fire and tries to break free of Ray, finally knocking him out with a telephone, and runs upstairs to try to save his wife and son. Ray recovers and runs after J.R. but is consumed by smoke and falls. J.R. is hit with a falling beam as he gets upstairs and both men are unconscious as Southfork burns.|$|E

Garcia started game three, but {{was replaced by a}} pinch hitter {{in the bottom of the}} third inning, already trailing 4–0. Author Jonathan Knight described the progression of the game: [...] "...a throwing error by George Strickland, and Mike Garcia had struggled in the opening frame, allowing three baserunners, as panic began to <b>creep</b> <b>into</b> Municipal Stadium. For the first time all year, it was warranted." [...] The Giants won the game, 6–2, and would win game four to claim the Series.|$|E
500|$|... "A Fool in Love" [...] was {{released}} in July 1960 and became an immediate hit, peaking at number 2 on the Hot R Sides chart and number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 that October. Kurt Loder described the track as [...] "the blackest record to ever <b>creep</b> <b>into</b> the white pop charts since Ray Charles' gospel-styled 'What'd I Say' that previous summer." [...] A second pop hit, [...] "It's Gonna Work Out Fine" [...] (1961), reached the top 20 and earned the group a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock and Roll Performance. Notable singles released during the duo's Sue Records period included the R hits, [...] "I Idolize You", [...] "Poor Fool", and [...] "Tra-La-La-La." [...] In 1964, Ike & Tina left Sue and signed with Kent Records, releasing the modest single, [...] "I Can't Believe What You Say." [...] The following year, they signed with Loma Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records and run by Bob Krasnow, who had become their manager shortly after they left Sue Records. Between 1964 and 1969, Ike & Tina signed with more than ten labels.|$|E
500|$|The Ritz {{became popular}} with film stars and {{executives}} when staying in London, although the hotel has kept {{most of the}} names of many of its luminaries a secret in its records. Douglas Fairbanks was known though to frequent the Ritz in the 1920s, and director Alexander Korda's talent scout held a table at the Ritz in the 1930s. Noël Coward, also a regular diner at the Ritz in the 1920s and 1930s, met with Michael Arlen in the restaurant in 1924 to discuss the urgent problem of generating the funding for his new play, The Vortex. Arlen gave Coward a cheque for $250 without question, and The Vortex would go on to be his first major success. Coward's song, [...] "Children of the Ritz", which featured in the 1932 revue Words and Music was penned while Coward was lunching in the Ritz with Beverley Nichols. Numerous authors began to meet at the Ritz during the same period, and it began to <b>creep</b> <b>into</b> literature itself. In Michael Arlen's 1922 novel Piracy, the hotel was described as a [...] "very stout and solid building in the manner of the old Bastille, originally conceived no doubt with a fearful eye on class prejudice", and R. Firbank had a running gag in his novels about there being [...] "fleas in the Ritz". Later, the hotel appears in Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time. The narrator Nicholas Jenkins meets poet Mark Members at the Ritz, and the golden nymph in the Palm Court of the hotel is mentioned.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1870s breweries {{had become}} the largest users of {{harvested}} ice. Though the ice-harvesting industry had grown immensely {{by the turn of}} the 20th century, pollution and sewage had begun to <b>creep</b> <b>into</b> natural ice, making it a problem in the metropolitan suburbs. Eventually, breweries began to complain of tainted ice. Public concern for the purity of water, from which ice was formed, began to increase in the early 1900s with the rise of germ theory. [...] Numerous media outlets published articles connecting diseases such as typhoid fever with natural ice consumption. This caused ice harvesting to become illegal in certain areas of the country. [...] All of these scenarios increased the demands for modern refrigeration and manufactured ice. [...] Ice producing machines like that of Carre’s and Muhl’s were looked to as means of producing ice to meet the needs of grocers, farmers, and food shippers.|$|E
