This article presents some insights on this issue, including suggested improvements for supervision of the illegal excavation of tree roots in mountain areas; tracing the source of the root-carving artwork raw materials; formulating detailed regulations supervising root diggers; enforcing rules and regulations to market trading of root-carving raw materials and artworks and imposing heavy fines for the artworks that are carved from roots of rare and protected species...|$|E

40|$|Many {{aspects of}} {{managing}} collection/item metadata relationships {{are critical to}} sustaining <b>collection</b> <b>value</b> over time. Metadata at the collection-level not only provides context for finding, understanding, and using {{the items in the}} collection, but is often essential to the particular research and scholarly activities the collection is designed to support. Contemporary retrieval systems, which search across collections, usually ignore collection level metadata. Alternative approaches, informed by collection-level information, will require an understanding of the various kinds of relationships that can obtain between collection-level and item-level metadata. This paper outlines the problem and describes a project that is developing a logic-based framework for classifying collection-level/item-level metadata relationships. This framework will support (i) metadata specification developers defining metadata elements, (ii) metadata librarians describing objects, and (iii) system designers implementing systems that help users take advantage of collection-level metadata.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide an edited version of a paper originally delivered at the conference “Celebrating Knowledge: The Power and Potential – 12 - 15 December 2005 ” organized by the Singapore National Library Board in conjunction with the opening of the new National Library Building. Using a basic model of a library, one that comprises three components – the <b>collection,</b> <b>value</b> added work on the collection, and services that help users exploit and use the collection – the paper discusses each component in light of current technological developments and learning trends to draw conclusions on the relevance of libraries in the future. It is argued that libraries and librarians will continue to play critical roles as the need for the effective preservation and transmission of knowledge in society still remains. As many of these critical roles rely on libraries as permanent institutions, librarians must continue to make significant contributions through their work in institutions such as libraries. The article provides a useful springboard to discuss, identify and elaborate on the roles of libraries and librarians in the near future...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{study on}} the {{economically}} important plant communities was carried out during summer 2008 {{in various parts of}} Malam Jabba valley, Swat. The principal aim of the study was phytosociological evaluation with special reference to the occurrence of commercially important medicinal plant species in coniferous forest of the study area. Secondly to prepare ethnobotanical inventory of the plant resources of the area, as well as to evaluate the conservation status of important medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) through rapid vulnerable assessment (RVA) procedure. The study documented 90 species of ethnobotanical importance, out of these 71 spp used as medicinal plant, 20 spp fodder plant, 10 spp vegetables, 14 spp wild fruit, 18 spp fuel wood, 9 spp furniture and agricultural tools, 9 spp thatching, fencing and hedges, 4 spp honey bee, 2 spp evil eyes, 2 spp religious and 3 spp as poison. Phytosociologically six plant communities were found, comprising five herbs-shrubs-trees communities and one meadow community. Further study is, therefore, required to quantify the availability of species and to suggest suitable method for their production and conservation. Recommendations are also given in the spheres of training in identification, sustainable <b>collection,</b> <b>value</b> addition, trade monitoring and cooperative system of marketing...|$|E
40|$|Conventional wisdom has it {{that the}} {{value-added}} tax is not a suitable instrument for lower-level jurisdictions (‘provinces’) in a federal system. The problems that arise when it is so used have become a serious constraint {{on the development of the}} VAT—and closer economic integration—in Brazil, the EU, India and elsewhere. This paper describes and compares two recent proposals for forms of VAT intended to alleviate these difficulties: the VIVAT and the CVAT. Both enable the VAT chain to be preserved on inter-provincial trade without compromising the destination principle (allowing provinces to tax consumption at different rates) or introducing new scope for game-playing by the provinces. The key difference between them is that the CVAT requires sellers to discriminate between buyers located in different provinces of the federation, whereas VIVAT requires them to discriminate between registered and non-registered buyers. Where the balance of advantage between the two lies is not entirely obvious.

40|$|Frett, John J. University gardens {{commonly}} tout their vital {{roles as}} "living laboratories" and "outdoor classrooms", {{but how can}} we ensure that their inherent educational benefits are delivered as effectively as possible? As with other instructional materials, academic plant collections should be assessed periodically to judge their fitness for purpose based on predetermined, mission-centric standards and objectives. A key objective of the University of Delaware Botanic Gardens (UDBG) is to inform and inspire students of horticulture and landscape design. This goal is facilitated by students' exposure to vibrant, relevant plant collections that aim to sustainably exhibit the region's ornamentally and functionally useful taxa. However, financial adversity, insufficient staff, and limited space are common barriers to maximizing <b>collection</b> <b>value.</b> In an effort to move beyond historically qualitative characterizations of academic gardens, the UDBG's holly (Ilex) collection served as test case for producing a quantitative example of collection evaluation for educational purposes. Evaluation criteria were based on survey data from university garden leadership, post-secondary plant materials instructors, and wholesale nursery growers and distributors. These elements were then synthesized to develop an assessment method for grading the collection's overall relevance. The resulting data {{will be used to}} identify any weaknesses in the collection's scope, promote curatorial accuracy, and improve managerial efficiency. Information pertaining to collection relevance will also help communicate the garden's value to university administrators and other stakeholders.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the tactical reconnaissance asset allocation problem in military operations. Specifically this thesis presents methods to optimize, under uncertain conditions, tactical reconnaissance asset allocation {{in order to}} maximize, within acceptable levels of asset risk exposure, the expected total information <b>collection</b> <b>value.</b> We propose a deterministic integer optimization formulation and two robust mixed-integer optimization extensions to address this problem. Robustness is applied to our model using both polyhedral and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets resulting in tractable mixed integer linear and second order cone problems. We show through experimentation that robust optimization leads to overall improvements in solution quality compared to non-robust and typical human generated plans. Additionally we show that by using our robust models, military planners can ensure better solution feasibility compared to non-robust planning methods even if they seriously misjudge {{their knowledge of the}} enemy and the battlefield. We also compare the trade-offs of using polyhedral and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. In our tests our model using ellipsoidal uncertainty sets provided better quality solutions at a cost of longer average solution times to that of the polyhedral uncertainty set model. Lastly we outline a special case of our models that allows us to improve solution time at the cost of some solution quality. by David M. Culver. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Objective: During {{the summer}} of 2014, Laupus Library at East Carolina University began {{investigating}} {{an increase in the}} number of items that were being reported as being “not on shelf” by staff and patrons. Due to a previous incident of organized theft, we decided to act quickly and determine the cause of these reports. Our project objectives were to assess the extent of loss, to look for correlations between areas of high loss and specific topics or disciplines, to implement measures to reduce the amount of loss, to uncover library book collection control practices at other libraries, and to conduct a follow-up assessment to measure the success of our efforts. Methods: An inventory was conducted of the entire library circulating collection in 2014 with an analysis of the percentage of books lost and the percentage of loss of the book <b>collection</b> <b>value.</b> A survey of the AAHSL libraries will be conducted on their collection control practices. After creating a case with campus police and increasing theft-prevention measures, a follow up inventory is presently being conducted to assess the success of the steps we took to mitigate loss. We also continue to monitor reports from patrons and staff who were unsuccessful in locating a book that should be located on the shelf per the library catalog. Results/Conclusion: By analyzing the loss-rate percentages of the first inventory and through analyzing both the statistical data and anecdotal patron and staff reports on the now current collection, we see a reduction already in book loss. Reviewing the data from other AAHSL libraries illustrated common practices among other health sciences libraries to help determine successful loss prevention measures...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{present a}} museological {{study of the}} {{scientific}} collections from an analytic perspective, overcoming the classical historical approach underdertaken until now. For this purpose used the group of the Iberian-Balearic amphibians preserved in the Natural History collections. A comprehensive compilation of the information available in our collection of this group {{has been used as}} a model case to analyse the collection concept, its utility, reliability and validity. We requested information about Iberian-Balearic amphibians to 260 Institutions which probably housed these specimens into their zoological collections. We obtained positive answer from 65 Institutions. This Information allowed us to make a catalogue of the Iberian-Balearic amphibians preserved in the Natural History collections. Also we have evaluated the validity of the batracological collections and their contents as scientific tools in different research areas such as: (1) Taxonomy and Nomenclature (2) Chorology and Zoogeography (3) Ecological Biogeography (4) Biogeography, Genetics and Conservation (5) Scientific education. (6) History of the collections (7) Anatomy and Morphology (8) Evolution and Development (9) Evolutionary Chorology (10) Phylogeny and Molecular Taxonomy. We used different statistical methods to analyze the information related to collection specimens, and also the information inferred by us (for instance: UTM 10 x 10 Km coordinates) We made tables of results that we used to make correlations between analysed variables, to know the capacity of each variable to infer others. Finally we made several cluster analysis where the OTUS ???? are each of the different Iberian-Balearic amphibian collections. In conclusion, concerning the evaluation of the zoological collections of Iberian-Balearic amphibians, the total number of the preserved amphibians in each collection is an important factor to determinate its value, but it is not the only relevant one. The <b>collection</b> <b>value</b> is influenced by other factors that aren¿t directly correlated with the total number of specimens, such as randomness in sample origin, incusion of type specimens, presence of samples of tissues or DNA extracts, or the endemism of the preserved species. On the other hand, the total number of specimens is a highly correlated factor with geographic location and potential georeference. This fact is extremely interesting in light of the wide spectrum of possibilities that this geographic information offers in relation with different research disciplines. We also must to into take count other factors that influence collection quality, such as the presence of type specimens, essential for taxonomic revisions, or the preservation of samples of tissues and DNA, or the presence of stained and cleared skeletons that allow evo-devo studies. In short we can affirm that while quantity (number of specimens) is important, other factors are needed to build collection quality. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
