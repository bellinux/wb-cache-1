40|$|Endosymbiosis {{has been}} a major driver of {{evolutionary}} diversification of eukaryotes. However, symbiosis can create conflict between partners and symbiont density is often tightly regulated within hosts to ensure optimal functioning of the holobiont. The horticultural pest insects, <b>citrus</b> <b>mealybugs,</b> make an intriguing and potentially-powerful case study for endosymbiosis, harbouring two obligate, nutritional, vertically transmitted bacteria: Tremblaya princeps and Moranella endobia, in a nested mutualism. In this thesis, I examine the variation in the density of each of these obligate symbionts in <b>citrus</b> <b>mealybugs</b> under controlled environmental conditions, using qPCR, as well as the diversity of facultative symbionts that infect the mealybugs using next-generation sequencing and conventional targeted PCR. <b>Citrus</b> <b>mealybugs</b> were found to harbour Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, Cardinium and Rickettsia, which have been found to impact the fitness of their hosts in other insect species, whereas long-tailed mealybugs were not found to harbour any of these bacteria, but the symbiont communities in both species were found to be dominated by their obligate symbionts. The density of the two obligate symbionts varied by up to six-fold between different populations kept under identical environmental conditions and a hybridisation experiment indicated that M. endobia and T. princeps density may be controlled by symbiont and host genotype respectively. However, symbiont density was not found to correlate with life-history traits in the laboratory, the ability of mealybugs to exploit different plant species, or the susceptibility of the mealybugs to insecticide and artificial reduction of symbiont density by heat-stress also had no effect on host fitness. <b>Citrus</b> <b>mealybugs</b> harbour seemingly superfluous symbionts with no clear fitness costs or benefits...|$|R

40|$|Beneficial eukaryotic–bacterial {{partnerships}} {{are integral}} to {{animal and plant}} evolution. Understanding the density regulation mechanisms behind bacterial symbiosis is essential to elucidating the functional balance between hosts and symbionts. <b>Citrus</b> <b>mealybugs,</b> Planococcus citri (Risso), present an excellent model system for investigating the mechanisms of symbiont density regulation. They contain two obligate nutritional symbionts, Moranella endobia, which resides inside Tremblaya princeps, which has been maternally transmitted for 100 – 200 million years. We investigate whether host genotype may influence symbiont density by crossing mealybugs from two inbred laboratory-reared populations that differ substantially in their symbiont density to create hybrids. The density of the M. endobia symbiont in the hybrid hosts matched that of the maternal parent population, in keeping with density being determined either by the symbiont or the maternal genotype. However, {{the density of the}} T. princeps symbiont was influenced by the paternal host genotype. The greater dependency of T. princeps on its host may be due to its highly reduced genome. The decoupling of T. princeps and M. endobia densities, in spite of their intimate association, suggests that distinct regulatory mechanisms can be at work in symbiotic partnerships, even when they are obligate and mutualistic...|$|R
25|$|The <b>citrus</b> <b>{{mealybug}}</b> {{looks very}} similar to the vine mealybug (Planococcus ficus), and the two species are mainly distinguished by the arrangement of pores and tubular ducts on the tiny body of the female.

25|$|Adult {{females and}} nymphs suck sap with their {{piercing}} mouthparts. This leads to plant {{damage in the}} form of wilting and chlorosis of the foliage, leaf drop, stunted growth, and sometimes the death of the plant. Fruits such as oranges become lumpy and discolored when the insect feeds on them, and they may fall off the tree. Insects packed with harvested fruits continue to feed, causing more losses during shipping. The mealybug secretes honeydew, which coats leaves and fruits and causes the growth of sooty molds.

40|$|UC Davis's Foundation Plant Materials Service (FPMS) {{maintains}} the disease-tested, professionally identified collection of grape scion and rootstock varieties, {{which is the}} core of the California Grapevine Registration and Certification Program. In 1992, newly developed serological testing techniques revealed the presence of grapevine leafroll­associated viruses (GLRaVs) in previously healthy vines in an older foundation propagating block, indicating active and recent virus spread. FPMS responded by increasing isolation distances and implementing a comprehensive virus screening program using the new methodology. The critical problem was the lack of information on leafroll virus epidemiology. When the distribution of infected plants in the old vineyard was mapped, new infections were frequently adjacent to known diseased grapevines. This study examined the ability of mealybugs, a putative leafroll vector, to transmit this group of viruses. We were able to confirm that four species found in California obscure, longtailed, <b>citrus</b> and grape <b>mealybug</b> can transmit GLRaV- 3 isolates.

40|$|Planococcus ficus (Signoret) and Planococcus citri (Risso) (Hom., Pseudococcidae) are {{important}} phytophagous components in different agroecosystems. The two species may coexist {{in the same}} environment and are most difficult to distinguish by morphological features. The {{aim of this study}} was to find genetic markers suitable for distinguishing P. ficus from P. citri, to assist in the rapid identification of field specimens. By using synthetic sex pheromone-baited traps, pure male populations of both species were collected from a vineyard and from a citrus orchard in northern Sardinia, Italy. Individual males of <b>citrus</b> and vine <b>mealybugs</b> were preliminarily examined by the random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. Among twelve 10 -mer random primers, the oligonucleotide OPL- 12 generated several markers suitable for distinguishing between the two species. This primer was then used to characterize individual males and females of both mealybug species collected near pheromone-baited traps in vineyards and orange orchards from different geographic areas. Reference samples from other regions of southern Italy were also included. A clear differentiation of the two species was accomplished according to their pattern of amplification, thus confirming a high level of intra-specific genetic homogeneity. Consequently, two fragments of the cytochrome c oxidase I gene from P. citri and P. ficus were compared and two pairs of species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were developed based on diverging sequences. These primers allowed sensitive and reliable PCR identification of both males and females of P. citri and of P. ficus of different geographic origin...|$|R

40|$|Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (Las) is the {{prevalent}} species {{of three different}} Liberibacter associated with citrus huanglongbing (HLB). Two psyllid species, Diaphorina citri and Trioza erytreae, are currently known to transmit Liberibacter bacteria. In this study, we tested the acquisition and transmission efficiency of Las by striped mealybugs (Ferrisia virgata) (Pseudococcidae; Hemiptera), another phloem-sap feeding insect with a broad host range of 264 species in 68 plant families. In our previous report, 63. 0 % of striped mealybugs collected from the Las-infected periwinkle plants in USHRL greenhouse tested positive for Las using the HLBasp primers and probe, and the Las populations were estimated at 3. 11 x 103 to 2. 32 x 105 cells per mealybug. This was confirmed using conventional PCR with six primer sets targeting different Las loci and by the 100 % identity of all seven PCR amplicons to the known Las sequences. However, attempts to transmit the disease in periwinkle and <b>citrus</b> using Las-infected <b>mealybugs</b> were not successful. To reveal the reason why Las-infected mealybugs {{were not able to}} transmit the disease, we used a leaf-disc bioassay in conjunction with typing of Las populations. Positive Las results were found in 100 % of the mealybugs after feeding for 1 - 2 weeks on infected leaf discs that were obtained from infected periwinkle and citrus leaves. In addition, Las bacteria were detected in mealybug gut, salivary glands and body cavity, with the titer in the gut and body being higher than that in the salivary glands. It is of interest to note that mealybugs grown on infected leaf-discs for 1 week and then transferred to non-infected leaf-discs did not test positive for Las. However, mealybugs grown on infected leaf-discs for 2 weeks and then transferred to non-infected leaf-discs for 2 more weeks remained positive for Las. These results indicate that striped mealybugs share similarities and differences in comparison with the Asian citrus psyllids in terms of acquisition and/or transmission of the Las bacterium...|$|R

Climate was compared across areas where the parasitoid has shown successes and failures in controlling mealybug populations. If climatic conditions impact significantly on C. perminutus biocontrol performance, the CLIMEX output of Ecoclimatic Index (EI) would indicate that the localities worldwide where the species is relatively successful have suitable climatic conditions (EI > 40). Southeastern Queensland data indicated C. perminutus population is relatively low in <b>citrus</b> <b>mealybug</b> samples from two citrus-producing localities, Mundubbera and Nambour. If climatic conditions impact significantly on C. perminutus survival, the model should also predict that the climates, as expressed by the climate Match Index (MI), of southeastern Queensland are not particularly suitable for C. perminutus (MI < 40). CLIMEX predicted Mundubbera and Nambour to be favorable for the population growth and persistence of C. perminutus. Also, the climates of these two Australian localities matched closely with those of localities worldwide where C. perminutus does impose some degree of biocontrol.
