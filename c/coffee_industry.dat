The visit to Europe was a success and thus Puerto Rico became an important member of the worldwide <b>coffee</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{program for}} {{restructuring}} and modernizing the <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> in Colombia has estimated {{an investment of}} two billion dollars. These monetary funds need to be generated from domestic and international sources. The Colombian coffee institutions and the policy making entities are facing the new realities of globalization and monetary volatility and economic uncertainties. Technological advances are being made in electronic commerce, production engineering and quality control, {{in an effort to}} reduce production costs and increase productivity. The historical evidence demonstrates that the institutions, organizations and policy making instruments of the <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> in Colombia are very dynamic and shall continue to adapt to changing circumstances and perform with leadership, innovation and positive results.|$|E
25|$|While {{many factors}} {{contributed to the}} {{impressive}} increase in production and revenue, the rise and success of the Colombian <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> reflects the Federation's rigid adherence to the three objectives which were originally offered to justify its creation: 1) to protect the industry, 2) to study its problems, and 3) to further its interests.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the colonial}} period, Honduras' economy was based largely on mining, cattle raising and the export of {{tropical}} hardwoods. Unlike most of its neighbors, Honduras did not develop a significant <b>coffee</b> <b>industry,</b> and one of the results of this was that much of its export wealth ended up being generated by foreign firms, often creating little local capital. For much of the nineteenth century, Hondurans looked to mining as a means of improving their economic position.|$|E

25|$|In December 1930, the Fourth National Congress of Coffee Growers {{convened in}} Bogotá. Due to the {{knowledge}} and experience of the <b>coffee</b> <b>industry,</b> acquired by running his own coffee business, Mariano Ospina Pérez was summoned by the Minister of Industry, Francisco J. Chaux, and by President Enrique Olaya Herrera to preside over this congress. At the adjournment of this congress, Ospina Pérez was elected, by the unanimous vote of the delegates, as General Director of the Federation serving in this position for four years, until 1934.|$|E
25|$|In the {{election}} {{of members of the}} Board of Directors in 1954, Ospina Pérez was installed as President of the Board of Directors. His return to the Federation marked the reappearance of one of Colombia's most important coffee names in {{an active role in the}} industry. Under Ospina Pérez' aegis, the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia successfully consolidated the nation's <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> and promoted it in the world markets to great effect. Colombia became the largest producer of prime Coffea arabica coffee in the world. He laid a very solid corporative foundation, and today, the Colombian Coffee Federation congregates and supports over 500,000 independent coffee growers and small farmers.|$|E
25|$|The Frenchman Gabriel de Clieu took {{a coffee}} plant to the French {{territory}} of Martinique in the Caribbean , from which {{much of the}} world's cultivated arabica coffee is descended. Coffee thrived in the climate and was conveyed across the Americas. Coffee was cultivated in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) from 1734, and by 1788 it supplied half the world's coffee. The conditions that the slaves worked in on coffee plantations were {{a factor in the}} soon to follow Haitian Revolution. The <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> never fully recovered there.

To make matters worse, after a price jump in 1986 world coffee prices fell by 35 percent in 1987, causing coffee exports to decline in value from US$539 million to US$347 million.|$|R

25|$|Given the {{positive}} advancement of coffee growing in Colombia, an important group of coffee growers, {{dedicated to the}} export of the beans, organized an association to regulate the market. Thus, in 1904, the coffee producers organization ("Sociedad de Productores de Café") was established. Although its good intentions, it failed to regulate the industry and the market. It was a difficult task, as the global conditions were complicated due to overproduction, price volatility and the events of World War I. The <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> in the nation was evolving and growers, merchants and exporters could not agree on policies and regulations to organize and consolidate it.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee {{seedlings}} to Martinique in the Caribbean in 1720. Those sprouts flourished and 50 {{years later}} there were 18,680 coffee trees in Martinique enabling {{the spread of}} coffee cultivation to Saint-Domingue (Haiti), Mexico and other islands of the Caribbean. The French territory of Saint-Domingue, saw coffee cultivated from 1734, and by 1788 it supplied half the world's coffee. Coffee had {{a major influence on}} the geography of Latin America. The French colonial plantations relied heavily on African slave laborers. However, the dreadful conditions that the slaves worked in on coffee plantations were a factor in the soon-to-follow Haitian Revolution.

25|$|The {{glory days}} of the Philippine <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> lasted until 1889 when coffee rust hit the Philippine shores. That, coupled with an insect infestation, {{destroyed}} virtually all the coffee trees in Batangas. Since Batangas was a major producer of coffee, this greatly affected national coffee production. In two years, coffee production was reduced to 1/6th its original amount. By then, Brazil had regained its position as the world's leading producer of coffee. A few of the surviving coffee seedlings were transferred from Batangas to Cavite, where they flourished. This was {{not the end of}} the Philippines' coffee growing days, but there was less area allotted to coffee because many farmers had shifted to other crops.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years, coffee {{production}} in India {{has grown by}} over 15 percent. From 1991, economic liberalisation took place in India, and the industry took full advantage of this and cheaper labour costs of production. In 1993, a monumental Internal Sales Quota (ISQ) made {{the first step in}} liberalising the <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> by entitling coffee farmers to sell 30% of their production within India. This was further amended in 1994 when the Free Sale Quota (FSQ) permitted large and small scale growers to sell between 70% and 100% of their coffee either domestically or internationally. A final amendment in September 1996 saw the liberalisation of coffee for all growers in the country and a freedom to sell their produce wherever they wished.|$|E
25|$|The general {{managers}} or {{directors of the}} National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia do not just function as business managers or administrators, {{given the fact that}} in furtherance of their normal business activities in running efficiently and effectively a private enterprise, they actively participate in the formulation and implementation of national policy for the <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> and they may substantially influence the macro-economic policy of the country. The general Managers have had a seat in the Board of Directors of the Banco de la República, in the Council of Economic and Social Policy (Consejo de Política Económica y Social) and in the Council of International Trade and Commerce.

25|$|The {{second reason}} Hacienda Buena Vista is {{significant}} {{is that it}} offers {{one of the best}} remaining examples of a Puerto Rican coffee plantation.

It is said to have even been the favorite at the Vatican at the time. Hacienda Buena Vista is also significant because it shows the evolution of the <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> in the region. Various periods can be appreciated. These range from the cultivation of produce such as plantains (1833–1845); to the production of flour (from rice and corn) (1847–1872).

40|$|According to the International Coffee Organization, global coffee {{production}} is rising {{driven by an}} increase in total demand. However, similar to other crops, coffee cherries, and beans are exposed to contamination and consequent colonization by fungi during different phases of plant development, harvesting, transport, and storage. Consequently, mycotoxins also contaminate coffee beans although the roasting process has an important role in reducing mycotoxins presence, depending upon the combination of time and temperature. Since each country applies different roasting conditions, significant differences in mycotoxins concentrations occur across Europe with respect to contamination levels even when the origin of the coffee is the same. A previous paper showed high contamination by toxigenic mycobiota of coffee beans to be used in Portuguese <b>coffee</b> <b>industries.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

25|$|The 2-mm-long coffee borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei) is {{the most}} {{damaging}} insect pest to the world's <b>coffee</b> <b>industry,</b> destroying up to 50 {{percent or more of}} the coffee berries on plantations in most coffee-producing countries. The adult female beetle nibbles a single tiny hole in a coffee berry and lays 35 to 50 eggs. Inside, the offspring grow, mate, and then emerge from the commercially ruined berry to disperse, repeating the cycle. Pesticides are mostly ineffective because the beetle juveniles are protected inside the berry nurseries, but they are vulnerable to predation by birds when they emerge. When groves of trees are nearby, the American yellow warbler, rufous-capped warbler, and other insectivorous birds have been shown to reduce by 50 percent the number of coffee berry borers in Costa Rica coffee plantations.|$|E
25|$|Coffee {{also found}} its way to the Isle of Bourbon, now known as Réunion, in the Indian Ocean. The plant {{produced}} smaller beans and was deemed a different variety of arabica known as var. Bourbon. The Santos coffee of Brazil and the Oaxaca coffee of Mexico are the progeny of that Bourbon tree. Circa 1727, the King of Portugal sent Francisco de Melo Palheta to French Guiana to obtain coffee seeds {{to become a part of}} the coffee market. Francisco initially had difficulty obtaining these seeds, but he captivated the French Governor's wife and she sent him enough seeds and shoots to commence the <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> of Brazil. In 1893, the coffee from Brazil was introduced into Kenya and Tanzania (Tanganyika), not far from its place of origin in Ethiopia, 600 years prior, ending its transcontinental journey.|$|E
25|$|Leff (1982, 1997) {{explains}} the decline {{experiences in the}} north-east in terms of Dutch disease. As coffee exports came to play {{a greater role in}} the foreign exchange market, the real exchange rate increasingly reflected the importance of that product, which had a negative impact on the less competitive regions, such as the north-east. It was neither possible to restructure the sugar industry very quickly, nor easy to promote large-scale inter-regional migration flows, although a large number of slaves did move from the north-east to the south-east. Throughout this period, the expansion of the <b>coffee</b> <b>industry</b> was not hindered by any increase in labor costs, since up to 1852(end of the slave trade), wages were depressed by the presence of slave labor and later by subsidized immigration flows, particularly from Italy (Leff 1997:5). This strengthened the existing pattern in Brazil: an export sector that generated high levels of earnings alongside a large sector that catered to the domestic market and a large subsistence economy, both with very low levels of productivity, with the outcome being low per capita income levels but a high export coefficient relative to the other Latin American economies.|$|E
