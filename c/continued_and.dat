The film performed poorly at the box office.|$|E

5|$|By 6:30a.m. {{the battle}} for the Alamo was over. Mexican {{soldiers}} inspected each corpse, bayoneting any body that moved. Even with all of the Texians dead, Mexican soldiers continued to shoot, some killing each other in the confusion.

Although the general showed himself, the violence <b>continued</b> <b>and</b> the buglers were finally ordered to sound a retreat. For 15minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fausto was a {{long-lived}} {{tropical cyclone}} that formed during the 2002 Pacific hurricane season. The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth named storm of the season, Fausto developed on August21 from a tropical wave that {{had crossed the}} Atlantic, and entered the Pacific on August 17. Becoming a tropical depression, the system intensified, and quickly became Tropical Storm Fausto early on August22. Fausto rapidly intensified, and was already a hurricane on that same day as becoming a tropical storm. Rapid intensification <b>continued,</b> <b>and</b> the tropical cyclone ultimately peaked as a strong Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. At that time, the winds 145mph (230km/h). Fausto began to gradually weaken after attaining peak intensity on August24, and was eventually downgraded to a tropical storm two days later. Weakening <b>continued,</b> <b>and</b> Fausto degenerated into a remnant low on August28 while well northeast of Hawaii.|$|E
