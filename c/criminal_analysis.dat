The book provides resources for the law enforcement official including descriptions of devices used for possible bombs, a database of terrorist networks, and a list of references used.

The episode is an emotional one for SSA David Rossi since Unit Chief Erin Strauss is murdered by The Replicator. She was taken from her hotel room, where he had planned to meet her that night, drugged and put on the streets of New York disoriented for Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner to find her. The episode's last scene is SSA David Rossi eulogizing her to the team after her funeral, at a gathering at his home. In season ten, we learn that David has a daughter by his second wife.

Therefore the authors decided to investigate 36 pairs of halfsiblings with known relationships from different parts of Italy, using a high number of autosomal STRs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework that}} supports the detection and mitigation of cognitive biases in visual analytics environments for <b>criminal</b> <b>analysis.</b> Criminal analysts often use visual analytics environments for their analysis of large data sets, for gaining insights on criminal events and patterns of criminal events, and for drawing conclusions and making decisions. However, {{due to the nature}} of human cognition, these cognitive processes may lead to systematic errors, so-called cognitive biases. The most prominent and relevant cognitive bias in the intelligence field is the confirmation bias, in which an analyst disproportionally considers and selects information that supports the initial expectation and hypothesis. The framework presented in this paper describes a model, how the possible occurence of the confirmation bias can be detected automatically, while the analyst makes use of the visual environment. Moreover, based on this information, different feedback methods are employed that support and encourage the mitigation of the confirmation bias. This framework is in a work-in-progress state and contains research objectives and directions, the framework design, initial implementations, plans for further development and integration, as well as user-centric evaluation. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|The use {{by police}} {{services}} and inquiring agencies of forensic data in an intelligence perspective is still fragmentary {{and to some}} extent ignored. In order to increase the efficiency of criminal investigation to target illegal drug trafficking organisations and to provide valuable information about their methods, it is necessary to include and interpret objective drug analysis results already during the investigation phase. The value of visual, physical and chemical data of seized ecstasy tablets, as a support for criminal investigation on a strategic and tactical level has been investigated. In a first phase different characteristics of ecstasy tablets have been studied in order to define their relevance, variation, correlation and discriminating power in an intelligence perspective. During 5 years, over 1200 cases of ecstasy seizures (concerning about 150000 seized tablets) coming from different regions of Switzerland (City and Canton of Zurich, Cantons Ticino, Neuchâtel and Geneva) have been systematically recorded. This {{turned out to be a}} statistically representative database including large and small cases. During the second phase various comparison and clustering methods have been tested and evaluated, on the type and relevance of tablet characteristics, thus increasing knowledge about synthetic drugs, their manufacturing and trafficking. Finally analytical methodologies have been investigated and formalised, applying traditional intelligence methods. In this context classical tools, which are used in <b>criminal</b> <b>analysis</b> (like the I 2 Analyst Notebook, I 2 Ibase, …) have been tested and adapted to address the specific need of forensic drug intelligence. The interpretation of these links provides valuable information about criminal organisations and their trafficking methods.

40|$|Computer {{intrusions}} {{and attacks}} compromise individuals, companies and communities. Whilst {{it is clear}} that computer and information security studies point to a generalised increase in the number and sophistication of computer security attacks over the past decade and that nations now entirely rely upon computer systems, insufficient attention is paid to the protection of those systems. Computer data and network systems affect our everyday lives, from the supply-chain software that ensures that the shelves are stocked at the supermarket, to systems that manage finance and share markets. Compromises of computer security are, therefore, rightly seen both as an attack on those individual entities whose systems and information are compromised, and as a communal attack upon the people and organisations that rely upon or use computer systems, both directly and indirectly. The aim of this thesis is to give an analysis of computer system security, information protections and the legal ramifications of computer security compromise, notably, data security compromise in Australia. Ultimately, the aim is to address three overlapping questions: what are the ways in which systems are breached, what are the legal consequences of a breach and are those consequences adequate? This paper looks at the underlying technology and relationships between actors involved in the majority of security compromises and looks at the common factors in how systems and networks are attacked and actors damaged. The paper then goes on to look at criminal liability for security compromises and shows how a <b>criminal</b> <b>analysis</b> feeds into the proper civil law consideration of the topic. Finally, the paper looks at data security through the lens of privacy. Ultimately, this paper concludes that Australia is inconsistent in its legal responses to information security incidents. Such variations are based on the area of law being discussed and dependent on the breach methodology and outcome. The criminal law provides the most current and potent legal protection any business or individual has had in this field. This is followed by statutory privacy law which provides a narrow degree of coverage and provides only a weak conciliation process for addressing data security issues. Finally, common law and equity provide the most uncertain commercial remedies for those that suffer data security breach. This paper concludes that present protections are inadequate and uncertain, and that change is required...|$|E
