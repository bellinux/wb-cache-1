5|$|In April and May 1944, 9./JG52 {{resisted}} the Soviet Crimean Offensive. In April Hartmann claimed five victories. In May, Hartmann filed claims number 208 to 231 which included six on the 6 May. On 8 May 1944, JG52 fled {{the region as}} the German defence collapsed. Hartmann flew out with two mechanics <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> the fuselage of his Bf109. JG52 subsequently {{took part in the}} defeat of the Soviet First Jassy–Kishinev Offensive on the Romanian-Soviet border.|$|E
5|$|One hundred {{thousand}} {{soldiers on the}} high seas in a multitude of transports converged on Gibraltar. More than 400 aircraft of all types were <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway. Fighters had been shipped in crates and assembled on the airfield. Every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition, fuel, and other essential supplies. 168 American pilots were housed in the RAF messes at North Front.|$|E
5|$|Run privately for profit, as {{were all}} English prisons until the 19th century, the Marshalsea {{looked like an}} Oxbridge college and functioned as an {{extortion}} racket. Debtors in the 18th century who could afford the prison fees had access to a bar, shop and restaurant, and retained the crucial privilege of being allowed out during the day, which gave {{them a chance to}} earn money for their creditors. Everyone else was <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> one of nine small rooms with dozens of others, possibly for years for the most modest of debts, which increased as unpaid prison fees accumulated. The poorest faced starvation and, if they crossed the jailers, torture with skullcaps and thumbscrews. A parliamentary committee reported in 1729 that 300inmates had starved to death within a three-month period, and that eight to ten were dying every 24hours in the warmer weather.|$|E

5|$|The university, {{which is}} built on high ground, served as an {{evacuation}} point and emergency shelter for thousands of flood refugees. The civil defense director of the university expected between 700 and 800 people to take shelter at the university. Between 7,000 and 8,000 showed up as the water rose through August 14 and 15 and <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> facilities designed to house just over 1,000 students. A helipad {{was set up in}} a parking lot, and helicopters from Eielson Air Force Base ferried supplies to the refugees. Fairbanks' power plant was flooded, so the university depended on its physical plant to provide electricity for the refugees. When the rising water threatened to flood the plant, hundreds of the refugees massed to build barricades and pump out the plant's basement.|$|E
5|$|With {{the other}} females not {{selected}} for immediate death, Frank {{was forced to}} strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was tattooed with an identifying number on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread rations for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by scabies. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which {{was in a state}} of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately , spread across around 200 small sites. The difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked on top of each other to fit the available space and covered with a layer of earth. In more crowded areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered to free up space. In some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds, unearthing the previous burials, and fresh corpses <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> the available space. Intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture, coffin wood was burned as household fuel, and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to the north of England to be sold as fertiliser. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid; in 1842 the mean working life of a London professional man was 30 years and of a London labourer just 17 years.|$|E

25|$|Britain again won the Ashes in 1932. In 1932 {{the police}} locked the SCG gates after 70,204 <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> the SCG. This would remain {{the world record}} test match {{attendance}} until eclipsed by the 73,631 who attended the 1992 World Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
25|$|Since it is {{impossible}} to see so many events from His arrest to His crucifixion to be <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> a short time span from midnight to about 9 o'clock in the morning, some argued for more than one day Passion chronology, including Eugen Ruckstuhl (1965).|$|E
25|$|The last {{recorded}} {{train is}} the one used to transport {{the women of the}} Flossenbürg March, where for three days in March 1945 the remaining survivors were <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> cattle cars to await further transport.

60|$|He {{looked on}} in silence after that. And presently, when Ancliffe departed, {{he was glad}} to follow Hough into the street. There the same {{confusion}} held. A loud throng hurried by, as if bent on <b>cramming</b> <b>into</b> a few hours the life that would not last long.|$|R
25|$|As more {{blind people}} are <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> the prison, {{overcrowding}} {{and lack of}} outside support causes hygiene and living conditions to degrade. Soon, the walls and floors are caked in filth and human feces. Anxiety over the availability of food undermines the morale {{and the lack of}} organization prevents the fair distribution of food. The soldiers who guard the asylum become hostile.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{at a time}} {{of growing}} {{ambition}} for the club, terracing was cut into the cinder banking of the Kop and further earth removal from the Cross Street to Saltergate end was undertaken to level the pitch. In a successful push for promotion to the Second Division in 1931-32, 20,092 fans <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> the ground to see the home team overtake Lincoln City for the top spot.|$|E
25|$|After Poland's defeat Zakulski {{joined the}} {{underground}} Military Organization Lizard Union (Związek Jaszczurczy) {{due to his}} prewar contacts in the Organizacja Polska. In the Podgórze district where he lived, on 3 March 1941 the Nazis created Kraków Ghetto on the orders of Gauleiter Hans Frank. Some 15,000 Jews were removed from {{their homes in the}} district of Kazimierz – the main spiritual and cultural centre of Kraków Jewry – and <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> an area of Podgórze previously inhabited by 3,000 people.|$|E

50|$|The public {{relations}} exercise to showcase {{the game in}} Melbourne proved a success with a sell-out crowd of 25,800 <b>cramming</b> <b>into</b> Olympic Park. The game was highlighted by NSW halfback Ricky Stuart racing 70 metres to score, easily outpacing Qld winger Les Kiss who made no ground on the former Wallaby.|$|R
50|$|The trial, at its time, was as notorious as the O.J. Simpson {{trial was}} in the 1990s and was {{accompanied}} by a media circus akin to such trials today. A reputed 8,000 people tried to <b>cram</b> <b>into</b> the church for the funeral and Cunningham reportedly threw herself dramatically on Burdell's casket.|$|R
25|$|Stanley Kirk Burrell {{was born}} on March 30, 1962 in Oakland, California. His father was a {{professional}} poker player and gambling casino manager (at Oaks Card Club's cardroom), as well as warehouse supervisor. He grew up poor with his mother (a secretary) and eight siblings in a small apartment in East Oakland. He recalled that six children were <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> a three-bedroom housing project apartment. The Burrells would also frequent thoroughbred horse races, eventually becoming owners and winners of several graded stakes.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s a {{sustained}} period of aircraft hijackings between Cuba and the U.S. by citizens of both nations {{led to a}} need for cooperation. By 1974, U.S. elected officials had begun to visit the island. Three years later, during the Carter administration, the U.S. and Cuba simultaneously opened interests sections in each other's capitals. In 1980, after 10,000 Cubans <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> the Peruvian embassy seeking political asylum, Castro stated that any who wished to do so could leave Cuba, in {{what became known as}} the Mariel boatlift. Approximately 125,000 people left Cuba for the United States.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1969, the UC Regents fired Angela Davis, {{a radical}} feminist and {{lecturer}} in the Philosophy Department, for openly identifying {{as a member of}} the Communist Party USA. Outraged faculty threatened to withhold grades if Davis was not reinstated, and nearly 2,000 students <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> Royce Hall's auditorium when Davis delivered her first lecture despite the Regents' decision to remove credit for the class. The overflowing audience gave the 25-year-old professor a standing ovation. On October 22, Chancellor Young complied with a State Superior Court order overruling the Regents' decision by restoring course credit to Davis's class. Eight months later, the Regents again dismissed Davis from the UCLA faculty.|$|E

25|$|Sculpting Life {{received}} its premier terrestrial broadcast on the Irish National Broadcaster, RTÉ to much critical acclaim. The film, also aired on the Arts Channel in New Zealand, provides a unique {{view of the}} world of a bronze casting sculptor, as he creates a series of famine sculptures from research, through to unveiling in Ireland Park, Toronto. Partly based on his reading of Joseph O'Connor's the Star of the Sea, Gillespie enters the world of its central character, the murderous Pius Mulvey as he haunts the decks of a coffin ship and becomes an emaciated ghost, living among the hundreds of Irish emigrants <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> steerage. The documentary follows the sculptor as he brings the character to life in bronze.|$|E
25|$|The record {{attendance}} for an SANFL fixture {{was set at}} the 1976 SANFL Grand Final between Sturt and Port Adelaide at Football Park {{which saw}} 66,987 <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> the stadium, though some estimate the crowd to have been as high as 80,000 with thousands turned away at the gates. The largest attendance for a minor round fixture was set in Round 19, 1988 for a double header at Football Park. 38,213 fans saw Sturt play Port Adelaide in the early game while reigning premiers North Adelaide faced ladder leaders Central District in the late game. The record suburban ground attendance was an estimated 24,000 who saw Sturt and Norwood at Unley Oval on 9 June 1924. A verified attendance of 22,738 saw Port play Norwood at Alberton in Round 11, 1977*.|$|E
25|$|The {{sale was}} {{announced}} on the 26th, pending FCC approval. Release the World head Chris Panos pledged to keep as much secular programming as possible, including the NBC affiliation. Still, six full-time staff members left, including Angstadt, leaving the station's engineer Ray McInturff to pull double duty as manager. The station <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> {{half of its}} building {{in an attempt to}} stabilize its financial situation by renting the other half out. The station's financial trouble brought the attention of the State Corporation Commission, who in March found grounds to block the sale. Television Fredericksburg had been granted an exception from stock-registration requirements under Virginia law, which the state argued should be removed if a controlling stake was to be sold to an out-of-state interest. Television Fredericksburg successfully defended its actions in an April 2 hearing, and the sale was allowed to proceed.|$|E
50|$|Game II {{was played}} on a cold and wet night that saw almost 30,000 <b>cram</b> <b>into</b> the Sydney Cricket Ground, {{signalling}} that the New South Wales public had finally embraced the Origin concept. The mud, rain and tolerant eye of referee Barry Gomersall combined to form an explosive mix. Progress was arduous in the SCG quagmire and handling almost impossible.|$|R
