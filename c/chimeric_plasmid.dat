40|$|Genes {{encoding}} {{thymidylate synthetase}} from Bacillus subtilis bacteriophages were cloned in Escherichia coli. Chimeric plasmids pCD 1 and pCD 3 were constructed from site-specific endonuclease digests of bacteriophage phi 3 T DNA cloned in pMB 9 in E. coli. Similar cloning techniques with bacteriophage beta 22 DNA yielded chimeric plasmids pCD 4, pCD 5, and pCD 6. Endonuclease digests of DNA from pCD 1 and pCD 3 propagated in E. coli or from DNA isolated from bacteriophage phi 3 T propagated in B. subtilis transformed B. subtilis from Thy- to Thy+. Intact DNA from bacteriophage beta 22, endonuclease digests of beta 22 DNA, and a <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> (pCD 5) composed {{only of the}} thybeta 22 gene and pMB 9 did not transform B. subtilis from Thy- to Thy+ even though pCD 5 could transform Thy- E. coli to Thy+. However, if the thybeta 22 fragment from pCD 5 was introduced into another <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid,</b> pCD 2, that contains a region of homology to the chromosome of B. subtilis in addition to pMB 9, transformation of Thy- clones of B. subtilis was possible. Furthermore, Southern hybridization analyses of the digests of chromosomal DNA from the Thy+ transformants established that the entire <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> was incorporated into the chromosome of B. subtilis. Treatment of these plasmids with site-specific endonucleases abolished transformation. These {{results indicated that the}} entire <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> can be incorporated into the chromosome of B. subtilis by a Campbell-like model. Therefore, an additional mechanism for transformation exists whereby plasmids can be integrated if sufficient chromosomal homology is maintained...|$|E

40|$|A {{gene cluster}} {{encoding}} biphenyl- and chlorobiphenyl-degrading enzymes was cloned from a soil pseudomonad into Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1161. Chromosomal DNA from polychlorinated biphenyl-degrading Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF 707 was digested with restriction endonuclease XhoI and cloned into the unique XhoI site of broad-host-range plasmid pKF 330. Of 8, 000 transformants tested, only 1, containing the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> pMFB 1, rendered the host cell able to convert biphenyls and chlorobiphenyls to ring meta cleavage compounds via dihydrodiols and dihydroxy compounds. The <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> contained a 7. 9 -kilobase XhoI insert. Subcloning experiments {{revealed that the}} genes bphA (encoding biphenyl dioxygenase), bphB (encoding dihydrodiol dehydrogenase), and bphC (encoding 2, 3 -dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase) were coded for by the 7. 9 -kilobase fragment. The gene order was bphA-bphB-bphC. The hydrolase activity, which converted the intermediate meta cleavage compounds to the final product, chlorobenzoic acids, and was encoded by a putative bphD gene, was missing from the cloned 7. 9 -kilobase fragment...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> was {{constructed}} using colicinigenic factor E 1 (ColE 1) DNA as the replicon and DNA fragments carrying the galactose or tryptophan operons from E. coli. Restriction endonuclease EcoRI digests of ColE 1 DNA and various DNAs containing the trp or gal operons {{were joined by}} T 4 polynucleotide ligase [polynucleotide synthetase (ATP), poly(deoxyribonucleotide) :poly(deoxyribonucleotide) ligase (AMP-forming), EC 6. 5. 1. 1]. <b>Chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> carrying the desired genes were selected after transformation of Trp- or Gal- cells with ligated DNA. By using this method, we constructed ColE 1 -gal and ColE 1 -trp <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> in which {{the source of the}} bacterial gal and trp operons was an unfractionated EcoRI digest of total E. coli DNA. The frequency of recovery of such <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> is 10 to 20 colonies per mug of ligated DNA used in the transformation step. The method utilized in this report for constructing specific <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> from total E. coli DNA is very simple. It requires only endonuclease R-EcoRI and T 4 polynucleotide ligase, both of which are commercially available. The yield of transformants suggests that this method will be useful for cloning and amplifying a wide variety of functionally defined genes from E. coli and other prokaryotic organisms...|$|R
40|$|Biphasic, <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> for the {{transformation}} of Agmenellum quadruplicatum PR- 6 (Synechococcus sp. strain 7002) were constructed by splicing the 3. 0 -megadalton cryptic plasmid from strain PR- 6 into plasmids pBR 322 and pBR 325 from Escherichia coli. Transformants of either E. coli or strain PR- 6 by these plasmids could be detected {{on the basis of}} the drug resistance marker(s) carried by the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Plasmid DNA isolated from a PR- 6 transformant transformed PR- 6 much more efficiently than plasmid DNA prepared from E. coli. Plasmids from which the AvaI recognition site was deleted (AvaI is an isoschizomer of the AquI restriction endonuclease of strain PR- 6) also transformed strain PR- 6 much more efficiently than did plasmids containing the AvaI recognition site. These and other results suggest that AquI strongly effects plasmid transformation when the donor plasmid contains an unmodified AquI recognition site. Multimeric forms of the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> are also much more efficient at transforming strain PR- 6 than are the analogous monomeric forms...|$|R
40|$|The vector pBW 2 {{was made}} to {{selectively}} clone <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> with chromosomal Mu d(bla lacZ) transcriptional or translational fusions. It was tetracycline resistant and had the carboxyl-terminal end of bla distal to its PstI site. Because ligation of PstI-digested chromosomal DNA of a Mu d(bla lacZ) insertion with pBW 2 restored bla, ampicillin-resistant <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> were selectable. These plasmids had the Mu d bla amino terminus and simultaneously acquired other Mu d sequences including lacZ, the chromosomal fusion joint, and the DNA adjacent to the nearest chromosomal PstI site. The plasmid pBW 2 was useful in the molecular cloning of several psi and pho::lacZ(Mu d) fusions, as well as chromosomal genes located near Mu d insertions...|$|R

Certain of these plasmids were shown to express the uvsY or the uvsW gene products by their ability to complement the UV sensitivity of infecting uvsW or uvsY mutant phage. Also, a <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> containing both the uvsW and uvsY genes increases the survival of UV-irradiated, methyl methane sulfonate- or ethyl methane sulfonate-treated recA hosts...|$|E
40|$|The {{protoplast}} fusion technique of Schaffner (W. Schaffner, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77 : 2163 - 2167, 1980) has been adapted to introduce cloned {{herpes simplex virus}} genes into cultured mammalian cells. The technique involves digesting bacterial cell walls with lysozyme to produce protoplasts and then fusing the protoplasts to mammalian cells by treatment with polyethylene glycol. For monitoring transfer, protoplasts were labeled with the fluorescent dye fluorescein isothiocyanate before fusion. After fusion, greater than 50 % of the mammalian cells were fluorescent, demonstrating that bacterial material was transferred with high frequency. Transfer of plasmid pBR 325 occurred at frequencies of 1 to 2 %, as measured by in situ hybridization. Fusion transfer of a <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> consisting of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (strain KOS) EcoRI fragment F in pBR 325 resulted in expression of some viral genomic sequences in about 5 % of the mammalian cells, as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. One Ltk- cell in 300 to 500 was transformed to the TK+ phenotype after fusion with protoplasts carrying the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> pX 1, which consists of pBR 322 and the BamHI fragment coding for the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase gene...|$|E
40|$|Deletions or insertions in the copB gene of plasmid R 1 {{result in}} a copy mutant phenotype. The {{wild-type}} copB gene has been cloned on various plasmid vectors. The presence of such <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> reduced the copy number of R 1 copB mutant plasmids to normal or subnormal levels, indicating {{the expression of a}} trans-acting inhibitor activity from the copB chimeras. However, the cloned copB gene did not affect the copy number of wild-type R 1, and no incompatibility was exerted by the cloned copB gene against wild-type R 1 (or R 100). Although the copB gene is not normally required for the incompatibility exerted by copA, it is shown that the CopB function is required for expression of incompatibility by the copA gene from some types of <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Mutant plasmids that have lost both Cop functions replicate in an uncontrolled fashion...|$|R

They are generated by joining of the nucleotide neighboring the nick {{site in the}} M 13 replication origin to a nonadjacent nucleotide. This nucleotide is most often located within particular short plasmid regions, named deletion hot spots. Three natural hot spots {{were present in the}} <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Two were active only when the DNA replication initiated at the M 13 origin was allowed to progress; the third was active only in the presence of wild-type amounts of DNA ligase.

40|$|Restriction {{endonuclease}} cleavage maps {{of seven}} <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> {{that may be}} used for molecular cloning in Bacillus subtilis are presented. These plasmids all carry multiple antibiotic resistance markers and were constructed by in vitro molecular cloning techniques. Several of the antibiotic resistance markers were shown to undergo insertional inactivation at specific restriction endonuclease sites. Kanamycin inactivation occurred at the BglII site of pUB 110 derivatives, erythromycin inactivation occurred at the HpaI and BclI sites of pE 194 derivatives, and streptomycin inactivation occurred at the HindIII site of pSA 0501 derivatives. A stable mini-derivative of pBD 12 was isolated and characterized. By using these plasmids, we identified proteins involved in plasmid-coded kanamycin and erythromycin resistance. The properties and uses of these <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> in the further development of recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid technology in B. subtilis are discussed...|$|R

The complete nucleotide {{sequence of the}} gene and flanking regions was determined. A protein of approximately 21 kilodaltons was identified when the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> encoding the aacA 1 gene was introduced into E. coli maxicells.

40|$|DNA {{plasmids}} {{were detected}} in two independent strains of Saccharomyces rouxii among 100 yeast strains other than Saccharomyces cerevisiae tested. The plasmids, pSR 1 and pSR 2, had {{almost the same}} mass (approximately 4 X 10 (6) daltons) as 2 -micrometers DNA of S. cerevisiae. pSR 1 and pSR 2 gave identical restriction maps with restriction endonucleases BamHI, EcoRI, HincII, HindIII, and XhoI, and both lacked restriction sites for PstI, SalI, and SmaI. These maps, however, differed significantly from that of S. cerevisiae 2 -micrometers DNA. Restriction analysis also revealed two isomeric forms of each plasmid and suggested {{the presence of a}} pair of inverted repeat sequences in the molecules where intramolecular recombination took place. DNA-DNA hybridization between the pSR 1 and pSR 2 DNAs indicated significant homology between their base sequences, whereas no homology was detected between pSR 1 and pJDB 219, a <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> constructed from a whole molecule of 2 -micrometers DNA, plasmid pMB 9, and a 1. 2 -kilobase DNA fragment of S. cerevisiae bearing the LEU 2 gene. A <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> constructed with pSR 1 and YIp 1, the larger EcoRI-SalI fragment of pBR 322 ligated with a 6. 1 -kilobase DNA fragment of S. cerevisiae bearing the HIS 3 gene, could replicate autonomously in an S. cerevisiae host and produced isomers, presumably by intramolecular recombination at the inverted repeats...|$|E
40|$|The {{transcription}} of cloned maize plastid DNA sequences {{in vitro}} by maize plastid DNA-dependent RNA polymerase {{has been studied}} to expose {{the roles of the}} enzyme, polypeptide cofactors, and DNA sequences in the regulation of gene expression. The 4. 35 -kilobase pair BamHI fragment 9 carries the maize plastid gene for the large subunit of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase and part of the gene for a 2. 2 -kilobase RNA. These two genes are separated by ≈ 330 base pairs and are transcribed divergently. Transcripts of the gene for the large subunit of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase are abundant in bundle sheath cells of maize leaves and we show here that transcripts of the 2. 2 -kilobase RNA gene are present in both mesophyll cells and the adjacent bundle sheath cells. In vitro, {{in the presence of the}} S factor, maize chloroplast DNA-dependent RNA polymerase produces a transcript of the gene for the large subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase with a 5 ′ terminus like that of the corresponding mRNA isolated from plastids, transcribes chloroplast DNA sequences of Bam fragment 9 in a <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> in preference to the vehicle RSF 1030 and, in a ratio of 3 : 1, preferentially transcribes the gene for the large subunit of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase over the 2. 2 -kilobase RNA gene from supercoiled <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} DNA {{replication}} of bacteriophage f 1 contains a nucleotide sequence {{that is used}} both for the initiation of viral (plus) strand synthesis and for its termination. With <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> containing two f 1 functional origins in the same orientation, synthesis of chimeric plus-strand DNA is initiated, after f 1 infection, at either {{one of the two}} f 1 origins and is terminated at the other. Thus, the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> segregate into two replicons, each of them containing only one f 1 origin. This system has been used to test several fragments of the f 1 origin varying in size or in nucleotide sequence for their ability to function in either initiation or termination of viral strand synthesis.

40|$|<b>Chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> able to {{replicate}} in Bacteroides fragilis or in B. fragilis and Escherichia coli were constructed {{and used as}} molecular cloning vectors. The 2. 7 -kilobase pair (kb) cryptic Bacteroides plasmid pBI 143 and the E. coli cloning vector pUC 19 were the two replicons used for these constructions. Selection of the plasmid vectors in B. fragilis {{was made possible by}} ligation to a restriction fragment bearing the clindamycin resistance (Ccr) determinant from a Bacteroides R plasmid, pBF 4;Ccr was not expressed in E. coli. The <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> ranged from 5. 3 to 7. 3 kb in size and contained at least 10 unique restriction enzyme recognition sites suitable for cloning. Transformation of B. fragilis with the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> was dependent upon the source of the DNA; generally 10 (5) transformants micrograms- 1 of DNA were recovered when plasmid purified from B. fragilis was used. When the source of DNA was E. coli, there was a 1, 000 -fold {{decrease in the number of}} transformants obtained. Two of the shuttle plasmids not containing the pBF 4 Ccr determinant were used in an analysis of the transposon-like structure encoding Ccr in the R plasmid pBI 136. This gene encoding Ccr was located on a 0. 85 -kb EcoRI-HaeII fragment and cloned nonselectively in E. coli. Recombinants containing the gene inserted in both orientations at the unique ClaI site within the pBI 143 portion of the shuttle plasmids could transform B. fragilis to clindamycin resistance. These results together with previous structural data show that the gene encoding Ccr lies directly adjacent to one of the repeated sequences of the pBI 136 transposon-like structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{gene for}} {{thermostable}} alpha-amylase from the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Each alpha-amylase-producing colony contained {{at least a}} 9. 7 -kilobase-pair (kb) <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> composed of the vector pBR 322 and a common 5. 4 -kb HindIII fragment of DNA. B. stearothermophilus contains four plasmids with sizes from 12 kb to over 108 kb. Restriction endonuclease analysis of these naturally occurring plasmids showed they also contain a 5. 4 -kb HindIII fragment of DNA. Cloning experiments with the four plasmids yielded alpha-amylase-producing E. coli that contained the same 9. 7 -kb <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid.</b> Restriction endonuclease analysis and further recombinant DNA experiments identified a 26 -kb plasmid that contains the gene for alpha-amylase. A spontaneous mutant of B. stearothermophilus unable to produce alpha-amylase was missing the 26 -kb plasmid but contained a 20 -kb plasmid. A 6 -kb deletion within {{the region of the}} 5. 4 -kb HindIII fragment yielded the 20 -kb plasmid unable to code for alpha-amylase. A nick-translated probe for the alpha-amylase coding region did not hybridize to either plasmid or total cellular DNA from this mutant strain of B. stearothermophilus. These results demonstrate the gene for alpha-amylase is located exclusively on a 26 -kb plasmid in B. stearothermophilus with no genetic counterpart present on the chromosome...|$|E
40|$|A <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid,</b> pBOP, {{containing}} bovine papillomavirus (BPV) and {{the origin}} of replication from simian virus 40 (SV 40) was constructed. The plasmid was established in mouse cells, where it was maintained stably as an autonomous BPV replicon. Lines carrying pBOP were fused to cells of COS- 7, a simian line producing SV 40 T antigen. Replication dependent on the SV 40 origin and having the kinetics and approximate amplitude of an SV 40 infection ensued. SV 40 replication is therefore dominant over BPV replication, and the SV 40 origin can conveniently be used to amplify lower-copy-number plasmids in mammalian cells...|$|E

Computer {{assisted}} {{design of the}} gene included restriction endonuclease sites for plasmid insertion, a termination codon and two triplets coding for lysine at the 5 '-end of the structural gene. The synthesis involved preparation of 23 oligodeoxyribonucleotides by phosphotriester procedures coupled to rapid HPLC techniques. The gene was constructed in two halves by enzymatic ligation of the oligonucleotides and cloned into a specially constructed <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> vector.

40|$|The {{tetracycline}} resistance gene (tet) {{from the}} Campylobacter jejuni plasmid pFKT 1025 was cloned into both pUC 18 and pBR 322 and was expressed when the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> were introduced into Escherichia coli. The {{location of the}} tet determinant on the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> was determined by BAL 31 deletion mapping within a 2. 25 -kilobase (kb) RsaI-HincII fragment. A protein of approximately 70 kilodaltons was consistently produced by E. coli maxicells harboring the cloned tet determinant. A 500 -base-pair restriction fragment from within the 2. 25 -kb tet region was shown to hybridize only to DNA from tetracycline-resistant strains of C. jejuni and C. coli, {{but not to the}} DNA of organisms known to carry the streptococcal tetM determinant. No homology was noted between the DNA of 10 tetracycline-resistant isolates of campylobacter and the streptococcal tetL, tetM, or tetN determinants when tested under conditions of high stringency.

40|$|Mapping vectors {{containing}} {{antibiotic resistance}} markers inserted adjacent to or within different cloned genes from Streptococcus mutans {{were used to}} determine the relative positions of these genes on the chromosome. The gtfA, ftf, and scrB genes were inserted into streptococcal mapping vector pVA 891 adjacent to an Emr gene, whereas the Emr marker was inserted directly into the gtfB gene. These <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> were transformed into S. mutans GS- 5, selecting for Emr transformants. To determine the positions of the cloned genes relative to each other, it was necessary to construct plasmids labeled with a different antibiotic resistance marker. Thus, a Tetr gene was inserted adjacent to gtfB in the appropriate mapping vector and within the ftf and scrB genes with a mini-Mu transposon (Mu dT). The <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> were transformed into the appropriate Emr recipients, and the DNA from the resulting Emr Tetr transformants was used in linkage studies. Based on the cotransfer data, gtfB was not closely linked to gtfA, ftf, or scrB. However, gtfA cotransferred with ftf and scrB at frequencies of approximately 96 and 80 %, respectively. The percent cotransfer of ftf and scrB was approximately 92. These data indicate that the three genes are clustered on the GS- 5 chromosome, with ftf located between gtfA and scrB.

40|$|Cleavage at the F plasmid nic site {{within the}} origin of {{transfer}} (oriT) requires the F-encoded proteins TraY and TraI and the host-encoded protein integration host factor in vitro. We confirm that F TraY, but not F TraM, is required for cleavage at nic in vivo. <b>Chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> were constructed which contained either the entire F or R 100 - 1 oriT regions or various combinations of nic, TraY, and TraM binding sites, {{in addition to the}} traM gene. The efficiency of cleavage at nic and the frequency of mobilization were assayed in the presence of F or R 100 - 1 plasmids. The ability of these <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> to complement an F traM mutant or affect F transfer via negative dominance was also measured using transfer efficiency assays. In cases where cleavage at nic was detected, R 100 - 1 TraI was not sensitive to the two-base difference in sequence immediately downstream of nic, while F TraI was specific for the F sequence. Plasmid transfer was detected only when TraM was able to bind to its cognate sites within oriT. High-affinity binding of TraY in cis to oriT allowed detection of cleavage at nic but was not required for efficient mobilization. Taken together, our results suggest that stable relaxosomes, consisting of TraI, -M, and -Y bound to oriT are preferentially targeted to the transfer apparatus (transferosome) ...|$|R
40|$|A cloned 270 -nucleotide {{fragment}} {{from the}} origin {{region of the}} M 13 duplex replicative form DNA confers an M 13 -dependent replication mechanism upon the plasmid vector pBR 322. This M 13 insert permits M 13 helper-dependent replication of the hybrid plasmid in polA cells which are unable to replicate the pBR 322 replicon alone. Using in vitro techniques, we have constructed several plasmids containing deletions in the M 13 DNa insert. The endpoints of these deletions have been determined by DNA sequence analysis and correlated with the transformation and replication properties of each plasmid. Characterization of these deletion plasmids allows the following conclusions. (i) The initiation site for M 13 viral strand replication is required for helper-dependent propagation of the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid.</b> (ii) A DNA sequence in the M 13 insert, localized between 89 and 129 nucleotides from the viral strand initiation site, is necessary for efficient transformation of polA cells. A <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> containing the viral strand initiation site, but lacking this additional 40 nucleotide M 13 sequence, transforms helper-infected cells at a frequency approximately 10 (4) -fold {{less than that of}} plasmids containing this additional DNA segment. (iii) The entire M 13 complementary strand origin can be deleted without affecting M 13 -dependent transformation by the hybrid plasmids. We propose a model in which replication of one strand of duplex chimera initiates by nicking at the gene II protein nicking site in the viral strand of the M 13 insert, followed by asymmetric single-strand synthesis.

In heterozygous males of this line, and in a male derived from another microinjection, transcription of these new germ line genes occurs in the testes and is specifically stimulated by glucocorticoid hormones.

40|$|A small {{derivative}} of plasmid R 1 {{was used to}} integratively suppress a chromosomal dnaA(Ts) mutation. The strain obtained grew normally at 42 °C. The integratively suppressed strain was used as recipient for various plasmid R 1 derivatives. Plasmid R 1 and miniplasmid derivatives of R 1 could be established in the strain that carried an integrated R 1 replicon, but they were rapidly lost during growth. However, plasmids also carrying ColE 1 replication functions were almost completely stably inherited. The integratively suppressed strain therefore allows the establishment of bacteria diploid with respect to plasmid R 1 and forms a useful and sensitive system for studies of interaction between plasmid R 1 replication functions. Several of the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> caused inhibition of growth at high temperatures. All plasmids that inhibited growth carried one particular PstI fragment from plasmid R 1 (the PstI F fragment), and in all cases the growth inhibition could be ascribed to repression of initiation of chromosome replication at 42 °C, i. e., they carry a trans-acting switch-off function. Furthermore, the analogous PstI fragments from different copy mutants of plasmid R 1 were analyzed similarly, and one mutant was found to lack the switch-off function. The different <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> were also tested for their incompatibility properties. All plasmids that carried the switch-off function (and no other plasmids) also carried R 1 incompatibility gene(s). Since the PstI F fragment, which is present on all these plasmids, is very small (0. 35 × 106), {{it is suggested that}} the switch-off regulation of replication (by an inhibitor), incompatibility, and copy number control are governed by the same gene...|$|R
40|$|The ADV-G {{strain of}} Aleutian mink disease {{parvovirus}} (ADV) is nonpathogenic for mink but replicates permissively in cell culture, whereas the ADV-Utah 1 strain is highly pathogenic for mink but replicates poorly in cell culture. In order to relate these phenotypic differences to primary genomic features, we constructed {{a series of}} <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> between a full-length replication-competent molecular clone of ADV-G and subgenomic clones of ADV-Utah 1 representing map units (MU) 15 to 88. After transfection of the plasmids into cell culture and serial passage of cell lysates, we determined that substitution of several segments of the ADV-Utah 1 genome (MU 15 to 54 and 65 to 73) within an infectious ADV-G plasmid did not impair the ability of these constructs to yield infectious virus in vitro. Like ADV-G, the viruses derived from these replication-competent clones caused neither detectable viremia 10 days after inoculation nor any evidence of Aleutian disease in adult mink. On the other hand, other <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> were incapable of yielding infectious virus and were therefore replication defective in vitro. The MU 54 to 65 EcoRI-EcoRV fragment of ADV-Utah 1 was the minimal segment capable of rendering ADV-G replication defective. Substitution of the ADV-G EcoRI-EcoRV fragment into a replication-defective clone restored replication competence, indicating that this 0. 53 -kb portion of the genome, wholly located within shared coding sequences for the capsid proteins VP 1 and VP 2, contained a determinant that governs replication in cell culture. When cultures of cells were studied 5 days after transfection with replication-defective clones, rescue of dimeric replicative form DNA and single-stranded progeny DNA could not be demonstrated. This defect could not be complemented by cotransfection with a replication-competent construction...|$|R

Carrot protoplasts were used as a model system to optimize gene-transfer efficiency, which was measured 24 - 48 hr after electroporation {{by the amount of}} chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity resulting from the expression of the introduced <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Gene-transfer efficiency increased with the DNA concentration and was affected by the amplitude and duration of the electric pulse {{as well as by the}} composition of the electroporation medium. Our optimized gene-transfer conditions were effective when applied to tobacco and maize protoplasts, demonstrating that the method is applicable to both monocot and dicot protoplasts...|$|R
40|$|A {{recombinant}} plasmid, pCB 300, {{was constructed}} which carries a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) DNA insert corresponding to nucleotides 1825 - 2280, including the coding sequence (1830 - 2219) of {{open reading frame}} III (ORF III). This CaMV DNA insert was fused with the amino-terminal portion of the beta-galactosidase gene. Transcription of the hybrid gene {{is controlled by the}} lac promoter, which is repressed in Escherichia coli strain JM 103 and can be induced by isopropylthio-beta-D-galactoside (IPTG). When the promoter is derepressed, cells harboring the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> produce an Mr 16 000 fusion protein. This protein is immunodetected by antibodies raised against an amino terminal synthetic peptide of 19 amino acids corresponding to a sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence of ORF III...|$|E
40|$|Binding of the DnaA protein to its binding sites, the DnaA-boxes (TTATCCACA), was {{measured}} by a simple physiological approach. The presence of extra DnaA-boxes in growing cells leads to a derepression of dnaA gene expression, measured as beta-galactosidase activity of a dnaA-lacZ fusion polypeptide. Different DnaA-boxes caused different degrees of derepression indicating that the DnaA protein requires sequences {{in addition to the}} DnaA-box for efficient binding. The DnaA-boxes in oriC might act cooperatively in binding of the DnaA protein. The derepressed levels of DnaA protein obtained in a strain carrying an oriC+-pBR 322 chimera were very high and sufficient to activate oriC on the <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid,</b> which was maintained at a copy number more than three times that of pBR 322...|$|E
40|$|We {{have placed}} a 225 -bp {{fragment}} from the 5 ' {{end of the}} mouse rDNA transcription unit (from - 169 to + 56) {{in front of the}} SV 40 tumor antigen coding sequence. After microinjection of this <b>chimeric</b> <b>plasmid</b> into nuclei of mouse L-cells expression of SV 40 large T antigen has been observed. The expression of T antigen was dependent on the correct orientation of the rDNA fragment relative to the T antigen-coding region and was seen only in mouse cells. This indicates that the 225 -bp rDNA fragment contains the sequence information required for pre-rRNA transcription and demonstrates {{for the first time that}} a protein-coding gene can be transcribed and expressed under the control of an RNA polymerase I promoter...|$|E
40|$|The RP 4 {{replicon}} {{was detected}} as covalently-closed circular DNA in Caulobacter crescentus strains into {{which it had}} been transferred from Escherichia coli. RP 4 -mediated transfer of ColE 1 -associated markers into C. crescentus occurred, but only {{as the result of}} transposon-mediated events. Both transposition of a ColE 1 -associated marker onto RP 4 and cointegration of ColE 1 with RP 4 were observed. <b>Chimeric</b> <b>plasmids</b> containing both a ColE 1 and an RP 4 origin of replication were stably maintained in C. crescentus, but similar plasmids lacking the RP 4 origin of replication were not stably maintained in C. crescentus. Thus we show that the ColE 1 replicon cannot be maintained in C. crescentus unless it is covalently linked to another replicon, such as RK 2, that can be maintained...|$|R
40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus {{thymidine}} kinase gene has been cloned into a <b>chimeric</b> yeast <b>plasmid</b> cloning vehicle and transformed into appropriate yeast strains. Plasmids carrying the {{herpes simplex virus}} thymidine kinase gene can be propagated as autonomously replicating plasmids, but no RNA specific to the thymidine kinase coding sequence was detected...|$|R
40|$|Zea mays {{chloroplast}} DNA-dependent RNA polymerase {{in vitro}} preferentially transcribes maize chloroplast DNA sequences incorporated in cloned <b>chimeric</b> bacterial <b>plasmids.</b> Preferential transcription {{is dependent on}} the presence of a 27. 5 -kilodalton polypeptide, the S factor, which has been purified from maize chloroplasts, and also on the template's being in the supercoiled form...|$|R
