40|$|Until {{the early}} 1950 s, there {{did not exist}} any {{effective}} treatment for airway obstruction or cardiac arrest for lay-persons. In the late 1950 s, isolated steps were described to establish a patent airway (A), provide mouth-to-mouth breath-ing (B), and restore circulation (C) with chest compressions. Tying those steps together into an A-B-C sequence became the basis of physiologically effective <b>cardiopulmonary-cerebral</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> as the method was called originally. 1 Article see p 2173 Although single steps proved to be effective, the outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated by <b>cardiopulmonary-cerebral</b> <b>resuscitation</b> were not encouraging from the very start. The efforts provided by bystanders and medical person-nel came often “too little too late,” 2 {{and there was a}} lack of spe-cific therapies to treat the underlying causes or complications. The community-wide efforts of the public health organizations focused on the promotion of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a newly coined term, now lacking the cerebral component. It is thus not surprising that the mainstay of further medi-cal research focused mainly on the heart. Restoration of car-diac rhythm became an essential centerpiece of resuscitation efforts. Significant improvements in the survival of patients who had had a cardiac arrest were enabled by technological developments generally aimed to support the failing heart. The emergence of defibrillators in the 1960 s, followed by percutaneous coronary interventions and mechanical devices supporting the failing heart granted the extra time to recover cardiac function in patients who would not have had the same chance several years ago. The brain as the key and target organ seemed somewhat left behind, at least in these early years. Indeed, there was very little that medicine could offer to pro-tect, or restore, the brain function. In comparison with the orchestrated full-front industry-sponsored research aimed at supporting the failing heart, only a few research centers remained interested in the brain...|$|E
40|$|Standard <b>cardiopulmonary-cerebral</b> <b>resuscitation</b> {{fails to}} achieve {{restoration}} of spontaneous circulation in ~ 50 % of normovolemic sudden cardiac arrests outside hospitals and in essentially all victims of penetrating truncal trauma who exsanguinate rapidly to cardiac arrest. Among <b>cardiopulmonary-cerebral</b> <b>resuscitation</b> innovations since the 1960 s, automatic external defibrillation, mild hypothermia, emergency (portable) cardiopulmonary bypass, and suspended animation have potentials for clinical breakthrough effects. Suspended animation {{has been suggested}} for presently unresuscitable conditions and consists of the rapid induction of preservation (using hypothermia with or without drugs) of viability of the brain, heart, and organism (within 5 mins of normothermic cardiac arrest no-flow), which increases the time available for transport and resuscitative surgery, followed by delayed resuscitation. Since 1988, we have developed and used novel dog models of exsanguination cardiac arrest to explore suspended animation potentials with hypothermic and pharmacologic strategies using aortic cold flush and emergency portable cardiopulmonary bypass. Outcome evaluation was at 72 or 96 hrs after cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary bypass cannot be initiated rapidly. A single aortic flush of cold saline (4 °C) {{at the start of}} cardiac arrest rapidly induced (depending on flush volume) mild-to-deep cerebral hypothermia (35 ° to 10 °C), without cardiopulmonary bypass, and preserved viability during a cardiac arrest no-flow period of up to 120 mins. In contrast, except for one antioxidant (Tempol), explorations of 14 different drugs added to the aortic flush at room temperature (24 °C) have thus far had disappointing outcome results. Profound hypothermia (10 °C) during 60 -min cardiac arrest induced and reversed with cardiopulmonary bypass achieved survival without functional or histologic brain damage. Further plans for the systematic development of suspended animation include the following: a) aortic flush, combining hypothermia with mechanism-specific drugs and novel fluids; b) extension of suspended animation by ultraprofound hypothermic preservation (0 ° to 5 °C) with cardiopulmonary bypass; c) development of the most effective suspended animation protocol for clinical trials in trauma patients with cardiac arrest; and d) modification of suspended animation protocols for possible use in normovolemic ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, in which attempts to achieve restoration of spontaneous circulation by standard external cardiopulmonary resuscitation-advanced life support have failed...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Cardiopulmonary-cerebral</b> <b>resuscitation</b> (CPCR) {{training}} {{is essential for}} all hospital workers, especially junior residents who might become {{the manager of the}} resuscitation team. In our center, the traditional CPCR knowledge training curriculum for junior residents up to 5 years ago was lecture-based and had some faults. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a problem-based method on residents ’ CPCR knowledge and skills as well as their evaluation of their CPCR trainers. Methods: This study, conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, included 290 first-year residents in 2009 - 2010 - who were trained via a problem-based method (the problem-based group) - and 160 first-year residents in 2003 - 2004 -who were trained via a lecture-based method (the lecture-based group). Other educational techniques and facilities were similar. The participants self-evaluated their own CPCR knowledge and skills pre and post workshop and also assessed their trainers ’ efficacy post workshop by completing special questionnaires. Results: The problem-based group, trained via the problem-based method, had higher self-assessment scores of CPCR knowledge and skills post workshop: the difference as regards the mean scores between the problem-based and lecture-base...|$|E
40|$|Hospice {{care has}} been proved to result in changes to the medical {{behaviors}} of terminally ill patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects and medical behavior changes of hospice-shared care intervention among terminally ill gastric cancer patients. A total of 174 patients who died of gastric cancer between 2012 and 2014 were identified. These patients were divided into two groups: a hospice-shared care group (n = 93) and a control group (n = 81). Among the 174 patients, 84 % had advanced stage (stage III or stage IV) cancer. The females and the patients cared by medical oncologists had a higher percentage of hospice-shared care than the males (71 % vs 44 %, p = 0. 001) and those cared by other physicians (63 % vs 41 %, p = 0. 004). Compared to the control group, the hospice-shared care group underwent lower incidence of life sustaining or aggressive medical treatments, including intensive care unit admission (2 % vs 26 %, p< 0. 001), intubation (1 % vs 27 %, p< 0. 001), <b>cardiopulmonary-cerebral</b> <b>resuscitation</b> (0 % vs 11 %, p = 0. 001), ventilator use (1 % vs 27 %, p< 0. 001), inotropic agent use (8 % vs 46 %, p< 0. 001), total or partial parenteral nutrition use (38 % vs. 58 %, p = 0. 029), and blood transfusion (45 % vs 74 %, p< 0. 001). Besides, the hospice-shared care group had a higher percentage of palliative treatments than the control group, including signed Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders (95 % vs 37 %, p< 0. 001), receiving home hospice care (16 % vs 1 %, p< 0. 001), and indicating home as the realistically preferred place of death (41 % vs 19 %, p = 0. 001). The hospice ward admission rate in the hospice-shared care group increased from 30 % to 53 % from 2012 to 2014. The use of hospice-shared care for gastric cancer patients could increase the rate of signed DNR orders, decrease the use of life sustaining and aggressive/palliative treatments, and improve quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Most trauma {{cases with}} rapid {{exsanguination}} to cardiac arrest (CA) in the field, {{as well as}} many cases of normovolemic sudden cardiac death are ‘unresuscitable’ by standard <b>cardiopulmonary–cerebral</b> <b>resuscitation</b> (CPCR). We are presenting a dog model for exploring pharmacological strategies for the rapid induction by aortic arch flush of suspended animation (SA), i. e. preservation of cerebral viability for 15 min or longer. This can be extended by profound hypothermic circulatory arrest of at least 60 min, induced and reversed with (portable) cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). SA is meant to buy time for transport and repair during pulselessness, to be followed by delayed resuscitation to survival without brain damage. This model with exsanguination over 5 min to CA of 15 -min no-flow, is to evaluate rapid SA induction by aortic flush of normal saline solution (NSS) at room temperature (24 °C) at 2 -min no-flow. This previously achieved normal functional recovery, but with histologic brain damage. We hypothesized that the addition of adenosine would achieve recovery with no histologic damage, because adenosine delays energy failure and helps repair brain injury. This dog model included reversal of 15 -min no-flow with closed-chest CPB, controlled ventilation to 20 h, and intensive care to 72 h. Outcome was evaluated by overall performance, neurologic deficit, and brain histologic damage. At 2 min of CA, 500 ml of NSS at 24 °C was flushed (over 1 min) into the brain and heart via an aortic balloon catheter. Controls (n= 5) received no drug. The adenosine group (n= 5) received 2 -chloro-adenosine (long acting adenosine analogue), 30 mg in the flush solution, and, after reperfusion, adenosine i. v. over 12 h (210 μg/kg per min for 3 h, 140 μg/kg per min for 9 h). The 24 °C flush reduced tympanic membrane temperature (Tty) within 2 min of CA from 37. 5 to ≈ 36. 0 °C in both groups. At 72 h, final overall performance category (OPC) 1 (normal) was achieved by all ten dogs of the two groups. Final neurologic deficit scores (NDS; 0 – 10 % normal, 100 % brain death) were 5 ± 3 % in the control group versus 6 ± 5 % in the adenosine group (NS). Total brain histologic damage scores (HDS) at 72 h were 74 ± 9 (64 – 80) in the control group versus 68 ± 19 (40 – 88) in the adenosine group (NS). In both groups, ischemic neurons were as prevalent in the basal ganglia and neocortex as in the cerebellum and hippocampus. The mild hypothermic aortic flush protocol is feasible in dogs. The adenosine strategy used does not abolish the mild histologic brain damage...|$|E
