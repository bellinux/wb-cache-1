In order to obtain the mechanical properties of horizontal <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> <b>surface,</b> a comprehensive research was conducted. The research focused on the tensile capacity and seismic behavior of <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> <b>surface.</b> According the tests failure characteristics, four kinds of cracking model of <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> zone were formed. Test results indicated that bond materials could increase displacement ductility more than 10 ％～ 30 ％. And the clamping action provided by bond materials was so good that failure didn’t occur at the <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> itself, but in the concrete adjacent to it. Axial compressive force is advantageous for the shear capacity of <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> interface...|$|R
40|$|<b>Construction</b> <b>joints</b> are {{stopping}} {{places in}} the process of placing concrete, and they are required because in many structures it is impractical to place concrete in one continuous operation. The amount of concrete that can be placed at one time is governed by the batching and mixing capacity and by the strength of the formwork. A good <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> should provide adequate flexural and shear continuity through the interface. In this study, the effect of location of <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> on the performance of reinforced concrete structural elements is experimentally investigated. Nineteen beam specimens with dimensions of 200 × 200 × 950 mm were tested. The variables investigated are the location of the <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> (at midspan or at third point of the specimens), type of <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> (vertical, inclined, and key <b>construction</b> <b>joints),</b> and presence of stirrups at these joints. The specimens were tested using 1000 kN computer controlled versatile electronic testing machine. The specimens were positioned in the machine so that the deflection at center andor at the location of <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> was measured at each load step. The results of the experimental program indicated that the best location of the <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> is at the point of minimum shear. It was found that the use of vertical <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> has little effect on the overall behavior of beam specimens (the percentage of reduction in ultimate load capacity is in the range of 0 % - 5 %). While inclined <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> results in a noticeable reduction in strength of beams relative to the strength of beam without <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> the percentage of reduction in ultimate load capacity is in range of 8 % - 20 %. The presence of stirrups at the <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> is an important variable, which affect the type of failure and load carrying capacity. It is found that adding of stirrups across the joint results in an increase in capacity in the range of (7 %- 15 %) and a decrease in deflection in the range of (20 %- 48 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 15, 2016 - June 15, 2017 Concrete is {{the most widely used}} construction material in the world. When constructing large concrete structures, concrete may have to be placed in multiple lifts. In these cases, fresh concrete is placed on hardened concrete. The interface that is formed between these two lifts of concrete is known as a <b>construction</b> <b>joint.</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>joints</b> are common in reinforced concrete systems. However, little is known on how construction practices, specifically the preparation and curing of these joints, affects their strength and durability. State Highway Agencies (SHAs) require special treatment of these <b>construction</b> <b>joints.</b> The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) requires that <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> be water cured for 7 to 10 days prior to placing the next lift of concrete and that the <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> be saturated for a minimum of 4 hours before placing the fresh concrete. WSDOT also requires that water from the curing and wetting of the <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> be collected, tested, and treated before release. This often requires the construction of a complex drainage and water treatment system, which is expensive. These requirements were implemented with the objective of ensuring that the joint achieves sufficient strength and will resist deterioration throughout the life of the structure. However, very little research has been performed to assess whether these requirements lead to higher joint strength and better joint durability. Hence, the factors that influence these <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> need to be identified and quantified through research. An experimental investigation was performed to evaluate concrete <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> prepared with various surface characteristics and curing conditions. Three curing conditions (no cure, water cure, and compound cure) and three surface conditions (as-finished, intentionally roughened, and sand blasted) were evaluated. Forty-five slant shear specimens and twenty-seven durability specimens were designed, constructed, and tested to evaluate the bond strength and durability of <b>construction</b> <b>joints,</b> respectively. Durability is defined here as the rate of chloride penetration through the <b>construction</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|R

During humongous construction projects, it is very rare to build a concrete structure without instigating the use of <b>construction</b> <b>joints,</b> whether by design or by de facto forces. On site, the construction supervisor would contemplate whether one could relate the bending capacity of the concrete beam with the use of accidently imposed <b>construction</b> <b>joint.</b> Thus it is very essential to determine the effect the <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> has on the flexural bending capacity of the concrete.

40|$|Abstract: The {{three-dimensional}} roughness {{characteristics of}} the tensile granite <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> are studied. Firstly, the tensile granite joints are prepared by splitting cubic granite blocks, and the triangular networks of the <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> are established based on the topographic data collected by laser scanner. Then, the roughness {{characteristics of the}} two-dimensional profiles in different positions and different directions are studied. It proves that the roughness of the tensile granite <b>joint</b> <b>surface</b> is position and direction depended, and the roughness parameters based on the profiles are inadequate to characterize the roughness of the three-dimensional <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Some new roughness parameters to characterize the three-dimensional <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces</b> are finally calculated {{on the basis of}} the triangular networks, these parameters can reflect the spatial and anisotropic characteristics of the <b>joint</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The results in this paper will lay the foundation for further study of the roughness characteristics and mechanical properties of the tensile rock joints...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{experimentally}} correlate the compressive strength (f′c) of concrete to the modulus of rupture (fr) for plain concrete beams with a vertical <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> placed at their center. The ACI code provides a formula for the correlation of fr to f′c, but with the provision that the concrete specimen is monolithic (no joints). It is well known that no concrete structure is built without the use of <b>construction</b> <b>joints,</b> whether planned or un-planned, an engineer would definitely benefit from an equation that could relate the modulus of rupture of concrete as a function of its compressive strength. A better understanding of the effects of <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> on the modulus of rupture will assist engineers in making rational decisions on how to deal with vertical <b>construction</b> <b>joints,</b> which in turn will lead to ultimate cost savings on large-scale projects. In this study, seven different concrete mix designs were used. From each concrete mix, six plain concrete beams were poured, half of which were monolithic and the other half with a vertical <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> at the beam center. Four cylinders per design mix were casted for the purpose of obtaining the mix compressive strength. The experimental results indicate that for monolithic beams, the ACI Code always underestimates the modulus of rupture, whereas in the presence of a vertical <b>construction</b> <b>joint,</b> the conducted experiments yield a significant loss in the modulus of rupture of concrete that varies between 24 % and 83 %. Thus, there is a clear justification for providing dowels at <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> in order to assure continuity in strength over joints in plain concrete...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn general {{composite}} {{concrete slabs}} consist of two concrete layers: a prefabricated reinforced floor plate {{and an additional}} layer of concrete cast in-situ. The interaction of the two layers {{is based on the}} transmission of shear stresses in the <b>joint</b> <b>surface.</b> Transmission is possible through the appropriate shaping of the <b>joint</b> <b>surface</b> and the use of vertical reinforcement in the form of truss. The results of tests for different composite concrete slabs presented here suggest that the interaction of the two concrete layers may depend on the suitable anchoring of the bottom reinforcement in a ring beam. The full anchoring of bottom reinforcement allowed to obtain the full load bearing capacity of the composite slab with no possibility of bond stress transmission in the <b>joint</b> <b>surface.</b> The distribution of forces between the <b>joint</b> <b>surface</b> and the bottom reinforcement anchored in the ring beam depends on the shape of the <b>joint</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{experimentally}} correlate the compressive strength (f′c) of concrete to the splitting tensile strength (T) for plain concrete in the existence of a <b>construction</b> <b>joint,</b> and formulate an empirical equation relating T to f′c. Both the American Concrete Institute code (ACI 318 - 08 (ACI Committee 318, 2008)) and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM (ASTM Standard C 496, 2002; ASTM Standard C 192 /C 192 M, 2002; ASTM Standard C 39 /C 39 M, 2005; ASTM Standard C 617, 2002)) provide the testing methods and standards, as well as the applicable theoretical and experimental formulas for the correlation between T to f′c for concrete specimens, which are monolithic, indicating that the specimens lack any <b>construction</b> <b>joints.</b> Providing a useful reduction factor in the splitting tensile strength of concrete due the existence of a <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> is essential. It is a well known fact that <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> are used in every concrete structure, which indicates that engineers would definitely benefit from an equation that could relate the splitting tensile strength of concrete in function of its compressive strength. The results suggest that the reduction in the splitting tensile strength in the presence of a <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> is not as much as most engineers tend to believe. Due to that belief, most engineers tend to overdesign for steel reinforcement at those joints to compensate for this reduction. The objective of the study is to better the understanding of the effects of a <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> on the splitting tensile strength. Thus provide an empirical equation to assist engineers in their design calculations, therefore reducing the amount of steel reinforcement at the <b>construction</b> <b>joints.</b> Thus also leading to cost saving on projects...|$|R

Actual contacting area influences the location of the turning point of the Cn*-μ (critical friction coefficient), and the critical friction coefficient increases with the increase of actual contacting area.
