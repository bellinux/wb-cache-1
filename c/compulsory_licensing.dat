25|$|The 2002 Doha Declaration {{affirmed that}} the TRIPS {{agreement}} should not prevent members from taking measures {{necessary to protect}} public health. Despite this recognition, less-developed countries have argued that TRIPS's flexible provisions, such as <b>compulsory</b> <b>licensing,</b> are near-on impossible to exercise. In particular, less developed countries have cited their infant domestic manufacturing and technology industries {{as evidence of the}} policy's bluntness.|$|E

25|$|Patents {{have been}} criticized in the {{developing}} world, as they are thought to reduce access to existing medicines. Reconciling patents and universal access to medicine would require an efficient international policy of price discrimination. Moreover, under the TRIPS agreement of the World Trade Organization, countries must allow pharmaceutical products to be patented. In 2001, the WTO adopted the Doha Declaration, which indicates that the TRIPS agreement should be read {{with the goals of}} public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies: via <b>compulsory</b> <b>licensing</b> or parallel imports, even before patent expiration.|$|E
2500|$|This has not {{happened}} in most cases. [...] A 2005 report by the WHO found that many developing countries have not incorporated TRIPS flexibilities (<b>compulsory</b> <b>licensing,</b> parallel importation, limits on data protection, use of broad research and other exceptions to patentability, etc.) into their legislation to the extent authorized under Doha.|$|E

5000|$|The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) also {{sets out}} {{specific}} provisions that shall be followed if a <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> is issued, and {{the requirements of}} such licenses. All significant patent systems {{comply with the requirements}} of TRIPs. The principal requirement for the issue of a <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> is that attempts to obtain a license under reasonable commercial terms must have failed over a reasonable period of time. Specific situations in which <b>compulsory</b> <b>licenses</b> may be issued are set out in the legislation of each patent system and vary between systems. Some examples of situations in which a <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> may be granted include lack of working over an extended period in the territory of the patent, inventions funded by the government, failure or inability of a patentee to meet a demand for a patented product and where the refusal to grant a license leads to the inability to exploit an important technological advance, or to exploit a further patent. TRIPs also provides that the requirements for a <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> may be waived in certain situations, in particular cases of national emergency or extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use. Article 31.f of TRIPS requires that <b>compulsory</b> <b>licenses</b> be used [...] "predominantly" [...] for local markets, a requirement that complicates the ability of countries to import drugs manufactured overseas.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author gives an {{overview}} of the regulation of compulsory licence in international and Serbian sources of patent law. From international sources the subjects of analysis are the Paris Convention, TRIPS Agreement and the Community Patent Convention, whereby the last one has not come into force yet, but also contains rules on <b>compulsory</b> <b>license.</b> As far as Serbian law is concerned, all patent laws are analyzed, from the first one adopted as early as 1922 in the first Yugoslavia, until the effective Patent Law from 2011. The evolution of <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> is traditionally paralleled to the institution of forfeiture of patent. As the forfeiture of patent, as a sanction against the patent owner who does not intend to exploit the invention, was gradually losing its significance, so were the rules on <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> becoming more detailed and nuanced. Nevertheless, at present <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> is an instrument rarely applied in practice. This is primarily true of cases of <b>compulsory</b> <b>licenses</b> that are usually referred to as classical, such as the one issued when the patent holder does not exploit the invention or exploits it insufficiently and the one issued for the purpose of exploitation of a dependent patent, on the one hand, and the <b>compulsory</b> <b>license</b> issued in public interest in narrower sense, on the other. It is to be expected, however, that two latest subcategories of <b>compulsory</b> <b>license,</b> the one issued as a remedy for the infringement of the rules of competition and the one issued for the production of medicines for the purpose of export into countries with problems relating to public health, will be applied more frequently in practice...|$|R
40|$|Governments of {{developing}} countries can be in a vulnerable position with respect to patent protected drugs supplied by foreign firms, if the technology cannot be licensed or independently developed by local firms. In such instances, one possible solution is to negotiate for a price-drop with the patent holder in lieu of issuing a <b>compulsory</b> <b>license.</b> The present paper develops a game theoretic model of such bargaining and shows that while <b>compulsory</b> <b>licenses</b> do not occur under complete information, they can be issued under incomplete information. The model is tested against real episodes of <b>compulsory</b> <b>licenses</b> to derive policy insight...|$|R
