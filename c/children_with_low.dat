40|$|BACKGROUND There {{has been}} much concern about adverse {{individual}} and societal consequences of high fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. One concern is that children of high birth orders may have low birth weight. However, the evidence for such an effect is not strong. OBJECTIVE Our objective is to investigate whether a woman's high parity status might increase her risks of having a baby <b>with</b> <b>low</b> birth weight. METHODS Pooling 60 Demographic and Health Surveys data-sets from 32 sub-Saharan countries, we selected children of mothers who had at least two births of order two or higher within the five years preceding the surveys. We modeled the probability of having a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> birth weight and controlled for all mother-specific, household, or community characteristics that are constant over the period of analysis, by including fixed-effects for the mother. We also controlled for salient factors including sex, maternal age, preceding birth interval, and whether prenatal care was received. RESULTS We found no adverse effect of increasing parity on the odds of having a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> birth weight at normative ranges; such effects only manifest at extremely high parities - nine or more children. At moderately high parities, the chance of low birth weight is actually lower than at very low parities. CONCLUSIONS While high fertility may lead to various adverse outcomes for African families, low birth weight appears not to be among these outcomes. Other factors, such as adolescent childbearing, poverty, and inadequate prenatal care {{may be more important}} determinants of low birth weight in Africa...|$|R

However, related empirical evidence from low-income countries is lacking. Non-oedematous children (n = 661) aged 6 – 59 months admitted to a community-based outpatient therapeutic program for SAM in rural southern Ethiopia were studied. The response to treatment in children admitted to the program based on the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measurement was defined by calculating the gains in average MUAC and weight during the first four weeks of treatment. The children showed significant anthropometric changes only when assessed with the same anthropometric indicator used to define SAM at admission. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> the <b>lowest</b> MUAC at admission showed a significant gain in MUAC but not weight, and <b>children</b> <b>with</b> the <b>lowest</b> weight-for-height/length (WHZ) showed a significant gain in weight but not MUAC.

The subjects were a population sample of 424 children (211 girls, 213 boys) 6 - 8 years of age. Nutrient intake and meal pattern were measured by food records, and food intake and socioeconomic characteristics were assessed by questionnaires. RESULTS. Intakes of saturated fat, sucrose and salt were higher and intakes of vitamin D, iron and fibre and unsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio lower than recommended. Less than 5 % of children consumed vegetables, fruit and berries as recommended. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> highest parental education more likely ate fish (OR 2. 20, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 4. 54), fibre-rich bread (OR 5. 06, 95 % CI 1. 80 - 14. 29) and main meals (OR 2. 54, 95 % CI 1. 34 - 4. 83) but less likely used soft margarine (OR 0. 43, 95 % CI 0. 20 - 0. 94) as recommended than <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>lowest</b> parental education. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> highest household income more likely consumed skimmed milk (OR 2. 43, 95 % CI 1. 21 - 4. 88) and fish (OR 2. 21, 95 % CI 1. 12 - 4. 36) as recommended than <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>lowest</b> household income.

5000|$|<b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> vision {{sometimes}} have reading delays, but do benefit from phonics-based beginning reading instruction methods. Engaging phonics instruction is multisensory, highly motivating, and hands-on. Typically students are first taught {{the most frequent}} sounds of the alphabet letters, especially the so-called short vowel sounds, then taught to blend sounds together with three-letter consonant-vowel-consonant words such as cat, red, sit, hot, sun. Hands-on (or kinesthetically appealing) VERY enlarged print materials such as those found in [...] "The Big Collection of Phonics Flipbooks" [...] by Lynn Gordon (Scholastic, 2010) are helpful for teaching word families and blending skills to beginning readers with low vision. Beginning reading instructional materials should focus primarily on the lower-case letters, not the capital letters (even though they are larger) because reading text requires familiarity (mostly) with lower-case letters. Phonics-based beginning reading should also be supplemented with phonemic awareness lessons, writing opportunities, and lots of read-alouds (literature read to children daily) to stimulate motivation, vocabulary development, concept development, and comprehension skill development. Many <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> vision can be successfully included in regular education environments.

By taking {{a closer look at the}} nine traits that Thomas and Chess revealed from their study, parents can gain a better understanding of their child’s temperament and their own. Parents may also notice that situational factors cause a child's temperament to seem problematic; for example, a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> rhythmicity can cause difficulties for a family with a highly scheduled life, and a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> a high activity level may be difficult to cope with if the family lives in a crowded apartment upstairs from sensitive neighbors.|$|R
