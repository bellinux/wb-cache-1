40|$|Membrane {{chemical}} strippers {{for removal}} of lead based paint were researched. The technology {{demonstration of the}} membrane chemical stripper for removal of lead based paint on plaster and assessment was conducted at an abandoned house that is now classified as a historic building at Fort Riley, Kansas in Octo-ber 2002. Membrane <b>chemical</b> <b>stripping</b> {{was found to be}} generally effective at removing paint and reducing or eliminating the lead hazard. However, for plaster surfaces removal of residual paint and lead contamination must be accomplished by addi-tional stripper applications or by HEPA sanding. Compared to other suitable methods of onsite paint removal such as low temperature heat gun paint re-moval, the membrane <b>chemical</b> <b>stripping</b> is relatively inexpensive. When com-pared with other lead paint management approaches such as enclosure, the method is expensive.

The {{potential}} {{of using the}} laser ablation process to perform controlled stripping of titanium aluminium nitrite (TiAlN) coating from tungsten carbide (WC) substrate is explored in this paper.

A total of 973 specimens were tested. Unlike previously described bioluminescence methods, this test measures total ATP in urine without pretreatment of samples to remove somatic ATP. The result was compared with an ATP standard (20 ng/ml). A low result (less than 3 % of standard) was interpreted as negative and a high result (greater than 10 % of standard) as positive. Samples with intermediate results (38 % of total) were incubated at 35 degrees C in thioglycolate broth (1 : 10). A 2 % increase in ATP concentration was interpreted as positive.

40|$|Paint removal is {{a common}} {{maintenance}} requirement for aircraft as well as naval and land vehicles, since external paint gets damaged and loses much of its corrosion protection effectiveness with time. Paint removal is also conducted when metallic aircraft structures are inspected periodically for fatigue cracks and corrosion.

Each urine sample was evaluated after 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours of storage in BD Vacutainer® Plus Urinalysis Preservative (BD UAP) tubes and compared with refrigeration at 4 °C. All analyses were peformed on H- 800 and FUS- 200 automatic modular urine analyzers (Dirui Industry, Changchun, China). The kappa coefficients (?), false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates were evaluated. ? > 0. 8 was accepted as good agreement. Results: Haemoglobin (Hb), leucocyte esterase (LE), and protein (Pro) analyses should be performed within 4 hours, whereas glucose (Glc) was stable until the end of 48 hours in both storage conditions. Nitrite (Nit) was well preserved in BD UAP tubes for 24 hours but was stable only up to 8 hours at 4 °C. Bilirubin (Bil) had very high FN rates even at 4 hours in both conditions.
