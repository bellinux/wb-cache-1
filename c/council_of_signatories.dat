50|$|France is {{a member}} <b>of</b> the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Europe which has many legal {{frameworks}} against corruption in place including GRECO (Group of States Against Corruption) which applies for all <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Europe <b>signatories.</b> GRECO works by equally monitoring rights and obligations <b>of</b> the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Europe’s Member States. Police are bound by the Recommendations on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials and Criminal Law Convention on Corruption. In addition, France has its own Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen approved in August 1789 which outlines the rights of civilians inclusive of conduct applicable to public officials for fair treatment. In 1993 The Central Service for the Prevention of Corruption was also established in France to prevent corruption and transparency of economical life and public procedures. There {{are a number of}} bodies that monitor and investigate police corruption in France. The Inspection Générale de la Gendarmerie Nationale enables consistency, independency and impartiality of inspections carried out by the Gendarmerie Nationale, Inspection Générale de la Police monitors and regulates police behaviour and the Commission Nationale de Deontologie de la Securite (CNDS) monitors ethical and moral codes required to be upheld by security forces in France. Other strategies such as disabling officers to be on duty in their originating neighborhood and prohibiting officers from working in private investigation for three years after leaving the police force are enforced to ensure impartiality.|$|R

40|$|The European Committee of Social Rights has {{frequently}} encountered {{a situation in}} which it had to formulate an opinion on the legal order created by the European Union. What must be noted is that all EU Member States have earlier been members <b>of</b> the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Europe, <b>signatories</b> <b>of</b> the European Convention of Human Rights, or, although in varying degrees, committed under the European Social Charter. Consequently these states as well as the Communities they created, are obliged to respect and observe the rights protected under the European Conven tion of Human Rights ECHR) and the European Social Charter (ESC) and almost all collective complaints before the European Committee of Social Rights concern EU Member States. The Committee consistently held that restricting the exercise of the rights provided for in the ESC to EU citizens only is inconsistent with the scope of the undertakings covered by the Charter and constitutes its infringement. It also stressed that both, during the making the law phase as well in the law implementation phase, all obligations arising from the Charter must be satisﬁed. Contrary to the viewpoint of the European Court of Justice which adopted an approach of implied compliance of the EU’s legal order with the ECHR’s system, the Commission did ﬁnd any grounds for adopting a similar approach in the ESC’s context, which should be considered a shame. Despite its positive opinion of the legal order created by the EU, the Committee nevertheless emphasises the distinctness of its system and points to the inefficiencies of the law and its practical implementation by Member States which do not always observe the accepted standards of the Social Charter. 41211291 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|R
