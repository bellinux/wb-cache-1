40|$|International audienceIn {{therapeutic}} {{applications such}} as sonoporation, inertial cavitation is commonly considered as the main candidate inducing membrane poration. Thus, characterizing inertial cavitation, as related to bubble size distribution and medium history, is of great importance. When applying successive ultrasonic shots for increasing acoustic intensities, the inertial cavitation level sharply increases around the inertial cavitation threshold. The curve of the inertial cavitation level versus acoustic intensity is different when decreasing the acoustic intensity: the threshold obtained is lower. This effect, characterized by {{the area of the}} hysteresis loop, and attributed to the change in bubble size distribution, is studied experimentally and numerically. In our experiments, when increasing the time off between two shots, the inertial <b>cavitation</b> <b>curve</b> for decreasing intensity tends towards the curve for increasing intensity. Numerically, the main mechanisms responsible for this hysteresis were identified as rectified diffusion and fragmentation during acoustic excitation, and dissolution and rising bubbles when acoustic excitation is off. Starting from a given bubble size distribution, the change in bubble size distribution is obtained for increasing and decreasing acoustic intensity. The hysteresis of inertial cavitation(quantified by bubbles collapse energy) and its dependence on time off show qualitative agreement with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Cavitation erosion is {{a surface}} {{degradation}} mechanism which occurs most frequently in fluid-flowmachines operating in cavitation conditions. To find way to prediction the cavitation erosion progress, simplemathematical model was proposed. Design/methodology/approach: The model assumes that curve of cumulative volume loss {{as a function}} of timeapproaches initial volume of eroded material. This principle causes dependence of <b>cavitation</b> erosion <b>curve</b> notonly from mechanical properties of eroded material and cavitation loading but also from dimensions of initialvolume i. e. eroded area of material and even height of cross-section of eroded initial volume of material. Findings: Assessment of cavitation erosion resistant of material upon the base of <b>cavitation</b> erosion <b>curve</b> hasto take into account this influence. In the paper the influence of these parameters on the cavitation erosioncurve was discussed.

40|$|Research {{has been}} {{conducted}} to evaluate a technique for measuring the cavitation strength of water. The technique is based on counting cavitation events {{as a function of}} cavitation number on a standard body, thereby producing <b>cavitation</b> characteristic <b>curves.</b> It is assumed that water cavitates because of nuclei carried in the water and that the measured characteristic curves must therefore be related to the nuclei which are present. In this research it was hypothesized that the nuclei, whatever their real nature, could be represented by a distribution of equivalent gas bubbles of neutral density. The standard bodies were designed according to potential flow theory so that the bubble trajectories, along with their cavitation rates, could be calculated. By calculating <b>cavitation</b> characteristic <b>curves</b> for various bubble numbers and size distributions and comparing the calculated curves with measured curves for the same body, it was possible to infer the specifications for the equivalent bubble nuclei that were present in any test. The equivalent nuclei can be described using N, the number of cavitatable bubbles per unit volume of water (a number far smaller than the total number of nuclei per unit volume); rmax, the likeiy radius of the largest bubbles in the distribution; and a, a parameter of the exponential size distribution assumed for the bubbles. As a consequenoe, given (N,rmax,a) and an experimental realization whose flow field can be calculated by potential flow theory, {{it should be possible to}} predict incipient cavitation. The experiment devised for verifying this statement proved to be faulty, and experimental verification has not yet been accomplished. An alternative for future study has been proposed which calls for abandoning the hypothesis of equivalent bubble nuclei and determining the relative cavitation strength of water by direct comparison of a measured <b>cavitation</b> characteristic <b>curve</b> obtained on a standard body in a specific test configuration with a catalogue of such curves kept on file for a family of standard bodies.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} dynamics of embolism formation within a Douglas-fir tree-ring. Four resistant and four vulnerable 10 -year-old trees were selected among 50 trees, based on their P 50. Stem samples, taken next to those used to obtain the vulnerability to <b>cavitation</b> <b>curves,</b> were collected and submitted to increasing positive pressures, in order to simulate increasing tension caused by water stress in the xylem. Then the conductive surface of the samples was stained and scanned and the images were analyzed. X-ray microdensity profiles were obtained on the same samples. The microdensity profiles of the 2011 ring were analyzed in three parts, earlywood, transition-wood and latewood. The dynamics of embolism propagation was observed separately in these three parts. Our results showed that the initiation and the propagation of the cavitation follow a discrete trend, with at least two successive initiation events: first cavitation initiates and propagates rapidly in the latewood. Then, a second cavitation event begins and spreads in the earlywood and eventually propagates to the transition-wood, which remains the last conductive part in the ring before full embolism. We observed that resistant to cavitation trees showed lower transition-wood density than vulnerable to cavitation trees...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims Several {{studies show}} {{apparently}} contradictory findings about the functional convergence within the Mediterranean woody flora. In this context, this study evaluates {{the variability of}} functional traits within holm oak (Quercus ilex) to elucidate whether provenances corresponding to different morphotypes represent different ecotypes locally adapted to the prevaling stress levels. Methods Several morphological and physiological traits were measured at leaf and shoot levels in 9 -year-old seedlings of seven Q. ilex provenances including all recognized morphotypes. Plants were grown in a common garden for 9 years under the same environmental conditions to avoid possible biases due to site-specific characteristics. Key Results Leaf morphometry clearly separates holm oak provenances into 'ilex' (more elongated leaves with low vein density) and 'rotundifolia' (short and rounded leaves with high vein density) morphotypes. Moreover, these morphotypes represent two consistent and very contrasting functional types in response to dry climates, mainly in terms of leaf area, major vein density, leaf specific conductivity, resistance to drought-induced cavitation and turgor loss point. Conclusions The 'ilex' and 'rotundifolia' morphotypes correspond to different ecotypes as inferred from their contrasting functional traits. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the combined use of morphological and physiological traits has provided support for the concept of these two holm oak morphotypes being regarded as two different species. © 2014 The Author 2014.

40|$|Bounds of {{cavitation}} inception are experimentally {{determined in}} a creeping flow between eccentric cylinders, the inner one being static {{and the outer}} rotating at a constant angular velocity, Ω. The geometric configuration is additionally specified by a small minimum gap between cylinders, H, {{as compared with the}} radii of the inner and outer cylinders.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of drought on the water relations, osmotic adjustment and xylem vulnerability to embolism of olive (Olea europaea L.) varieties, 'Meski' and 'Chemlali'. Two-year-old self-rooted cuttings growing in sand-filled pots in a greenhouse were subjected to water stress by withholding water for 60 days. Water relations and gas exchange measurements showed that 'Chemlali' was more drought resistant than 'Meski' and had a greater capacity for osmotic adjustment through solute accumulation. However, when water stress was acute, the effect of osmoregulation on leaf cell turgor was largely counteracted by xylem <b>cavitation.</b> <b>Cavitation</b> vulnerability <b>curves</b> showed that both varieties were highly resistant to embolism formation. The xylem water potential inducing 50 % loss of stem conductivity approached - 7 MPa in 'Meski' and only slightly less in 'Chemlali'.

40|$|The setting {{level of}} an {{hydraulic}} machine, specially for low head machines, is decided {{with respect to}} the possible alteration of the efficiency due to the cavity development. This alteration can easily be noticed by plotting the evolution of the efficiency η {{as a function of the}} Thoma number σ leading to the so-called η – σ <b>cavitation</b> <b>curves.</b> Observation of the cavity extent in the flow passage of the runner allows to associate the drop of efficiency with a particular type of cavity development. However, depending on the type of cavities this drop cannot be very easily explained. Obviously, for a leading edge attached cavity corresponding to high head operating points, the presence of the vapour phase on the blade suction side limits the pressure at the vapour pressure value which causes the flow alteration. In the case of travelling bubble cavitation, corresponding to the outlet cavitation at the nominal head, this limitation of the pressure field due to the presence of the vapour was never characterized. In order to protect the efficiency at the best operating point against the travelling bubbles effects, the IEC norms suggests some measures relating to turbines standards cavitation tests. These measures are based on the systematic control of the test water quality in term of nucleation, which is the main factor of the inception of this type of cavitation. A prediction method of the efficiency drop due to the outlet travelling bubble cavitation is then a necessity from the point of view of the possibility to modify the runner geometry in the first state of the project. The main object of this work is then the understanding of the physical phenomenon acting on the Francis turbine efficiency alteration with a development of travelling bubble cavitation in order to elaborate a prediction method. The first aspect of this thesis work is the characterisation of the bubbles influence with some experiments carried out in the hydraulic machines tests rigs and the high-speed cavitation tunnel. The second part consists in the development of a cavitating pressure field prediction method. The main work is finally intented to analyse the actual standards cavitation tests methods...|$|R
40|$|Cavitation is a {{negative}} factor of hydraulic machinery because of its undesirable effects on the operation stability and safety. For reversible pump-turbines, the improvement of cavitation inception performance in pump mode is very important due to the strict requirements. The geometry of blade leading edge is crucial for the local flow separation which affects the scale and position of pressure drop. Hence, the optimization of leading edge shape is helpful {{for the improvement of}} cavitation inception performance. Based on the genetic algorithm, optimization under multiple flow rate conditions was conducted by modifying the leading edge ellipse ratio and blade thickness on the front 20 % meanline. By using CFD simulation, optimization was completed with obvious improvements on the cavitation inception performance. CFD results show that the pressure drop location had moved downstream with the increasement of the minimum pressure coefficient. Experimental verifications also got an obvious enhancement of cavitation inception performance.

40|$|Current {{understanding}} of physiological mechanisms governing stomatal behavior under water stress conditions is still incomplete and controversial. It {{has been proposed}} that coordination of stomatal kinetics with xylem vulnerability to <b>cavitation</b> [vulnerability <b>curve</b> (VC) ] leads to different levels of isohydry/anisohydry in different plant species/cultivars. In this study, this hypothesis is tested in Vitis vinifera cultivars displaying contrasting stomatal behavior under drought stress. The cv Montepulciano (MP, near-isohydric) and Sangiovese (SG, anisohydric) were compared in terms of stomatal response to leaf and stem water potential, as possibly correlated to different petiole hydraulic conductivity (k(petiole)) and VC, {{as well as to}} leaf water relations parameters. MP leaves showed almost complete stomatal closure at higher leaf and stem water potentials than SG leaves. Moreover, MP petioles had higher maximum k(petiole) and were more vulnerable to cavitation than SG. Water potential at the turgor loss point was higher in MP than in SG. In SG, the percentage reduction of stomatal conductance (PLg(s)) under water stress was almost linearly correlated with corresponding percentage loss of k(petiole) (PLC), while in MP PLg(s) was less influenced by PLC. Our results suggest that V. vinifera near-isohydric and anisohydric genotypes differ in terms of xylem vulnerability to cavitation as well as in terms of k(petiole) and that the coordination of these traits leads to their different stomatal responses under water stress conditions...|$|R

A very good agreement was found for coniferous and diffuse-porous species. However, the technique was not appropriate for ring-porous species, probably because many vessels were cut open in the cen-trifuged xylem segments.
