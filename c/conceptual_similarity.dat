50|$|It is the Court's duty {{to decide}} {{similarity}} or {{identity of the}} marks, goods or services. The criteria are often: aural, visual and <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> (often applied in trademark infringement cases).|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> between VMX and the SPU architecture is supporting the same vectorization model. For this reason, most algorithms adapted to Altivec will usually adapt successfully to the SPU architecture as well.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic {{clustering}} {{based on}} the conceptual content of documents can also be accomplished using LSI. Clustering {{is a way to}} group documents {{based on the}}ir <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> to each other without using example documents to establish the conceptual basis for each cluster. This is very useful when dealing with an unknown collection of unstructured text.|$|E
50|$|The play bears many <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> to Tom Stoppard's Hapgood, a {{play about}} spies and secret agents that takes place {{primarily}} in the men's changingroom of a municipal swimming baths.|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of a material substratum was posited by John Locke, with <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> to Baruch Spinoza's substance and Immanuel Kant's concept of the noumenon (in The Critique of Pure Reason).|$|R
5000|$|A multi-dimensional {{control table}} has some <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> to {{bytecode}} {{operating on a}} virtual machine, in that a platform dependent [...] "interpreter" [...] program is usually required to perform the actual execution (that is largely conditionally determined by the tables content). There are also some <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> to the recent Common Intermediate Language (CIL) in the aim of creating a common intermediate 'instruction set' that is independent of platform (but unlike CIL, no pretentions {{to be used as}} a common resource for other languages). P-code can also be considered a similar but earlier implementation with origins as far back as 1966.|$|R
50|$|Laozi {{taught that}} the Tao {{was not only}} the {{ultimate}} reality but the ideal of human life. Another <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> between various conceptions is that the ultimate reality also somehow reveals to humans the way to live. For example, Plato taught that the Good was both the source of reality, the highest object of knowledge, and the ultimate end of desire.|$|E
50|$|The Remington Lady Remington Smooth and Silky was {{designed}} to operate {{in a similar way}} to the spring type Epilady, except that a series of metal discs were used instead of a spring. It was the subject of extensive patent litigation in Europe due to a <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> to the spring type epilator. The UK patent infringement case is known as Improver Corporation v Remington Consumer Product Limited 1990 F.S.R. 181.|$|E
50|$|A {{conceptual}} {{space is}} a geometric structure {{that represents a}} number of quality dimensions, which denote basic features by which concepts and objects can be compared, as such as weight, color, taste, temperature, pitch, and the three ordinary spatial dimensions. In a conceptual space, points denote objects, and regions denote concepts. The theory of conceptual spaces is a theory about concept learning first proposed by Peter Gärdenfors. It is motivated by notions such as <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> and prototype theory.|$|E
50|$|Most reviews {{were just}} favorable, rating 3.7/5 in Goodreads, 1/5 in Cuddlebuggery and 8.1/10 in Fantasy Book Review. Critics commented on how Kate's novel has <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight, {{replacing}} the mythical characters as fallen angels instead of vampires.|$|R
50|$|The attentional blink can be {{moderated by}} changes in visual {{similarity}} between targets and distractor stimuli, {{but it can also}} be affected by <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities,</b> suggesting that stimuli are processed to quite a deep level preconsciously, with much of the resulting information discarded before it reaches consciousness.|$|R
50|$|Sweet F.A. has {{encountered}} some controversy {{because of its}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> to Channel Ten's Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation3. While both programs share the same format, Sweet F.A. has combined use of celebrity and regular guests, which gives the general public a chance to represent their own generation.|$|R
5000|$|The theory {{also puts}} forward {{the notion that}} natural {{categories}} are convex regions in conceptual spaces. In that if [...] and [...] are elements of a category, and if [...] is between [...] and , then [...] {{is also likely to}} belong to the category. The notion of concept convexity allow the interpretation of the focal points of regions as category prototypes. In the more general formulations of the theory, concepts are defined in terms <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> to their prototypes.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} for interactions to occur outside an organism before administration of the drugs has taken place. This can occur when two drugs are mixed, for example, in a saline solution prior to intravenous injection. Some classic examples {{of this type of}} interaction include that thiopentone and suxamethonium should not be placed in the same syringe and same is true for benzylpenicillin and heparin. These situations will all be discussed under the same heading due to their <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} has a close <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> to Seifert’s famous Centre Point complex in London, being {{a series of}} low rise offices and retail units between two and five stories, anchored by a high rise office tower. The complex also incorporated an unused extension to the adjacent King's Theatre. These elements frame a sunken garden in the centre, providing a focus for pedestrian flows from both Bath Street and Elmbank Crescent. Two cast concrete murals by local artists Charles Anderson and Keith McCarter feature on the internal pathways of the complex.|$|E
5000|$|The Point of Departure {{review by}} Troy Collins states [...] "This date shares {{numerous}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> with Sleepthief. Both albums offer experimental narratives bolstered by considered interplay and impressively intuitive logic, with Halvorson's idiosyncratic electric guitar providing {{a far more}} assertive edge than Noble's crystalline piano." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Natural policy {{gradient}} {{methods and}} the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, two variable metric methods proposed for solving reinforcement learning tasks, are contrasted {{to point out}} their <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> and differences. Experiments on the cart pole benchmark are conducted as a first attempt to compare their performance. ...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the {{relation}} between delay discounting and future time perspective by reviewing how these concepts have been measured and quantified {{in order to assess}} their <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities.</b> The extent to which the different measures are empirically related is reviewed by describing studies that have assessed both constructs and by comparing the variables that have been associated with variations in delay discounting and in time horizon. We suggest that both steep delay discounting and a short future time perspective are associated with a range of problematic and health-damaging behaviors, such as addictive disorders, risky behavior, poor school performance, and delinquency. However, despite these shared associations, and despite the <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities,</b> the few studies that allow a direct comparison between measures of future time perspective and delay discounting do not give reason to presume a robust relation between them...|$|R
5000|$|... "The name TLS Bicycle Attack {{was chosen}} because of the <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> between how {{encryption}} hides content and gift wrapping hides physical objects. My attack relies heavily on the property of stream-based ciphers in TLS {{that the size of}} TLS application data payloads is directly known to the attacker and this inadvertently reveals information about the plaintext size; similar to how a draped or gift-wrapped bicycle is still identifiable as a bicycle, because cloaking it like that retains the underlying shape. The reason that I've named this attack at all is only to make referring to it easier for everyone." ...|$|E
5000|$|Darwin Core was {{originally}} {{created as a}} Z39.50 profile by the Z39.50 Biology Implementers Group (ZBIG), supported by funding from a USA National Science Foundation award. [...] The name [...] "Darwin Core" [...] was first coined by Allen Allison at {{the first meeting of}} the ZBIG held at the University of Kansas in 1998 while commenting on the profile's <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> with Dublin Core. The Darwin Core profile was later expressed as an XML Schema document for use by the Distributed Generic Information Retrieval (DiGIR) protocol. A TDWG task group was created to revise the Darwin Core, and a ratified metadata standard was officially released on 9 October 2009.|$|E
50|$|The first popular science-fiction {{program on}} American {{television}} was the children's adventure serial Captain Video and His Video Rangers, which ran from June 1949 to April 1955. Within {{eight months of}} Captain Video's debut, two other landmark series were launched - Tom Corbett, Space Cadet (8/50 - 6/55) and Space Patrol (3/50 - 2/55). ABC attempted {{to cash in on}} the burgeoning television science fiction market with a small screen version of Buck Rogers in 1950, but failed within months. Another series of the fiftes, Rod Brown of the Rocket Rangers broadcast live Saturdays from April 18, 1953, to May 29, 1954. The show was eventually cancelled due to a copyright infringement lawsuit based on the shows <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> to Tom Corbett.|$|E
5000|$|The Restful Objects {{specification}} {{states that}} it operates at a higher-level of abstraction than other restful standards such as the JAX-RS specifications for Java platform, or the WCF specification on [...]NET. There are some <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> to Odata - though Restful Objects places much more emphasis on exposing the behaviour of domain objects, not just their data.|$|R
5000|$|This new Russian [...] ".50-caliber" [...] {{cartridge}} bears certain <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> to {{a family}} of big-bore cartridges developed in the US for the AR-15 platform, such as [...]499 LWR or [...]50 Beowulf, although the Russian cartridge uses a longer case and generally a heavier bullet load - its US counterparts are usually loaded with bullets weighing 19 grams/300 grs and up.|$|R
50|$|Also, the {{character}} of Freefall had her direct parallel in {{the character}} of Jubilee, both of whom had similar attitudes and physical attributes, including being the youngest in their respective teams. Freefall also had an unearthly pet, Qeelocke, which parallels the baby dragon Lockheed belonging to Kitty Pryde of the X-Men. <b>Conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> among the pyrokinetic Burnout and the Fantastic Four's Human Torch are also quite evident.|$|R
5000|$|The James project {{manages the}} Apache Mailet API which defines [...] "matchers" [...] and [...] "mailets". These allow users {{to write their}} own mail-handling code, such as to update a database, build a message archive, or filter spam. A matcher is used to {{classify}} messages based on some criteria, and then determines whether the message should be passed to an appropriate mailet for processing. Mailets are so-called due to their <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> to a servlet, and arose because Sun Microsystems declined a proposal to include mail-handling in the servlet implementation. James ships {{with a variety of}} pre-written matchers and mailets to serve common tasks. Many sets of mailets and matchers can be combined to produce sophisticated and complex functional behaviour.|$|E
5000|$|The terms scare-line and scare-head {{derive from}} scare + {{headline}}; the longer name scare headline {{has sometimes been}} used. [...] The Oxford English Dictionary notes {{the use of the}} shorter expressions scare-line and scare-head, the latter as early as 1888. The use of scare quote in the same sense dates back to at least 1946. The term scare line also refers to [...] "a means of directing fish towards the main, holding part of a net by frightening the fish into movement", but the term is not well known outside of commercial fishing (and bird hunting, where a similar technique is used to flush birds into flight), so an influence on the journalism term is dubious despite a <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> in a hierarchical structure {{has been proposed}} by studies such as Wu and Palmer (1994) which have been summarized and evaluated in Budanisky and Hirst (2006). The present study applies the {{measurement of}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> to conceptual metaphor research by comparing concreteness of ontological resource nodes to several prototypical concrete nodes selected by human subjects. Here, the purpose of comparing <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> between nodes is to select a concrete sense for a word which is used metaphorically. Through using WordNet-SUMO interface such as SinicaBow (Huang, Chang and Lee, 2004), concrete senses of a lexicon will be selected once its SUMO nodes have been compared in terms of <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> with the prototypical concrete nodes. This study has strong implications for the interaction of psycholinguistic and computational linguistic fields in conceptual metaphor research...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Metaphors {{based on}} perceptual {{similarity}} {{are considered to}} be one of the hallmarks of creativity. We propose here an image-based retrieval system for generating pairs of perceptually similar images. A number of examples of images paired by the system are presented and discussed. Often, these images are conceptually very different, and hence can serve as anchors for perceptual metaphors that create new <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} conceptual descriptions based on description logics for contentbased information retrieval and present several innovative contributions. We provide a query-byexamples retrieval framework which avoids the drawback of a sophisticated query language. We extend an existing DL to deal with spatial concepts. We provide a content-based similarity measure based on the least common subsumer which extracts <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> of examples. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Trey Fanjoy and premiered on February 9, 2017. In it, Lambert is shown in a beauty salon getting a makeover and interacting with other patrons (which include songwriters Natalie Hemby and Waylon Payne) who are getting their hair curled with beer cans and gossiping. The video was filmed in Watertown, Tennessee and draws <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities</b> to Legally Blonde.|$|R
40|$|The UMLS Semantic Network and Metathesaurus are two {{complementary}} knowledge sources. While {{many studies}} compare relationships {{across the two}} structures, their alignment has never been attempted. We applied two methods based on lexical and <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> to aligning the Semantic Network with the UMLS Metathesaurus. Approximately {{two thirds of the}} semantic types could be aligned by lexical similarity. <b>Conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> suggested mappings in all but ten cases. Potential applications enabled by the alignment are discussed, namely auditing the consistency between the Semantic Network and the Metathesaurus and extending the Semantic Network downwards. The relative contribution and limitations of the two methods used for the alignment are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{registration}} {{process as a}} Community trade mark of the sign «Golden Balls», it has been {{raised the question of}} whether that sign is conceptually similar to the earlier trade mark «Ballon d’Or». The EU General Court held – in a diff erent sense from the decision of the 1 st Board of Appeal – that between that sign and the earlier mark «Ballon d’Or» there is a very slight <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity,</b> which is not suffi cient to declare the susceptibility of confusion of the average European consumer.

40|$|AbstractThe rapid {{expansion}} of e-commerce {{at the beginning of}} 21 st century has {{had a significant impact on}} intellectual property management. A particular area of concern is the misuse of trademarks and trademark protection. Trademarks are proprietary words and images with high reputational value; they are important assets, often used as a marketing tool, which require infringement protection. One of the issues considered during infringement litigation is the visual, conceptual and phonetic similarity of different trademarks. In particular, the <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> of trademarks is an area never previously studied in information retrieval. This paper focuses on this important aspect by proposing a conceptual model of the comparison process, aimed at retrieving conceptually similar trademarks. The proposed model employs natural language processing and semantic technology to compute the <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarity</b> between trademarks...|$|E
25|$|Bondage and {{discipline}} are {{two aspects of}} BDSM that {{do not seem to}} relate to each other because of the type of activities involved, but they have <b>conceptual</b> <b>similarities,</b> and that is why they appear jointly. Contrary to the other two types, B does not define the tops and bottoms itself, and is used to describe the general activities with either partner being the receiver and the giver.|$|R
