50|$|Advanced Mobile Location (or AML) is a <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> {{technique}} {{in case of}} an emergency.|$|E
50|$|As {{soon as the}} {{emergency}} service call taker answers the call any available <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> information is transferred to {{the emergency}} service, however the emergency service call taker will still question the caller to obtain correct location details in order to dispatch the correct response.|$|E
50|$|The system {{only works}} in North America if the {{emergency}} telephone number 911 is called. Calls made to other telephone numbers, {{even though they may}} be listed as an {{emergency telephone number}}, may not enable this feature. Outside Canada, Mexico, and the United States this type of facility is often called <b>caller</b> <b>location,</b> though its implementation is dependent on how the telephone network processes emergency calls.|$|E
50|$|Inbound sales {{enquiries}} can be relayed automatically to {{the regional}} sales manager appropriate for the <b>caller’s</b> <b>location.</b>|$|R
50|$|In addition, US {{toll-free}} numbers may {{be accessed}} {{free of charge}} regardless of the <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> by some IP telephone services.|$|R
5|$|The app {{displays}} {{information on}} callers, {{such as their}} latest social media posts, local weather at the <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> and {{the identity of the}} caller. It originally had the ability to display information on callers, such as their latest social media posts, local weather at the <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> and the identity of the caller. The ability for consumers to add themselves to the directory was added in the summer of 2009 and being able to edit existing entries was added that October.|$|R
50|$|AML {{is being}} {{implemented}} in the UK by {{an increasing number of}} smart-phone manufacturers and mobile network operators: BT, the mobile networks EE, O2 and Three, together with HTC, Sony, Alcatel, and Samsung handsets, have already successfully implemented AML. Apart from the UK, AML is fully deployed in Estonia, Lithuania and the state of Lower Austria. Moreover, around 10 countries around Europe are testing AML as a solution to problematic <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> in an emergency with the aim of deploying it by the end of 2017.|$|E
50|$|The National Emergency Number Association (NENA) {{long-term}} solution for emergency calling, {{referred to as}} the i3 Solution, assumes end-to-end Internet Protocol (IP) signaling from the Voice over IP (VoIP) endpoint to an IP-enabled Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), with callback and <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> information provided to the PSAP with the call. While the i3 Solution assumes end-to-end IP connectivity, and it is expected that an increasing number of PSAPs will evolve to support i3 functionality over time, legacy PSAPs must continue to be supported as originating networks and the Emergency Services infrastructure migrate toward IP.|$|E
50|$|It was {{developed}} in the United Kingdom by British Telecom, EE Limited, and HTC as a solution to problematic <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> in emergencies. When a person in distress calls the emergency services with a smart-phone where AML is enabled, the telephone automatically activates its location service to establish its position and sends this information to the emergency services via an SMS. The services uses either GNSS or WiFi depending on which one is better at the given moment. It is estimated that this technique is up to 4000 times more accurate than the previously used system.|$|E
50|$|Enhanced 9-1-1 (E-911 or E911) {{automatically}} {{gives the}} dispatcher the <b>caller's</b> <b>location,</b> if available. Enhanced 9-1-1 {{is available in}} most areas (approximately 96 percent of the U.S.).|$|R
50|$|The IP-based Intrado VIPER call {{processing}} equipment provides quadruple redundancy at VECC and Weber County, {{as well as}} a common database for call routing and mapping systems that displays the <b>caller’s</b> <b>location.</b>|$|R
50|$|In February 2014, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{supported}} {{a proposal that}} would create standards requiring wireless providers to give information about a <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> to public safety personnel. The caucus, through Co-Chair Shimkus, supported the proposal.|$|R
50|$|The first 911 {{system was}} {{installed}} in Haleyville, Alabama, in February 1968, {{as a way to}} quickly connect a subscriber to the local police station. The system was rapidly adapted and improved by other telephone companies, evolving into the E911 system, which provides both <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> and identification. A pioneering system was in place in Chicago by the mid-1970s, providing both police and fire departments access to the source location of emergency calls. Enhanced 911 is currently deployed in most metropolitan areas in the United States, Canada, and Mexico as well as all of the Cayman Islands.|$|E
5000|$|A public-safety {{answering}} point (PSAP), {{sometimes called}} [...] "public-safety access point", {{is a call}} center responsible for answering calls to an emergency telephone number for police, firefighting, and ambulance services. Trained telephone operators are also usually responsible for dispatching these emergency services. Most PSAPs are now capable of <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> for landline calls, and many can handle mobile phone locations as well (sometimes referred to as phase II location), where the mobile phone company has a handset location system. Some can also use voice broadcasting, where outgoing voice mail {{can be sent to}} many phone numbers at once, in order to alert people to a local emergency such as a chemical spill.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{the county}} {{or a large}} city usually handles this responsibility. As a {{division}} of a U.S. state, counties are generally bound to provide this and other emergency services even within the municipalities, unless the municipality chooses to opt out and have its own system, sometimes along with a neighboring jurisdiction. If a city operates its own PSAP, but not its own particular emergency service (for example, city police but county fire), {{it may be necessary}} to relay the call to the PSAP that does handle that type of call. The U.S. requires <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> capability on the part of all phone companies, including mobile ones, but there is no federal law requiring PSAPs to be able to receive such information.|$|E

50|$|In March 2005, {{commercial}} Internet telephony provider Vonage was sued by the Texas Attorney General, who {{alleged that}} their website and other sales and service documentation {{did not make}} clear enough that Vonage's provision of 9-1-1 service was not done in the traditional manner. In May 2005, the FCC issued an order requiring VoIP providers to offer 9-1-1 service to all their subscribers within 120 days of the order being published. The order set off anxiety among many VoIP providers, who felt {{it will be too}} expensive and require them to adopt solutions that won't support future VoIP products. In Canada, the federal regulators have required Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide an equivalent service to the conventional PSAPs, but even these encounter problems with <b>caller</b> <b>location,</b> since their databases rely on company billing addresses.|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand 111 service {{uses the}} Android Emergency Location Service {{to provide a}} mobile callers {{probable}} location; depending {{on a number of}} environmental conditions this could be as precise as 4 meters using the GNSS capabilities of an Android mobile phone. The location of mobile callers using Apple and other types of mobile phones uses statistical analysis to derive the callers probable location based on the cell tower connecting the emergency call (this is not triangulation as triangulation requires multiple cell towers which is not the norm for rural areas) with an accuracy of 1+ kilometer. All location data is only be held for 60 minutes and is then deleted to comply with the regulated conditions of use of emergency <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> information as set by the NZ Privacy Commissioner.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Caller</b> <b>Location</b> Information (CLI) {{provided}} {{is normally}} integrated into emergency dispatch center's computer-assisted dispatch (CAD) system. Early CAD systems provided text {{display of the}} caller's address, call history and available emergency response resources. In 1994, working {{in cooperation with the}} emergency response agencies of Covington, KY, 911 Mapping Systems, Inc. founded in 1992 by Robert Graham Thomas Jr., implemented the first real-time on-screen E911 street map display to highlight the caller's position, nearest available emergency responders and other relevant information such as fire hydrants, hazardous materials and/or other data maintained by the city. Shortly thereafter, integrated mapping became a standard and integral part of all CAD systems and continues to evolve alongside 911 response technology. For Wireline E911, the location is an address. For Wireless E911, the location is a coordinate. Not all PSAPs have the Wireless and Wireline systems integrated.|$|E
50|$|In the {{international}} telephone number notation, the leading plus (+) {{serves as an}} international prefix symbol, and is immediately followed by the country code. The user or the telephone system should replace the + symbol with international dialing prefix used in the <b>caller's</b> <b>location.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{emergency}} call {{systems in the}} United States and elsewhere are undergoing a transition from the PSTN-based legacy system to a new IP-based system. The new system {{is referred to as}} the Next Generation 9 - 1 - 1 (NG 9 - 1 - 1) or NG 112 system. We have built a prototype NG 9 - 1 - 1 system which features media convergence and data integration that are unavailable in the current {{emergency call}}ing system. The most important piece of information in the NG 9 - 1 - 1 system is the <b>caller's</b> <b>location.</b> The <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> is used for routing the call to the appropriate call center. The emergency responders use the <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> to find the caller. Therefore, it is essential to determine the <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> as precisely as possible to minimize delays in emergency response. Delays in response may result in loss of lives. When a person makes an emergency call outdoors using a mobile phone, the Global Positioning System (GPS) can provide the <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> accurately. Indoor positioning, however, presents a challenge. GPS does not generally work indoors because satellite signals do not penetrate most buildings. Moreover, there is an important difference between determining location outdoors and indoors. Unlike outdoors, vertical accuracy is very important in indoor positioning because an error of few meters will send emergency responders to a different floor in a building, which may cause a significant delay in reaching the caller. This thesis presents a way to augment our NG 9 - 1 - 1 prototype system with a new indoor positioning system. The indoor positioning system focuses on improving the accuracy of vertical location. Our goal is to provide floor-level accuracy with minimum infrastructure support. Our approach is to use a user's smartphone to trace her vertical movement inside buildings. We utilize multiple sensors available in today's smartphones to enhance positioning accuracy. This thesis makes three contributions. First, we present a hybrid architecture for floor localization with emergency calls in mind. The architecture combines beacon-based infrastructure and sensor-based dead reckoning, striking a balance between accurately determining a user's location and minimizing the required infrastructure. Second, we present the elevator module for tracking a user's movement in an elevator. The elevator module addresses three core challenges that make it difficult to accurately derive displacement from acceleration. Third, we present the stairway module which determines the number of floors a user has traveled on foot. Unlike previous systems that track users' foot steps, our stairway module uses a novel landing counting technique. Additionally, this thesis presents our work on designing and implementing an NG 9 - 1 - 1 prototype system. We first demonstrate how emergency calls from various call origination devices are identified, routed to the proper Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) based on the <b>caller's</b> <b>location,</b> and terminated by the call taker software at the PSAP. We then show how text communications such as Instant Messaging and Short Message Service can be integrated into the NG 9 - 1 - 1 architecture. We also present GeoPS-PD, a polygon simplification algorithm designed to improve the performance of location-based routing. GeoPS-PD reduces the size of a polygon, which represents the service boundary of a PSAP in the NG 9 - 1 - 1 system...|$|R
5000|$|In over 98% of {{locations}} in the United States and Canada, dialing [...] "9-1-1" [...] from any telephone will link the caller to an emergency dispatch office—called a Public-Safety Answering Point (PSAP) by the telecom industry—which can send emergency responders to the <b>caller's</b> <b>location</b> in an emergency. In approximately 96 percent of the U.S., the Enhanced 9-1-1 system automatically pairs caller numbers with a physical address.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} for the caller to be aware of their location when phoning for the emergency services; the caller's location will not be passed onto the emergency services immediately, and finding the location requires a combination of efforts from both parties. However it is possible to trace both landline and mobile telephone numbers with the BT operator; the former can be traced to an address. The latter can be immediately traced to a grid reference according to the transmitter being used, however this is only accurate to a certain wide area — for more specific traces senior authority must be acquired and an expensive operation can be conducted to trace the mobile phone to within a few metres. A number of smartphone apps can now be downloaded that assist with <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> by using the smartphone's satellite navigation features.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{initiate}} an emergency communication to summon help when needed is regarded by the European Union {{as a right}} of all citizens and when emergency assistance is needed {{it is essential that}} emergency services organisations are able to determine the location of the caller {{with a high degree of}} confidence in the shortest possible period of time. High quality accurate and reliable <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> information is vital for enabling the emergency services organisations to provide a timely response to an emergency incident. In order to achieve this objective in Europe, Article 26 (5) 1 of the Universal Service Directive requires Member States to ensure that “undertakings concerned make <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> information available free of charge to the authority handling emergency calls as soon as the call reaches that authority”. Furthermore, competent regulatory authorities at the national level are required to “lay down criteria for accuracy and reliability of the <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> information provided. ” This ECC Report provides an analysis of the <b>caller</b> <b>location</b> solutions available in order to implement the relevant legislative provisions of the Universal Service Directive by competent regulatory authorities in CEPT countries. The Report also aims to: Establish a common understanding of the terms “accuracy ” and “reliability ” in the context of calle...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Poison {{control centres}} provide {{information}} on the management of poisoning incidents. The British Columbia (BC) Drug and Poison Information Centre recently implemented an electronic database system for recording case information, {{making it easier to}} use case data as a potential source of population-based information on health services usage and health status. This descriptive analysis maps poisoning case rates in BC, highlighting differences in patient age, substance type, medical outcome, and <b>caller</b> <b>location.</b> Methods: There were 50, 621 human exposure cases recorded during 2012 and 2013. Postal code or city name was used to assign each case to a Health Service Delivery Area (HSDA). Case rates per 1, 000 person-years were calculated, including crude rates, age-standardized rates, age-specific rates, and rates by substance type, medical outcome, and <b>caller</b> <b>location.</b> Results: The lowest case rate was observed in Richmond, a city where many residents do not speak English as a first language. The highest rate was observed in the Northwest region, where the economy is driven by resource extraction. Pharmaceutical exposures were elevated in the sparsely populated northern and eastern areas.
