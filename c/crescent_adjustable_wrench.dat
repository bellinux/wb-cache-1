50|$|Drop Forged - a {{piece of}} red-hot iron or steel placed within an {{impression}} and then struck with the matching impression mounted on a heavy top hammer or ram. Typically the work piece is struck through successive impressions to squeeze the material to finished shape. <b>Adjustable</b> <b>wrenches</b> are drop forged. Nice detailing like on a cast iron piece, but not brittle. Makes a good strong tool, heavy gear, or cam shaft.|$|R
50|$|Bahco is a Swedish brand {{within the}} hand tool industry, {{which is now}} part of SNA Europe, part of Snap-on. Its roots go back to the {{industrial}} revolution in Sweden in the late eighteen hundreds, starting with innovations such as the pipe wrench and the modern <b>adjustable</b> <b>wrench.</b> Since then, the product range has expanded with a total assortment of products that today includes over 7000 hand tools.|$|R
25|$|The pipe wrench, or Stillson <b>wrench,</b> is an <b>adjustable</b> <b>wrench</b> {{used for}} turning soft iron pipes and {{fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. The pipe wrench was invented by Daniel C. Stillson in 1869.|$|R
50|$|The monkey wrench, {{known as}} gas grips in the UK, is an <b>adjustable</b> <b>wrench,</b> a later American {{development}} of eighteenth-century English coach wrenches. It was {{popular in the}} {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries but is now used only for heavier tasks, having been mostly replaced by the lighter and sleeker shifting adjustable spanner. The term monkey wrench is also used colloquially to refer to the pipe wrench, owing to their broadly similar shapes.|$|R

50|$|The Diamond Calk Horseshoe Company of Duluth, Minnesota, USA {{was founded}} in 1908 by {{blacksmith}} Otto Swanstrom. Initially manufacturing horseshoes with a special type of calk to improve the animals' foothold on slippery surfaces, the company successfully adapted {{to the development of}} motorised transport for the masses and produced a range of <b>adjustable</b> <b>wrenches</b> and pliers from the 1920s. The family-owned company was sold to the Triangle Corporation in 1981; Triangle itself was eventually sold to Cooper Tools.|$|R
5000|$|In many European {{as well as}} Middle Eastern {{countries}} (e.g. France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, etc.) the <b>adjustable</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is called}} an English key. English engineer Richard Clyburn is credited with inventing an adjustable spanner in 1842. Another English engineer, Edwin Beard Budding, is also credited with the invention. Improvements followed: on 22 September 1885 Enoch Harris received US patent 326868 for his spanner that permitted both the jaw width and {{the angle of the}} handles to be adjusted and locked. Other countries, like Denmark, Poland and Israel, refer to it as a Swedish key. Swedish company Bahco attributes an improved design, in 1891 or 1892, to Swedish inventor Johan Petter Johansson. who in 1892 received a patent Johansson's spanner was a further development of Clyburn's original [...] "screw spanner". In some countries (e.g. Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, Serbia, Iran, Slovakia, Slovenia, Poland, Croatia, Romania, and Bulgaria) it is called [...] "French key" [...] (in Poland, [...] "Swedish" [...] or [...] "French" [...] key depending on type). In Canada and the United States, the tool is known as a <b>Crescent</b> <b>wrench</b> or an <b>adjustable</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1983 Bahco {{started to}} develop and {{manufacture}} ergonomic hand tools. The first products that were developed according to ergonomic principles were the screwdrivers (1983), the <b>adjustable</b> <b>wrenches</b> (1984), wood chisels (1985) and slip-joint pliers (1986). In 1996, the Bahco ERGOTM concept was presented and scientifically approved {{as a way of}} preventing repetitive strain injuries and to increase productivity. All Bahco tools that carry the ERGOTM trade mark have undergone a scientific 11-point development program with regard to ergonomics and function.|$|R
5000|$|Analyzer {{technical}} staff {{will have the}} capability of accessing the status of all the key indicators of analytical sample system performance both locally and remotely. Predictive rather than preventive maintenance can be performed and remote diagnostics and graphical user interfaces are the norm. Analyzer rounds will be eliminated. Analyzer systems will become more reliable and trustworthy. The analyzer technician will {{have the power to}} configure a sampling/analytical system, as he/she desires using the smart applets. The <b>adjustable</b> <b>wrench</b> and screwdriver will be replaced with software.|$|R
5000|$|Gabriel [...] "Gavrush" [...] Rapoport (1924-2001) was a Palmach and IDF combat veteran, {{who helped}} create Israel's famed heavy {{equipment}} rescue unit that has saved lives around the world. Gavrush {{was one of}} the first children born on the kibbutz. According to Haaretz, Israeli poet and writer Haim Gouri, a friend of Rapoport, said: [...] "When Gavrush was born, the midwife fainted. Never before had an infant come out of the womb holding a revolver in one hand, and an <b>adjustable</b> <b>wrench</b> in the other".|$|R
50|$|Currently, it {{is unclear}} how UGGT {{recognize}} misfolded glycoprotein. It has been proposed that UGGT may bind to exposed hydrophobic stretches, a characteristic feature of misfolded proteins. UGGT crystal structures 3 suggest marked conformational mobility, which could explain the ability of the protein to recognise a wide variety of client glycoproteins of different shapes and forms. The same conformational mobility could account for the ability of the protein to re-glucosylate N-linked glycans at different distances from the misfold site. See for example the picture in which glycoproteins are symbolized by nuts and UGGT by an <b>adjustable</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Easier installation. Installing PEX is {{much less}} labor-intensive than copper pipes, {{since there is no}} need to use torches to solder pipes together, or to use glue to attach pipes to fittings. One home {{inspector}} wrote that [...] "Once you've worked with PEX, you'll never go back to that other stinky glue stuff." [...] Builders putting in radiant heating systems found that PEX pipes [...] "made installation easy and operation problem-free". PEX connections can be made by pushing together two matching parts using a compression fitting, or by using an <b>adjustable</b> <b>wrench</b> or a special crimping tool. Generally, fewer connections and fittings are needed in a PEX installation.|$|R
