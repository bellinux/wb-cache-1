40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{an alternative approach}} for poplar micropropagation, based on the restriction of gas exchange between inside and outside environments of culture vessel, {{rather than on the}} application of exogenous hormones. Apical and nodal stem segments (explants) excised from in vitro-developed shoots of hybrid white poplar (Populus alba L. × P. tremula L.) were incubated in either sealed (with Parafilm) or unsealed capped glass <b>culture</b> <b>tubes</b> (150 × 20 mm) on a hormone-free Woody Plant Medium. Shoot proliferation on apical explants was observed in sealed <b>culture</b> <b>tubes</b> but not in the unsealed ones; the difference between these two samples in respect of shoot number increased in the course of time and became threefold after three months of culture, with 3. 2 ± 0. 4 (mean ± SE) shoots per explant in the sealed tubes versus 1. 1 ± 0. 1 in the unsealed ones (for comparison, the mean shoot numbers on nodal explants were 2. 4 ± 0. 3 and 3. 4 ± 0. 4 in the unsealed and sealed <b>culture</b> <b>tubes,</b> respectively). Moreover, the shoots taken from the sealed <b>culture</b> <b>tubes</b> could be distinguished by superior shoot length, if compared to the shoots from the unsealed tubes, during the subsequent culture stage under uniform conditions...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{identified}} nonsterile blood collection tubes as the reservoir for contaminating microorganisms in outbreaks of pseudobacteremia. Microorganisms {{are thought to}} be transferred from the nonsterile tubes to the blood <b>culture</b> <b>tubes</b> when blood is drawn for cultures, but the validity of this hypothesis has not previously been tested. We recently investigated an outbreak of Ewingella americana pseudobacteremia in which an epidemiological association was found between pseudobacteremia and the practice of drawing blood for culturing {{at the same time that}} blood for coagulation studies is drawn. The nonsterile coagulation tubes, prepared in the hospital, were contaminated with E. americana. We studied three different procedures that personnel reported using to inoculate blood <b>culture</b> <b>tubes</b> after dispensing blood into the coagulation tubes.

Materials needed for the extraction include two 16 - x 100 -mm screw cap culture tubes (Kimble), one "po inty" tube (<b>culture</b> <b>tube</b> end pointed by heating and extending), and one 16 - x 100 -mm disposable <b>culture</b> <b>tube</b> (VWR), all containing sample. Deuterated morphine and deuterated codeine as internal standard (1. 0 #g/mL), and 1. 0 p. g/mL of morphine and codeine standard are used.

40|$|The {{urinary tract}} {{is a common}} site of {{infection}} in the hospitalized, institutionalized, or ambulatory patient population. Ideally, urine should be cultured immediately or refrigerated up to 24 hours for quantitative examination for microorganisms. In the evaluation of patients at their homes or in long-term care facilities, rapid plating or refrigeration may not be practical. This is also true when evaluating small children in whom external collection devices are required to obtain a specimen. Because of these limitations, we evaluated a urine preservative and transport system, the Sage Products Urine <b>Culture</b> <b>Tube,</b> {{in a study of}} 1469 clinical specimens.

40|$|In vitro rooting of {{oil palm}} shoots derived from somatic embryos was {{achieved}} through a single-phase protocol in which three shoots are cultured {{in the same}} <b>culture</b> <b>tube</b> on an alpha-naphtaleacetic acid-enriched culture medium. Rooting performance was dependent on both the genetic origin and initial size of the shoot explants. All shoots from a given tube showed a tendency to give roots of the same type, independent of the original size of the explant. Whatever the clonal line, longer-size shoots (L-type: > 9 cm) showed higher rooting rates than medium-size (M-type: 7 - 9 cm) and short-size ones (S-type: 5 - 7 cm). When groups of three shoots from the same clonal line were rooted {{together in the same}} <b>culture</b> <b>tube,</b> the combination of plant size within the group impacted overall quality of rooting. Within triplets of shoots containing more than one short individual, the probability of obtaining adequate rooting was low. Similarly, when more than one long shoot was included in the triplet rooting, quality was also poor. By avoiding such combinations, the rate of well-rooted plantlets increased by 25 %, with a maximum of 66 % when triplets of S/M/L combination were used. Smaller shoots, which usually showed poor rooting performance, were therefore found to benefit from the presence of their neighbors. This interaction between the sizes of individuals in a given tube was found to be associated with a within-tube correlation effect, a phenomenon previously described as '' event coupling,'' which was estimated using a distorted binomial-type distribution of probabilities. The resulting calculation of a coupling factor (average r= 0. 60) explains the behavior of shoots within the same <b>culture</b> <b>tube</b> and their average rooting performance. Modeling of the interactions that occurred during in vitro rooting is described here and is recommended for improvement of this critical step in micropropagation...|$|E

30|$|In {{an earlier}} study, a {{supplement}} of BA and NAA {{was reported to}} be the most effective growth regulator combination for induction of shoots in leaf explants of S. involucrata via organogenesis route (Guo et al.

In the present study, a dramatic increase in shoot proliferation in second subculture could be due to culture of shoots in the larger vessels (orchid flasks having 650  ml volume) compared to glass tubes (45  ml volume) used in the first two cultures. Also, <b>culture</b> <b>tube</b> and orchid flask had differential medium content of 10  ml and 100  ml, respectively.

[1997]; Hazra et al. [2000]). The positive influence of the larger vessel on increased shoot proliferation could be due to the availability of higher amounts of nutrients and a larger area for gaseous exchange.|$|E

Preservative-containing tubes are commercially available for urine transport. As these tube containers are not always filled to the manufacturer's specifications, we studied the effects of stabilizer formation with low urine volumes. The Sage Urine <b>Culture</b> <b>Tube</b> and the Becton-Dickinson Urine Culture Kit were evaluated by using 30 cultures diluted in urine to 10 (5) colony-forming units per ml. Both tube types were injected with 1, 2, 3, and 4 to 5 ml (tube capacity) of urine containing each culture. Specimens were held at 22 degrees C and cultured at 0, 4, and 24 h. Colony counts were corrected for the dilution due to the preservative. The Becton-Dickinson Urine Culture Kits were toxic to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in specimens containing up to 2 ml of urine, and the minimum usable amount of urine for reliable results was 3 ml.
