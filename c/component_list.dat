40|$|Background: The koji mold, Aspergillus oryzae {{is widely}} used for the {{production}} of industrial enzymes due to its particularly high protein secretion capacity and ability to perform post-translational modifications. However, systemic analysis of its secretion system is lacking, generally due to the poorly annotated proteome. Results: Here we defined a functional protein secretory <b>component</b> <b>list</b> of A. oryzae using a previously reported secretory model of S. cerevisiae as scaffold. Additional secretory components were obtained by blast search with the functional components reported in other closely related fungal species such as Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus niger. To evaluate the defined <b>component</b> <b>list,</b> we performed transcriptome analysis on three a-amylase over-producing strains with varying levels of secretion capacities. Specifically, secretory components involved in the ER-associated processes (including components involved in the regulation of transport between ER and Golgi) were significantly up-regulated, with many of them never been identified for A. oryzae before. Furthermore, we defined a complete list of the putative A. oryzae secretome and monitored how it was affected by overproducing amylase. Conclusion: In combination with the transcriptome data, the most complete secretory <b>component</b> <b>list</b> and the putative secretome, we improved the systemic understanding of the secretory machinery of A. oryzae in response to high levels of protein secretion. The roles of many newly predicted secretory components were experimentally validated and the enriched <b>component</b> <b>list</b> provides a better platform for driving more mechanistic studies of the protein secretory pathway in this industrially important fungus...|$|E

40|$|A major {{limitation}} for untargeted metabolomics {{studies is}} {{the generation of}} a library or target <b>component</b> <b>list</b> from the deconvoluted mass spectral data files. In order to achieve this, a script was written to compile a library from the results output of SpectralWorks AnalyzerPro. A set of 24 plasma samples from pigs were extracted and analysed using an Agilent 5973 GC-MS single quadrupole instrument. Generation of a library from this data set initially yielded a library with 2146 components, which reduced to 660 components after manual quality control. The same samples using an in-house target <b>component</b> <b>list</b> of 350 compounds generates an average of only 102 matches {{that can be used}} for subsequent analysis. This represents an increase of nearly 650 % using the automated library generation. The same samples were analysed by GCxGC-TOF-MS using a LECO Pegasus 4 D. Automated library generation was performed using the LECO ChromaTOF software. Generation of a library from these samples yielded a library with 3689 components, which reduced to 963 components after manual quality control. The key limitation of this technique is the requirement to manually quality control the data set. To overcome this, the process has now been integrated into AnalyzerPro. Automated library generation is a relatively simple option for strengthening metabolomics data sets and taking better advantage of the data generated by mass spectral analysi...|$|E
