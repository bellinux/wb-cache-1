Materials and Methods: CNE 2 human NPC cells were treated with various CINN concentrations. The effects of CINN on the proliferation and apoptosis of CNE 2 NPC cells were examined using the MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis. Additionally, western blotting was performed to analyze the expression of a number of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related proteins. Results: The proliferation of CNE 2 cells was significantly inhibited after treatment with different CINN concentrations for various lengths of time. The inhibitory effect of CINN was concentration-and time-dependent. Flow cytometric analysis showed that 2 mmol/L CINN displayed a significant apoptosis-inducing effect. The western blot analysis results showed that KLF 6, Fas-L, Bax, P 53 and caspase- 3 protein expression was drastically increased in the CNE 2 cells after treatment with 2 mmol/L CINN, whereas Bcl- 2 and cyclin D 1 protein expression was markedly reduced.

Utilizaram-se 1. 350 aves distribuídas em blocos casualizados, com seis repetições e cinco dietas, uma sem aditivos e outras quatro, cada uma contendo um dos aditivos: 10 ppm de avilamicina; 200 ppm de um produto contendo óleos essenciais de cravo, tomilho, canela e pimenta; 100 ppm de um produto {{comercial}} composto de óleos essenciais sintéticos de orégano e canela e óleo-resina de pimenta microencapsulados; 500 ppm de um produto comercial constituído de óleo de eucalipto, óleo essencial de canela-da-china, folhas de boldo-do-chile e sementes de feno-grego na fase inicial e 1. 200 ppm nas fases de crescimento e final. Aos 21 e 42 dias, foram avaliadas as variáveis de desempenho e aos 44 dias de idade, as características de carcaça. Dos 27 aos 30 dias de idade, foi realizado o ensaio de metabolismo pelo método de coleta total de excretas e determinadas a energia metabolizável e a digestibilidade da proteína bruta das dietas. As dietas com misturas de extratos vegetais não tiveram efeito significativo sobre o desempenho se comparadas à dieta sem aditivo e à dieta com antibiótico. A ausência de desafio na criação e a utilização de dietas com ingredientes de alta digestibilidade podem ter contribuído para que as aves expressassem todo o seu potencial, tornando indetectável a melhora ocasionada pela inclusão de qualquer dos aditivos. Dietas contendo misturas de extratos vegetais promovem desempenho semelhante ao obtido com dietas contendo antibiótico. The {{trial was}} carried out to evaluate different blends of plants extracts in broilers diets. It was used 1, 350 broilers distributed in a randomized block design with six replicates and five diets, one without additive and the four others, each containing {{one of the following}} additives: 10 ppm of avilamycin; 200 ppm of a product containing essential oils of carnation, thyme, cinnamon and microencapsulated capsicum; 100 ppm of a product containing essential oils of synthetic cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol and capsicum oleoresin microencapsulated; 500 ppm of a commercial product containing eucalypt oil, essential oil of <b>Chinese</b> <b>cinnamon,</b> leaves of Chilene boldo and seeds of fenu-Greek at the initial phase and 1200 ppm in the grower and finisher phases. Performance parameters were evaluated at 21 and 42 days of age and the carcass characteristics at 44 days of age. From 27 to 30 days of age, it {{was carried out}} the metabolism trial trough total excreta collection method and metabolizable energy and the crude protein digestibility of the diets were determined. The diets with plant extract blends had no significant effect on the performance when compared to diet without additives or diet with avilamycin. The lack of challenge in the experimental facilities and the use of diets with high digestibility ingredients might have contributed to broilers express all their potential making undetectable the improvement made by the inclusion of any of these additivies. Diets with plant extract blends promote performance similar to those obtained with diets containing avilamycin...|$|E
