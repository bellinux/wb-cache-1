40|$|Samples of 1050 {{aluminum}} {{extracted from}} cold rolled plate were annealed and then ECAPed to 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 passes via route BC. These samples were machined and further compressed under plane <b>strain</b> <b>compression</b> to two <b>strain</b> levels. The stress-strain response in plane <b>strain</b> <b>compression</b> of ECAPed material was documented and {{revealed that the}} response is composed of two stages; a short transient early hardening stage followed by an almost perfect plastic behavior. The equivalent strength values obtained here are compared with those obtained in simple compression, using the same loading direction. A strain path change (SPC) parameter was calculated for each deformation scheme to justify the higher equivalent strength values achieved in simple compression. Nevertheless, the starting texture before plane <b>strain</b> <b>compression</b> is different depending {{on the number of}} ECAP passes; a transition to the rolling texture is always evidenced. The evolution of the main ideal rolling texture components obtained from such combination of deformation schemes, ECAP and plane <b>strain</b> <b>compression,</b> is presented and compared to what texture could be achieved if plane <b>strain</b> <b>compression</b> was conducted on an initially annealed material.

50|$|This {{is usually}} {{due to the}} {{mismatch}} in thermal expansion of two cantilever materials, for instance, silicon cantilever coated with {{a thin layer of}} metal (to increase the deflection). When heated, materials with higher expansion coefficient will expand more than the material with lower expansion coefficient. In this case, two materials, one in tensile strain, the other in <b>compression</b> <b>strain,</b> will induce substantial bending. However, this mechanism can be excluded for two reasons; first, cantilever coatings have been stripped experimentally and no change in signal was observed; second, the calculated thermal diffusion length in SiNx and Si cantilevers at the SJEM working frequency (typically 10 kHz~100 kHz) is small, much smaller than the length of the cantilever(typically 100 um).|$|E

30|$|Successful {{treatment}} of subtrochanteric fractures depends on stable osteosynthesis. However, because subtrochanteric fractures are often comminuted, stable internal fixation {{can be difficult}} to achieve [10]. Also, these fractures extend into diaphyseal bone, which has decreased vascularity and, therefore, poorer healing potential [2]. This predisposes internal fixation of these fractures to high rate of failure. Kyle reported that the <b>compression</b> <b>strains</b> are considerably greater than the tension strains [1]. These large stresses on the medial cortex in the subtrochanteric area make cortical restoration at the time of surgery mandatory to prevent cyclic loading and failure of any device used on the tension side of the femur [10].|$|R

Isothermal plane <b>strain</b> <b>compression</b> tests {{have been carried out}} with the purpose of determining relationships to describe the kinetics of static recrystallization, the recrystallized grain size, the isothermal grain growth rate and the strength during hot rolling of AISI 316 steel. The kinetics of static recrystallization were also studied in samples tested in axisymmetric compression, or hot rolled. The effect on the kinetics of static recrystallization of the strain distribution in samples tested in plane <b>strain</b> <b>compression</b> was analysed. The set of equations determined for 316 steel wasused in a computer model modified from the one developed by Leduc (1980) for simulation of hot rolling loads and microstructural evolution. Partially recrystallized microstructure was generated in a laboratory hot rolling mill and was reasonably simulated by the use of the computer programme. Non-isothermal plane <b>strain</b> <b>compression</b> tests were carried out for direct simulation of laboratory hot rolling results. Comparison between experimental hot rolling and plane <b>strain</b> <b>compression</b> data has shown reasonable levels of agreement in the microstructural simulations undertaken in the present work.
