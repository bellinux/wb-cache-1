60|$|The Chain of Universe {{alludes to}} the Jain idea that the whole, {{consisting}} of intellectual {{as well as of}} natural principles, existed from all eternity; and that it has been subject to endless revolutions, whose causes are the inherent powers of nature, intellectual as well as physical, without the intervention of a deity. But the Poet ridicules the non-human, i.e., the not-ourselves, the negation of ourselves and consequently a non-existence. Most Easterns confuse the contradictories, in which one term stands for something, and the other for nothing (e.g., ourselves and not-ourselves), with the contraries (e.g., rich and not-rich = poor), in which both terms express a something. So the positive-negative infinite is not the complement of finite, but its negation. The Western man derides the process by making not-horse the <b>complementary</b> <b>entity</b> of horse. The Pilgrim ends with the favourite Soofi tenet that the five (six?) senses are the doors of all human knowledge, and that no form of man, incarnation of the deity, prophet, apostle or sage, has ever produced an idea not conceived within his brain by the sole operation of these vulgar material agents. Evidently he is neither spiritualist nor idealist.|$|E
40|$|Product reviews {{contain a}} lot of useful {{information}} about product features and customer opinions. One important product feature is the <b>complementary</b> <b>entity</b> (products) that may potentially work together with the reviewed product. Knowing complementary entities of the reviewed product is very important because customers want to buy compatible products and avoid incompatible ones. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} <b>Complementary</b> <b>Entity</b> Recognition (CER). Since no existing method can solve this problem, we first propose a novel unsupervised method to utilize syntactic dependency paths to recognize complementary entities. Then we expand category-level domain knowledge about complementary entities using only a few general seed verbs on a large amount of unlabeled reviews. The domain knowledge helps the unsupervised method to adapt to different products and greatly improves the precision of the CER task. The advantage of the proposed method {{is that it does not}} require any labeled data for training. We conducted experiments on 7 popular products with about 1200 reviews in total to demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures, IEEE BigData 201...|$|E

We use Conditional Random Field (CRF) as the base learner and augment CRF with knowledge-based features (called the Knowledge-based CRF or KCRF for short). We conduct experiments to show that KCRF effectively improves the performance of supervised CER task...|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the theme of}} Sufism, modernity, {{and the relationship between}} the two. This study concludes that according to Mahmûd, Sufism can deliver the people towards the true knowledge. In order to obtain this knowledge, the method of ittibâ‘ to al-Qur’ân and Sunnah is used. The method is implemented through purification of the soul. This method differs from the two methods used in modernity, namely the Cartesian philosophical method and Baconian observation method. The last two methods are only able to produce empirical-rational knowledge. According to Mahmûd, both methods are only appropriate when used in the context of physical science, not of metaphysics and moral issues. The last two issues are more appropriate when viewed from the perspective of Sufism, which is guided by revelation. Mahmûd argued that the relationship between Sufism and modernity is a complementary relationship, in which each of the two aspects is a <b>complementary</b> <b>entity</b> to another. It means that modernity will be spiritually empty without Sufism on one hand and Sufism will also be more meaningful when supported by modern science on the other. </p...|$|E
40|$|Product Community Question Answering (PCQA) {{provides}} {{useful information}} about products and their features (aspects) {{that may not}} be well addressed by product descriptions and reviews. We observe that a product's compatibility issues with other products are frequently discussed in PCQA and such issues are more frequently addressed in accessories, i. e., via a yes/no question "Does this mouse work with windows 10 ?". In this paper, we address the problem of extracting compatible and incompatible products from yes/no questions in PCQA. This problem can naturally have a two-stage framework: first, we perform <b>Complementary</b> <b>Entity</b> (product) Recognition (CER) on yes/no questions; second, we identify the polarities of yes/no answers to assign the complementary entities a compatibility label (compatible, incompatible or unknown). We leverage an existing unsupervised method for the first stage and a 3 -class classifier by combining a distant PU-learning method (learning from positive and unlabeled examples) together with a binary classifier for the second stage. The benefit of using distant PU-learning is that it can help to expand more implicit yes/no answers without using any human annotated data. We conduct experiments on 4 products to show that the proposed method is effective. Comment: 9 pages, 1 figure...|$|E

Alucard's hit points determine {{the maximum amount}} of damage he can withstand before dying while his magic points decide how frequently a magical attack may be cast. Alucard has four other attributes: strengththe power of his physical attack; defensehis resilience to damage inflicted by the monsters; intelligencethe recovery speed of magic points; and luckthe frequency that items are dropped by enemies. Defeating monsters provides him with experience points and he will level up after reaching a predetermined amount, increasing his attributes in the process. Alucard may cast eight different spells, which requires the player to input directional combinations and will use up varying amounts of his magic points. During the course of the game, Alucard can acquire the ability to summon familiars, which function as <b>complementary</b> <b>entities,</b> aiding him in battle and exploration. The North American version of the game includes the Fairy, Demon, Ghost, Bat, and Sword familiars. The original Japanese version also includes the familiars Nose Devil (functionally identical to the Demon but with a Tengu mask) and Pixie.|$|R
40|$|Modern Nuclear Physics {{requires}} {{access to}} higher yields of rare isotopes, {{that relies on}} further development of the In-flight and Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) production methods. The limits of the In-Flight method will be applied via the next generation facilities FAIR in Germany, RIKEN in Japan and RIBF in the USA. The ISOL method will be explored at facilities including ISAC-TRIUMF in Canada, SPIRAL- 2 in France, SPES in Italy, ISOLDE at CERN and eventually at the very ambitious multi-MW EURISOL facility. ISOL and in-flight facilities are <b>complementary</b> <b>entities.</b> While in-flight facilities excel {{in the production of}} very short lived radioisotopes independently of their chemical nature, ISOL facilities provide high Radioisotope Beam (RIB) intensities and excellent beam quality for 70 elements. Both production schemes are opening vast and rich fields of nuclear physics research. In this article we will introduce the targets planned for the EURISOL facility and highlight some of the technical and safety challenges that are being addressed. The EURISOL Radioactive Ion Beam production relies on three 100 kW target stations and a 4 MW converter target station, and aims at producing orders of magnitude higher intensities of approximately one thousand different radioisotopes currently available, and to give access to new rare isotopes. As an illustrative example of its potential, beam intensities of the order of 1013 132 Sn ions pe r second will be available from EURISOL, providing ideal primary beams for further fragmentation or fusion reactions studies...|$|R
30|$|Plans for Léogâne’s {{redevelopment}} include environmental remediation and optimization {{of material}} and resource flows across the energy, water, agricultural and transportation sectors. Investment in one sector, per the plan, creates the stability needed to initialize another; this is integral to the final outcome and can’t be undertaken successfully unless the supporting sectors are in place. The new paradigms for the plan rely upon the cascading of energy, water or residual resources extracted from nature across these sectors. Through colocation and coupling of complementary components, the program will capitalize on designed-in exchanges among multiple system elements. For instance, floodwater control may {{also be used to}} generate energy, irrigate crops and improve water quality. Agricultural and municipal solid waste can provide energy and heat for industrial processes while returning beneficial soil amendments. The vision entails closing loops to create a self-sufficient, holistic system, one that captures synergies, creates economic efficiencies, and eliminates waste. Promoting synergies between economic gains and social infrastructure helps to amplify benefits, ensuring that real gains are made in all sectors for the poorest and most vulnerable people (OECD 2006 b). The design also promotes colocation of <b>complementary</b> <b>entities</b> such as industry, hospitals, clinics and schools, allowing these entities to take advantage of infrastructural outputs and/or contribute inputs. Overall, the plan reduces reliance upon most ‘first world’ carbon-intensive systems, substituting for the most part technologies that can, after training, be constructed and managed by local labor. In addition to new jobs, the scheme also entails alternative employment opportunities for agriculture, agroforestry, and aquaculture industries envisioned for the commune, along with other forms of local enterprise.|$|R

We propose a method that formulates the problem of exploring such signals on unannotated bilingual text as a simple Integer Linear Program, which encourages entity tags to agree via bilingual constraints. Bilingual NER experiments on the large OntoNotes 4. 0 Chinese-English corpus show that the proposed method can improve strong baselines for both Chinese and English. In particular, Chinese performance improves by over 5 % absolute F 1 score. We can then annotate a large amount of bilingual text (80 k sentence pairs) using our method, and add it as uptraining data to the original monolingual NER training corpus. The Chinese model retrained on this new combined dataset outperforms the strong baseline by over 3 % F 1 score. ...|$|R

A Computational Ecosystem is a system of agents designed to emulate, in the computer, biological systems where autonomous individuals are organized in a hierarchical food chain and interact by trading units of energy.

The central claim is focused on how the narratives normally associated with these systems and their functioning are two <b>complementary,</b> but separate <b>entities.</b> By virtue of considering these separately the computational ecosystem is argued to be an abstract generative engine for heterogeneity, spontaneity, and even novelty.

Although the definitions are clearly described, classification of patients into these traditional, clinical disease entity can be difficult. Recent evidence that there are complex, overlapping phenotypes of obstructive lung disease. Our aim was to capture clinical phenotypes of obstructive diseases {{through the use of}} cluster analysis in a representative patient population at a common Dutch pulmonary outpatient clinic. Clinical physiological and cellular/ molecular markers were used in the analysis. To carry out the cluster analysis, an imputed dataset was created from a random sample of 191 adult patients chosen from a pulmonary outpatient clinic. The selection criteria from the sample included patients with a doctor's diagnosis for asthma or COPD. Detailed assessment of patient pulmonary function, blood eosinophil counts, allergic sensitisation and smoking history was collected. We observed four distinct clusters with different clinical characteristics of obstructive lung diseases. Cluster 1 : patients with a history of extensive cigarette smoking, airway obstruction without signs of emphysema; cluster 2 : patients with features of the emphysematous type of COPD; cluster 3 : patients with characteristics of allergic asthma; cluster 4 : patients with features suggesting an overlap syndrome of atopic asthma and COPD. Four phenotypes of obstructive lung disease were identified amongst patients clinically labelled as asthma or COPD. These findings emphasize the concept that there are different phenotypes of obstructive lung diseases, including overlapping and <b>complementary</b> disease <b>entities.</b> These phenotypes of chronic airways disease can serve to tailor disease managemen...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} half century, neuropsychologists, {{cognitive}} psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists interested in human memory have accumulated evidence showing {{that there is not}} one general memory function but a variety of memory systems deserving distinct (but for an organism, <b>complementary)</b> functional <b>entities.</b> The first attempts to organize memory systems within a taxonomic construct are often traced back to the French philosopher Maine de Biran (1766 – 1824), who, in his book first published in 1803, distinguished mechanical memory, sensitive memory and representative memory, without, however, providing any experimental evidence in support of his view. It turns out, however, that what might be regarded as the first elaborated taxonomic proposal is 14 centuries older and is due to Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430), also named St Augustine, who, in Book 10 of his Confessions, by means of an introspective process that did not aim at organizing memory systems, nevertheless distinguished and commented on sensible memory, intellectual memory, memory of memories, memory of feelings and passion, and memory of forgetting. These memories were envisaged as different and complementary instances. In the current study, after a short biographical synopsis of St Augustine, we provide an outline of the philosopher’s contribution, both in terms of questions and answers, and focus on how this contribution almost perfectly fits with several viewpoints of modern psychology and neuroscience of memory about human memory functions, including the notion that episodic autobiographical memory stores events of our personal history in their what, where and when dimensions, and from there enables our mental time travel. It is not at all meant that St Augustine’s elaboration was the basis for the modern taxonomy, but just that the similarity is striking, and that the architecture of our current viewpoints about memory systems might have preexisted as an outstanding intuition in the philosopher’s mind...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since its}} first {{conception}} in 1907 by Bergson, "complementarity" {{has come to}} represent extremely wholistic situations, for which fragmentability into parts turn out unsuccessful. In 1927, Bohr used the term complementarity within quantum mechanics, with profound consequences, for a principally unsuccessful fragmentability into independent observability and definability concepts. The paper objectifies language, in a very general understanding, as a complementaristic phenomenon. Language is thereby conceived as a whole of description and interpretation processes, such that fragmentation in these parts is in principle impossible within the language itself, but possible in a metalanguage if one such exists. The linguistic complementarity is an ultimate form to which particular complementarity conceptions can be reduced. In a basic understanding, the linguistic complementarity refers to the impossibility of describing the constituents of a language, its description and interpretation processes, in the language itself. As such, the complementarity obtains for every language, from genetic language over programming and formal languages, to external communication languages. The argument {{is based on a}} factual function of every language, namely to admit communication or control, whereby descriptions are bound to be finitely representable and static, whereas the corresponding interpretations may be infinite of any order as well as dynamic. Further understandings of the linguistic complementarity are developed by utilizing specific knowledge of languages. With reference to languages for formal set theories, we develop the complementarity as a tension between describability and interpretability. With reference to a processual function concept, with origins in recursive function theory and lambda calculus, we develop complementarity in terms of the unavoidable partiality of the self-references that a language may permit. The reducibility, to the linguistic complementarity, of the specific complementarity conceptions by Bergson and Bohr is investigated with positive results. For the reducibility of Bohr complementarity, as a tension between definability and observability, to the linguistic complementarity, as a tension between describability and interpretability within a language, we develop observability as interpretability in an observation language. Furthermore, we suggest that the self–reference problem for quantum mechanical measurement be naturally resolved in terms of the linguistic complementarity, thereby pointing at a possibility of developing linguistic models for quantum mechanics, for which mechanistic models do not suffice. It is suggested that the real value in finding <b>entities</b> <b>complementary</b> may not be fully revealed until a reduction is carried out to the complementarity for an embracing language. Not until then, we may know if the complementarity is transcendable or not, and understand the possibilities which correspond to a weighing of describability against interpretability...|$|R
