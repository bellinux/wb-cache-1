40|$|The {{concept of}} and {{crystalline}} solar <b>cell</b> <b>arrays</b> on flexible, transparent substrates {{has been focused}} on solution-processed organic and nanocrystal films. Reserach work has found that mechanically flexible and monocrystalline Si cells can offer both high versatility abd performance. The fully operational solar cell device is created by transfer of the micro-cells onto the final substrate after electrode metallization of the device. Use of minimal crystalline Si material fro light absorption and energy harvesting offers a cost-effective route for large-scale manufcaturing of these solar <b>cell</b> <b>arrays.</b> A unique strategy based on ultra-thin and single-crystalline Si has been developed for producing highly efficient, lightweight, low-cost, and mechanically stable solar <b>cell</b> <b>arrays...</b>|$|R

To highlight recent progress in the field of microbial <b>cell</b> <b>arrays,</b> this review discusses research on genetic engineering of reporter cells, technologies for patterning live cells on solid surfaces, cellular immobilization in different polymers, and studies on their application in environmental monitoring, disease diagnostics, and other related fields.

50|$|A {{built-in}} solar <b>cell</b> <b>array</b> in {{a hand-held}} product {{has a very}} small capacity. The light output and run time of the solar flashlight are limited {{by the amount of}} energy that can be absorbed in a day. Flashlights are usually stored indoors or otherwise out of direct sunlight; consumers may find it inconvenient to remember to place the flashlight in full sunlight for several hours before use. Rechargeable cells self-discharge, so unless the flashlight is stored in a sunny location, the light may not function in an emergency. Rechargeable cells have a finite charge/discharge cycle life, and when the cells wear out it may be difficult for the consumer to replace them. Some of these disadvatages can be mitigated by separating the solar <b>cell</b> <b>array</b> from the flashlight, but then the simplicity of automatic charging is lost.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of the linear first-order passive circuit is of considerable importance to engineers. However, dynamic responses of these circuits when powered with solar <b>cell</b> <b>arrays</b> {{have not received}} much attention. Further to this, to date, no closed-form solution was reported for the transient response of these circuits due to difficulties arising from the complicated traditional model of the external characteristic of solar <b>cell</b> <b>arrays.</b> To overcome this difficulty, in this paper, a new model is proposed for external characteristic of solar <b>cell</b> <b>arrays.</b> The closed-form transient response of R-L and R-C circuits obtained from this model are compared with their counterparts obtained from the traditional model by using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical method and very close agreement is obtained between {{the two sets of}} results. Also a closed-form solution is provided for direct estimation of the maximum power point voltage and current. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} highly {{parallel}} microfluidic approach for contacting single cell pairs. The approach combines a differential fluidic resistance trapping method {{with a novel}} cellular valving principle for homotypic and heterotypic single cell co-culturing. Differential fluidic resistance was used for sequential single <b>cell</b> <b>arraying,</b> with the adhesion and flattening of viable cells within the microstructured environment acting to produce valves in the open state. Reversal of the flow {{was used for the}} sequential single <b>cell</b> <b>arraying</b> of the second cell type. Plasma stencilling, along the linear path of least resistance, was required to confine the cells within the trap regions. Prime flow conditions with minimal shear stress were identified for highly efficient <b>cell</b> <b>arraying</b> (similar to 99 %) and long term cell culture. Larger trap dimensions enabled the highest levels of cell pairing (similar to 70 %). The single cell co-cultures were in close proximity for the formation of connexon structures and the study of contact modes of communication. The research further highlights the possibility of using the natural behaviour of cells as the working principle behind responsive microfluidic element...|$|R

50|$|The plant's {{buildings}} {{have been designed}} to maximise natural light during the day and a selection of high thermal materials (e.g. solid precast concrete walls and insulation) to improve thermal properties, thereby minimising energy consumption. More specifically, solar photovoltaic cells have been placed on the reverse osmosis buildings for localised power generation. Each reverse osmosis building has an approximately 100 kW solar <b>cell</b> <b>array</b> providing a site capacity of approximately 200 kW at peak sun hours.The high pressure pumps feeding the reverse-osmosis membranes are the largest consumers of energy in the plant. Energy recovery devices are installed to harness the pressure in the saline concentrate stream and use it to pressurise some of the feed water. As a result, the high pressure pumps are only needed to deliver half of the water feeding the reverse osmosis system, reducing energy consumption in the plant by up to 40 per cent. Likewise, two turbine generators in the outfall tunnel take advantage of the plant elevation 50 meters above sea level. This mini-hydroelectric system is capable of producing 1,290 kW of renewable electricity which is fed back into the plant, reducing energy consumption by approximately 2.5%.|$|E

Our generalized model is independent of the special geometry of the <b>cell</b> <b>arrays</b> and describes the temporal evolution of the connection weights between cells on different manifolds.
