40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{two types}} of hop-indexed models for the unit-demand asymmetric Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) : (a) capacitated models guaranteeing {{that the number of}} commodities (paths) traversing any given arc does not exceed a specified capacity; and (b) hop-constrained models guaranteeing that any route length (number of nodes) does not exceed a given value. The latter might, in turn, be divided into two classes: (b 1) those restricting the length of the path from the depot to any node k, and (b 2) those restricting the <b>length</b> of the <b>circuit</b> passing through any node k. Our results indicate that formulations based upon <b>circuit</b> <b>lengths</b> (b 2) lead to models with a linear programming relaxation that is tighter than the linear programming relaxation of models based upon path lengths (b 1), and that combining features from capacitated models with those of <b>circuit</b> <b>lengths</b> can lead to formulations for the CVRP with a tight linear programming bound. Computational results on a small number of problem instances with up to 41 nodes and 440 edges show that the combined model with capacities and <b>circuit</b> <b>lengths</b> produce average gaps of less than one percent. We also briefly examine the asymmetric travelling salesman problem (ATSP), showing the potential use of the ideas developed for the vehicle routing problem to derive models for the ATSP with a linear programming relaxation bound that is tighter than the linear programming relaxation bound of the standard Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson [G.

40|$|We {{show that}} every bridgeless cubic graph G with m edges has a cycle cover of length at most 1. 6 m. Moreover, if G {{does not contain}} any {{intersecting}} <b>circuits</b> of <b>length</b> 5, then G has a cycle cover of length 212 / 135 · m ≈ 1. 570 m and if G contains no 5 -circuits, then it has a cycle cover of length at most 14 / 9 · m ≈ 1. 556 m. To prove our results, we show that each 2 -edge-connected cubic graph G on n vertices has a 2 -factor containing at most n/ 10 +f(G) <b>circuits</b> of <b>length</b> 5, where the value of f(G) only depends {{on the presence of}} several subgraphs arising from the Petersen graph.

50|$|The circuit had {{a number}} of {{different}} configurations. From its construction in 1950 until 1954 it was 5.1 km in length. In 1955 major works increased the <b>circuit's</b> <b>length</b> to 6.542 km, its most famous configuration. Construction of a new Autoroute across the circuit saw a new section of track built and the <b>length</b> of the <b>circuit</b> reduced to 5.543 km.

50|$|Some {{types of}} metal conduit may {{also serve as}} a useful bonding {{conductor}} for grounding (earthing), but wiring regulations may also dictate workmanship standards or supplemental means of grounding for certain types.

5000|$|For 1952, {{the track}} was re-configured to bypass Gueux via the (then) new D26 section, {{shortening}} the circuit from 7.826 km to 7.152 km (4.444 mi) after {{which it was}} renamed [...] "Circuit de Reims" [...] or commonly referred to simply as [...] "Reims". Improvements continued in preparations for 1953, the inaugural year of the 12 Hours of Reims series, which featured a new D26 track extension from the Virage de la Hovette (Annie Bousquet corner) to a new purpose built intersection with the La Garenne straight (Muizon corner) about 1.2 km west of the previous Gueux / La Garenne junction, resulting in a new preliminary <b>circuit</b> <b>length</b> of 8.372 km (5.187 mi). The last major modifications were before the 1954 season, re-profiling the new Muizon corner {{from the previous year}} and the Thillois corner to a larger and faster radius, which established again a shorter and final <b>circuit</b> <b>length</b> of 8.302 km (5.158 mi). This public road circuit had previously been made up entirely of straights with a few slight and very fast kinks and slow corners; with the addition of these 3 fast sweepers and the extension of the main straight, this circuit, which was already very fast- was now even faster than it had been before, by about 10-15 mph per lap.|$|E

40|$|A cubic graph G is {{cyclically}} 5 -connected if G is simple, 3 -connected, has {{at least}} 10 vertices and for every set F of edges of size at most four, at most one component of G F contains circuits. We prove that if G and H are cyclically 5 -connected cubic graphs and H topologically contains G, then either G and H are isomorphic, or (modulo well-described exceptions) there exists a cyclically 5 -connected cubic graph G' such that H topologically contains G' and G' is obtained from G {{in one of the}} following two ways. Either G' is obtained from G by subdividing two distinct edges of G and joining the two new vertices by an edge, or G' is obtained from G by subdividing each edge of a <b>circuit</b> of <b>length</b> five and joining the new vertices by a matching to a new <b>circuit</b> of <b>length</b> five disjoint from G {{in such a way that}} the cyclic orders of the two circuits agree. We prove a companion result, where by slightly increasing the connectivity of H we are able to eliminate the second construction. We also prove versions of both of these results when G is almost cyclically 5 -connected in the sense that it satisfies the definition except for 4 -edge cuts such that one side is a <b>circuit</b> of <b>length</b> four. In this case G' is required to be almost cyclically 5 -connected and to have fewer <b>circuits</b> of <b>length</b> four than G. In particular, if G has at most one <b>circuit</b> of <b>length</b> four, then G' is required to be cyclically 5 -connected. However, in this more general setting the operations describing the possible graphs G' are more complicated. Comment: 47 pages, 5 figures. Revised according to referee's comments. To appear in J.

5000|$|Both car and Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} racing were regular attractions at Monza, but as {{the speed}} of the machines were increasing, two chicanes—the Variante del Rettifilo at the middle of the start/finish straight, [...] and the Variante Ascari—were added in 1972 to reduce racing speeds. This resulted in a new <b>circuit</b> <b>length</b> of 5.755 km. Grand Prix motorcycles continued to use the un-slowed road track until two serious accidents resulted in five deaths, including Renzo Pasolini and Jarno Saarinen, in 1973, and motorcycle racing did not return to Monza until 1981. These races involved drivers constantly slipstreaming competing cars, which produced several close finishes, such as in 1967, 1969, and 1971; the last year the Italian Grand Prix was run at Monza without chicanes.|$|E
50|$|The circuit {{was also}} {{extensively}} used for testing, especially in Formula One. In 1986, Brabham Formula One driver Elio de Angelis {{was killed in}} a testing accident at the fast first turn after the rear wing of his Brabham BT55 had broken off. Although the circuit was not the cause of the crash, it was modified {{in order to make it}} safer. The length of the Mistral Straight was reduced from 1.8 km in length to just over 1 km, and the fast sweeping Verierre curves where de Angelis had crashed were bypassed. Effectively, after the start, instead of heading into the left hand Verierre sweeper, cars now braked hard and turned sharp right into a short run that connected the pit straight to the Mistral. This changed the <b>circuit</b> <b>length</b> for a Grand Prix from 5.81 km (3.61 mi) to just 3.812 km (2.369 mi). This also had the effect of cutting lap times from Keke Rosberg's 1985 pole time of 1:32.462 in his Williams-Honda turbo, to Nigel Mansell's 1990 pole time of 1:04.402 in his V12 Ferrari.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lumped element}} model is valid {{whenever}} , where [...] denotes the circuit's characteristic length, and [...] denotes the circuit's operating wavelength.Otherwise, when the <b>circuit</b> <b>length</b> {{is on the}} order of a wavelength, we must consider more general models, such as the distributed element model (including transmission lines), whose dynamic behaviour is described by Maxwell's equations. Another way of viewing the validity of the lumped element model is to note that this model ignores the finite time it takes signals to propagate around a circuit. Whenever this propagation time is not significant to the application the lumped element model can be used. This is the case when the propagation time is much less than the period of the signal involved. However, with increasing propagation time there will be an increasing error between the assumed and actual phase of the signal which in turn results in an error in the assumed amplitude of the signal. The exact point at which the lumped element model can no longer be used depends to a certain extent on how accurately the signal needs to be known in a given application.|$|E
