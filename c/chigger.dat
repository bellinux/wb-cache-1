40|$|Abstract. Characterization of the 56 -kDa type-specific antigen (TSA) {{genes of}} Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT) from three {{naturally}} infected, laboratory-reared mite colonies comprising three species (Leptotrombidium deliense [Ld], Leptotrombidium imphalum [Li], and Leptotrombidium chiangraiensis [Lc]) has revealed {{the presence of}} single and coexisting OT genotypes found in individual <b>chiggers.</b> The Karp genotype was found {{in all of the}} <b>chiggers</b> examined, whereas Gilliam and UT 302 genotypes were only observed in combination with the Karp genotype. From analysis of these OT genotypes after transmission from <b>chiggers</b> to mice it was determined that with the Lc and Li mites, the OT genotype composition in the rodent spleens post-infection had not changed and therefore resembled that observed in the feeding <b>chiggers.</b> However, only the Karp genotype was found in rodents after feeding by Ld <b>chiggers</b> carrying Karp and Gilliam genotypes.

25|$|Chiggers {{attach to}} the host, pierce the skin, inject enzymes into the bite wound that digest {{cellular}} contents, and then suck up the digested tissue through a tube formed by hardened skin cells called a stylostome. They do not burrow into the skin or suck blood, as is commonly assumed. Itching from a <b>chigger</b> bite may not develop until 24–48 hours after the bite, so the victim may not associate the specific exposure with the bite itself. The red welt/bump on the skin is not where a <b>chigger</b> laid eggs, as is sometimes believed. The larva remains attached to a suitable host for {{three to five days}} before dropping off to begin its nymphal stage. They tend to attach where clothing have restrictions, such as belt lines, or behind the knees when wearing jeans.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the harvest}} mite <b>chigger</b> {{usually do not}} carry {{diseases}} in North American temperate climates, Leptotrombidium deliense is considered a dangerous pest in East Asia and the South Pacific because it often carries Orientia tsutsugamushi, the tiny bacterium that causes scrub typhus, which is known alternatively as the Japanese river disease, scrub disease, or tsutsugamushi. The mites are infected by the Rickettsia passed down from parent to offspring before eggs are laid in a process called transovarial transmission. Symptoms of scrub typhus in humans include fever, headache, muscle pain, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms.|$|E

In their larval stage, they attach to various animals, including humans, and feed on skin, often causing itching. These relatives of ticks are nearly microscopic, measuring 0.4mm (1/60 of an inch) and have a chrome-orange hue.

40|$|The demilitarized {{fortress}} Lunet 3 {{was suspected}} to be inhabited by man-infesting <b>chiggers.</b> To study this phenomenon, mice, voles and shrews were caught and studied at four-weekly intervals during two years. A dog {{was used as}} a bait every Wednesday. Three species of <b>chiggers</b> were found on the small mammals: Neotrombicula autumnalis (Shaw, 1790), N. japonica (Tanaka, et al.,l 930) and Cheladonta sp. Only N. autumnalis was found to attack dog and man. This species was present on its hosts from the middle of July until the middle of October or November. Its larvae were found on Rattus norvegicus, Apodemus sylvaticus, Clethrionomys glareolus, Sorex araneus, Crocidura russula, Erinaceus europeus, Capra hircus Canisfamiliaris, Homo sapiens and Turdus merula. Major hosts were as follows: C. glareolus and A. sylvaticus. Peak number of N. autumnalis per host include 1100 mites on a bank vole and 700 on a goat. Favoured sides of attachment were inside the ears (C. glareolus), on the face (E. europeus), between the toes (C. familiaris, C. hircus), around the anus (A. sylvaticus, C. russula S. araneus and T. merula), in case of man, those areas where clothing was tight. The <b>chiggers</b> were present in higher numbers in 1975 compared to 1974, this is probably caused by the warmer summer of 1975. N. autumnalis had only one generation per year on Lunet 3. The larvae did not hibernate on their hosts. In the summer of 1973 our attention was drawn to a demilitarized fort inhabited by 17 persons, some of whom complained of an annoying papular urticaria. A pilot study pointed to <b>chiggers</b> as the most likely cause of the trouble. Not much is known of dutch <b>chiggers</b> (Bronswijk ~z Roberti, 1974).
