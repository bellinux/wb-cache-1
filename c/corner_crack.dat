6000|$|In August {{the first}} frost came and formed [...] "young ice" [...] on the sea, but this lasted {{only for a}} brief hour or two, and was broken up by the tide and melted. By the 10th of September the young ice {{cemented}} the floes of last year's ice together, and soon rendered the ice round the ship immovable. Hummocks clustered round several rocky islets in the neighbourhood, and the rising and falling of the tide covered {{the sides of the}} rocks with bright crystals. All the feathered tribes took their departure for less rigorous climes, {{with the exception of a}} small white bird about the size of a sparrow, called the snow-bird, which is the last to leave the icy north. Then a tremendous storm arose, and the sea became choked up with icebergs and floes which the frost soon locked together into a solid mass. Towards the close of the storm snow fell in great abundance, and when the mariners ventured again to put their heads up the opened hatchways, the decks were knee-deep, the drift to windward was almost level with the bulwarks, every yard was edged with white, every rope and cord had a light side and a dark, every point and truck had a white button on it, and every hole, <b>corner,</b> <b>crack,</b> and crevice was choked up.|$|E

The results of the fatigue crack growth tests with short <b>corner</b> <b>cracks</b> were compared with the long fatigue crack growth test data. The short cracks grew at K values below the threshold for long cracks at the same stress ratio. They also grew faster than long cracks at the same K-values and the same stress ratios.

Based on a systematical numerical study of the 3 D stress fields near the crack tip of quarter elliptic <b>corner</b> <b>cracks</b> and comparison with that of ideal through-the-thickness cracks, an equivalent thickness conception for curved cracks is proposed from the viewpoint of out-of-plane constraint, and a semi-analytical solution for the equivalent thickness of <b>corner</b> <b>cracks</b> is obtained.

40|$|In this report, {{data from}} fatigue crack growth {{programmes}} NASGRO and Franc 2 D is analyzed. Results are correlated with reports written on Volvo Aero, simulations performed in NASCRAC, another crack growth programme, and also another degree project previously performed at Volvo. For some case real test {{data will be}} used for comparison. To evaluate the function of these programmes is essential since Volvo in the future will rely on them to a high extent. The different crack geometries used during the execution of this project are through, surface and <b>corner</b> <b>cracks.</b> Since Franc 2 D is an entirely two dimensional programme there were no possibilities to simulate surface or <b>corner</b> <b>cracks</b> with it and hence these crack geometries were only applied in NASGRO. Cases used in this project originate from parts found in turbines, built by Volvo Aero to the European Ariane rocket. However, presented results may also be used to draw general conclusions concerning the functionality of the programmes. This report may in many aspects be used as a handbook which helps the user to choose certain parameters before a simulation is initiated. A variety of simulations, originating from several cases, indicated that NASGRO and Franc 2 D handle stresses in two different ways. In NASGRO no height need to be stated for a case because the stress is used along the crack extension. In Franc 2 D which is a mesh based programme however, the height must be stated and the stress is applied at the top of geometry. Two different approaches and the case simulated should decide which approach is most truthful. For the through crack both programmes give satisfying results and many results correlate well with both older results as well as expectations. Results were also received for surface and <b>corner</b> <b>cracks,</b> some good, but in many aspects these geometries need further development. Franc 3 D, which operates in a similar manner to Franc 2 D but is based on three dimensions, could be used in future simulations concerning surface and <b>corner</b> <b>cracks.</b> The elastic-plastic module in NASGRO was also used in this project but a range of simulations indicated that it does not work well enough for cases presented in this project.
