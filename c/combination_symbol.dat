40|$|This {{contribution}} {{proposes a}} new <b>combination</b> <b>symbol</b> mapper/ 8 -ary constellation, {{which is a}} joint optimization of an 8 -ary signal constellation and its symbol mapping operation, to improve the performance of Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation with Iterative Decoding (BICM-ID). The basic idea was to use the so called (1, 7) constellation (which is a capacitive efficient constellation) instead of the conventional 8 -PSK constellation and to choose the most suitable mapping for it. A comparative study between the combinations most suitable mapping/(1, 7) constellation and SSP mapping/conventional 8 -PSK constellation has been carried out. Simulation {{results showed that the}} 1 st combination significantly outperforms the 2 nd combination and with only 4 iterations, it gives better performance than the 2 nd combination with 8 iterations. A gain of 4 dB is given by iteration 4 of the 1 st combination compared to iteration 8 of the 2 nd combination at a BER level equal to 10 - 5, and it (iteration 4 of the 1 st combination) can attain a BER equal to 10 - 7 for, only, a SNR = 5. 6 dB. </p...|$|E

40|$|Children {{with limited}} speech using graphic symbols for {{communication}} often express themselves predominantly through single symbols rather than <b>symbol</b> <b>combinations.</b> This study aimed {{to investigate the}} effect of an intervention strategy that was incorporated into shared storybook reading on the production of graphic <b>symbol</b> <b>combinations.</b> Three {{children between the ages}} of 7; 9 (years;months) and 10; 8 with limited speech and physical impairments participated in the study. A multiple probe design across behaviours (3 different types of semantic <b>symbol</b> <b>combinations)</b> was used, replicated across the 3 participants. Intervention entailed prompting the production of strategic <b>symbol</b> <b>combinations</b> (generated from a matrix) during shared storybook reading by using a prompting hierarchy. The participants’ production of combinations targeted during intervention as well as their ability to generalize to nontarget combinations from the matrix was monitored using a probe test (picture description task). All 3 participants showed some gains in acquiring the combinations and generalizing to nontarget combinations, as measured by the probe test. While 1 participant showed convincing effects, the other 2 showed lower effects. Lower effects may be partly ascribed to participant characteristics as well as to the discrepancies between the intervention and probe contexts. All participants performed better within the shared storybook reading context. Results suggest that the production of <b>symbol</b> <b>combinations</b> can be facilitated during shared storybook reading and that the matrix strategy promotes generalization to untrained semantic combinations. However, participant gains may not reflect immediately in formal testing situations. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

Participants were presented with arrays of visual symbols consisting of a number of visual targets amidst distractor symbols. The participants had to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether there were more targets or more distractors present in the array. <b>Combinations</b> of <b>symbol</b> features (color-fill, color-letter, color-shape, and fill-shape) were varied on a block-to-block basis, while set size and ratio of targets to distractors (easy/ 20 : 80 or difficult/ 40 : 60) were varied on a trial-by-trial basis. The results of this experiment revealed that the combination of color and shape and specific shapes and fill led to worse performance compared to the combinations of color and fill. These results suggest that the combination of colors and fill can be used to facilitate the identification of display elements in a complex visual array...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of coherently {{extending}} the integration time for the acquisition of new Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals is addressed. Unlike the acquisition of legacy GNSS signals, the presence of secondary codes allows the polarity of the transmitted signal to change each primary code period. These polarity changes have to be recovered and <b>symbol</b> <b>combinations</b> have to be tested before extending the coherent integration time. The hierarchical structure imposed by secondary codes {{and the presence of}} data/pilot channels are exploited to improve the acquisition process. A new algorithm, based on the fast m-sequence and Walsh-Hadamard transforms, is developed and used for efficiently testing all the possible <b>symbol</b> <b>combinations.</b> Secondary code constraints are included to further reduce the computational complexity of enumerating all <b>symbol</b> <b>combinations.</b> The proposed algorithms are analyzed in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and an approximate expression for the probability of false alarm is derived exploiting results from Extreme Value Theory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes {{generalized}} context modeling (GCM) for heterogeneous data compression. The proposed model {{extends the}} suffix of predicted subsequences in classic context modeling to arbitrary <b>combinations</b> of <b>symbols</b> in multiple di-rections. To address {{the selection of}} contexts, GCM constructs a model graph with a combinatorial structuring of finite order <b>combination</b> of predicted <b>symbols</b> as its nodes. The estimated probability for prediction is obtained by weighting over a class of context models that contain all the occurrences of nodes in the model graph. Moreover, separable context modeling in each direction is adopted for efficient prediction. To find optimal class of context models for prediction, the normalized maximum like-lihood (NML) function is developed to estimate their structures and parameters, especially for heterogeneous data with large sizes. Furthermore, it is refined by context pruning to exclud...|$|R
