40|$|For {{the first}} time, global ocean usable wind power is {{evaluated}} for modern offshore turbine characteristics including hub height, usable {{portion of the}} wind speed distribution and siting depth. Mean wind power increases by 30 %, 69 % and 73 % within the tropics and northern and southern hemisphere extratropics, respectively, between hub heights of 10 m and 100 m. A turbine with a <b>cut-out</b> <b>speed</b> of 25 m s− 1 (30 m s− 1) within the northern hemisphere storm track harvests between 55 % (82 %) and 85 % (> 98 %) of available power. Within this region, a 2 – 3 m s− 1 change in <b>cut-out</b> <b>speed</b> {{can result in a}} 5 – 7 % change in usable power. 80 m wind power accumulates at a rate of 20 – 45 GW km 2 m− 2 per meter depth increase from the shore to the shelf break.

The combined impact of all three characteristics on available wind power is assessed for three technology tiers: existing, planned, and future innovations. Usable percent of 80 m available global ocean wind power ranges from 0. 40 % for existing to 2. 73 % for future envisioned turbine specifications.

The effects of local wind speed and wind turbine power characteristics on the optimum hub height are investigated. The optimum hub height decreased as the mean wind speed and wind shear exponent increased.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{variable}} torque generator (VTG) with a movable stator relative to the rotor in the drivetrain of a wind turbine is investigated theoretically and computationally. This feature allows {{the use of a}} larger capacity generator in wind turbines to increase the rated power in high wind speeds and still keep them in operation in even lower than cut-in speed ranges. Thus, by harnessing more wind power throughout the entire power curve of the wind turbine, from the new cut-in speed to the <b>cut-out</b> <b>speed,</b> the efficiency of the wind turbine can be increased.

40|$|This thesis assesses {{improvements}} to {{two types of}} control for a novel interior permanent magnet (PM) synchronous generator with fractional-slot, concentrated-wound stator designed for direct-drive wind energy conversion. The two control techniques assessed are a) field oriented control using a back-to-back converter arrangement and b) a current controller with a rectifier-connected boost converter. These were chosen to understand the potential and {{the limitations of the}} generator and its control. Modifications to the control techniques are proposed to improve the generator efficiency, the dynamic performance in the flux-weakening range and the torque ripple performance. The adequacy of the distributed-wound PM synchronous machine model for steady-state and dynamic control of this generator was experimentally validated under field oriented control using a back-to-back converter connected to the grid. The effectiveness of the existing current trajectory controls on the efficiency of the new generator was evaluated. A new flux-prioritized maximum torque per ampere technique which is independent of speed-dependent predefined trajectories was introduced, and a similar efficiency improvement was gained as the conventional loss minimization method in the partial load range. Thus, the control model validation and efficiency imrpovement of the new generator are the primary contributions. The dynamic performance of the generator, directly driven by a non-pitchable wind turbine emulator was investigated from cut-in speed to <b>cut-out</b> <b>speed</b> using maximum power point tracking and then constant power control above rated speed. A significant contribution was done in the power control above base wind speed that was achieved by utilizing the extended flux-weakening capability of the machine with its wide constant power-speed range. High torque ripple was observed when operated with a rectifier and boost converter using boost converter inductor current control. A new direct torque control technique using a machine rotor position based torque estimator was proposed to minimize this torque ripple. Eventhough the reduced torque ripple is still higher than that with back-to-back converter, the achieved ripple reduction is significant. The control of generator speed under each method is also demonstrated. Although the new method gives a faster speed dynamics than the conventional method, it shows slower speed response than that of back-to-back converter control. However, the significance of the study using a diode rectifier-connected boost converter control is highlighted with the achieved torque ripple minimization and performance enhancement of the generator. This study is expected to open new investigations in flux-weakening control of the PM generators using rectifier-connected boost converter. In this thesis, back to back converter control is demonstrated in order to optimally control the novel generator under the field oriented control, energy efficient current control and power control together with voltage control operating above rated speed. Torque ripple minimization of the generator is also presented when used with a diode rectifier-connected boost converter control...|$|E

These characteristics include hub height, rotor diameter, and rated power, and depend on turbine make and model. They shape the turbine’s power curve and thus have large implications for the energy generation capacity of wind farms. For each characteristic, we find complex and substantial geographical variations in the sensitivity of energy generation. However, the sensitivity associated with each characteristic can be predicted by a single corresponding climate statistic, greatly simplifying {{understanding of the relationship}} between climate and turbine optimization for energy production. In the case of the sensitivity to rotor diameter, the change in energy output per unit change in rotor diameter at any location is directly proportional to the weighted average wind speed between the cut-in speed and the rated speed. The sensitivity to rated power variations is likewise captured by the percent of the wind speed distribution between the turbines rated and <b>cut-out</b> <b>speeds.</b> Finally, the sensitivity to hub height is proportional to lower atmospheric wind shear. Using a wind turbine component cost model, we also evaluate energy output increase per dollar investment in each turbine characteristic.

The maximum wind speed range (from cut-in to <b>cut-out</b> wind <b>speed)</b> is considered for design of blade as well as predicting the fatigue life of the blade. Morrow’s equation is used for calculating the fatigue life of wind turbine blade. The parameters which govern the fatigue life of the blade are the chord length; blade length and the twist angle. For optimizing the fatigue life of the Wing Turbine blade, the length of blade, the chord length and the twist angle, these parameters are varied. Constrained Gradient (Steepest ascent method) method is used for fatigue life optimization of the blade. The twist angle is very sensitive to the fatigue life of the blade than the chord length and the blade length. The fatigue life increases exponentially with the increase in twist angle, while there is parabolic relation between the fatigue life of the blade and the chord length. The fatigue life decreases with increase in the blade length linearly. Due to increase in fatigue life of the blade, the cost of the wind turbine plant get...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{long-term}} wind {{data obtained from}} high-resolution hindcast simulations is used to analytically assess offshore wind power potential in the Aegean and Ionian Seas and provide wind climate and wind power potential characteristics at selected locations, where offshore wind farms are at the concept/planning phase. After ensuring the good model performance through detailed validation against buoy measurements, offshore wind speed and wind direction at 10 m above sea level are statistically analyzed on the annual and seasonal time scale. The spatial distribution of the mean wind speed and wind direction are provided in the appropriate time scales, along with the mean annual and the inter-annual variability; these statistical quantities are useful in the offshore wind energy sector as regards the preliminary identification of favorable sites for exploitation of offshore wind energy. Moreover, the offshore wind power potential and its variability are also estimated at 80 m height above sea level. The obtained results reveal that there are specific areas in the central and the eastern Aegean Sea that combine intense annual winds with low variability; the annual offshore wind power potential in these areas reach values close to 900 W/m 2, suggesting that a detailed assessment of offshore wind energy would be worth noticing and could lead in attractive investments. Furthermore, as a rough estimate of the availability factor, the equiprobable contours of the event [4 m/s ≤ wind speed ≤ 25 m/s] are also estimated and presented. The selected lower and upper bounds of wind speed correspond to typical cut-in and <b>cut-out</b> wind <b>speed</b> thresholds, respectively, for commercial offshore wind turbines. Finally, for seven offshore wind farms {{that are at the}} concept/planning phase the main wind climate and wind power density characteristics are also provided...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the converter {{design for a}} 20 kW wind turbine generator. The converter consists of a phase controlled rectifier and a DC/DC boost converter. The rectifier makes the generator AC voltage match the DC voltage while the boost converter keeps the DC voltage constant. The generator's synchronous inductance acts as an AC inductor of boost converter so no extra DC inductor is required. This converter {{is designed to be}} efficient and cheap. However, this converter does result in higher power loss in the generator due to its non-sinusoidal phase current, especially when the firing angle is not equal to 0. 1. POWER FLOW DIAGRAM The power flow diagram for the 20 kW wind generator system is shown in Figure 1. The wind drives the wind turbine, which is connected to the wind generator, therefore the wind energy is converted to electrical energy. The generator's AC voltage is converted to DC voltage through an AC/DC converter. The DC output voltage is fed to the load and battery bank. The voltage should stay constant for various wind speeds. When the wind speed is too high, i. e., the generator produces too much power and voltage, the dump load is connected through the switches. Also, the blade pitch control can be employed in an emergency. When the wind speed is low, the generator together with the battery bank can provide sufficient energy to the load. Figure 1. Power Flow Diagram of Wind Turbine System In Figure 1, the battery bank is composed of 120 series connected Pd-Acid batteries, each at 2. 35 V and all together at 282 V.

H 577 P CEE 2016 LinJXL, 408 pages :color illustrationsCompared with {{horizontal}} axis wind turbines (HAWT), vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) have the primary advantages of insensitivity to wind direction and turbulent wind, a simpler structure, less fatigue loading, and easy maintenance. As a result, {{a renewed interest}} in VAWTs has been seen in recent years and there is a trend worldwide in building large-scale VAWTs. Nevertheless, VAWTs were not pursued after brief development and failing in the 1980 s, which resulted in a lack of design experience of large-scale VAWTs. Furthermore, VAWTs suffer the disadvantages of low power coefficient and difficulties in self-start and shut-down. Hence, great research efforts are urgently required to make VAWTs workable. In this regard, this thesis is devoted to a systematic and novel study of large-scale VAWTs, which includes the determination of wind loads on all the components of the VAWT using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, the finite element modelling and model updating of laminated composite blades, the fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of blades and other components of the VAWT, the pitch control systems for four states of the VAWT, the structural health monitoring (SHM) of the VAWT, and the concept of the smart VAWT. To conduct fatigue and ultimate strength analyses, dynamic loads on the whole VAWT must be determined. A practical method of wind load simulation for VAWTs is proposed in this study based on the strip analysis method and the 2 D shear stress transport (SST) k-w model. The validity of 2 D SST k-w model for VAWTs is assessed by comparing simulation results with those obtained by 2. 5 D large eddy simulation (LES). The influences of the tower, arms and turbulent inflow on the aerodynamic forces of the blades are further studied. The results show that the wind pressure and aerodynamic forces simulated by the 2 D SST k-w model match well with those obtained by 2. 5 D LES. The influences of the mean wind speed profile, turbulence, and interaction of all the components can be included in the proposed method at an acceptable computation cost. The influence of the tower is unapparent while the influence of the arms is obvious. The tangential force, and thus the power coefficient, is reduced due to the existence of the arms. The turbulent inflow wind speed causes fluctuation in the wind loads. In addition to wind loads, a precise finite element (FE) model is also needed for the structural analysis. The blades of modern wind turbines are made of laminated composite materials. In this thesis, an FE model of blades is established using laminated shell elements and a micromechanics-based model updating method is proposed to update the laminar elastic constants of the FE model. Analyses of sensitivity and uncertainty are conducted to determine the parameters of micromechanics models to be updated. Static bending tests are conducted and the measured data are used to update the models. The results show that by applying micromechanics models to the process of updating laminar elastic constants, direct identification of these constants can be avoided. In addition, the number of updating parameters can be reduced. It is found that the fiber volume fraction is the most influential parameter with the largest uncertainty for both unidirectional fiber reinforced plastic (UD FRP) and plain weave fiber reinforced plastic (PW FRP). After updating the fiber volume fractions for UP FRP and PW FRP based on the measured strains and displacements, both the calculated local strains and the global displacement match well with the measured data. A framework for the fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of composite blades is proposed. First, a refined FE model of a laminated composite straight blade is established. Based on the FE model, fatigue analyses are conducted and the influences of the ultimate tensile and compressive strains, damping ratio and fundamental frequency on fatigue damage are studied. Ultimate strength analysis at the extreme wind speed is also conducted and the influence of wind direction on the response of blade is considered. The results show that for the specific composite straight blade considered, the locations at the supports and the mid-span of the blade have larger fatigue damage than other positions of the blade. The positions subjected to compressive cyclic loads have the larger fatigue damage than those subjected to tensile cyclic loads. The fatigue damage is sensitive to the damping ratio and fundamental frequency. The critical locations of strength failure are near the supports. The largest interlaminar shear stresses occur near the supports while the largest interlaminar normal stresses occur at the leading edge, not in the support section. A framework for fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of other components of VAWTs is also proposed. A FE model of the VAWT is established by beam elements. The rotating frame method is used to eliminate the rigid motion of the VAWT. Based on the FE model, fatigue and ultimate strength analyses are then conducted. The results show that the largest fatigue damage occurs {{at the root of the}} main arms. The fatigue critical location of the tower is at the bottom. It is found that larger fatigue damage occurs in the leeward side of the tower. For the rotor, the strength failure critical locations are the roots of main arm and the shaft. Assuming that the direction of the extreme wind speed is at the azimuth angle of 0 ⁰, the dangerous azimuth angles of the main arm are 60 ⁰ and 240 ⁰; the dangerous azimuth angles of the shaft are 30 ⁰, 150 ⁰ and 270 ⁰. For the tower, the fatigue critical location is at the bottom and in the leeward side and the dangerous azimuth angles are 30 ⁰, 150 ⁰ and 270 ⁰. Field tests of a straight-bladed VAWT are conducted to validate the proposed frameworks for the fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of VAWTs. The power spectrum densities (PSDs) of the measured responses are calculated under different conditions. Natural frequencies are determined from the peaks of the normalized PSDs of measured responses. The FE model of the VAWT is updated by the identified natural frequencies. By comparing the simulated responses with the corresponding measured data in the frequency domain, it is found that these two results match well with each other. Therefore, the proposed frameworks are validated to some extent. The pitch control system for large-scale VAWTs is proposed. The operation of VAWTs can be divided into four states: start-up above the cut-in wind speed, operation under the rated wind speed, operation above the rated wind speed, and shut-down over the <b>cut-out</b> wind <b>speed.</b> To improve the power generation, self-starting and shut-down performance of straight-bladed VAWTs, two pitch control algorithms,the fixed pitch (in one revolution) and the variable pitch (in one revolution), are studied for the four states using the double multiple streamtube theory (DMST). It is found that the sinusoidal pitch algorithm produces better control results than the fixed pitch algorithm. Based on these studies, a pitch control system is defined. Two sets of data acquisition and processing devices are used, one for the rotating parts and the other for the stationary parts. Furthermore, based on the results of fatigue and ultimate strength analyses, a SHM system is proposed for the VAWT. Anemometers are installed to monitor the wind condition; a tachometer is installed to monitor the rotational speed and the azimuth angle; strains gauges are installed at the critical locations of fatigue and ultimate strength failure to monitor the local deformations; accelerometers are installed to monitor global deformations; and load cells are installed to monitor the service loads. Similar to the control system, two sets of data acquisition and processing devices are used. Synthesizing the SHM system, control system and power supply, a smart VAWT concept is defined. Such a smart VAWT has self-sensing, self-inspecting, self-control and self-power capabilities. Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringPh.

40|$|In {{the year}} 2000, 15 GW of wind power was {{installed}} throughout the world, producing 100 PJ of energy annually. This {{contributes to the}} total electricity demand by only 0. 2 %. Both the installed power and the generated energy are increasing by 30 % per year world-wide. If the airflow over wind turbine blades could be controlled fully, the generation efficiency and thus the energy production would increase by 9 %. Power Control To avoid damage to wind turbines, they are cut out above 10 Beaufort (25 m/s) on the wind speed scale. A turbine could be designed {{in such a way}} that it converts as much power as possible in all wind speeds, but then it would have to be to heavy. The high costs of such a design would not be compensated by the extra production in high winds, since such winds are rare. Therefore turbines usually reach maximum power at a much lower wind speed: the rated wind speed, which occurs at about 6 Beaufort (12. 5 m/s). Above this rated speed, the power intake is kept constant by a control mechanism. Two different mechanisms are commonly used. Active pitch control, where the blades pitch to vane if the turbine maximum is exceeded or, passive stall control, where the power control is an implicit property of the rotor. Stall Control The flow over airfoils is called attached when it flows over the surface from the leading edge to the trailing edge. However, when the angle of attack of the flow exceeds a certain critical angle, the flow does not reach the trailing edge, but leaves the surface at the separation line. Beyond this line the flow direction is reversed, i. e. it flows from the trailing edge backward to the separation line. A blade section extracts much less energy from the flow when it separates. This property is used for stall control. Stall controlled rotors always operate at a constant rotation speed. The angle of attack of the flow incident to the blades is determined by the blade speed and the wind speed. Since the latter is variable, it determines the angle of attack. The art of designing stall rotors is to make the separated area on the blades extend in such a way, that the extracted power remains precisely constant, independent of the wind speed, while the power in the wind at cut-out exceeds the maximum power of the turbine by a factor of 8. Since the stall behaviour is influenced by many parameters, this demand cannot be easily met. However, if it can be met, the advantage of stall control is its passive operation, which is reliable and cheap. Problem Definition In practical application, stall control is not very accurate and many stall-controlled turbines do not meet their specifications. Deviations of the design-power in the order of tens of percent are regular. In the nineties, the aerodynamic research on these deviations focussed on: profile aerodynamics, computational fluid dynamics, rotational effects on separation and pressure measurements on test turbines. However, this did not adequately solve the actual problems with stall turbines. In this thesis, we therefore formulated the following as the essential question: Does the separated blade area really extend with the wind speed, as we predict? To find the answer a measurement technique was required, which 1) was applicable on large commercial wind turbines, 2) could follow the dynamic changes of the stall pattern, 3) was not influenced by the centrifugal force and 4) did not disturb the flow. Such a technique was not available, therefore we decided to develop it. Stall Flag Method For this method, a few hundred indicators are fixed to the rotor blades in a special pattern. These indicators, called stall flags are patented by the Netherlands Energy Research Foundation (ECN). They have a retro-reflective area which, depending on the flow direction, is or is not covered. A powerful light source in the field up to 500 m behind the turbine illuminates the swept rotor area. The uncovered reflectors reflect the light to the source, where a digital video camera records the dynamic stall patterns. The images are analysed by image processing software that we developed. The program extracts the stall pattern, the blade azimuth angles and the rotor speed from the stall flags. It also measures the yaw error and the wind speed from the optical signals of other sensors, which are recorded simultaneously. We subsequently characterise the statistical stall behaviour from the sequences of thousands of analysed images. For example, the delay in the stall angle by vortex generators can be measured within 1 ° of accuracy from the stall flag signals. Properties of the Stall Flag The new indicators are compared to the classic tufts. Stall flags are pressure driven while tufts are driven by frictional drag, which means that they have more drag. The self-excited motion of tufts, due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, complicates the interpretation and gives more drag. We designed stall flags {{in such a way that}} this instability is avoided. An experiment with a 65 cm diameter propeller confirms the independence of stall flags from the centrifugal force and that stall flags respond quickly to changes in the flow. We developed an optical model of the method to find an optimum set-up. With the present system, we can take measurements on turbines of all actual diameters. The stall flag responds to separated flow with an optical signal. The contrast of this signal exceeds that of tuft-signals by a factor of at least 1000. To detect the stall flag signal we need a factor of 25 fewer pixels of the CCD chip than is necessary for tufts. Stall flags applied on fast moving objects may show light tracks due to motion blur, which in fact yields even more information. In the case of tuft visualisations, even a slight motion blur is fatal. Principal Results In dealing with the fundamental theory of wind turbines, we found a new aspect of the conversion efficiency of a wind turbine, which also concerns the stall behaviour. Another new aspect concerns the effects of rotation on stall. By using the stall flag method, we were able to clear up two practical problems that seriously threatened the performance of stall turbines. These topics will be described briefly. 1. Inherent Heat Generation The classic result for an actuator disk representing a wind turbine is that the power extracted equals the kinetic power transferred. This is a consequence of disregarding the flow around the disk. When this flow is included, we need to introduce a heat generation term in the energy balance. This has the practical consequence that an actuator disk at the Lanchester-Betz limit transfers 50 % more kinetic energy than it extracts. This surplus is dissipated in heat. Using this new argument, together with a classic argument on induction, we see no reason to introduce the concept of edge-forces on the tips of the rotor blades (Van Kuik, 1991). We rather recommend following the ideas of Lanchester (1915) on the edge of the actuator disk and on the wind speed at the disc. We analyse the concept induction, and show that correcting for the aspect ratio, for induced drag and application of Blade Element Momentum Theory all have the same significance for a wind turbine. Such corrections are sometimes made twice (Viterna & Corrigan, 1981). 2. Rotational Effects on Flow Separation In designing wind turbine rotors, one uses the aerodynamic characteristics measured in the wind tunnel on fixed aerodynamic profiles. These characteristics are corrected for the effects of rotation and subsequently used for wind turbine rotors. Such a correction was developed by Snel (1990 - 1999). This correction is based on boundary layer theory, the validity of which we question in regard to separated flow. We estimated the effects of rotation on flow separation by arguing that the separation layer is thick so the velocity gradients are small and viscosity can be neglected. We add the argument that the chord-wise speed and its derivative normal to the wall is zero at the separation line, which causes the terms with the chord-wise speed or accelerations to disappear. The conclusion is that the chord-wise pressure gradient balances the Coriolis force. By doing so we obtain a simple set of equations that can be solved analytically. Subsequently, our model predicts that the convective term with the radial velocity (vrvr/r) is dominant in the equation for the r-direction, precisely the term that was neglected in Snels analysis. 3. Multiple Power Levels Several large commercial wind turbines demonstrate drops in maximum power levels up to 45 %, under apparently equal conditions. Earlier studies attempting to explain this effect by technical malfunctioning, aerodynamic instabilities and blade contamination effects estimated with computational fluid dynamics, have not yet yielded a plausible result. We formulated many hypotheses, three of which were useful. By taking stall flag measurements and making two other crucial experiments, we could confirm one of those three hypotheses: the insect hypothesis. Insects only fly in low wind, impacting upon the blades at specific locations. In these conditions, the insectual remains are located at positions where roughness has little influence on the profile performance, so that the power is not affected. In high winds however, the flow around the blades has changed. As a result, the positions at which the insects have impacted at low winds are very sensitive to contamination. So the contamination level changes at low wind when insects fly and this level determines the power in high winds when insects do not fly. As a consequence we get discrete power levels in high winds. The other two hypotheses, which did not cause the multiple power levels for the case we studied, gave rise to two new insights. First, we expect the power to depend on the wind direction at sites where the shape of the terrain concentrates the wind. In this case the power level of all turbine types, including pitch regulated ones, will be affected. Second, we infer heuristically that the stalled area on wind turbine blades will adapt continuously to wind variations. Therefore, the occurrence of strong bi-stable stall-hysteresis, which most blade sections demonstrate in the wind tunnel, is lost. This has been confirmed by taking special stall flag measurements. 4. Deviation of Specifications The maximum power of stall controlled wind turbines often shows large systematic deviations from the design. We took stall flag measurements on a rotor, the maximum power of which was 30 % too high, so that the turbine had to be cut out far below the designed <b>cut-out</b> wind <b>speed.</b> We immediately observed the blade areas with deviating stall behaviour. Some areas that should have stalled did not and caused the excessive power. We adapted those areas by shifting the vortex generators. In this way we obtained a power curve that met the design much more closely and we realised a production increase of 8 %...|$|R
