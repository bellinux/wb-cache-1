The need for <b>control</b> <b>system</b> synthesis techniques is first established as a result of <b>control</b> <b>system</b> hardware trends of increasing <b>control</b> <b>system</b> component and <b>control</b> <b>system</b> manufacturing complexity. A <b>control</b> <b>system</b> synthesis methodology is them presented. The <b>control</b> <b>system</b> synthesis methodology follows four stages of system analysis, identification, decomposition, and functional assignment. A distributed architecture is also presented that allows <b>control</b> <b>system</b> architect to implement controllers in the absence of system design constraints and gradually shift workload distribution until a final design is established. Synthesis examples from the fields of active noise control and flow cytometry are presented to further define and validate the approach. The results of the applications of synthesis in each of these fields is the determination of a <b>control</b> <b>system</b> design that meets the specification criteria. In each case, the use of a synthesis methodology led to an uncommon solution. ...|$|R
