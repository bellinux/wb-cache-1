25|$|Several other {{regional}} varieties of <b>cheese</b> <b>with</b> fly larvae are produced in Europe. For example, goat-milk cheese {{is left to}} the open air until P. casei eggs are naturally laid in the cheese.

In addition, other regions in Europe have traditional cheeses that rely on live arthropods for ageing and flavouring, such as the German Milbenkäse and French Mimolette, both of which rely on cheese mites.|$|E

The origins of this cheese {{probably}} {{goes back to}} the Balkans or the Italian peninsula, but it has been significantly modified to Mexican tastes. It is made with skim milk, giving it a fairly firm texture, with a sweet/sour taste. In traditional markets, this cheese is often sold in baskets in which it has been molded, giving it the alternate name of queso de canasta. It is often served cold as part of an appetizer or snack tray. It is also found on sandwiches in most parts of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{sweetness}} of wines {{is determined by}} the amount of residual sugar left in the wine after the fermentation process. Wines can be bone dry (with the sugars fully fermented into alcohol), off-dry (with a hint of sweetness), semi-dry (medium-sweet) and dessert level sweetness (such as the high sugar content in Sauternes and Tokays). Sweet wines often need to be sweeter than the dish they are served with. Vintage brut champagne paired with sweet, wedding cake can make the wine taste tart and weak while the cake will have off flavors. In food pairings, sweetness balances spice and heat. It can serve as a contrast to the heat and alleviate some of the burning sensation caused by peppers and spicy Asian cuisine. It can accentuate the mild sweetness in some foods and can also contrast with salt such as the European custom of pairing salty Stilton <b>cheese</b> <b>with</b> a sweet Port. Sweetness in a wine can balance tartness in food, especially if the food has some sweetness (such as dishes with sweet & sour sauces).|$|E
500|$|The town {{is first}} {{recorded}} in Edward I's charter of the 13th century, as [...] "Kesewik". Scholars have generally considered {{the name to}} be from the Old English, meaning [...] "farm where cheese is made", the word deriving from [...] "cēse" [...] (<b>cheese)</b> <b>with</b> a Scandinavian initial [...] "k" [...] and [...] "wīc" [...] (special place or dwelling), although not all academics agree. George Flom of the University of Illinois (1919) rejected that derivation on the grounds that a town in the heart of Viking-settled areas, as Keswick was, would not have been given a Saxon name; he proposed instead that the word is of Danish or Norse origin, and means [...] "Kell's place at the bend of the river". Among the later scholars supporting the [...] "cheese farm" [...] toponymy are Eilert Ekwall (1960) and A D Mills (2011) (both Oxford University Press), and Diana Whaley (2006), for the English Place-Name Society.|$|E
