The minimum number of quantization levels and the minimum sample rate were derived for a digital voice channel. A sample rate of 6000 samples per second and lowpass filters with a 3 db cutoff of 2400 Hz are required for 100 percent sentence intelligibility. Consonant sounds are the first speech components to be degraded by quantization noise. A <b>compression</b> <b>amplifier</b> can be used to increase the weighting of the consonant sound amplitudes in the analog-to-digital converter. An expansion network must be installed at the output of the digital-to-analog converter to restore the original weighting of the consonant sounds.

In this work, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} the continuous calibration of the system using a pilot tone for both beam current dependency and thermal drift compensation, eliminating the need for thermoregulation.

40|$|This paper compares three {{single-ended}} distributed amplifiers (DAs) {{realized in}} an in-house InP/InGaAs double {{heterojunction bipolar transistor}} technology featuring an f(ind t) and f(ind max) larger than 200 GHz. The amplifiers use five or eight gain cells with cascode configuration and emitter follower buffering. Although the technology is optimized for mixed-signal circuits for 80 Gbit/s and beyond, DA results could be achieved that demonstrate the suitability of this process for the realization of modulator drivers. The results are documented with scattering parameter, eye diagram, and power measurements. This includes amplifiers featuring a 3 -dB bandwidth exceeding 80 GHz and a gain of over 10 dB. One of the amplifiers exhibits clear eyes at 80 Gbit/s with a gain of 14. 5 dB and a voltage output swing of 2. 4 V(ind pp) limited by the available digital input signal.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{hair cell}} (He) {{homeostasis}} and the <b>compression</b> wave cochlear <b>amplifier.</b> In {{the first part}} of the thesis, an accurate physiological treatment of a generic HC is conducted using a nonlinear distributed parameter physical model. This model includes the major ionic species (sodium, potassium and chlorine), defining the active cellular homeostatic properties. This model is used for transient response analysis. Resting state and transient responses of the HC model are in excellent agreement with the experimental literature. HCs in this model are most simply classified as instantaneous nonlinear transduction devices (i. e. their homeostatic mechanisms are not significantly frequency selective). A <b>compression</b> wave cochlear <b>amplifier</b> (CW-CA) is defined and modelled for the first time in the second part of the thesis. It is a physiological model that addresses three main elements present in the peripheral hearing circuit: cochlear mechanics, HC nonlinearity, and neurology. The actual physiological feedback mechanism of the CW-CA is realistic. A passive travelling wave (or other mechanical) vibration is the input to the system. Whilst the travelling wave wiggles the Organ of Corti, the compression wave pulsates it. The CW-CA is an alternative to the physiologically ill-defined locally active travelling wave cochlear feedback amplifier proposed by others. The new CW-CA model results in a cycle-by-cycle amplifier with nonlinear response. It is capable of assuming an infinite number of different operating states. The stable and first few amplitude-limited unstable states are significant in describing the operation of the peripheral hearing system. The CW-CA model can explain a large number of hearing phenomena. Several of these are investigated by means of a system analysis for both the stable and unstable cases. The system is studied and the tone, two-tone suppression and distortion product responses are found to align well with published results. Explanations for various mechanical, HC and neurological phenomena are discussed and presented. For example, previously poorly understood phenomena such as otoacoustic emissions and neural spontaneous rates are accounted for...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} stimulated Raman {{scattering}} on femtosecond pulse generation using a parabolic amplifier and a grating pair compressor are presented. We derive an explicit analytical {{form for the}} Stokes pulse evolution. We find that {{the evolution of the}} Stokes pulse can be divided into four regimes; small Gaussian Stokes pulse, small asymmetric Stokes pulse, signal depletion, and parabolic Raman pulse. In order to achieve efficient pulse <b>compression,</b> the parabolic <b>amplifier</b> should be operated in the small Stokes pulse regime where the signal pulse is not seriously distorted. We also derive an analytical expression to obtain a critical fiber length for the small Stokes pulse regime. The derived theory is applied to a realistic high power femtosecond pulse generation process through a split-step Fourier numerical simulation. The pulse compression results confirm that our derived critical fiber length leads to the highest peak power and shortest width of compressed pulse. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Beamforming is a {{necessary}} feature of high-capacity communication links operating at millimeter-wave (mm-wave) bands. Due {{to the advancement of}} CMOS-SiGe processes, mm- wave phased arrays can be manufactured at low cost with compact sizes. Transmit arrays are capable of improving the low-output power of silicon PAs through beam directivity. However, reaching (relatively) high efficiency while maintaining high-linearity for QAM waveforms poses a design trade-off. Receive systems suffer from low signal levels and potentially high-power jammers from neighboring links that are not spatially rejected. High linearity is essential for attaining the most efficient communication for both transmit and receive systems. High directivity of the system suggests the need for adaptive beam-scanning methods that do not require skilled labor to determine the location of the transmitter and receiver. The first portion of the dissertation discusses the performance of two phased-array architectures (LO and RF scanning) in presence of jammers. Analytical equations are derived which incorporate the antenna array geometry, array circuit architecture, and channel non-linearity. Secondly, a low-EVM (error-vector- magnitude) direct-conversion I/Q modulator is presented at Q-band in 120 nm SiGe process. The effect of various circuit errors on modulation quality is analyzed. In particular, a new analysis and closed-form equations are presented for the impact of I/Q path <b>compression,</b> power- <b>amplifier</b> AM-AM and AM-PM non-linearity on the system EVM. The second version of implemented Q-band I/Q upconverter incorporates two 12 -bit DACs and active mixers and is demonstrated to pre-distort a 16 -QAM through an off-chip power amplifier. Finally, a novel adaptive beam-steering I /Q receiver array is proposed and demonstrated in 45 nm CMOS SOI process. The proposed architecture allows auto- steering {{in the direction of the}} incident signal and supports modulated RF signal for high-data rate communication. The technique uses combined dynamics of coupled-oscillator arrays (COA) and coupled-phased locked loops (CPLL). This is the first demonstration of self- steering mechanism in a monolithic platfor...|$|R
30|$|The {{correlation}} between the input and feedback signal is performed on a modulated signal that precedes the training signal because the gain <b>compression</b> of the <b>amplifier</b> makes {{the accuracy of the}} correlation over the training signal suspect. In addition, because the envelope of the modulated signal will typically have a PDF such that it spends much of its time within the linear operating region of the amplifier, correlation using the modulated signal becomes more reliable. However, because the modulated signal is stochastic, the statistics of the modulated signal, as well as the size of the data block over which the correlation operation is performed will impact the accuracy of the delay estimation. In general, the accuracy of the estimation improves as the block size increases. Unfortunately, a larger block size requires more memory and takes longer to perform the estimate. The predistortion function cannot be exactly determined following the transmission of single training ramp and recalculation of the LUT coefficients thereafter. A series of training ramps will have to be transmitted. Although significant improvement in the ACPR of the amplifier should be observed even after a single training ramp, yet simulations have shown that the predistortion function can converge to a solution after only six training ramps.|$|R

Indeed, the amplifiers represent prototype test vehicles for a larger hybrid amplifier {{to be used as}} the final power stage in the transmitting chain of a T/R module of an L-band SAR antenna for earth observation. The amplifiers described in this paper exploit a discrete bar of a commercial 0. 35 mum pHEMT process as active device. The first amplifier, featuring a single discrete device, delivers 12 Watts with 56. 5 % PAE and 12. 3 dB gain at 2 dB <b>compression.</b> The second <b>amplifier</b> exploits 4 discrete pHEMT bars using input/output microstrip splitter/combiner and lumped wire bonding/ceramic MIM capacitor output matching networks.

Since it is a space application, these performances have been achieved with the required de-rating on break-down voltages, current densities and operating channel temperature. The latter has been evaluated by means of a 3 -D device model implemented in the framework of a finite differences numerical thermal simulator. In spite of the constraints due to space de-rating rules, the obtained output power densities are 1 W/mm and 0. 875 W/mm for the single-discrete and the 4 -discrete amplifiers, respectively, which represent a value very close to {{the state of the art}} for pHEMT processes...|$|R
40|$|Low cost cameras have proliferated in {{the last}} decade by taking {{advantage}} of the semiconductor technology (CMOS) used for the manufacture of computer processors and other integrated circuits. An image sensor is the key integrated circuit component in a camera that serves the role of faithfully recording the interaction of light with the world. Fabrication in a CMOS process allows a variety of passive and active components to be included with the image sensor. This manufacturing flexibility combined with increasing availability of computational power opens new possibilities for image sensing. This dissertation presents two CMOS image sensors intended not for direct image capture but to enable information processing tasks such as post-capture refocusing, depth mapping, feature extraction, optical flow, and velocimetry. A major portion of this thesis advances a recently introduced light sensing device, called angle sensitive pixel (ASP), which selectively responds to the local incident angle of light rays. Although the previously presented device enabled post-capture refocus and range finding by capturing light fields it was limited by its poor optical sensitivity due to its use of metallic gratings. In this work, I report on a new set of structures for angle detection with significantly better optical efficiency. For the fabrication of these devices, I develop a post-CMOS process flow for etching phase gratings at each pixel site and demonstrate its scalability on a 2. 6 mm x 2 mm sensor. Further, the merits of an image sensor whose pixels possess carefully tailored angular responses is demonstrated by building an array of angle sensitive pixels to compute Gabor transforms in the optical domain. Images are captured by the sensor in the form of transform coefficients that readily lend themselves to data <b>compression.</b> An <b>amplifier</b> and analog-to-digital converter that exploit the sparsity of the image transform coefficients are included on the chip. I show how measurements captured by the sensor can be used to recover either a low-resolution 4 D light field using fast, linear processing, or a high-resolution light field using sparsity-constrained optimization. In the latter part of this dissertation I present a CMOS image sensor for efficient computation of rotation parameters such as angular position and velocity. Unlike a conventional image sensors built using a rectangular grid of pixels, the array introduced here uses circular photodiodes arranged uniformly in polar coordinates to enable rapid image based measurements on revolving targets. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a comparative nonlinear analysis of low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) under different stimuli {{for use in}} astronomical applications. Wide-band Gaussian-noise input signals, together with the high values of gain required, make that figures of merit, such as the 1 dB compression (1 dBc) point of amplifiers, become crucial in the design process of radiometric receivers in order to guarantee the linearity in their nominal operation. The typical method to obtain the 1 dBc point is by using single-tone excitation signals to get the nonlinear amplitude to amplitude (AM-AM) characteristic but, as will be shown in the paper, in radiometers, {{the nature of the}} wide-band Gaussian-noise excitation signals makes the amplifiers present higher nonlinearity than when using single tone excitation signals. Therefore, in order to analyze the suitability of the LNA’s nominal operation, the 1 dBc point has to be obtained, but using realistic excitation signals. In this work, an analytical study of <b>compression</b> effects in <b>amplifiers</b> due to excitation signals composed of several tones is reported. Moreover, LNA nonlinear characteristics, as AM-AM, total distortion, and power to distortion ratio, have been obtained by simulation and measurement with wide-band Gaussian-noise excitation signals. This kind of signal can be considered as a limit case of a multitone signal, when the number of tones is very high. The work is illustrated by means of the extraction of realistic nonlinear characteristics, through simulation and measurement, of a 31 GHz back-end module LNA used in the radiometer of the QUIJOTE (Q U I JOint TEnerife) CMB experimen...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a great}} {{interest}} in obtaining laser pulses with a high average power as well as high pulse energies. Continuously pulsed systems face many problems to satisfy those requirements, independent on the amplifier concept. While many applications such as electron beam characterization and free-electron-laser seeding need high pulse energies at high repetition rates, they only need those laser pulses for a certain amount of time. Therefore, {{it is not necessary to}} run a laser system with continuous pulses at those parameters and a so-called burst mode might be sufficient and even essential in such cases. We report on a CPA-laser system, based on a large pitch fiber as a main-amplifier delivering bursts containing ultra-short, highly-energetic pulses. The burst rate is set to 20 Hz, while each burst contains 2000 pulses at a pulse-repetition-rate of 10 MHz and with a pulse-duration of 700 fs. Hence the duty cycle D is 0. 4 %. To achieve a homogeneous pulse energy level between 27 ?J and 31 ?J after the <b>compression,</b> the main <b>amplifier</b> is pumped with a very high power of 1. 6 kW in a burst-mode (D= 10 %). By using an acousto-optical modulator (AOM) after the main-amp fiber, the residual output before and after the burst is removed to suppress ASE and any underground-pulses around the amplified burst. The limitations that could be observed during this experiment were mainly due to mode instabilities, which were detectable even on a very short time scale of a few hundred ?s using a high speed camera...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, novel multi-section {{laser diodes}} based on quantum-dot {{material}} are designed and investigated which exhibit {{a number of}} advantages such as low threshold current density; temperature-insensitivity and suppress carrier diffusion due to discrete nature of density of state of quantum-dots. The spectral versatility {{in the range of}} 1. 1 µm – 1. 3 µm wavelengths is demonstrated through novel mode-locking regimes such as dual-wavelength mode-locking, wavelength bistability and broad tunability. Moreover, broad pulse repetition rate tuning using an external cavity configuration is presented. A high peak power of 17. 7 W was generated from the quantum-dot laser {{as a result of the}} tapered geometry of the gain section of the laser has led to successful application of such device for two-photon imaging. Dual-wavelength mode-locking is demonstrated via ground (?= 1180 nm) and excited (?= 1263 nm) spectral bands with optical pulses from both states simultaneously in the 5 -layer quantum-dot two-section diode laser. The widest spectral separation of 83 nm between the modes was achieved in a dual-wavelength mode-locked non-vibronic laser. Power and wavelength bistability are achieved in a mode-locked multi-section laser which active region incorporates non-identical QD layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy. As a result the wavelength can be electronically controlled between 1245 nm and 1290 nm by applying different voltages to the saturable absorber. Mode-locked or continuous-wave regimes are observed for both wavelengths over a 260 mA – 330 mA current ranges with average power up to 28 mW and 31 mW, respectively. In mode-locked regime, a repetition rate of 10 GHz of optical pulses as short as 4 ps is observed. Noticeable hysteresis of average power for different bias conditions is also demonstrated. The wavelength and power bistability in QD lasers are potentially suitable for flip-flop memory application. In addition, a unique mode-locked regime at expense of the reverse bias with 50 nm wavelength tuning range from 1245 nm to 1290 nm is also presented. Broad repetition rate tunability is shown from quantum-dot external cavity mode-locked 1. 27 µm laser. The repetition rate from record low of 191 MHz to 1 GHz from fundamental mode-locking was achieved. Harmonic mode-locking allows further to increase tuning up to 6. 8 GHz (34 th-order harmonic) from 200 MHz fundamental mode-locking. High peak power of 1. 5 W can be generated directly from two-section 4 mm long laser with bent waveguide at angle of 7 ° at 1. 14 GHz repetition rate without the use of any pulse <b>compression</b> and optical <b>amplifier.</b> Stable mode-locking with an average power up to 60 mW, corresponding to 25 pJ pulse energy is also obtained at a repetition frequency of 2. 4 GHz. The minimum time-bandwidth product of 1. 01 is obtained with the pulse duration of 8. 4 ps. Novel tapered quantum-dot lasers with a gain-guided geometry operating in a passively mode-locked regime have been investigated, using structures that incorporated either 5 or 10 quantum dot layers. The peak power of 3. 6 W is achieved with pulse duration of 3. 2 ps. Furthermore, the record peak power of 17. 7 W and transform limited pulses of 672 fs were achieved with optimized structure. The generation of picosecond pulses with high average power of up to 209 mW was demonstrated, corresponding to 14. 2 pJ pulse energy. The improved optical parameters of the tapered laser enable to achieve nonlinear images of fluorescent beads. Thus it is for the first time that QD based compact monolithic device enables to image biological samples using two-photon microscopy imaging technique.
