5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond <b>cutting</b> <b>process</b> relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
5|$|GTAW {{can be used}} {{on nearly}} all {{weldable}} metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method {{can be used on}} a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel <b>cutting</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
5|$|The process {{required}} {{a range of}} equipment. Some of this was protective equipment to allow the workforce and horses to operate safely on ice, including cork shoes {{for the men and}} spiked horse shoes. Early in the 19th century only ad hoc, improvised tools such as pickaxes and chisels were used {{for the rest of the}} harvest, but in the 1840s Wyeth introduced various new designs to allow for a larger scale, more commercial harvesting process. These included a horse-drawn ice cutter, resembling a plough with two parallel cutters to help in marking out the ice quickly and uniformly, and later a horse-drawn plough with teeth to assist in the <b>cutting</b> <b>process</b> itself, replacing the hand saw. By the 1850s, specialist ice tool manufacturers were producing catalogues and selling products along the east coast. There were discussions over the desirability of a circular cutting saw for much of the 19th century, but it proved impractical to power them with horses and they were not introduced to ice harvesting until the start of the 20th century, when gasoline engines became available.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} in {{manufacturing}} is to minimize production time, costs, energy and resources while maintaining or even improving performance. For this reason {{and because of}} the increase of highly engineered products with complex components and advanced materials, there is a high innovation pressure in the production industry. High performance in production and an increase in energy and resource efficiency can be realized by applying hybrid processes with an integration of additional physical processes and forms of energy into the processing zone. Starting from characteristics of components and materials, this paper shows a classification of hybrid <b>cutting</b> <b>processes</b> and presents a selection of applications at Fraunhofer IWU in detail. A strong focus is placed on hybrid <b>cutting</b> <b>processes</b> with superimposed axis movements and their potentials. The paper shows different kinds of hybrid <b>cutting</b> <b>processes</b> with their specific motivations such as the reduction of thermo-mechanical tool load, the realization of the machinability of advanced materials or the manufacturing of complex geometries. The examples for vibration-assisted <b>cutting</b> <b>processes</b> show that additional axial tool vibrations in the micron range {{have a positive impact on}} chip breaking and cutting forces and, consequently, on tool wear and tool. The considered media-assisted <b>cutting</b> <b>processes</b> clarified that the performance depends not only on optimum cutting speed, but also on the combination with the appropriate flushing strategy. Machining with superimposed axis movements enables high-precision manufacturing with new geometrical degrees of freedom. In general, hybrid <b>cutting</b> <b>processes</b> enhance performance for manufacturing and service life of highly engineered products...|$|R

25|$|During {{the diamond}} <b>cutting</b> <b>process,</b> the diamond cutter {{wants to get}} the {{heaviest}} diamond out of a rough stone. However, this can come {{at the cost of}} lowering cut grade. If a diamond is too deep, the carat weight will increase but result in a loss of brilliance due to light leakage. Diamond cutters have to contend with working a stone to its best finished form with the least amount of waste. This strategy depends {{on the quality of the}} stone and its final proportions. If two diamonds of equal weight are inspected there can be a noticeable difference in size when viewed from above; arguably the most important view. A well cut 0.90ct diamond for example could have the same width as a poorly cut 1.00ct diamond. This phenomenon is known as spread.|$|E

Upon downloading the participant's body scan, the illustrations were overlaid to provide an output manufacturing element.

The machines used by American Window Glass replaced glass blowers, but still used the same blowing and <b>cutting</b> <b>process</b> used in the 1880s—although the company was constantly working to make the process more efficient. Competitors such as American inventor Irving W. Colburn began working on a machine that produced window glass using a different process.

[...] Working with Colburn, Owens improved the window glass machine enough that it began being used for production in 1921. By 1926, Libbey-Owens had gained a window glass market share of 29 percent, while American Window Glass's share was 59 percent. During the 1920s, Pittsburgh Plate Glass also developed a new process for making window glass, creating even more competition in the window glass industry.|$|E

500|$|Until the mid-twentieth century, all peat {{was cut by}} hand. Although {{the effects}} of the {{industry}} on the ecology of the moors were serious, hand cutting mainly affected the surface of the moors.

Once the <b>cutting</b> <b>process</b> was mechanised, peat could be cut from a greater depth, and at a faster rate, resulting in less ability for the moors to recover. Mechanical peat cutting was introduced to the moors in the early 1960s, and the process was similar to hand cutting, in that the peat was extracted over a small area but to a considerable depth. More destructive to the ultimate regeneration of the moors was the introduction of peat milling in 1985, where a thin layer of peat was stripped from a wider area. Thus in 1910, around 56 tonnes per acre were extracted from [...] of the moors, whereas in 1985 the yield was 10 tonnes per acre over double that area. As early as the late 1960s, academics and conservation agencies expressed concerns that the moors had been so badly damaged by peat extraction and farming that they were not worth saving.|$|E

To this end, in metal <b>cutting</b> <b>processes,</b> {{it is necessary}} to reduce the specific cutting energy while, at the same time, precision requirements have to be ensured. Precision is critical in metal <b>cutting</b> <b>processes</b> because they often constitute the final stages of metalworking chains. This paper presents a method for the planning of energy-efficient machining processes based on numerical simulations. It encompasses two levels of planning flexibility: process adjustment and process design. At the process adjustment level, within the constraints of existing machines and tools, numerical simulations of orthogonal cutting are used to determine cutting parameters for increased energy efficiency. In this case, the model encompasses specific cutting energy, tool wear, chip geometry, and burr shape. These factors determine the energy and resources required for the chip formation itself, tool replacements, cleaning and deburring and with that the overall energy efficiency and precision. In the context of process design, with the ability to select machines, machine configurations, tools, and cooling systems, numerical simulations of <b>cutting</b> <b>processes</b> that incorporate machine and tool conditions are applied in the planning of energy-efficient machining.
