40|$|Greenhouses are a well-accepted {{containment}} {{strategy to}} grow and study genetically modified plants (GM) before release into the environment. Various <b>containment</b> <b>levels</b> are requested by national regulations to minimize GM pollen escape. We tested the amount of pollen escaping from a standard greenhouse, {{which can be used}} for EU containment classes 1 and 2. More specifically, we investigated the hypothesis whether pollen escape could be minimized by insect-proof netting in front of the roof windows, since the turbulent airflow around the mesh wiring could avoid pollen from escaping. We studied the pollen flow out of greenhouses with and without insect netting of two non-transgenic crops, Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) and Corn (Zea Mays). Pollen flow was assessed with Rotorod® pollen samplers positioned inside and outside the greenhouse’ roof windows. A significant proportion of airborne pollen inside the greenhouse leaves through roof windows. Moreover, the lighter pollen of Lolium escaped more readily than the heavier pollen of Maize. In contrast to our expectations, we did not identify any reduction in pollen flow with insect netting in front of open windows, even under induced airflow conditions. We conclude that insect netting, often present by default in greenhouses, is not effective in preventing pollen escape from greenhouses of wind-pollinated plants for containment classes 1 or 2. Further research would be needed to investigate whether other alternative strategies, including biotic ones, are more effective. ...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} 2002, an {{outbreak}} of a new viral respiratory illness, called SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus), occurred in China. The disease spread over Asia, North America, Europe and Africa. In response to the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated an international collaboratorion that included clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory investigations, and initiated efforts to control the spread of SARS. As in other countries, Belgium has been decided to establish biosafety guidelines and recommendations with particular emphasis on handling clinical specimens associated with SARS for research, production, and clinical laboratories. Taking into account that there is so far no SARS case reported in Belgium {{as well as in}} other countries in the world, and based on a scientific risk assessment related to the contained use of biological agents, the SARS-CoV was classified as a Risk Group 3 agent. In relation to the reported biosafety assessment, the SARS-CoV should be handled in appropriate biosafety <b>containment</b> <b>levels</b> to avoid laboratory-acquired infections and spread of the disease in the human population and the environment. Therefore, diagnostics activities with inactivated clinical specimens associated with SARS cases and with specimens originating in countries where SARS is documented but associated with SARS cases should be performed under Biosafety Level 2 (BSL- 2) conditions.

40|$|Effective {{containment}} of arthropod vectors {{of infectious diseases}} is necessary to prevent transmission of pathogens by released, infected vectors and to prevent vectors that escape from establishing populations that subsequently con-tribute to increased disease. Although rare, past releases illustrate what can go wrong and justify the need for guide-lines that minimize risks. An overview of recommendations for insectary facilities, practices, and equipment is provided, and features of four recently published and increasingly rigorous arthropod <b>containment</b> <b>levels</b> (ACLs 1 - 4) are sum-marized. ACL- 1 is appropriate for research that constitutes the lowest risk level, including uninfected arthropods or vectors that are infected with micro-organisms that do not cause disease in humans, domestic animals, or wildlife. ACL- 2 is appropriate for indigenous and exotic arthropods that represent a moderate risk, including vectors infected or suspected of being infected with biosafety level (BSL) - 2 infectious agents and arthropods that have been genetically modified in ways that do not significantly affect their fe-cundity, survival, host preference, or vector competence. ACL- 3 is recommended for arthropods that are or may be infected with BSL- 3 infectious agents. ACL- 3 places greater emphasis on pathogen containment and more re-stricted access to the insectary than ACL- 2. ACL- 4 is in-tended for arthropods that are infected with the most dangerous BSL- 4 infectious agents, which can cause life-threatening illness by aerosol or arthropod bite. Adherence to these guidelines will result in laboratory-based arthropod vector research that minimizes risks and results in important new contributions to applied and basic science.

40|$|To protect {{occupants}} of vehicles that leave {{the road from}} serious injuries, safe roadsides and medians are important. This report describes the way to make safe roadsides by means of obstacle-free zones, slopes, frangible poles, crash cushions and safety barriers. The research performed here aims to define criteria for places where safety devices are necessary. The research {{was carried out by}} means of a literature study including the national European standards. Furthermore, results from a questionnaire which was send to European institutes and ministries are described. This questionnaire contained for instance questions about national standards and/or criteria for use of safety barriers, and about accident data on motorways and express roads where safety barriers were involved. Data from European countries, but also from the United States were analysed to prepare a proposal for standards and strategies for EU-countries. The first issue of the report deals with the desirable width for the obstacle-free zone. Figures are presented about the only European research carried out in the Netherlands in the 1980 's. Figures for motorways, single-lane highways and local single-lanes are given. Based on the questionnaires, distances of obstacle-free zones from other European countries are mentioned. The second issue is a shoulder with safe slopes. Figures from the United States and European countries are discussed. The figures from the Netherlands are based on mathematical simulations and twelve full-scale tests on slopes with two gradients. If fixed objects are made to yield, the third issue, they can be placed in an obstacle-free zone without safety barriers. Different solutions are mentioned, such as slip base, plastic hinges, fracture elements or a combination of these. The fourth issue deals with crash cushions. If solitary rigid obstacles along a shoulder cannot be removed, they can be shielded with a crash cushion. Crash cushions are applied on motorways in mainly two different situations: in pointed areas at exits (often {{at the beginning of a}} safety barrier) and on shoulders to shield single objects. If crash cushions have been hit head-on, the vehicle usually remains within the shoulder so that it forms no danger for other traffic. In the case of a side impact, most types of crash cushions function like a safety barrier. Several European countries have their own, different types of crash cushions. In the concept of a safe road side (shoulders and medians), protection with safety barriers is the least safe solution (the last issue). An effectively functioning safety barrier prevents a vehicle from leaving the roadway and striking a fixed object or terrain feature that is considered more hazardous than the barrier itself. But a collision with a safety barrier is never free from the risk of injuries for the {{occupants of}} the colliding vehicle, nor is it for other road users. Requirements, CEN standards, <b>containment</b> <b>levels,</b> differences between steel and concrete barriers, and Dutch experiences with mathematical simulations are described. Proposals for motorway standards and strategies for EU countries are discussed. There are safety reasons for favouring wide obstacle-free zones. Based on information from many European countries a minimum width of 9 metres is recommended. Also is recommended to carry out accident investigations in different European countries to collect more data in order to take a more well-founded decision for the European situation. Slopes may be a part of an obstacle-free zone if vehicular manoeuvres are possible. This is the case with a gradient of at least 1 : 5 for high slopes (> 5 m) and 1 : 6 for lower slopes (< 2 m). Only fixed roadside objects can be located within an obstacle-free zone, if their support poles are frangible. If solitary rigid obstacles can not be relocated, protecting them with a crash cushion is the solution. In the report a decision model is described for determining the choice for shoulders and the median: obstacle-free or safety barriers. If a decision is made for a low containment level, steel barriers are in favour if only the installation costs are calculated. Taking into account other aspects, it depends on the local circumstances which type of barrier is to be preferred. Differences between countries are too great for a general statement. Also for express roads and single carriageways recommendations are given for the width of obstacle-free zones and the necessity for safety barriers. The single carriageway roads are in fact at the heart of the problem of obstacle accidents in Europe. There are many of such accidents because there are so many old roads. Unfortunately, accidents with "natural" obstacles such as trees, are widely spread so that dealing with them cannot be targeted at concentrations of dangerous locations. Apart from the erection of safety barriers, the driving speeds will have to be drastically reduced to increase the safety of such roads. Subsequently, this means that the road's function will be changed. A procedure has been described for identifying the locations and establishing priorities for those most requiring the placing of safety barriers. As a cost-benefit analysis, the "one million ECU test" of the European Commission can be applied. A strategy developed in America to deal with these problems, appears to be applicable also in Europe. It concerns for instance better accident monitoring, research, more attention (education, spreading information, good management), and greater budgets. (A...|$|E
