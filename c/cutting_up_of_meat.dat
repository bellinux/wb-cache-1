60|$|Great {{preparations}} {{were made}} by Amense for the banquet on the following week, for she had resolved that this should completely eclipse the entertainments of Nicotis. Ameres had, as usual, left everything in her hands, and she spared no expense. For {{a day or two}} previous large supplies of food arrived from the farm and from the markets in the city; and early {{on the morning of the}} entertainment a host of professional cooks arrived to prepare the dinner. The head cooks superintended their labors. The <b>meat</b> consisted <b>of</b> beef and goose, ibex, gazelle, and oryx; for although large flocks of sheep were kept for their wool, the flesh was not eaten by the Egyptians. There were, besides, great numbers of ducks, quails, and other small fowl. The chief cooks superintended the <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> the <b>meat</b> and the selection of the different joints for boiling or roasting. One servant worked with his feet a bellows, raising the fire to the required heat; another skimmed the boiling caldrons with a spoon; and a third pounded salt, pepper, and other ingredients in a large mortar. Bakers and confectioners made light bread and pastry; the former being made in the form of rolls, sprinkled at the top with carraway and other seeds. The confectionary was made of fruit and other ingredients mixed with dough, and this was formed by a skillful workman into various artistic shapes, such as recumbent oxen, vases, temples, and other forms. Besides the meats there was an abundance of all the most delicate kinds of fish.|$|R

50|$|The camping {{facility}} where EF70 57 is preserved closed in March 2013, and <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> the camping coaches commenced in February 2016.|$|R
50|$|Sonny had {{recently}} {{decided not to}} retaliate against Bumpas for the beating, but the murder and <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> Jones was apparently the final straw for Mosby. The murder is gruesome, but Sonny makes it {{appear to be an}} agricultural accident, rather than a revenge killing.|$|R
2500|$|Clarkson {{has stated}} {{he was deeply}} unhappy at Repton School, {{saying that he had}} been a [...] "suicidal wreck" [...] there, having {{experienced}} extreme bullying, which he alleged included: being thrown into a cold plunge pool, night time beatings, being forced to lick the lavatories clean, routine damage to his property, defecation in his tuck box, and the <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> his clothing.|$|R

50|$|Switchblade Symphony {{was formed}} in 1989 by {{composer}} Susan Wallace and vocalist Tina Root. The band's name refers to the <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> elements <b>of</b> classical music to mix them with harder sounds.|$|R
60|$|The {{news of this}} {{disaster}} was carried to Peshawar by a native Mussulman officer, who had been liberated, where it created great excitement. As all communication with Chitral had ceased, the assistant British agent at Gilgit called up the Pioneers; who marched into Gilgit, four hundred strong, on the 20th of March. On the 21st news was received <b>of</b> the <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> Ross's party, and it was naturally supposed that that of Edwards was also destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|Thom Jurek {{writes that}} [...] "While many intellectuals have made wild pronouncements about Marclay and his art - {{and it is}} art, make no mistake - writing all sorts of blather about how he strips the adult century bare by his <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> vinyl records and pasting them {{together}} with parts from other vinyl records, they never seem to mention that these sound collages of his are charming, very human, and quite often intentionally hilarious." ...|$|R
5000|$|On March 24, 2006, Curt Kirkwood polled fans at his MySpace page [...] with a {{bulletin}} that asked: [...] "Question for all ! Would the original line <b>up</b> <b>of</b> <b>Meat</b> Puppets interest anyone ? Feedback is good - {{do you want}} a reunion!?" [...] The response from fans was overwhelmingly positive within a couple of hours, leading to speculation <b>of</b> a full-blown <b>Meat</b> Puppets reunion in the near future. However, a post made by Derrick Bostrom on the official Meat Puppets site dismissed the notion.|$|R
50|$|Another {{circumstance}} {{under which}} diffusive bonding occurs is “scission”. Chain scission is the <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> polymer chains, {{resulting in a}} higher concentration of distal tails. The heightened concentration of these chain ends {{gives rise to a}} heightened concentration of polymer tails extending across the interface. Scission is easily achieved by ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of oxygen gas, which suggests that adhesive devices employing diffusive bonding actually benefit from prolonged exposure to heat/light and air. The longer such a device is exposed to these conditions, the more tails are scissed and branch out across the interface.|$|R
60|$|On {{reaching}} camp {{after the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> the elephant, as detailed {{in the last}} chapter, the negroes had set to work to roast and boil {{with a degree of}} vigour that would have surprised even the chefs de cuisine of the world's first-class hotels. Having gorged themselves to an extent that civilised people might perhaps have thought dangerous, they had then commenced an uproarious dance, accompanied by stentorian songs, which soon reduced them to the condition of beings who needed repose. Proceeding upon the principle of overcoming temptation by giving way to it, they at once lay down and went to sleep.|$|R
50|$|The cuisine of the Mariana Islands {{is largely}} made <b>up</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> dishes {{including}} pork, poultry, horse meat, and meat from other land mammals. Some popular land mammals consumed include bats, mice, rate and lizards. Most {{of the dishes}} on the islands are cooked in coconut oil. Naturally, the islands' surrounding waters make seafood another popular option. Some seafoods include sea cucumbers, whale's meat, and various fish. It is said that the Mariana Island's cuisine is heavily influenced by its neighbors Papuan, Hawaiian, and American cuisines.|$|R

2500|$|With {{respect to}} what he called [...] "the <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> the 'timing'", Lacan asked the question, [...] "Why make an {{intervention}} impossible at this point, which is consequently privileged in this way?" [...] By allowing the analyst's intervention on timing, the variable-length session removed the patient's—or, technically, [...] "the analysand's"—former certainty as {{to the length of}} time that they would be on the couch. When Lacan adopted the practice, [...] "the psychoanalytic establishment were scandalized"—and, given that [...] "between 1979 and 1980 he saw an average of ten patients an hour", it is perhaps not hard to see why: [...] "psychoanalysis reduced to zero", if no less lucrative.|$|R
60|$|The <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> {{the whole}} surface of this rounded {{mountain}} into little pools, now dry, of all sizes, from ten to about one hundred yards in circumference, {{is a very}} striking phenomenon. The streams flow in shallow transverse valleys, each passing through a succession of such pools, accompanying a step-like character of the general surface. The beds are stony, becoming more so where they enter the pools, upon several of the larger of which I observed curving ridges of large stones, radiating outwards on to their beds from either margin of the entering stream: more generally large stones were deposited opposite every embouchure.|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} {{remarkable}} about my introduction to Marie Marais. I did not rescue her from any attack {{of a wild}} beast or pull her out of a raging river in a fashion suited to romance. Indeed, we interchanged our young ideas across a small and extremely massive table, which, in fact, had once done duty as a block for the chopping <b>up</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat.</b> To this hour I can see the hundreds of lines running criss-cross upon its surface, especially those opposite to where I used to sit.|$|R
50|$|Mrs Nicoletis is {{behaving}} very nervously. She {{is killed}} by drinking poisoned brandy. Poirot focuses his attention {{now on the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> the rucksack. By careful study of the rucksack's design, he identifies an unusual corrugated base, and suggests to the police that the rucksack {{is part of an}} international smuggling operation. The rucksacks were sold to innocent students, and then used to transport drugs and gems. Mrs Nicoletis had been bankrolling the organisation, but was not the brain behind it. When the police visited Hickory Road on an unconnected issue, the murderer had cut up the rucksack to avoid its being found and removed light bulbs to avoid being recognised.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw his Majesty last night," [...] he told Rupert when he {{returned}} next morning, [...] "and he was very gracious. I hear that even Brousac, who brought the news of our defeat, was kindly received. I am told that he feels the <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> his guards very much. A grand entertainment, which was {{to have taken place}} this week, has been postponed, {{and there will be no}} regular fetes this autumn. I told his Majesty that I had brought you with me on parole, and the manner of your capture. He charged me to make the time pass pleasantly for you, and to bring you down to Versailles, and to present you at the evening reception.|$|R

When threatened, it flattens its body but does not attempt to bite. The blade-like teeth are thought adaptive for <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> shells <b>of</b> reptile eggs, and small lizards and frog eggs also consumed.|$|R
25|$|Salt {{is added}} to food, either by the food {{producer}} or by the consumer, as a flavor enhancer, preservative, binder, fermentation-control additive, texture-control agent and color developer. The salt consumption in the food industry is subdivided, in descending order of consumption, into other food processing, meat packers, canning, baking, dairy and grain mill products. Salt {{is added to}} promote color development in bacon, ham and other processed meat products. As a preservative, salt inhibits the growth of bacteria. Salt acts as a binder in sausages to form a binding gel made <b>up</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> fat, and moisture. Salt also acts as a flavor enhancer and as a tenderizer.|$|R
50|$|The Sugar Labour Commission, {{established}} {{to report on}} the repatriation of Pacific Islanders, took evidence in Bundaberg in April 1906. Frank Courtice, city organiser of the Bundaberg District Workers Union, said he supported the development of the State refinery system and the <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> plantations into smaller farms run by individual farmers. This concept was supported by Henry Albert Cattermull, overseer on Sunnyside, who said he had used white labourers since 1902, who were mostly local farmers' sons, and he found them more reliable than itinerant workers. Henry St George Caulfield also gave evidence in relation to the number of Islanders still in the district, which he estimated to be 1100. There had been some problems returning South Sea Islanders to their homes and others were keen to remain in Queensland.|$|R
5000|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} medical knowledge had been necessary {{to perform the}} dismemberment. At the inquest on 17 June, it was stated that: [...] "the division of the parts showed skill and design: not, however, the anatomical skill of a surgeon, but the practical knowledge of a butcher or a knacker. There was a great similarity between the condition, as regarded <b>cutting</b> <b>up,</b> <b>of</b> the remains and that of those found at Rainham, and at the new police building on the Thames Embankment." [...] The London Times of 5 June reported that [...] "in {{the opinion of the}} doctors the women had been dead only 48 hours, and the body had been dissected somewhat roughly by a person who must have had some knowledge of the joints of the human body." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{expression}} {{explores the}} merits of two options: [...] "Fish", which refers to the act of fishing; or [...] "cut bait", which refers to <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> pieces <b>of</b> bait into small, usable portions. A more modern, alternative interpretation of [...] "cut bait" [...] is understood to mean cutting one's fishing line. The meaning of the expression can vary, depending on which interpretation of [...] "cut bait" [...] is intended.|$|R
50|$|Japan's {{imports from}} the United States {{included}} both {{raw materials and}} manufactured goods. United States agricultural products were a leading import in 1990 (US$8.5 billion as measured by United States export statistics), made <b>up</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> (US$1.5 billion), fish (US$1.8 million), grains (US$2.4 billion), and soybeans (US$8.8 billion). Imports of manufactured goods were mainly {{in the category of}} machinery and transportation equipment, rather than consumer goods. In 1990 Japan imported US$11.1 billion of machinery from the United States, of which computers and computer parts (US$3.9 billion) formed the largest single component. In the category of transportation equipment, Japan imported US$3.3 billion of aircraft and parts (automobiles and parts accounted for only US$1.8 billion).|$|R
5000|$|Similarly to {{the cuisine}} of the Catalan cuisine, the spices used are few {{and not very}} varied, {{but they are the}} ones that give each product a {{distinct}} personality, and makes them different and flavourul. The spices normally used are black pepper, white pepper, paprika (in sobrassada), anise, cinnamon and salt. Some also add other typical Mediterranean spices such as thyme, rosemary and oregano.• White Botifarra, of grayish clear brown color, since it does not contain blood, it has the form of the ball that is used for the escudella. It is made <b>up</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> {{and other parts of the}} pig and it is surrounded by a fine membrane. It is generally eaten cooked, usually fried.|$|R

50|$|Police {{forensics}} {{searched the}} home of the victims. In May 2010 the NSW Crime Commission told Kathy Lin about the discovery of shoe prints that may match an ASICS sneaker, and police surveillance video later showed Robert Xie <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> boxes <b>of</b> ASICS sneakers and flushing them down a toilet. Forensics used Bloodstain pattern analysis on a stain on the floor of Xie's garage, leading the Crown prosecutor to allege that the stain was blood.|$|R
5000|$|Rogers made a guest {{appearance}} on The Real Housewives of D.C. in 2010 and in 2008 she demonstrated for another television crew her signature gift-giving style, which involved <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> sheets <b>of</b> dollar bills {{and using them}} as wrapping paper. [...] She says she started doing this years ago, as a [...] "cheap" [...] and [...] "unique" [...] way of wrapping inexpensive gifts while still complying with ethics rules governing gift-giving in Washington.|$|R
50|$|A head spade is an {{instrument}} used in whaling. Its {{name comes from}} being a spade specialized for cutting off the head a whale by chopping through the vertebrae {{at the base of}} the skull, though it is also used for <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> other parts <b>of</b> the whale.|$|R

50|$|The {{depiction}} of theft, murder, rape, abortion and torture appear amongst other immoral acts. The {{direct or indirect}} result of these acts is {{shown to be a}} tortuous afterlife. The {{depiction of}} hell includes the <b>cutting</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> bodies with a saw, burning bodies, and bondage with hot chains. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include charity and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. The reliefs also depict more harmonious topics including working together, agricultural methods, and planned parenthood. The pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, complete with description of samsara (the endless cycle of birth and death). Some of the panels have inscriptions which are believed to have been instructions to the carvers. Some panels remain unfinished, and this gives rise to the theory that the additional base was added before the temple had been completed.|$|R
