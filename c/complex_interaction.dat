5|$|Tropical Depression Ten {{formed from}} the <b>complex</b> <b>interaction</b> between an upper-level low, a {{tropical}} wave that produced Tropical Storm Ingrid, and {{the tail end}} of a cold front. By September17, the system produced widespread thunderstorm activity over The Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level low over the Florida Panhandle increased convection across the area, and on September18 the system began crossing Florida. Initially very disorganized, surface pressures gradually decreased across the region, with a weak low-pressure area developing on September19.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Hanna was a {{moderately}} strong tropical storm that affected the Gulf Coast and Southeastern {{regions of the}} United States. The tenth tropical cyclone and ninth named storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Hanna formed through the <b>complex</b> <b>interaction</b> of a surface trough, a tropical wave, and an upper-level low pressure system, a disturbance in the upper atmosphere. Designated a tropical depression at 0000UTC on September12, the storm remained disorganized throughout its duration, though it attained tropical storm status and a peak intensity of , with winds of 60miles per hour (100km/h). Hanna crossed extreme southeastern Louisiana, and made a second landfall along the AlabamaMississippi border.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this thesis, {{we develop}} and {{evaluate}} {{machine learning algorithms}} that can learn effectively from data with <b>complex</b> <b>interactions</b> and ambiguous labels. The need for such algorithms is motivated by such problems as protein-protein binding and drug activity prediction. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we focus on the problem of myopia. This problem arises when greedy learning strategies are applied to learn from data with <b>complex</b> <b>interactions.</b> We present skewing, our approach to alleviating myopia. We describe theoretical results and empirical results on Boolean data that show that our approach can learn effectively from data with <b>complex</b> <b>interactions.</b> We investigate the effects of various parameter choices on our approach, and the effects of dimensionality and class-label noise. We then propose and evaluate a variant that scales better to high-dimensional data. Finally, we propose and evaluate an extension that is able to learn from non-Boolean data with similar <b>complex</b> <b>interactions</b> as in the Boolean case...|$|R
5|$|One {{theory that}} has been {{advanced}} is that the devastation in Florence caused by the Black Death, which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in {{a shift in the}} world view of people in 14th-century Italy. Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife. It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art. However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the <b>complex</b> <b>interaction</b> of the above factors.|$|E
5|$|The <b>complex</b> <b>interaction</b> {{between a}} cold front, {{multiple}} tropical waves, {{and a broad}} {{area of low pressure}} in the wake of Nicole {{led to the formation of}} a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on October11 about 115mi (185km) southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios. The nascent cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Paula six hours later, briefly moving ashore the northeastern tip of Honduras early on October11 before re-emerging into the northwestern Caribbean. Amid a favorable environment, Paula intensified into a hurricane by 00:00UTC on October12 and attained peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) at 18:00UTC while maintaining an unusually small size. An increase in shear prompted a steady weakening trend as the system turned north and then east. Paula fell to tropical storm intensity early on October14, making landfall between Santa Lucia and Puerto Esperanza with winds of 65mph (100km/h). The system further weakened to a tropical depression early on October15 and degenerated into a remnant low by 12:00UTC. The remnant low quickly became diffuse, dissipating at 18:00UTC.|$|E

The Carl Zeiss Lotfernrohr 7, or Lotfe 7, was an advanced mechanical system similar to the Norden bombsight, although in form it was more similar to the Sperry S-1. It started replacing the simpler Lotfernrohr 3 and BZG 2 in 1942, and emerged as the primary late-war bombsight used in most Luftwaffe level bombers. The use of the autopilot allowed single-handed operation, and was key to bombing use of the single-crewed Arado Ar 234.|$|E
