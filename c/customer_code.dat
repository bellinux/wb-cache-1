5|$|For its Boeing fleet, {{excluding}} the Boeing 787, Japan Airlines' <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> is 46. As an example, a Boeing 777-200 ordered new by Japan Airlines bears the model name 777-246. Note that the -289 {{is owned by}} JAS before transferred to JAL.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the Boeing 707 and early Boeing 747 variants from BOAC, British Airways inherited a mainly UK-built fleet of aircraft when it was formed in 1974. The airline introduced the Boeing 737 and Boeing 757 into the fleet in the 1980s, followed by the Boeing 747-400, Boeing 767 and Boeing 777 in the 1990s. BA is now the largest operator of Boeing 747-400s, with 57 in its fleet. Prior to the introduction of the 787, when Boeing built an aircraft for British Airways, it was allocated the <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> 36, which appeared in their aircraft designation as a suffix, such as 737–436.|$|E
25|$|As of October 2017, the ANA {{passenger}} fleet (excluding subsidiaries) {{consists of}} the following aircraft: ANA's Boeing <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> is 81 for all Boeing aircraft except the Boeing 787.

2500|$|The base {{airframe}} for E-767 {{is that of}} a 767-200ER, Boeing designation 767-27C. (The [...] "7C" [...] designation is the Boeing <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> for the JASDF). The 767 airframe offers about 50 {{percent more}} floor space and nearly twice the volume of the 707 on which the E-3 is based. [...] The mission electronics equipment are installed in forward cabin to balance the weight with the rotodome mounted above the aft fuselage. [...] The aft cabin contains the crew's rest area, galley, and lavatory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this communication, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} the {{automatic}} extraction of numerical fields in handwritten documents. The approach exploits the known syntactic structure of the numerical field to extract, combined {{with a set of}} contextual morphological features to find the best label of each connected component. Applying an HMM based syntactic analyzer on the overall document allows to localize/extract fields of interest. Reported results on the extraction of zip codes, phone numbers and <b>customer</b> <b>codes</b> from handwritten incoming mail documents demonstrate the interest of the proposed approach. ...|$|R
5000|$|Boeing's <b>customer</b> <b>codes</b> used to {{identify}} specific options and livery specified by customers was started with the 707, and has been maintained through all Boeing's models. In essence the same system as used on the earlier Boeing 377, the code consisted of two digits affixed to the model number {{to identify}} the specific aircraft version. For example, Pan American World Airways was assigned code [...] "21". Thus, a 707-320B sold to Pan Am had the model number 707-321B. The number remained constant as further aircraft were purchased; thus, when Pan American purchased the 747-100, it had the model number 747-121.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, the Essential Services Commission of Victoria, Australia (ESC) {{released}} its {{changes to the}} Electricity <b>Customer</b> Metering <b>Code</b> and Procedure to implement its decision to mandate interval meters for 2.6 million Victorian electricity customers.|$|R
50|$|Mercury {{began by}} {{offering}} fixed-line facilities direct to businesses, residential and small business. Users {{could use the}} 'Mercury 2300' service via their existing BT phone line by dialling a '131' prefix followed by a ten-digit <b>customer</b> <b>code,</b> then the number which they wished to dial. At the time, many phones were manufactured with a dedicated 'Mercury Button' which allowed the prefix and <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> to be stored and then dialed with a single button press.|$|E
50|$|The Boeing <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> for Lion Air is GP, {{which appears}} in their {{aircraft}} designation as a suffix, such as 737-8GP and 737-9GPER.|$|E
50|$|For model {{numbers in}} the 707 to 777 range, the model number {{consists}} of an airplane's model number, for example 707 or 747, followed by a dash and three digits that represent the series within the model, for example 707-320 or 747-400. In aviation circles, a more specific model designation is sometimes used where the last two digits of the series designator are replaced by the two digit, alpha-numeric Boeing <b>customer</b> <b>code,</b> for example 747-121, representing a 747-100 originally ordered by Pan American World Airways (Boeing <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> 21) or 737-7H4, representing a 737-700 originally ordered by Southwest Airlines (Boeing <b>customer</b> <b>code</b> H4). Unlike other models, the 787 uses a single digit to designate the series, for example 787-8. This convention was followed {{in the development of}} the newest version of the 747, the 747-8, along with the 737 MAX and 777X series.|$|E

She helped <b>customers</b> with <b>coding</b> and ensured that their problems would run on the [...] "breadboard" [...] and [...] "prototype" [...] systems.|$|R
50|$|Horizontal {{partitioning}} (also see shard) involves putting different rows {{into different}} tables. For example, <b>customers</b> with ZIP <b>codes</b> less than 50000 {{are stored in}} CustomersEast, while <b>customers</b> with ZIP <b>codes</b> {{greater than or equal}} to 50000 are stored in CustomersWest. The two partition tables are then CustomersEast and CustomersWest, while a view with a union might be created over both of them to provide a complete view of all customers.|$|R
