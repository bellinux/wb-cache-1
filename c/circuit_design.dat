5|$|In VLSI {{integrated}} <b>circuit</b> <b>design,</b> if {{a collection}} of modules must be connected by wires that can each bend at most once, then again there are two possible routes for the wires, {{and the problem of}} choosing which of these two routes to use, {{in such a way that}} all wires can be routed in a single layer of the circuit, can be solved as a 2-satisfiability instance.|$|E
5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} digital <b>circuit</b> <b>design</b> theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E
5|$|In electronics, {{magnetic}} core memory, radar, single electron transistors, and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers. Harold Eugene Edgerton {{was a pioneer}} in high speed photography and sonar. Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital <b>circuit</b> <b>design</b> theory. In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography. At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, Atari began work on a driving game, an idea founder Nolan Bushnell had wanted to do since the company was {{initially}} founded in June 1972 before it was shelved in favor of Pong. The design work itself was handled by Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari and had previously handled the prototype design of Gotcha. Larry Emmons developed the circuits to control the car itself in the game, creating the feel of braking, acceleration, and movement. Emmons also used integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)— in his <b>circuit</b> <b>design</b> to store graphical data such as the tracks, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used. This {{is believed to be}} the first use of integrated circuit-based memory in an arcade game, and ROMs thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. The mechanical designs for the game, including the steering wheel, pedal, and gear shift controllers, were developed by Eigen Systems, located in the same building as Cyan and founded by ex-coworkers of the Cyan founders Emmons and Steven Mayer. At one point, the game's design included a small printer that would print high scores when achieved, but this was removed prior to the final design.|$|E
25|$|The main {{contribution}} of Alpha to the microprocessor industry, {{and the main}} reason for its performance, was not so much the architecture but rather its implementation. At that time (as it is now), the microchip industry was dominated by automated design and layout tools. The chip designers at Digital continued pursuing sophisticated manual <b>circuit</b> <b>design</b> {{in order to deal with}} the overly complex VAX architecture. The Alpha chips showed that manual <b>circuit</b> <b>design</b> applied to a simpler, cleaner architecture allowed for much higher operating frequencies than those that were possible with the more automated design systems. These chips caused a renaissance of custom <b>circuit</b> <b>design</b> within the microprocessor design community.|$|E

25|$|In {{integrated}} <b>circuit</b> <b>design,</b> physical {{design is}} a step in the standard design cycle which follows after the <b>circuit</b> <b>design.</b> At this step, circuit representations of the components (devices and interconnects) of the design are converted into geometric representations of shapes which, when manufactured in the corresponding layers of materials, will ensure the required functioning of the components.
