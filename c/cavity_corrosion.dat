40|$|BACKGROUND: Stainless steel {{brackets}} {{are composed of}} various metal that may corrode in oral <b>cavity.</b> <b>Corrosion</b> {{is caused by the}} release of metal ions such as chromium, nickel, and iron. The release of metal ions can cause adverse effects such as toxicity, allergic, and mutagenicity. To evaluate the biocompatibility of stainless {{steel brackets}}, micronucleus assay as one of genotoxicity assay is used in this study. To determine the differences and the correlation of metal ions release and genotoxic activity among three brand stainless steel brackets. METHODS: Three brands of brackets were immersed in artificial saliva for 672 hours and the release of ion chromium, nikel and iron were examined. The cytokynesis block micronucleus assay (CBMN) using lymphocytes was performed as well. RESULTS: The highest metal releasing were nickel, cromium, iron, respectively (30. 5, 27. 2, 23. 4 ppb). There was a significant differences between total nickel and iron ion release among three brand brackets (p= 0. 04, p= 0. 02). Genotoxicity of metal ion released was correlated with durration of immersion brackets (p= 0. 01). Genotoxicity was significant correlated with the release of chromium (p= 0. 03) and nickel (p= 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Genotoxicity of stainless steel brackets was influenced by duration of immersion but not influenced by brand brackets...|$|E
40|$|Hydrostatic {{pressure}} {{effects on}} pitting initiation and propagation in X 70 steel are investigated by evaluating metastable pitting probability using electrochemical methods and immersion corrosion tests in containing chlorine ion solution. Potentiodynamic tests indicated that hydrostatic pressure can decrease the breakdown potential {{and lead to}} a reduced transpassivity region. Metastable test results revealed that hydrostatic pressure can increase metastable pitting formation frequency and promote stabilization of metastable pitting growth. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results indicate that Hydrostatic pressure decreases the charge transfer resistance and increases the dissolution rate within the <b>cavities.</b> <b>Corrosion</b> test results also indicated that pitting initiation and propagation are accelerated by hydrostatic pressure. Result validity was verified by evaluating metastable pitting to predict pitting corrosion resistance...|$|R
40|$|The focused {{ion beam}} {{technique}} was employed to investigate the atmospheric corrosion morphology of AZ 91 D. It {{was found that the}} α matrix of the alloy was preferentially corroded in the areas adjacent to intermetallic phases. The most interesting finding was that the corrosion products in <b>corrosion</b> <b>cavities</b> were pelletlike, which has never been reported before...|$|R
40|$|In the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seed, embryos {{grow and}} develop within the <b>corrosion</b> <b>cavity</b> of the megagametophyte, a maternally derived haploid tissue, which houses the {{majority}} of the storage reserves of the seed. In the present study, histochemical methods and quantification of the expression levels of the programmed cell death (PCD) and DNA repair processes related genes (MCA, TAT-D, RAD 51, KU 80, and LIG) were used to investigate the physiological events occurring in the megagametophyte tissue during embryo development. It was found that the megagametophyte was viable from the early phases of embryo development until the early germination of mature seeds. However, the megagametophyte cells in the narrow embryo surrounding region (ESR) were destroyed by cell death with morphologically necrotic features. Their cell wall, plasma membrane, and nuclear envelope broke down with the release of cell debris and nucleic acids into the <b>corrosion</b> <b>cavity.</b> The occurrence of necrotic-like cell death in gymnosperm embryogenesis provides a favourable model for the study of developmental cell death with necrotic-like morphology and suggests that the mechanism underlying necrotic cell death is evolutionary conserved...|$|R

Exchange current densities and transfer coefficients for oxygen reduction on Alloy C- 22 and carbon steel for {{the range of}} temperature 25 - 95 degrees Celsius have been determined.

40|$|Abstract: Electrochemical {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} epoxy aluminum coating immersed in 3. 5 %NaCl solution was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). SEM {{was also used}} to analyze the surface images of coating, and the failure mechanism was discussed as well. The experimental results showed that corrosive species can penetrate into coatings and reach the coating/substrate interface promptly, causing the decrease of electro-resistance and the beginning of electrochemical corrosion at the coatings/metal interface. The coating was compact and continuous at beginning, while the blisters and <b>cavities</b> appeared after <b>corrosion,</b> which were formed osmotic pressure created by corrosion species penetration. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the thermal}} testing {{is carried out}} by using the resin {{structure}} with artificial cavity made by three-dimensional printer. There are some non-destructive testing method such as the ultrasonic testing method, the thermal testing method and so on. It is known {{that the size of}} defect {{can be found at the}} target point by using the ultrasonic testing method. On the other hand, the thermal testing method has a characteristic that the location of the defect, the <b>cavity,</b> the <b>corrosion</b> and so on, can be found on the target surface. However, the shape of defect can’t be correctly found by only using the heat image on target surface. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to construct a system that we can confirm the relationship between size of defect and the observed temperature data, i. e., the heat image and the time history of observed temperature data, by using the resin structure with artificial cavity. The resin structure is made by the three dimensional printer, and there is an advantage that the size and the shape of cavity can be changed freely by using the three dimensional printer...|$|R
40|$|A {{corrosion}} sensor {{newly developed}} by the Swiss Society for Corrosion, modified for a potential application in the oral cavity, was tested in vitro. By measuring the impedance with a special sensor {{in the size of}} a bur handpiece, it allows a quick determination of the corrosion resistance. For the evaluation of the method, measurements were done on six conventional dental alloys (two precious alloys, one Pd-based alloy and three non-precious alloys) which had been tested in crevice corrosion by the authors in an earlier stage. Qualitatively the results are quite in concordance with the ones got with the usual tests. On the base of the present results the use directly in the oral <b>cavity</b> of this <b>corrosion</b> test method appears to be very promising...|$|R
40|$|USA-SRB Element is {{responsible}} for the assembly and refurbishment of the non-motor components of the SRB as part of Space Shuttle. Thrust Vector Control (TVC) frames structurally support components of the TVC system located in the aft skirt of the SRB (Solid Rocket Booster). TVC frames are exposed to the seacoast environment after refurbishment and, also, to seawater immersion after splashdown, and during tow-back to CCAFS-Hangar AF refurbishment facilities. During refurbishment operations it was found that numerous TVC frames were experiencing internal corrosion and coating failures, both from salt air and seawater intrusions. Inspectors using borescopes would visually examine the internal cavities of the complicated aluminum alloy welded tubular structure. It was very difficult for inspectors to examine cavity corners and tubing intersections and particularly. {{to determine the extent of}} the corrosion and coating anomalies. Physical access to TVC frame internal <b>cavities</b> for <b>corrosion</b> removal and coating repair was virtually impossible, and an improved method using a Liquid (water based) Vapor-phase Corrosion Inhibitor (LVCI) for preventing initiation of new corrosion, and mitigating and/or stopping existing corrosion growth was recommended in lieu of hazardous paint solvents and high VOC/solvent based corrosion inhibitors. In addition, the borescopic inspection method used to detect corrosion, and/or coating anomalies had severe limitations because of part geometry, and an improved non-destructive inspection (NDI) method using Neutron Radiography (N-Ray) was also recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} a-Al-bronze (Cu- 7 %A 1) was studied in 3. 4 % NaC 1 solution {{for extended periods}} of time using x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, optical and scanning electron microscopy, and electrochemical polarization measurements. Corrosive attack occurs very early leading to general corrosion and pit nucleation, coalescence, growth, and eventual merging of neighboring pits together to give multiple trough-like <b>cavities.</b> The <b>corrosion</b> products which form under free corrosion conditions appear as a duplex film with an inner adherent layer of A 1203 and an outer layer of Cu 20, Cu 2 (OH) 3 C 1, and Cu(OH) C 1. The x-ray measurements revealed several significant findings: (i) the Cu (l l l) plane corrodes preferentially, (it) Cu 20 forms very early under open-circuit conditions and grows progressively with time. Conversely Cu(OH) C 1 was detected microscopically on the corroded surface after 9 days and by x-ray diffraction after much longer times, (iii) CuC 1 forms only at anodic potentials, considerably higher than the free corrosion potential. Indeed, it was not detected under free corrosion conditions, and (iv) the composition ofthe corrosion products which were retained on the alloy surface is quite different from those which spalled off the corroding surface. Copper-base alloys {{have a long history of}} service in marine nvironments. In general, they exhibit an attractive combination of properties, e. g., good machinability, goo...|$|R
40|$|The {{concurrent}} flow of two immiscible liquids (Oil-Water) in pipelines is usually encountered in oil production and pipeline transportation. Water {{is present in}} crude oil and separation facilities. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effect of pipe deformations caused by <b>corrosion</b> <b>cavity</b> and scale sediments build-up on the water cut at the pipe wall. An extensive literature review survey on both experimental and numerical investigation has been performed on oil-water flows in horizontal pipelines. Two multiphase flow models (Mixture and Eulerian models) were formulated and presented with the corresponding conservation equations. The three major turbulent modelling approaches to capture turbulent phenomenon were described; Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations (RANS) was selected as an appropriate turbulence model for turbulent flow simulations. Preliminary runs were performed {{for two of the}} validation cases in order to estimate the pipe entrance length and establish the parameters of the reference state corresponding to pure oil and oil-water. Validation studies were performed to choose the appropriate multiphase model. The results showed that Eulerian multiphase model was fairly more accurate and acceptable in comparison to the mixture model. A further Validation studies was also conducted to select the droplet diameter, whereby appropriate droplet diameter of 3 × 10 - 5 mm was selected. The <b>corrosion</b> <b>cavity</b> and scale sediments were modelled with rectangular cavity and cubical obstacle respectively oriented perpendicular to the pipe flow. The model geometries and computational mesh were generated with GAMBIT (2. 4) and exported to FLUENT (6. 3). The simulation was conducted for input water volume fraction of 0. 1 and 0. 3, Reynolds number of 18, 500 and 22, 000. Configurations of 16 cases were considered because of computational requirements. Numerical simulation of oil-water pipe flow with <b>corrosion</b> <b>cavity</b> and cubical obstacle were performed and analyses of flow features have been described. Effect of aspect ratio, input water volume fraction and Reynolds number on the amount of water volume fraction at the pipe wall, cavity and around cubical obstacle have been analysed. Quantitative data of maximum and minimum water volume fractions in the pipe, cavity walls and around the cubical obstacle have been computed and compared. The results indicated that around the cavity, turbulence was produced resulting to recirculation, mixing and separation of water from oil. Similarly, oil-water separate from the front, sidewalls and behind the cubical obstacle which lead to formation of different types of vortices. It was observed that water segregated faster with increase in input water fraction and decrease in Reynolds number. However, more water settled to the bottom of deep cavity than shallow cavity and the area of pipe wall wetted by water reduced as the Reynolds number increases. Parametric study on cavity flow has been conducted with the new adjusted turbulent viscosity with damping functions. The results showed improvement on water volume fraction distribution behaviour in pipe and cavity wall surfaces. Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF...|$|R
50|$|Seed {{maturity}} {{cannot be}} predicted accurately from cone flotation, cone moisture content, cone specific gravity; but {{the province of}} B.C. found embryo occupying 90% + of the <b>corrosion</b> <b>cavity</b> and megagametophyte being firm and whitish in colour are the best predictors for white spruce in B.C., and Quebec can forecast seed maturity some weeks in advance by monitoring seed development in relation to heat-sums and the phenological progression of the inflorescence of fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium L.), an associated plant species. Cone collection earlier than one week before seed maturity would reduce seed germination and viability during storage. Four stages of maturation were determined by monitoring carbohydrates, polyols, organic acids, respiration, and metabolic activity. White spruce seeds require a 6-week post-harvest ripening period in the cones to obtain maximum germinability, however, based on cumulative degree-days, seed from the same trees and stand showed 2-week cone storage was sufficient.|$|R
40|$|A {{predictive}} and self-consistent {{mathematical model}} incorporating the electrochemical, chemical and ionic migration processes characterizing the propagation stage of crevice and pitting corrosion in metals is described. The model predicts the steady-state solution chemistry and electrode kinetics (and hence metal penetration rates) within an active <b>corrosion</b> <b>cavity</b> {{as a function}} of the many parameters on which these depend, such as external electrode potential and crevice dimensions. The crevice is modelled as a parallel-sided slot filled with a dilute sodium chloride solution. The cavity propagation rates are found to be faster in the case of a crevice with passive walls than one with active walls. The distribution of current over the internal surface of a crevice with corroding walls can be assessed using this model, giving an indication of the future shape of the cavity. The model is extended to include a solid hydroxide precipitation reaction and considers the effect of consequent changes in the chemical and physical environment within the crevice on the predicted corrosion rates. In this paper, the model is applied to crevice and pitting corrosion in carbon steel...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} {{diagnostic}} criteria useful in hunting lesions identification {{is a new}} branch of investigation. Though recently {{there has been an}} increase in studies focused on this issue, no experimental works exist that analyze marks left by backed, morphologically standardized lithic projectiles like those used by the hunter-gatherers that peopled a large part of Europe during the Late Glacial. As such, this paper aims to provide comparison data for identifying archaeological Late Epigravettian projectile impact marks. At the same time, the potential of 3 D scanning microscopy to distinguish hunting injuries from other taphonomic marks is assessed. The morphometric analyses, based on the descriptive criteria developed from other recent studies, highlight the presence of peculiar features of experimentally produced drag and puncture marks. These data are interpreted {{as a result of the}} specific design of Late Epigravettian lithic projectiles. The outcomes of 3 D digital analysis confirm the crucial role of this methodological approach in taphonomic study, offering new clues in PIMs (Projectile Impact Marks) archaeological identification and distinction from cut marks, carnivore tooth marks and <b>corrosion</b> <b>cavities...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous seep carbonate boulders {{from the}} Russian Arctic island of Novaya Zemlya, collected in 1875 by A. E. Nordenskiöld during his expedition to Siberia. The carbonates are significantly depleted in heavy carbon isotopes (δ 13 C values {{as low as}} ca. − 40 ‰) and show textures typical for carbonates formed {{under the influence of}} hydrocarbons, such as fibrous carbonate cements and <b>corrosion</b> <b>cavities.</b> The rocks contain index fossils of Late Oxfordian–Early Kimmeridgian, Late Tithonian (Jurassic) and latest Berriasian–Early Valanginian (Cretaceous) age. The fossil fauna is species rich and dominated by molluscs, with subordinate brachiopods, echinoderms, foraminifera, serpulids and ostracods. Most of the species, including two chemosymbiotic bivalve species, likely belong to the ‘background’ fauna. Only a species of a hokkaidoconchid gastropod, and a possible abyssochrysoid gastropod, can be interpreted as restricted to the seep environment. Other seep faunas with similar taxonomic structure are suggestive of rather shallow water settings, but in case of Novaya Zemlya seep faunas such structure might result also from high northern latitude...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives : All {{elements}} {{existing in}} orthodontic alloys can {{be released to}} the oral <b>cavity</b> as <b>corrosion</b> products; therefore, they can accumulate in body tissues after systemic absorption. Among body tissues that can be evaluated for systemic absorption of nickel, {{in this study we}} used hair strands, because if nickel is absorbed systematically, it would accumulate in these strands over time. Furthermore, hair sampling is a non-invasive method, so the main aim of this study was the evaluation of nickel ions release into the hair strands of fixed orthodontic patients compared with the control group in a 4 -month duration. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, the test group included 24 female patients between 12 - 20 years of age that were going to begin fixed orthodontic treatment. The control group consisted of their sisters in the same age range, who volunteered to participate in this study. Initial hair samples were taken from both groups at the beginning the study and immediately before setting up the fixed appliances in test group. The samples were taken from three different scalp sites including; frontal, vertex, and occipital areas. After 16 weeks, hair samples were taken from approximately the same scalp areas in both the groups. The samples were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer and data analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. Results: This study showed that there were significant differences in nickel levels before and after study for case (P = 0. 004) and control groups (P = 0. 012). The mean nickel concentration after four months was 0. 382 ± 0. 36 μg/g for controls and 0. 673 ± 0. 38 μg/g for the case group, which was significantly different (P = 0. 002). Conclusion: The hair nickel concentrations significantly increased after insertion of fixed orthodontic appliances as compared with the control group...|$|R
40|$|Process {{industries}} have vast networks of pipelines. Those pipelines {{are prone to}} external and internal corrosion. Usually environmental conditions and other operating factors cause corrosion. Although there are various ways to protect corrosion but it is inevitable. It may lead to uniform material loss of the wall thickness or pitting, which corresponds to the local wall thickness reduction or general form of cavitations. <b>Corrosion</b> <b>cavity</b> can appear as simplified or in other general form as shown in Fig. 1. These corrosion defects can appear externally as well as internally. Corrosion reduces strength of pipe leading to risk on production, facilities and even human life. To avoid failures due to corrosion and ensure safe and continued operation, corrosion has to be detected and measured. The strength of these corroded areas has to be determined to ensure safety of pipeline, facilities and human life.
