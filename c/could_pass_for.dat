25|$|The NAACP {{sent its}} Field Secretary, Walter F. White, from New York City to Elaine in October 1919 to {{investigate}} events. White was of mixed, majority-European ancestry; blond and blue-eyed, he <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> white. He was granted credentials from the Chicago Daily News. He gained {{an interview with}} Governor Charles Hillman Brough, who gave him a letter of recommendation for other meetings with whites, {{as well as an}} autographed photograph.|$|E
25|$|Two boys, Kevin and Tommy, {{have become}} {{convinced}} (mostly Kevin) {{that the two}} barbers who run the unpopular and obscure old barbershop in town are actually vampires. Despite failing most vampire tests (such as disliking garlic, crossing running water, crosses etc.) the two break into the barbershop's basement. They are captured and the truth revealed: neither barber is a vampire. Rather, they harvest blood for their resident vampire; vampires have changed over the centuries into gigantic things more akin to 1000-pound leeches than anything that <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> a human. They bargained with the barber guild: if the guild would hide and feed them, then the barbers {{would be allowed to}} harvest a sort of purified blood which grants partial immortality to humans. The two are forcibly inducted into this grim fraternity.|$|E
25|$|Seeking {{to atone}} for his past wrongdoings, Matsuōmaru plots to save Kan Shūsai's life, {{at the cost of}} that of his own son, Kotarō. He sends Kotarō to the school, where Genzō and Tonami decide he is the only one at the school whose head <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> Kan Shūsai's. This scene {{is a classic example of}} the {{conflict}} between giri (honor, fealty) and ninjō (human compassion), as Genzō and Tonami sacrifice an innocent boy to save their master's son. When the sound of Genzō's sword striking off Kotarō's head is heard from offstage, Matsuōmaru strikes a distinctive Matsuō mie pose, expressing his suppressed anguish. He then departs with the head in a box, to identify it for Shihei as Kan Shūsai's head, pretending to have done the deed and thus saving Kan Shūsai's life.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to a special request for an explosive that could be smuggled through Japanese checkpoints by Chinese guerrillas, Kistakowsky mixed HMX, a non-toxic explosive produced as a by-product of the RDX process, with flour to create [...] "Aunt Jemima", after a brand of pancake flour. This was an edible explosive, which <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> regular flour, and even be used in cooking.|$|E
500|$|... "Still Into You" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a power pop, pop rock and new wave song with skeletal guitar lines similar to that of the artist Gotye, alternative dance glockenspiel and synths. It lacks a heavy guitar riff, which Paramore is typically known for, and is replaced by a back beat on the drums. James Montgomery at MTV compared the song to the new wave band The Cars, saying it <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> one of their B-sides.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{agreement}} did not stipulate different treatment for Poles who were ethnically Jewish, many Jews feared that {{the agreement}} would not be honored in their case. In fact, the Nazis conducted a [...] "medical examination" [...] at the Pruszków internment camp, in order to [...] "catch out" [...] Jews from among Warsaw's refugees. As a consequence, {{a large number of}} the Jews who were still in Warsaw {{at the time of the}} uprising, decided to remain in hiding rather than join the non-Jewish civilians leaving the city. According to memoirs from the period, the choice often came down to whether a particular person [...] "looked Aryan" [...] and <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> a non-Jewish Pole.|$|E

500|$|One {{of the few}} {{supporters}} of Lazenby amongst the critics was [...] Alexander Walker in the London Evening Standard who said that [...] "The truth is that George Lazenby is almost as good a James Bond as the man referred to in his film as 'the other fellow'. Lazenby's voice is more suave than sexy-sinister and he <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> the other fellow's twin on the shady side of the casino. Bond is now definitely all set for the Seventies." [...] Judith Crist of New York Magazine also found the actor a strong point of the movie, stating that [...] "This time around there's less suavity and a no-nonsense muscularity and maleness to the role via the handsome Mr. Lazenby".|$|E
500|$|However, {{the show}} did {{come in for}} some criticism. San Jose Mercury News criticized the plot and the casting saying that [...] "the storylines usually involve the {{obligatory}} three-episode-arc drug problems or lost virginity with dialogue designed to keep a dog up to speed", and that [...] "Whoever at FOX thought Benjamin McKenzie (Ryan on [...] "The O.C.") <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> anything younger than 25 should be fired". A DVD review was critical of the repetitive plot stating that [...] "the Ryan-Marissa fol-de-rol gets tiresome as it devolves into relentless bad timing", while Entertainment Weekly did not think the acting was always up to scratch, stating [...] "it's unfortunate to have all this potential for arm-flinging drama invested in Barton, an actress who can be as flat as a paper doll". It was also denounced for excessive brawling and glamorizing underage drinking.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were initially}} reluctant to feature Maud Adams again because her previous character {{was killed in}} The Man with the Golden Gun. Sybil Danning was announced in Prevue magazine in 1982 as being Octopussy, but was never actually cast. Faye Dunaway was deemed too expensive. Barbara Carrera said she turned down the role to take {{a part in the}} competing Bond film Never Say Never Again. In the book A Star is Found: Our Adventures Casting Some of Hollywood's Biggest Movies, casting director Jane Jenkins revealed that the Bond producers told her that they wanted a South Asian actress to play Octopussy, so she looked at the only two Indians in a then predominantly white Hollywood, Persis Khambatta and Susie Coelho. Afterwards, she auditioned white actresses, like Barbara Parkins, who she felt <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> Indian. Finally, Albert R. Broccoli announced to her that they would cast Swedish-born Maud Adams, darken her hair, and change a few lines about how she was raised by an Indian family. A different plotline, with Adams' British father exposed as a traitor, was used instead. As for Adams, she asked to play Octopussy as a European woman and was granted this, but on the title character's name, she felt the producers [...] "went too far".|$|E

Hanabishi falls for the King quickly, but as the kingdom and the harem grows, he is just as quickly forgotten.|$|R
5000|$|A non-representational {{music video}} {{was made of}} [...] "The Ghost of Tom Joad". It {{featured}} a black-and-white photo montage constrained to a subsection of the screen resembling a rear-view mirror. Depressed U.S. Route 66-area American scenes were featured; though set in the 1990s, many <b>could</b> have <b>passed</b> <b>for</b> the 1930s. Occasionally {{a line from the}} song would flash on the screen.|$|R
500|$|Smith and Lavington {{consider}} that Lazenby [...] "had chosen to play Bond {{the same way}} as Sean Connery had, with perhaps more humility and humanity"; they {{went on to say that}} [...] "Lazenby's inexperience rarely shows" [...] in the film, and that [...] "he invariably rises to the occasion". Alexander Walker in the London Evening Standard said that, [...] "The truth is that George Lazenby is almost as good a James Bond as the man referred to in his film as 'the other fellow'. Lazenby's voice is more suave than sexy-sinister and he <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> the other fellow's twin on the shady side of the casino. Bond is now definitely all set for the Seventies". Judith Crist of New York Magazine commented that, [...] "This time around there's less suavity and a no-nonsense muscularity and maleness to the role via the handsome Mr. Lazenby". Feminist film critic Molly Haskell wrote an approving review in the Village Voice: [...] "Lazenby... seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates".|$|E
500|$|The {{writing and}} {{narrative}} were well received by critics, with Andy Goergen of Nintendo World Report labeling it as [...] "a strong argument for video {{games as a}} new medium of storytelling". Reviewers at Famitsu called the story enigmatic and thrilling. Carolyn Petit at GameSpot felt that the lengthy Novel sections amplified the fear and tension throughout the game, while Heidi Kemps of GamesRadar compared them to [...] "high-quality thriller novels". Jason Schreier of Wired criticized the prose for being inconsistent, but said {{that the use of}} the narrator was clever and unusual. Susan Arendt at The Escapist called the story multi-layered and horrifying. Zach Kaplan at Nintendo Life liked the dialogue, but found the third-person narration to be dull and slow, with out-of-place or clichéd metaphors and similes. Both Chris Schilling at Eurogamer and Lucas M. Thomas at IGN felt that the urgency portrayed in the game's story sometimes was at odds with the tone or timing of the dialogue, such as lengthy conversations while trapped inside a freezer, or lighthearted dialogue and jokes. Thomas called the premise gripping, and said that the mythology, conspiracies and character backgrounds were engrossing. Tony Ponce at Destructoid said that the characters initially seemed like a [...] "stock anime cast", but that the player discovers more complexity in them after moving past first impressions. Kaplan felt that each character was well developed, fleshed out and unique, and <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> real people.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{critics were}} {{impressed}} with the album. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borivoj Krgin dismissively labeled the album as [...] "another failure on the band's part {{to take the initiative}} and reinvent themselves." [...] Krgin described King as [...] "the weaker and less inventive of the two main songwriters" [...] (King and Hanneman), feeling the album followed [...] "a familiar direction that almost always sounds tired and forced" [...] as a result of King being the album's main songwriter. Krgin also singled out Araya for criticism, and called the vocalist a [...] "hollow shell of his former self, boasting a singing style that is monotonous, devoid of creativity and at times virtually unlistenable." [...] Krgin awarded the record 6 out of 10, and ended the review by observing that [...] "Slayer's rapidly diminishing record sales (Diabolus In Musica has shifted less than 300,000 copies in the US compared to 600–700,000+) as a sign that the band is in dire need of a new lease on life." [...] The Washington Post gave it a mixed review, stating, [...] "Of course, what Slayer says isn't supposed to be nearly as important as how it says it: The riffs are all overdriven and suffocating, and that's a conscious decision. In its simplest form, a song like [...] "Exile" [...] <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> Motorhead pushed through the blades of a lawn mower, but that's selling Slayer short; guitarist Kerry King actively fights the groove that naturally comes from playing heavy rock-and-roll." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] is a hip hop and rave song, with a {{duration}} of three minutes and forty-two seconds. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted that the song's composition is a [...] "chaotic dense spray of boasts over a muscular, scraping beat". Brad Stern of MTV Buzzworthy labeled the song as [...] "noisy, trap-tastic twerker" [...] that is reminiscent of Rihanna's 2012 single [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] and according to him, contains blazin' beats, brags aplenty, nasty unapologetic attitude. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] is an aggregation off [...] "distorted" [...] synthesisers derived from Joey Beltram's 1990 record [...] "Mentasm" [...] "until it sounds weird and disorientating". The Boston Globes James Reed labeled [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] as a club banger containing a heavy bass [...] "that rumbles more in your chest instead of rattling your feet." [...] Alex Macpherson of Fact wrote that on the song [...] "Rihanna sprays declamations like machine gun fire over what <b>could</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> a lost early ’90s Prodigy rave anthem." [...] The lyrical content of [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] revolves around Rihanna explaining how if any of her crew does not respect her, then she should no longer remain with her, singing: [...] "How could you be so hood, but you're so fuckin' pop?/ How could you be so fun and sound like you're selling rocks?". On the song, Rihanna sounds [...] "indignant" [...] and [...] "impressed" [...] with being herself and proclaims: [...] "Walk up in this bitch like I own the ho".|$|E

5000|$|In his {{analysis}} of the film, Roberto Curti heavily criticized it, noting that [...] "the story is stretched beyond belief" [...] and that [...] "the budget is so poor that Terror In Rome <b>could</b> well <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> a Turkish movie", and eventually complaining that [...] "the film is so badly written and directed {{that it is hard to}} believe it came from such an experienced filmmaker as Grieco and a renowned writer as Felisatti." ...|$|R
