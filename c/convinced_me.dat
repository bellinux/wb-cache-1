25|$|I {{was shocked}} at college to see one hundred of my classmates in the library all reading copies of the same book. Instead of doing as they did, I went into the stacks and read the first book written by an author whose name began with Z. I {{received}} {{the highest grade in}} the class.

25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E
500|$|The entire {{experience}} {{of working on}} Flower Drum Song was rewarding in many ways, {{not the least of}} which was that it <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> that I had overcome all traces of my depression.

At the beginning, most students simply fail to appreciate the need for doing this. Accordingly, the real number system is introduced as an ordered field with the least-upper-bound property, and a few interesting applications of this property are quickly made. However, Dedekind's construction is not omitted. It is now in an Appendix to Chapter 1, where it may be studied and enjoyed whenever the time is ripe." [...] (p. ix) ...|$|E

500|$|Though Waters had differing {{ideas about}} which songs they should play, he [...] "agreed {{to roll over}} for one night only", Gilmour told the Associated Press, [...] "The rehearsals <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> it wasn't {{something}} I wanted {{to be doing a}} lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that ... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who.|$|E
500|$|Lytle later noted, [...] "It was {{actually}} Jim 's fault. He {{suggested that we}} consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [...] he <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> {{it might be a}} good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Richie Unterberger {{awarded the}} album three stars out of five, {{describing}} Nico's songwriting as [...] "singularly morose". Dorian Lynskey wrote for The Guardian that The Marble Index forces {{the distinction between}} art and entertainment, comparing it to the [...] "terrifying" [...] output of musician Scott Walker (particularly the album Tilt), painter Mark Rothko and writer Philip Roth. Simon Reynolds described the record as [...] "psychic landscapes, glittering in their immaculate, lifeless majesty of someone {{cut off from the}} thawing warmth of human contact and fellowship" [...] and [...] "religious music for nihilists". Sputnikmusic's Louis Arp was less enthusiastic, finding the music [...] "pretentious" [...] and [...] "agitating" [...] in the aura it evoked while deeming Nico's lyrics repetitive and meaningless. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said, [...] "While The Velvet Underground and Nico plus Chelsea Girl <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> that Nico had charisma; The Marble Index plus Desertshore convince me that she's a fool." ...|$|E

500|$|Lee was a {{character}} actor and acting instructor {{with a range}} of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and hornrimmed glasses, [...] "with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief". [...] Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was [...] "perfectly cast" [...] as Mr. Hooper. [...] According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Streets first episode with Lee, [...] "Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did... He <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> that no matter how simple the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it". [...] Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, [...] "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to say to each other". [...] The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.|$|E
500|$|Though Pink Floyd {{turned down}} a {{contract}} worth Â£136million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting {{it ought to be}} for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen, stating: [...] "The [...] rehearsals <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> [...] it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed by Gino Castaldo from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica; the resulting article declared: [...] "Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased." [...] Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: [...] "It's over... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old...it is much more comfortable to work on my own." [...] Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite with the surviving former members.|$|E
500|$|By 2001, Arulpragasam {{designed}} the cover for Elastica's last single [...] "The Bitch Don't Work", {{and went on}} the road with the band to video document their tour. The tour's supporting act, electroclash artist Peaches, introduced Arulpragasam to the Roland MC-505 and encouraged her to make music, a medium in which Arulpragasam lacked confidence. While holidaying together in Bequia in the Caribbean, Arulpragasam began experimenting with Frischmann's MC-505. She adopted her stage name, [...] "M.I.A.", standing for [...] "Missing In Acton" [...] during this time. In her 2012 book Arulpragasam writes, [...] "M.I.A. came to be because of my missing cousin. I wanted to make a film about where he was since he was M.I.A. (Missing in Action) in Sri Lanka. We were the same age, went to the same schools growing up. I was also living in Acton at the time. So I was living in Acton looking for my cousin missing in action." [...] Of her time in Bequia, she told [...] "I started going out to this chicken shed with a sound system. You buy rum through a hatch and dance in the street. They <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> to come to church where people sing so amazingly. But I couldnât clap along to hallelujah. I was out of rhythm. Someone said, âWhat happened to Jesus? I saw you dancing last night and you were totally fine.â They stopped the service and taught me to clap in time. It was embarrassing". Returning to West London, where she shared an apartment with Frischmann, she began working with a simple set-up (a second-hand 4-track tape machine, the MC-505, and a radio microphone), composing and recording a six-song demo tape that included [...] "Lady Killa", [...] "M.I.A.", and [...] "Galang".|$|E

2500|$|Key {{publicly}} criticized slavery's cruelties, so {{much that}} after his death a newspaper editorial stated [...] "So actively hostile was he to the peculiar institution that he was called 'The Nigger Lawyer' .... because he often volunteered to defend the downtrodden {{sons and daughters of}} Africa.
