5000|$|A {{model for}} the {{quaternary}} structure of the M. acetivorans S-layer was proposed based on packing of the MA0829 CTR in a hexagonal lattice {{in one of the}} two obtained crystal forms (Protein Data Bank accession number 3U2G). The minimal building block of the S-layer sheet is a trimer of crystallographic MA0829 CTR dimers. Lateral translation of the trimeric unit creates a flat 2-dimensional sheet that has features consistent with the molecular properties of hexagonal archaeal S-layers. [...] The overall appearance of the S-layer resembles a honeycomb structure of hexagonal tiles with center to <b>center</b> <b>spacing</b> between the tiles of ~240 Å and a height of ~45 Å.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} {{near the}} beginning of the article, the attainment of a nonfluctuating velocity ratio is dependent on the profile of the teeth.Friction and wear between two gears is also dependent on the tooth profile. There are a great many tooth profiles that provides a constant velocity ratio. In many cases, given an arbitrary tooth shape, it is possible to develop a tooth profile for the mating gear that provides a constant velocity ratio. However, two constant velocity tooth profiles are the most commonly used in modern times: the cycloid and the involute. The cycloid was more common until the late 1800s. Since then, the involute has largely superseded it, particularly in drive train applications. The cycloid is in some ways the more interesting and flexible shape; however the involute has two advantages: it is easier to manufacture, and it permits the center-to-center spacing of the gears to vary over some range without ruining the constancy of the velocity ratio. Cycloidal gears only work properly if the <b>center</b> <b>spacing</b> is exactly right. Cycloidal gears are still used in mechanical clocks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] -Low {{temperature}} superconductors containing artificial pinning centers (APC) in NbTi {{have shown}} critical current densities (below 4 Tesla) substantially higher than metallurgically fabricated and optimized NbTi superconductors. Peak current densities are achieved when the pinning <b>center</b> <b>spacing</b> are matched to spacing of the flux line lattice (EL) at field of operation.

In addition, the lesign approach or geometry such as the size of the artificial superconducting filament, the area of the pinning material, and the position of the pins can be important factors in determining the strength of the pinning force on the FLL.

The pin <b>center</b> <b>spacing</b> is 2 mm and the pin diameter is 1 mm. For the maximum deflection of 2 mm, the display can represent frequencies up to 7. 5 Hz; smaller deflections lead to achievable frequencies up to 25 Hz because the servos are slew rate limited.

The simulations are carried out with Reynolds number Re = 200, aspect ratio L/D = 10 and four transverse pitch ratios: T/D = 1. 2, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 3. 0, where Re is defined by incoming velocity U, cylinder diameter D and kinetic viscosity v, L is cylinder span length and T is center to <b>center</b> <b>spacing</b> between the cylinder pair. Numerical results show that the wake patterns depend on not only T/D, but also the end flow conditions. Both the wake street and statistics of fluid force vary along the cylinder span considerably, indicating strong three dimensionality of the wake flows and their interaction.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for many years that cells will react to the shape of their microenvironment. It is more {{recently}} becoming clear that cells can alter their morphology, adhesions, and cytoskeleton in response to their nanoenvironment. A few studies have gone further and measured cellular response to high-adhesion nano-materials. There have, however, been practical difficulties associated with genomic studies focusing on low-adhesion nanotopographies. Because of advancement in fabrication techniques allowing the production of large area of structure and the ability to amplify mRNA prior to microarray hybridization, these difficulties can be overcome. Here, electron beam lithography has been used to fabricate arrays of pits with 120 nm diameters, 100 nm depth and 300 nm center to <b>center</b> <b>spacing</b> in hexagonal arrangement. Electron and fluorescent microscopies have been used to observe morphological changes in fibroblasts cultured on the pits. 1. 7 k gene microarray was used to gauge genomic response to the pits.
