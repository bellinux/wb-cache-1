2500|$|Howard Brennan was a steamfitter who {{was sitting}} {{across the street from}} the Texas School Book Depository and {{watching}} the motorcade go by. He notified police that he heard a shot come from above and looked up to see a man with a rifle fire another shot from the southeast <b>corner</b> <b>window</b> on the sixth floor. He said he had seen the same man minutes earlier looking through the window. Brennan gave a description of the shooter, and Dallas police subsequently broadcast descriptions between 12:45p.m., 12:48p.m., and 12:55p.m. After the second shot was fired, Brennan recalled, [...] "This man I saw previous was aiming for his last shot... and maybe paused for another second as though to assure himself that he had hit his mark." ...|$|E

60|$|It came on {{afternoon}} {{and it came}} on evening. Norfolk is a delightful street to lodge in--provided you don't go lower down--but of a summer evening when the dust and waste paper lie in it and stray children play in it {{and a kind of}} a gritty calm and bake settles on it and a peal of church-bells is practising in the neighbourhood it is a trifle dull, and never have I seen it since at such a time and never shall I see it evermore at such a time without seeing the dull June evening when that forlorn young creature sat at her open <b>corner</b> <b>window</b> on the second and me at my open <b>corner</b> <b>window</b> (the other corner) on the third. Something merciful, something wiser and better far than my own self, had moved me while it was yet light to sit in my bonnet and shawl, and as the shadows fell and the tide rose I could sometimes--when I put out my head and looked at her window below--see that she leaned out a little looking down the street. It was just settling dark when I saw her in the street.|$|E
60|$|There young Toots was, at any rate; {{possessed of}} the gruffest of voices and the shrillest of minds; {{sticking}} ornamental pins into his shirt, and keeping a ring in his waistcoat pocket {{to put on}} his little finger by stealth, when the pupils went out walking; constantly falling in love by sight with nurserymaids, who had no idea of his existence; and looking at the gas-lighted world over the little iron bars in the left-hand <b>corner</b> <b>window</b> of the front three pairs of stairs, after bed-time, like a greatly overgrown cherub who had sat up aloft much too long.|$|E

5000|$|Among American enthusiasts, it {{is common}} to refer to the {{different}} models by the number of their windows. The basic Kombi or Bus is the 11-window (a.k.a. three-window bus because of three side windows) with a split windshield, two front cabin door windows, six rear side windows, and one rear window. The DeLuxe model featured eight rear side windows and two rear <b>corner</b> <b>windows,</b> making it the 15-window (not available in Europe). Meanwhile, the sunroof DeLuxe with its additional eight small skylight windows is, accordingly, the 23-window. From the 1964 model year, with its wider rear door, the rear <b>corner</b> <b>windows</b> were discontinued, making the latter two the 13-window and 21-window respectively. The 23- and later 21-window variants each carry the nickname [...] "Samba" [...] or in Australia, officially [...] "Alpine".|$|R

Your relations with her are far more than business relations, no doubt; but a residue of business remains in them, and business is business ever.

If, for these two reasons, some competent Proxy would give you away, I should take it very kindly.’ ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was only}} between {{the station and}} Gavinia's house {{that she had been}} seen, but they searched far afield. Tommy, {{accompanied}} by Corp, even sought for her in the Den. Do you remember the long, lonely path between two ragged little dykes that led from the Den to the house of the Painted Lady? It was there that Grizel had lived with her mamma. The two men went down that path, which is oppressed with trees. Elsewhere the night was not dark, but, as they had known so well when they were boys, it is always dark after evenfall in the Double Dykes. That is the legacy of the Painted Lady. Presently they saw the house--scarcely the house, but a lighted window. Tommy remembered the night when as a boy, Elspeth crouching beside him, he had peered in fearfully at that <b>corner</b> <b>window</b> on Grizel and her mamma, and the shuddersome things he had seen. He shuddered at them again.|$|E
50|$|During the 1930s, Art Deco had a {{noticeable}} effect on house {{design in the}} United Kingdom, {{as well as the}} design of various public buildings. Straight, white-rendered house frontages rising to flat roofs, sharply geometric door surrounds and tall windows, as well as convex-curved metal <b>corner</b> <b>windows,</b> were all characteristic of that period.|$|R
50|$|Its {{structural}} system {{is referred to}} variously as horizontal-plank frame, stacked plank or plank-to-plank. The clapboard is affixed to layers of planks stacked solid.

60|$|There {{was a high}} wall round this garden, and I had a job to {{get over}} it, but once {{on the other side}} it was all plain sailing. I did not meet a soul upon the road, and the iron gate of the avenue was open. No one was moving at the lodge. The moon was shining, and I could see the great house glimmering white through an archway of trees. I walked up it for {{a quarter of a mile}} or so, until I was at the edge of the drive, where it ended in a broad, gravelled space before the main door. There I stood in the shadow and looked at the long building, with a full moon shining in every window and {{silvering}} the high stone front. I crouched there for some time, and I wondered where I should find the easiest entrance. The <b>corner</b> <b>window</b> of the side seemed to be the one which was least overlooked, and a screen of ivy hung heavily over it. My best chance was evidently there. I worked my way under the trees to the back of the house, and then crept along in the black shadow of the building. A dog barked and rattled his chain, but I stood waiting until he was quiet, and then I stole on once more until I came to the window which I had chosen.|$|E
