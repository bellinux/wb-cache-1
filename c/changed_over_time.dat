Early sejms have seen mostly majority voting, but beginning in the 17th century, unanimous voting became more common, and 32 sejms were vetoed with the infamous liberum veto, particularly {{in the first half}} of the 18th century. This vetoing procedure has been credited with significantly paralyzing the Commonwealth governance.|$|E
