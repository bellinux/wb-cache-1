2500|$|When {{dealing with}} rubber {{components}} with mold bonded metal sleeves, swaging {{provides a more}} controlled and cost-effective alternative to 'shooting' the rubber part into a metal sleeve, where an intensive and less dependable secondary operation is needed to finish the product. [...] A metal can with a bonding component (such as phosphate) is painted to the inside diameter, and molten rubber is injected into the metal sleeve. This creates a product that when cooled may be swaged to the desired size. [...] The second {{reason for this is}} that the product is more reliable, and during the swaging process the rubber is more relaxed when the outside can to which the rubber is bonded has its diameter reduced, changing the springrate (K) values and damping <b>coefficient</b> (<b>C)</b> of the rubber. [...] After swaging, any inconsistencies in the metal and rubber have been minimized.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} paper the effect of vertical curvature of flow streamlines due to change in weir crest height on discharge <b>coefficient</b> (<b>Cd)</b> was experimentally studied. The study was carried out on four different types of weirs under different flow conditions (sharp crested weir, broad crested weir, triangular weir, and trapezoidal weir). Also, the study deals with the effect of head angle of the triangle weir on discharge coefficient. This study was carried out through 254 experimental runs. The study showed that the discharge <b>coefficient</b> (<b>Cd)</b> in both sharp and broad crested weirs was affected by the relative crest height (H/Y). By using the regression analysis, two formulas between the discharge <b>coefficient</b> (<b>Cd)</b> and the dimensionless crest height (H/Y) for both sharp and broad crested weirs were presented. The comparative study between the developed formulas and those formulas developed by other researchers showed good agreement in discharge coefficient values. For triangular weir, the effect of head angle () on discharge <b>coefficient</b> (<b>Cd)</b> {{was more than the}} effect of relative head (H/Y). Also, the experimental study illustrates that the effect of relative head (H/Y) on discharge <b>coefficient</b> (<b>Cd)</b> in trapezoidal weir could not be considered.
