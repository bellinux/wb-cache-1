40|$|Thermoplastic {{polymers}} exhibit non-isochoric behaviour during tensile and <b>compression</b> <b>testing</b> {{as well as}} particular deformations like {{local necking}} (tension) or buckling (compression). A method for the determination of Cauchy stresses from tensile and <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> is presented, that considers the actual deformations of the test specimens. The exact geometry of the specimens in the respective present configuration is determined in photographs, which are taken continuously throughout the test. The engineering stresses at several time points are converted into Cauchy stresses using newly developed formulas in consideration of the actual specimen geometry. For validation finite element analyses of the tensile and <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> are performed using the identified stress-strain curves. The numerical results show good agreement with the experiments for the tested polymers. Thus a method for conversion of engineering to Cauchy stresses in tensile and <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> could be established considering the non-isochoric deformation in plasticity. With this method “true” stress-strain curves as input for finite element material models can be identified for arbitrary materials...|$|R

The flow curves were investigated {{in a wide range}} of strain rate using cylindrical specimens characterised by different slenderness ratios; as far as the ring <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> are concerned, different strain rates were obtained using hollow cylinders with different values of height, and inner and outer diameters. The axisymmetric <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> showed an appreciable increase in the flow stress and in the strain rate sensitivity as the results given by high speed tests were compared with those obtained under quasi-static loading condition. The analysis of the results provided by the ring <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> showed that strain rate affects the variation of the inner ring diameter, irrespective of the height reduction and frictional condition...|$|R

50|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{can actually}} be used to some slight advantage. If a <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> does give a low figure, {{and it has been}} determined it is not due to intake valve closure/camshaft characteristics, then one can differentiate between the cause being valve/seat seal issues and ring seal by squirting engine oil into the spark plug orifice, in a quantity sufficient to disperse across the piston crown and the circumference of the top ring land, and thereby affect the mentioned seal. If a second <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> is performed shortly thereafter, and the new reading is much higher, it would be the ring seal that is problematic, whereas if the <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> pressure observed remains low, it is a valve sealing (or more rarely head gasket, or breakthrough piston or, rarer still, cylinder-wall damage) issue.|$|E
