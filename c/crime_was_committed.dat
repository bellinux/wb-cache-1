5|$|Lower {{courts are}} split {{on whether the}} Clause {{requires}} that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> <b>committed.</b> Some courts have held that it does. Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{borders of}} Albania again became {{the cause of}} {{international}} conflict when Italian General Enrico Tellini and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader Benito Mussolini was incensed, and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever {{the results of the}} investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million lire in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> <b>committed</b> by Greeks.|$|E

In this episode, the fatal shooting of a realtor, while alone in a cinderblock jail cell, has Doggett struggling {{to find out who}} committed the murder and how the <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> <b>committed.</b> Scully and Doggett, however, soon learn that there is more to this case than meets the eye.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{jurisdictional}} requirements in the Rome Statute {{that must be}} met before a case may begin against an individual. The requirements are (1) subject-matter jurisdiction (what acts constitute crimes), (2) territorial or personal jurisdiction (where the <b>crimes</b> <b>were</b> <b>committed</b> or who committed them), and (3) temporal jurisdiction (when the <b>crimes</b> <b>were</b> <b>committed).</b>|$|R

5|$|The First Nations in {{the north}} {{typically}} had some prior experience of Europeans, for example through contact with the Hudson's Bay Company, and there was little conflict between the police and these native communities, and few crimes committed. The First Nations typically {{did not like the}} police, however, and often blamed them for wider government policies; for their part, the mounted police often regarded the First Nations with contempt. By comparison, the mounted police got on much better with the Inuit, who had seen far less contact with Europeans. The force generally took a more liberal, paternalistic attitude towards them, often applying informal justice rather than official laws when the occasional Inuit <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> <b>committed.</b> Members of the First Nations and Inuit were employed to drive police dog sleds and cook for their patrols.|$|E
5|$|Weeks later, Jernigan filed a counter-suit against Wilkinson in Fayette County circuit court. He {{asked the}} court to award him $50 million in punitive damages and to {{determine}} the profits made by his and Wilkinson's veneer company, of which he would receive half. A judge ordered the case moved to Louisville because the alleged <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> <b>committed</b> in Glasgow, in the state's western district. State charges against Jernigan, which included kidnapping and carrying a concealed deadly weapon, were dropped so that the federal extortion charges could take precedence. Over the objection of his legal counsel, the court ordered Jernigan to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was insane or mentally incompetent for his own defense. The court-appointed psychiatrist found Jernigan competent to stand trial, and he was released in late May on a $25,000 bond.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} NatWest Three — Giles Darby, David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew — were extradited to the United States in 2006 {{on charges}} relating to a transaction with Enron Corporation in 2000 {{while they were}} working for Greenwich NatWest. It {{has been argued that}} the alleged <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> <b>committed</b> by British citizens living in the UK against a British company based in London and therefore, any resulting criminal case falls {{under the jurisdiction of the}} English courts. However, the Serious Fraud Office decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. There has been criticism that the Americans do not have to produce a prima facie case, or even a reasonable one, to extradite British citizens, whereas no such facility exists to extradite US citizens to the UK. On 28 November 2007 the three admitted one charge of wire fraud after a plea bargain. On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison.|$|E

25|$|On September 21, 2009, Joel Patrick Courtney {{pleaded guilty}} to aggravated murder {{and was sentenced to}} life in prison without the {{possibility}} of parole for Wilberger's death.

25|$|United States v. Dawson (1854) {{concerned}} a murder {{committed in the}} Indian Territory by a non-Indian defendant, a crime which by statute was triable in Arkansas. Between the murder and the trial, the District of Arkansas had been subdivided into the Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas. The Court held that the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which requires a jury drawn {{from the state and}} district wherein the <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> <b>committed,</b> had no application to crimes committed outside of a U.S. state.|$|E

25|$|David Renwick {{wanted to}} write a detective series that dealt with the actual work of {{detection}} rather than action, which most crime dramas appeared to focus on at the time. Also, whereas most of these were about who did it (Inspector Morse or Taggart) and why it was done (Cracker), this new series would be about how it was done, with such tropes as murders committed in locked rooms, a person being in two places at once or impossible thefts. Finding a culprit would still be part of the detective's job, but the emphasis would be on discovering how the <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> <b>committed.</b>|$|E
