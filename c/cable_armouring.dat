50|$|Most cable faults {{result from}} human {{activities}} especially ships' anchoring and commercial fishing that involves {{contact with the}} seabed, e.g. bottom trawling. Collectively, these activities account for over 65% of cable faults and occur primarily in water depths <200m. Damage resulting from natural phenomena account for around <10% of all cable faults, but this percentage can spike during a major event such as large earthquakes (>M=7.0) when multiple cables can break. On the continental shelf, waves and currents, especially those generated by storms, may abrade exposed cables and/or cause them to sway in the oscillating currents thus inducing fatigue. Those effects are minimized by <b>cable</b> <b>armouring</b> and burial beneath the seabed. Less frequent but nonetheless devastating are tsunami such as the 2011 Great Tohuku Earthquake of 2011 that severely damaged Japanese coastal infrastructure. Such earthquakes may also generate submarine landslides and turbidity currents - sediment-laden currents that travel long distances (100s to 1000s kilometres) at high speeds (up to 68 kilometres/hour). These turbulent flows break cables in water depths down to 5000m and deeper. For example, offshore Taiwan and Algeria suffered earthquakes in 2006 and 2003 that caused 22 and 29 cable breaks respectively. Turbidity currents also form under major rain storms. The discharged flood waters are so laden with mud and sand that they sink to the seabed and move downslope to form cable-damaging turbidity currents. Other natural causes of cable faults include deep-ocean currents, volcanoes and ice. While such forces may be locally significant, worldwide they are minor compared to earthquakes and storms.|$|E

40|$|Continual {{advances}} {{are being}} made in the control and monitoring of subsea oil wells by the application of new technology for sensors, subsea processing and communications devices. With these advances, the demands on the subsea umbilical are constantly increasing with deployment lengths and depths growing and the quantity of controlled functions now greater than ever. The need for {{a good understanding of}} the effects of deployment subsea is essential, as communications frequencies and data throughput constantly increase. This research aims to address some of the issues regarding umbilical modelling and sets up a series of tests to measure the effects of pressure and cable flooding within the umbilical and assesses the effect of steel tubes, hydraulic hoses and <b>cable</b> <b>armouring</b> on the operating parameters of the cables. In addition, the cables are modelled using electromagnetic field solver tools and the results compared with those measured. Once prediction losses have been established, these are compared with measurements taken on the full lengths of umbilical and the reasons for any discrepancies examined. It is shown that, in a typical subsea umbilical, the proximity of conducting cores to adjacent components, such as hydraulic hoses or steel wire armour, the flooding with sea water and the pressure due to the depth of deployment all {{have a significant impact on}} the impedance parameters of the cables. The effect of cable screening on attenuation is also examined and it is shown that, as well as affecting capacitance and conductance, the screen has a significant impact on the cable resistance and inductance, with the resistance rising to a maximum at a certain screen thickness before a subsequent reduction. This effect was investigated further by modelling with an electromagnetic field solver and a possible explanation for this effect is proposed. Comparison of the modelled data and measurement of cables under the various operating conditions investigated show good correlation with the results, allowing very accurate prediction of the effects on electrical performance of cables when deployed subsea in Subsea Control System umbilicals...|$|E

(This does not mean they always do, as practical performance depends on installation details and the discrimination enhancing filtering in the ELCB.) Therefore, by electrically separating <b>cable</b> <b>armour</b> from the <b>cable</b> circuit protective conductor, an ELCB can be arranged to protect against cable damage only, and not trip on faults in downline installations.|$|R

It uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), NFC, Android devices and Microsoft Azure for creating fully functional system for cable drum organization. The system heavily emphasize the use of user roles to personalize the web page for each user for creating a more seamless work flow. The system consist of different modules, performing different tasks. Three different mobile applications, a web site, a middleware and a SQL database have been created. Two of the mobile applications provides functionality for tracking the cable drums inside the factory hall. The NFC application provides functionality for identifying the drum, and for updating the information about it. The middleware does most of the work within the system. It decides whether or not the drum has moved, checks user privileges and implements methods for adding, updating and deleting from the database. The web site provides a simple user interface, and creates simple methods for a user to update the backend with correct information. The system have been designed and implemented from requirements set by Nexans Rognan. Multiple smaller, fault prone and time-consuming tasks have been adopted into the system. Users at Nexans have been included in the testing, and they have provided feedback which have been implemented in the system. Testing have shown that the system is mature enough to be used as it is now, and the technology chosen does suit the environment at Nexans...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{design of}} {{high-voltage}} power cables {{is important to}} achieve an economical delivery of electric power from wind farms and power plants over the very long distances {{as well as the}} overseas electric power. The main focus of this thesis is the investigation of electromagnetic losses in components of high-voltage power cables. The objective of the ongoing research is to develop the theory and optimization techniques as tools to make material choices and geometry designs to minimize the high-frequency attenuation and dispersion for HVDC power cables and the power losses associated with HVAC cables. Physical limitations, dispersion relationships and the application of sum rules as well as convex optimization will be investigated to obtain adequate physical insight and a priori modeling information for these problems. For HVAC power cables, the objectives are addressed by performing measurements and estimation of complex valued permeability of <b>cable</b> <b>armour</b> steel in Papers I and II. Efficient analytical solutions for the electromagnetic field generated by helical structures with applications for HVAC power cables have been obtained in Paper III. For HVDC power cables, estimation of insulation characteristics from dielectric spectroscopy data using Herglotz functions, convex optimization and B-splines, has been investigated in Papers V and VI. The unique solution requirements in waveguide problems have been reviewed in Paper IV...|$|R

This study tries {{to capture the}} impact of power-lines on residential property values within Lagos metropolis. Questionnaires were distributed to 139 registered Estate Surveying firms and 605 persons residing along and within a 200 m perpendicular distance to power-lines in Surulere and Alimosho Local Government Council Areas of Lagos Metropolis. Interviews with the managers and field officers of PHCN sub-stations {{in the study area}} were also conducted while data were analysed using analytical statistics. The study revealed that power-lines and its associated risks were found to affect rental values of residential properties within high brow Surulere while no effect was recorded for residential properties in suburban Alimosho. The study ecommends the use of buried <b>armour</b> <b>cables</b> as alternative to power lines and the strict enforcement of the right-of-ways where power-lines exist within the Lagos metropolis and generally across the nation.
