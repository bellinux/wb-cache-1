40|$|The authors {{describe}} the detailed protocol developed in their laboratory at Oak Ridge for the permeabilization and <b>cryobiological</b> <b>preservation</b> of embryos of Drosophila melanogaster, Oregon R strain. The protocol is supplemented by notes containing two sorts of information. One category includes {{references to the}} appropriate portions of their published papers giving the scientific rationale and experimental basis for important steps. The other category {{is concerned with the}} criticality of certain steps and the precision with which they need to be performed. As an aid to investigators, the authors list even ordinary pieces of equipment. Brand names and model numbers are given where it is either important or convenient for readers to know precisely what is used...|$|E
40|$|Cryopreservation of mouse sperm {{provides}} an eco-nomic option for preserving {{the large number}} ofmouse strains now being generated by transgenic and targeted mutation methodologies. The ability of a spermato-zoan cell to survive <b>cryobiological</b> <b>preservation</b> depends on general biophysical constraints that apply to all cells, such as the avoidance or minimization {{of the formation of}} intracellular ice during cooling. This action is typically achieved by use of cryoprotectant substances and by controlled, slow rates of cooling. Superimposed on those general constraints may be special characteristics of mouse spermatozoa, such as more narrow, osmotically driven volume tolerance limits and the fact that relatively successful freezing can be obtained with-out the use of a permeating cryoprotective agent. The lack of important information regarding sperm cells ' fundamental cryobiological properties, including their osmotic and mem...|$|E
