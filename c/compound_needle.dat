Nominal power is 140 kW at engine speed 2300 min– 1. The engine is equipped with gas turbine pressure charging with intercooling of charging air, accumulator-type fuel-handling system. Calculations of the working process {{have been made in}} accordance with the developed computer program and models. Investigations have been carried out in two stages: without any changes in regulation of fuel-handling system and with cyclic fuel delivery that ensure such value of excess air factor at various operational modes which corresponds to the operation with diesel fuel. All the obtained results have been analyzed in the paper. The paper shows changes in mean indicated pressure, specific indicated fuel consumption, indicated efficiency, specific nitrogen oxides emissions for various modes in question while using 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 % mixture of diesel fuel with butanol. Dependences of parameters pertaining to diesel operation have been determined according to external speed characteristic for various mixtures and the obtained data make it possible to justify parameters of the fuel-handling system. It has been recommended to use a diesel fuel-butanol mixture containing 15 % of butanol without any changes in regulating and design engine parameters.

40|$|International audienceBackgroundIn {{advanced}} osteoarthritis (OA), {{when the}} cartilage is completely deleted, changes in micro-architecture {{and degree of}} mineralization of subchondral bone have been previously found comparatively to adjacent subchondral areas covered by normal cartilage. By contrast, the change of hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystallites, {{one of the factors}} governing the mechanical properties of bone, is not known. Material and methodsFor this aim, one vibrational spectroscopy by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and one diffraction technique using neutrons (powder neutron diffraction, PND) were performed. The main advantage of this latter technique is a great penetrating power of the neutron beam which permits to examine up to 1 cm sections of bone. Samples (7 mm diameter, 10 mm height) were from 4 women with hip OA in areas where the cartilage has disappeared and in areas with normal cartilage (subchondral bone is this case is considered as normal). The samples were harvested perpendicularly to compressive stress and were defatted to get a better signal to noise ratio and also to eliminate the fat rich in hydrogen. ResultsWith FTIR, the carbonation rate was 30 % with identical spectra in subchondral bone with or without cartilage. With PND, the width of a diffraction peak (hkl= 002) was smaller than the width of the other diffraction peaks, pointing out the anisotropy of the nanocrystals of all these <b>compounds</b> (<b>needle</b> and/or platelet-like morphology) along the c axis with an average length of 50 nm and a thickness of just 10 nm.

40|$|It {{was found}} {{recently}} that the transient liquid phase bonding of alumina via boron oxide interlayer results in a needle-like structure at joint. In this research the growth morphology and crystal structure of the interfacial compounds at 900 C for various joining time have been investigated. In addition, the interfacial structure of the joint at 800 C and 15 hrs has also been studied, while the maximum joining strength of 155 MPa was found at this joining condition. Alumina bulks coated with 3 m thick boron oxide at one side have been stacked in pair by facing the coated sides. The loading was set as 15 kPa. The joining times at 900 C are 2, 6, 15, 24 hrs and it is 15 hrs at 800 C. The morphology and crystal analysis of the joined alumina bulks were carried out in aid with scanning electron microscope and transmission microscope including selected area diffraction. The appearance of three compounds 3 Al 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3, 2 Al 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3 and 9 Al 2 O 3 - 2 B 2 O 3 is verified by means of diffraction pattern analysis. It is {{found in this study}} that at 900 C the interface is mostly occupied by the cloudy metastable 3 Al 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3 phase, while joining for 2 hrs. The stable 2 Al 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3 and 9 Al 2 O 3 - 2 B 2 O 3 appear with increasing time, while the later forms later. The shape of both stable compounds is needle-like and they grow along the [001] direction detected from selected area diffraction imaging. It indicates a good coherency between the <b>compound</b> <b>needles</b> and substrate grains that no obvious boundary between them was observed.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} driven carbon shortage {{is often}} assumed to explain slow growth and treeline formation at high elevations. To test this hypothesis, we analysed mobile carbon pools in Pinus cembra across the treeline ecotone in the Swiss Alps. Concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in needles, branches, stems and roots, {{as well as}} lipids (acylglycerols) in all woody tissues were measured throughout the growing season. Starch was the most prominent non- structural carbon <b>compound</b> in <b>needles,</b> whereas lipids represented 50 - 75 % of the mobile carbon compounds in wood. The relative seasonal variation of the lipid fraction was very small, but due to the high absolute amount of lipids, the annual variability of carbon in lipids exceeded that of NSC in woody tissues. Mobile carbon compounds were highly abundant throughout the year and were never significantly depleted. Across a 110 m altitudinal transect from timberline to the uppermost site of tree existence, NSC and lipid concentrations generally increased. This trend became even more pronounced when the increasing structural density of tissues at higher elevations was accounted for. An estimation of the whole tree mobile carbon concentration (fraction of mobile carbon compounds within the whole tree biomass) also revealed an increasing trend of NSC and lipid pools with elevation. We therefore conclude that carbon limitation {{is unlikely to be}} responsible for reduced tree growth at the alpine treeline studied. Increased concentrations of NSC and lipids at the upper tree limit rather suggest that sink activity is limited. Hence, treeline formation is most likely the result of a direct thermal restriction of tissue formation (investment in structures) under otherwise sufficient carbon assimilation during the growing season...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{low-level}} ozone exposure and suppression of natural mycorrhizas on the above-ground chemical quality of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles and insect herbivore performance were studied in a two-year field experiment. Seedlings were fumigated with the ozone doses 1. 5 – 1. 7 times the ambient, and natural mycorrhizal infection level was about 35 % reduced in roots with fungicide propiconazole. On ozone-exposed seedlings the mean relative growth rate (MRGR) of Lygus rugulipennis Popp. nymphs {{was lower than}} on ambient ozone seedlings, but Gilpinia pallida Klug sawfly larvae grew better on elevated ozone seedlings than on ambient ozone seedlings. MRGR of Schizolachnus pineti Fabr. and Cinara pinea L. aphid nymphs or Neodiprion sertifer Geoffr. sawfly larvae or the oviposition of L. rugulipennis and N. sertifer were not affected by ozone exposure. Although ozone exposure did not affect total phenolics, total terpene, total or individual resin acid, total free amino acid, nutrient or sugar concentrations in needles, MRGR of L. rugulipennis positively correlated with total terpenes and MRGR of G. pallida positively with total amino acids. In addition, ozone exposure increased serine and proline concentration and marginally also starch concentration in needles. When mycorrhizas were reduced with fungicide, only MRGR of L. rugulipennis nymphs increased, but performance of other insect herbivores studied was not changed. However, number of L. rugulipennis eggs correlated positively with mycorrhizal infection level and also with total sugars. Reduction of mycorrhizas did not strongly affect the concentrations of analysed <b>compounds</b> in <b>needles,</b> because only phosphorus and potassium and some individual resin acids were reduced by fungicide treatment. These results suggest that low-level ozone exposure and moderately declined mycorrhizal infection do not drastically affect either the above-ground chemical quality of Scots pine seedlings or performance of studied insect herbivores...|$|R

Here, we evaluated proanthocyanidin contents in the total polyphenolic <b>compounds</b> of pine <b>needle</b> extracts prepared by hot water, ethanol, hexane, hot water-hexane (HWH), and hot water-ethanol (HWE). Analysis of each extract indicated that the ethanol extract contained the highest proanthocyanidin concentration. The HWH and hexane extracts also contained relatively high concentrations of proanthocyanidin. On the other hand, proanthocyanidin content analyses out of the total polyphenolic compounds indicated that the HWH extract contained the highest content.

The ERC is an important source of bioactive secondary metabolites, but very few of these biologically active compounds have been identified, purified or commercialized. An interdisciplinary collaboration between MU scientists was initiated in 2007 to identify and isolate biologically active phytochemicals from ERC tissues for possible commercial application. Our team has identified and purified biologically active <b>compounds</b> from leaves (<b>needles)</b> and fruit of the ERC. Many of these isolated diterpenoids not only have shown strong anti-microbial activities against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria, but also strong inhibitory activities against melanin biosynthesis. Recently, the isolated tricyclic diterpenoids have been recognized as promising anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and skin whitening agents by cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. The objectives of the proposed study are to: 1) isolate and characterize the biologically active phytochemicals, and 2) elucidate chemical structures of active compounds and their associated mode of actions. The first of these compounds to be characterized is the purified bioactive diterpenoid. The purified bioactive diterpenoid was found to have a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of all Gram positive pathogens tested. This inhibition of Gram positive bacteria is likely due to action on the cell division machinery, for affected cells elongate without proper separation. Additional compounds have activity on fungal agents, as well as potential anti-melanin activities.

This study tested the effects of water limitation on tree defense response of mature lodgepole and jack pine (Pinus contorta and Pinus banksiana) trees in the field. Tree defense response was initiated by inoculation of trees with the MPB-associated fungus Grosmannia clavigera and measured through monoterpene emission from tree boles and concentration of defensive <b>compounds</b> in phloem, <b>needles,</b> and necrotic tissues. Lodgepole pine generally emitted higher amounts of monoterpenes than jack pine; particularly from fungal-inoculated trees. Compared to non-inoculated trees, fungal inoculation increased monoterpene emission in both species, whereas water treatment {{had no effect on}} monoterpene emission. The phloem of both pine species contains (-) -α-pinene, the precursor of the beetle’s aggregation pheromone, however lodgepole pine contains two times as much as jack pine. The concentration of defensive compounds was 70 -fold greater in the lesion tissue in jack pine, but only 10 -fold in lodgepole pine compared to healthy phloem tissue in each species, respectively. Water-deficit treatment inhibited an increase of L-limonene as response to fungal inoculation in lodgepole pine phloem. The amount of myrcene in jack pine phloem was higher in water-deficit trees compared to ambient trees. Beetles reared in jack pine were not affected by either water or biological treatment, whereas beetles reared in lodgepole pine benefited from fungal inoculation by producing larger and heavier female offspring. Female beetles that emerged from jack pine bolts contained more fat than those that emerged from lodgepole pine, even though lodgepole pine phloem had a higher nitrogen content than jack pine phloem. These results suggest that jack pine chemistry is suitable for MPB pheromone production and aggregation on the host tree...|$|R
40|$|LGEP 2011 ID = 822 International audienceMany {{connectors}} {{are made}} of cuprous substrates with electroplated final surfaces such as tin and nickel. The main failure mechanism of such devices {{has been shown to}} be fretting. Intermetalliccompounds (IMC) formed due to the ageing of tin coatings have been shown to be an aggravating factor. Much work is still dedicated to better understand the failure mechanisms involved in tin fretting. The aim of this work was to elaborate improved coatings for better reliability of electronic devices. The work has been performed on tin layers electrodeposited on cuprous substrates such as those used in the electronic industry. Sine displacement cycles were imposed to ball/plane samples in "controlled displacement" fretting" tests. Experiments were performed for samples with underlayers of different types and thickness both as received and after heat treatment. The number of cycles for the contact resistance to exceed the threshold value of 10 mΩ increased with thin underlayers of 0. 1 μm. The heat treated tin layer with a 0. 1 μm cobalt underlayer showed a low and stable Rc value for a highly increased number of cycles. Various physicochemical techniques were used to analyse the composition profiles of the samples and to measure the thickness of the intermetalliccompounds. Thin underlayers allow copper to diffuse; intermetalliccompounds of different composition and with different structures are formed: Cu 6 Sn 5, Ni 3 Sn 4 or unidentified (Cu-Sn-Ni) and (Cu-Sn-Co) compounds. The electrical and tribological behaviours of bare IMC were investigated after stripping the free tin; sticking phenomena could account for the lower values of resistance recorded for the (Cu-Sn-Ni) and (Cu-Sn-Co) <b>compounds.</b> The particular <b>needle</b> shape of the intermetalliccompound formed with the thin cobalt underlayer could cause different fretting conditions leading to lower values of contact resistance for a longer time.

40|$|Chemical elicitors and {{mechanical}} treatments simulating real insect herbivory have been increasingly {{used to study}} induced defensive responses in woody plants. However, simultaneous quantitative comparisons of plant chemical defences elicited by real and simulated herbivory have received little attention. In this paper we compared the effects of real herbivory, simulated herbivory using two chemical elicitors, {{and mechanical}} damage treatments on the quantitative secondary chemistry of Pinus pinaster juveniles (namely on non-volatile resin in the stem and total phenolics in the needles). The real herbivory involved phloem wounding by Hylobius abietis and defoliation by Brachyderes lusitanicus (two pine weevils); the chemical elicitors to simulate herbivory induction were 40 mM methyl jasmonate (MJ) and 20 μM benzothiadiazole (BTH); and the mechanical treatments included phloem wounding and needle clipping. We also performed an additional experiment for assessing at what extent insect extracts could increase plant responses over mechanical damage. Chemical induction with MJ, mechanical wounding and real phloem herbivory by H. abietis all produced quantitatively similar results, increasing the concentration of resin in the stem and total phenolics in the needles by equivalent magnitudes. Exogenous application of BTH increased the concentration of phenolic <b>compounds</b> in pine <b>needles,</b> but did not show {{the same effect on}} stem resin. Contrastingly, we did not find significant changes in the concentration of resin in the stem or phenolics in the needles after needle clipping and B. lusitanicus feeding. Mechanical damage followed by the application of extracts from the insects B. lusitanicus and H. abietis on the injured tissues did not increase the responses in comparison to mechanical damage alone. The fact that strong induced responses elicited by phloem wounding insects are equally elicited by phloem injuries suggests that defences in pine trees are raised with low specificity regarding biotic enemies.

40|$|Although {{the effects}} of land use on soil organic matter are well known, the effects on the size, {{activity}} and diversity of the soil microbial community are less well documented. In this study {{the effects of}} agricultural land use (maize (Zea mays), annual ryegrass (Lolium multiforum), permanent kikuyu grass pasture (Pennisetum clandestinum), gum (Eucalyptus grandis) and pine (Pinus patula) forest) on microbial biomass C, microbial and exocellular enzyme activity and heterotrophic functional diversity (by analysis of catabolic response profiles to 36 substrates) was investigated on a site where the long-term history of land management was known. In comparison with native grassland, permanent kikuyu pasture resulted in an increase in organic C, microbial biomass, arginine ammonification rate, flourescein diacetate hydrolysis rate and arylsulphatase activity. By contrast, under maize under both conventional tillage (CT) and zero tillage (ZT) and annual ryegrass there was a reduction in organic matter and microbial biomass content and in measurements of microbial and enzyme activity. However, in these three arable soils, basal respiration, arginine ammonification and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis rates, when expressed per unit of microbial biomass, were higher than under the other land uses, suggesting the presence of a small but highly metabolically active microfloral community. Soils below pine forest tended to have a higher organic C content than those below gum forest, yet microbial biomass C, basal respiration, arginine ammonification rate and arylsulphatase activity were lower under pine forest. This was attributed to the inhibitory effects if phenolic <b>compounds</b> in pine <b>needles.</b> Principal components analysis of catabolic response profiles demonstrated that there were large differences in the catabolic capability of the soil microbial communities inhabiting the various land use types. Values for Shannon 2 ̆ 7 s and Simpson 2 ̆ 7 s diversity indices followed the order: pine < gum < kikuyu pasture = annual ryegrass = maize (ZT) = maize (CT) < native grassland indicating that greatest catabolic diversity existed under native grassland and least diversity existed under exotic forest. It was concluded that land use had substantial effects on the size, activity and diversity of the soil microbial community and that these changes could be broadly related to changes in soil organic matter content.

40|$|Calibration {{methods for}} {{quantitative}} on-site sampling using solid phase microextraction (SPME) were developed based on diffusion mass transfer theory. This was investigated using adsorptive polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) and Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) SPME fiber coatings with volatile aromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene) as test analytes. Parameters that affected the extraction process (sampling time, analyte concentration, water velocity, and temperature) were investigated. Very short sampling times (10 - 300 s) and sorbents {{with a strong}} affinity and large capacity were used to ensure a 'zero sink' effect calibrate process. It was found that mass uptake of analyte changed linearly with concentration. Increase of water velocity increased mass uptake, though the increase is not linear. Temperature did not affect mass uptake significantly under typical field sampling conditions. To further describe rapid SPME analysis of aqueous samples, a new model translated from heat transfer to a circular cylinder in cross flow was used. An empirical correlation to this model was used to predict the mass transfer coefficient. Findings indicated that the predicted mass uptake compared well with experimental mass uptake. The new model also predicted rapid air sampling accurately. To further integrate the sampling and analysis processes, especially for on-site or in-vivo investigations where {{the composition of the}} sample matrix is very complicated and/or agitation of the sample matrix is variable or unknown, a new approach for calibration was developed. This involved the loading internal standards onto the extraction fiber prior to the extraction step. During sampling, the standard partially desorbs into the sample matrix and the rate at which this process occurs, was for calibration. The kinetics of the absorption/desorption was investigated, and the isotropy of the two processes was demonstrated, thus validating this approach for calibration. A modified SPME device was used as a passive sampler to determine the time-weighted average (TWA) concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air. The sampler collects the VOCs by the mechanism of molecular diffusion and sorption on to a coated fiber as collection medium. This process was shown to be described by Fick's first law of diffusion, whereby the amount of analyte accumulated over time enable measurement of the TWA concentration to which the sampler was exposed. TWA passive sampling with a SPME device was shown to be almost independent of face velocity, and to be more tolerant of high and low analyte concentrations and long and short sampling times, because of the ease with which the diffusional path length could be changed. Environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, relative humidity, and ozone) had little or no effect on sampling rate. When the SPME device was tested in the field and the results compared with those from National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) method 1501 good agreement was obtained. To facilitate the use of SPME for field sampling, a new field sampler was designed and tested. The sampler was versatile and user-friendly. The SPME fiber can be positioned precisely inside the needle for TWA sampling, or exposed completely outside the needle for rapid sampling. The needle is protected within a shield at all times hereby eliminating the risk of operator injury and fiber damage. A replaceable Teflon cap is used to seal the needle to preserve sample integrity. Factors that affect the preservation of sample integrity (sorbent efficiency, temperature, and sealing materials) were studied. The use of a highly efficient sorbent is recommended as the first choice for the preservation of sample integrity. Teflon was a good material for sealing the fiber needle, had little memory effect, and could be used repeatedly. To address adsorption of high boiling point <b>compounds</b> on fiber <b>needles,</b> several kinds of deactivated needles were evaluated. RSC- 2 blue fiber needles were the more effective. A preliminary field sampling investigation demonstrated the validity of the new SPME device for field applications...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest in environmental analysis among the scientific community. Monitoring of organic and inorganic environmental pollutants and investigations into their potential to adversely affect human health has prompted {{the development of new}} methodologies for environmental analysis. Generally, the analytical procedure is comprised of several steps, such as sample collection, sample preparation, analysis, and data processing. Sample preparation is a critical step in the development of new methodologies, and considered the main source of uncertainty in the analysis of environmental samples. In this context, several sample preparation techniques have been recently developed and optimized with aims to miniaturize extraction, automate procedures, and reduce or circumvent solvent consumption. The currently presented research focused on further development and novel applications of two sample preparation methods, solid phase microextraction (SPME) and needle trap devices (NT). Solid phase microextraction (SPME) combines sampling, sample preparation, and sample introduction in one step. Analytical sampling by SPME has been employed in a variety of environmental applications. To quantify target analyte content, different calibration approaches can be performed based on the application process. This method is an equilibrium-based sample preparation technique that due to its currently presented configuration provides only information related to free molecules in gas phase. Conversely, the needle trap device, which contains a sorbent packed inside a needle, is an exhaustive, solventless, one-step sample preparation technique that can be easily calibrated. In addition, this approach eliminates errors associated with sample transportation and storage, which can consequently result in more accurate and precise analytical data. This technique is also useful {{for a wide variety of}} applications, including sample preparation of compounds with different chemical and physical properties, as well as varying volatilities. Furthermore, NT is a valuable sample preparation technique that, based on its geometry, allows it to act as a filter for collection of particles. The initial part of this research focused on new developments in the geometry of needle trap devices. Subsequently, particular attention was dedicated to the principles of collection efficiency as well as particle trapping mechanisms for filtration of particulate matter and aerosols by NTs. Finally, this thesis presents a joint application of NT and SPME for determination of target analytes in gaseous and particulate phases. The first part of this thesis provides a thorough evaluation of new prototypes of the extended tip needle trap device (NT), and a summary of their application towards in vivo sampling of biological emissions, as well as active/passive on-site sampling of indoor air. To increase desorption efficiency, the newly proposed NT device was constructed with a side hole above the sorbent and an extended tip that fits inside the restriction of the narrow neck liner. The commercial prototype needles were packed with divinylbenzene particles and evaluated in terms of robustness after multiple uses, as well as extracted amounts of volatile organic <b>compounds</b> (VOCs). Successively, <b>needles</b> were packed in-lab with synthesized highly cross-linked PDMS as a frit to immobilize carboxen (Car) particles. The performance of needles packed with PDMS and Car were then compared in regards to different flow rates. For passive sampling, the needles were packed with Car particles embedded in PDMS in order to simplify calculations in passive mode. Good performance was obtained using the NT devices as spot samplers, as well as passive samplers under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Commercial modified prototypes of NT were used to study biogenic emissions of pine trees. The new lab-made NT was then applied in the analysis of indoor air in a polymer synthesis laboratory in both active and passive approaches. Additionally, this thesis presents work conducted on the development and evaluation of an appropriate frit for NT devices. In order to investigate the feasibility of the NT device for analysis of nanometer-sized particles in high efficiency, three different filters, nanofibrous filter, porous membrane, and granular filter, were used to entrap dioctyl phthalate particles of diameters ranging between 10 - 200 nm. Subsequently, a series of experiments were carried out to estimate and compare the collection efficiency and pressure drop of the above mentioned filters. The effect of face velocity, fiber thickness, and fiber-packing density on filtration efficiency was also evaluated for each filter. The data showed that the efficiency curves for different filters demonstrated a lower efficiency for particle of sizes ranging between 40 to 60 nm, and at a face velocity of 17 cm/s. Calculated theoretical values based on the filtration model showed good agreement with the experimental data. This study demonstrated that use of the nanofibrous filter led to a significant improvement in the filtration efficiency of the NT device. Nevertheless, the proposed porous membrane was chosen as an appropriate filter instead for subsequent studies due to its relative simplicity of packing through the needle trap devices and high reproducibility in regards to packing procedure in comparison to the nanofribrous filter, which has high efficiency and poor reproducibility. Finally, needle-trap (NT) devices were applied in conjunction with solid phase microextraction (SPME) towards the measurement of free and particle-bound fragrances derived from personal care products. In order to simulate in-use exposure scenarios, the experiments were conducted in a specially constructed 0. 1 m 3 chamber configured to simulate in-use conditions in a bathroom. The perfumed body spray was introduced to the chamber in three second bursts to mimic typical consumer use. The produced aerosol was then continuously monitored using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) to determine the number and size of particles; characterization of the aerosol size distribution is an important factor when considering risk assessment, as particles < 7 µm are considered respirable and those of size < 20 µm inhalable. Needle trap devices using a range of packing materials were evaluated for measurement of total concentrations of target analytes, while free concentrations of the fragrance present in the aerosol spray were determined concurrently by SPME based on the external calibration method. The results showed similar concentration trends with the same sampling devices over different days...|$|R
