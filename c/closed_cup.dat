5000|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> testers: non-equilibrial, such as Pensky-Martens, where the vapours above the liquid are not in {{temperature}} equilibrium with the liquid, and equilibrial, such as Small Scale (commonly known as Setaflash), where the vapours are deemed to be in temperature equilibrium with the liquid. In both these types, the cups are sealed with a lid through which the ignition source can be introduced. <b>Closed</b> <b>cup</b> testers normally give lower values for the flash point than open cup (typically [...] lower) and are a better approximation to the temperature at which the vapour pressure reaches the lower flammable limit.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of flash point measurement: open cup and <b>closed</b> <b>cup.</b> In open cup devices, the sample is {{contained}} in an open cup which is heated and, at intervals, a flame brought over the surface. The measured flash point will actually vary with {{the height of the}} flame above the liquid surface and, at sufficient height, the measured flash point temperature will coincide with the fire point. The best-known example is the Cleveland open cup (COC).|$|E
5000|$|... ==Description== Montia diffusa is {{an annual}} herb growing erect to about 20 centimeters in maximum height, its stem {{branching}} intricately. The diamond or lance-shaped leaves are alternately arranged and {{measure up to}} 5 centimeters in length, not counting their long petioles. The inflorescence is a raceme of 3 or more flowers. Each flower has usually five pink or white petals under half a centimeter in length blooming from a nearly <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> of small green sepals wrapped around their bases.|$|E
50|$|The {{flower of}} Adenanthos is {{structurally}} {{the same as}} that of many other Proteaceae. Flower parts occur in multiples of four (tetramerous), but the four tepals are fused into a long, narrow perianth-tube topped by a <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> (the limb); the filament of each stamen is fused along its entire length with the midrib of a tepal, so that the anthers appear almost sessile, trapped within the limb; and the four carpels form a single compound pistil, the apex of which is also trapped within the limb. Four prominent scale-like nectaries surround the ovary.|$|E

5000|$|The black ascomata of Loramyces juncicola reach diameters {{of roughly}} 1.5 - 2 mm; they are shaped like {{flattened}} spheres when mature. Atop the ascomata are openings (ostioles) that are 20-30 µm wide and that protrude from the surface. After the ascomata have released their grey-colored ascospores, the top portion typically disintegrates leaving a partially <b>closed</b> <b>cup.</b> The spores {{of this species}} are hyaline, thin-walled, and spindle-shaped with dimensions of 17-22 µm long and 4-6 µm wide. The ascospores, which are surrounded by a gelatinous matrix, are divided into two cells by a septa. The [...] cell has a bluntly rounded point, while the [...] cell is thin and thread-like, bearing a slightly curved tail-like appendage.|$|E
50|$|Proteaceae flower parts {{occur in}} fours, but the four tepals are fused into a long, narrow tube with a <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> at the top, and the {{filaments}} {{of the four}} stamens are fused to the tepals, {{in such a way}} that the anthers are enclosed within the cup. The pistil initially passes along the inside of the perianth tube, so the stigma, too, is enclosed within the cup. As the flower develops, the pistil grows rapidly. Since the stigma is trapped, the style must bend to elongate, and eventually it bends so far, it splits the perianth along one seam. The style continues to grow until anthesis, when the nectaries begin to produce nectar. At this time, the perianth splits into its component tepals, the cup splits apart, and the pistil is released to spring more or less upright.|$|E
50|$|The nest {{is often}} {{suspended}} from a hanging branch usually at no great altitude, although Eric Simms reported nests at heights from 2.5 to 20 m. Firecrests may favour breeding close to northern goshawk nests. That large bird will prey on potential predators of the firecrest such as Eurasian sparrowhawks, and nest robbers like grey squirrels, Eurasian jays and great spotted woodpeckers. As is typical for the family, the nest is a <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> built in three layers {{with a small}} entrance hole near its top. The nest's outer layer is made from moss, small twigs, cobwebs and lichen, the spider webs also being used to attach the nest to the thin branches that support it. The middle layer is moss, and this is lined with feathers (up to 3,000) and hair. The nest is smaller, deeper and more compact {{than that of the}} goldcrest, about 8 cm across and 5 - 7 cm deep, with a wall thickness of about 2 cm. The nest is constructed by the female alone, although the male will accompany the female while she builds the nest over a period of a few days to three weeks.|$|E

In the case of some low concentrated flammable liquid aqueous solutions, the existence of a flash point is not very well defined, and their flammability is not precisely known. The experimental measurements of flash points are described in numerous national or international standards, which differ by their range of validity and by the specified experimental conditions. The flash point of ethanol, acetone, acetic acid and formic acid aqueous solutions was measured using Abel and Pensky-Martens in <b>close</b> <b>cup</b> methods, chosen regarding predicted values of flash point. Results obtained show that, for the most flammable products, such as acetone or ethanol, weakly concentrated aqueous solutions still remains flammable.

5000|$|Indulin AA-86 is {{the trade}} name (held by Ingevity) for a {{proprietary}} formula used for an asphalt emulsifying agent. As such, {{it does not}} have a given CAS number. Its composition is only provided subject to a nondisclosure agreement. [...] The company reports that it is a fatty amine derivative, an amber viscous liquid, pH 9 to 11 at a 15% w/w concentration, reactive with acids and oxidizing agents, with a relative density of 0.89, boiling point greater than 180 C and a <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> flash point of 126 C. It is not volatile, but is identified as a hazard for inhalation, eye or skin contact and must be used with adequate ventilation. The compound is stable and hazardous decomposition products should not be produced during normal use, but in a fire can produce carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, so firefighters are advised to wear self-contained breathing apparatus. State regulatory disclosures indicate it contains ethyl acrylate. According to the US EPA, [...] "the hydrochloric salt of this product is only acceptable for use in the production of asphalt emulsions, and the emulsions may only be used in asphalt paving applications." [...] Standard usage involves partial neutralization of basic indulin with hydrochloric acid to form a salt, for a 1.0:1.1 ratio of indulin to its salt.|$|E
5000|$|The male Madeira {{firecrest}} sings {{during the}} breeding season, often with its crest raised, {{and has a}} display which involves pointing its bill at another bird, showing the crest and strong face pattern. This differs from the display of the plainer-faced goldcrest, which bows its head to emphasize the crest. The Madeira firecrest is monogamous. As is typical for the family, the nest is a <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> built in three layers with a small entrance hole near its top.

The clutch size is unknown, but believed to be smaller than the 7-12 of the nominate race of common firecrest. The female incubates the eggs for 14.5 to 16.5 days to hatching, and broods the chicks, which fledge 19 to 20 days after hatching. Both parents feed the chicks and fledged young.|$|E
40|$|Investigation on the <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> {{flash point}} of {{visbreaking}} residue and finished fuel oil {{was carried out}} inthe Lukoil Neftochim Bourgas, Bulgaria (LNB).

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources, Wildlife, 2006 I {{examined}} {{the effect of}} forest buffer width and nest site characteristics on the nest survival of forest birds on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. During 2002 and 2003, a total of 164 nests of three <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> (Chestnut-backed Chickadee (Parus rufescens), Red-breasted Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus ruber) and Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes)) and four open cup (Pacific-slope Flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis), Hermit Thrush (Cartharus guttatus), Swainson???s Thrush (Cartharus ustulatus) and Varied Thrush (Ixoreus naevius)) species were monitored within forested buffers along the coastline. I modeled daily survival rate (DSR) of closed (DSR = 0. 989) and open (DSR = 0. 982) cup nesting species independently using variables at two spatial scales. For <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> nests the model best describing variation in DSR included height of nest and species. Nests located higher from the ground had better nest success. Variation in DSR of open cup nests was best explained by species. Pacific-slope Flycatcher nests had the highest success (87 %) whereas Varied Thrush nests had the lowest (21 %). DSR of Hermit Thrush nests, the only species for which I had adequate data to analyze separately, was related to distance to the coastline. Species with low DSR had similar nest site characteristics including diameter of nesting substrate and average percentage concealment of nest. However, these nest site characteristics alone do not determine DSR of the species evaluated in my study. Width of coastal forested buffers {{appears to have a}} negligible effect on DSR, however, some species exhibited low DSR within the buffers and further examination of these species is recommended.

40|$|Actin {{dynamics}} and myosin (Myo) contractile forces {{are necessary for}} formation and closure of the phagocytic cup. In Dictyostelium, the actin-binding protein Abp 1 and myosin IK are enriched in the <b>closing</b> <b>cup</b> and especially at an actin-dense constriction furrow formed {{around the neck of}} engulfed budded yeasts. This phagocytic furrow consists of concentric overlapping rings of MyoK, Abp 1, Arp 3, coronin, and myosin II, following an order strikingly reminiscent of the overall organization of the lamellipodium of migrating cells. Mutation analyses of MyoK revealed that both a C-terminal farnesylation membrane anchor and a Gly-Pro-Arg domain that interacts with profilin and Abp 1 were necessary for proper localization in the furrow and efficient phagocytosis. Consequently, we measured the binding affinities of these interactions and unraveled further interactions with profilins, dynamin A, and PakB. Due to the redundancy of the interaction network, we hypothesize that MyoK and Abp 1 are restricted to regulatory roles and might affect the dynamic of cup progression. Indeed, phagocytic uptake was regulated antagonistically by MyoK and Abp 1. MyoK is phosphorylated by PakB and positively regulates phagocytosis, whereas binding of Abp 1 negatively regulates PakB and MyoK. We conclude that a MyoK-Abp 1 -PakB circuit acts as a switch regulating phagocytosis efficiency of large particles...|$|R
5000|$|These {{are members}} of the swallow family of birds, and are placed in the Hirundininae {{subfamily}} which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins. DNA sequence studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built. [...] The groups are the [...] "core martins" [...] including burrowing species like the sand martin, the [...] "nest-adopters", which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities, and the [...] "mud nest builders". Ptyonoprogne species construct a mud nest and therefore belong to the latter group; They resemble the Hirundo species in that they make open cup nests, whereas Delichon martins build <b>closed</b> <b>cups,</b> and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows, have retort-like closed nests with an entrance tunnel. The genus Ptyonoprogne is closely related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA analysis showed that a coherent enlarged Hirundo genus should contain all the mud-builder genera. Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the DNA research showed that if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off.|$|R
