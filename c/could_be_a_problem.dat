Human rights issues do not inform the foreign policies of these two countries to the same extent as they do the policies of other large states such as Japan, India, the EU states and the United States.

25|$|The lander {{arrived at}} night at 2:56:55 Mars local solar time (16:56:55 UTC) on July 4, 1997. The lander {{had to wait}} until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to Earth. The landing site was located at 19.30° north {{latitude}} and 33.52° west longitude in Ares Vallis, only 19 kilometres southwest of the center of the 200km wide landing site ellipse. During Sol 1, the first Martian solar day the lander spent on the planet, the lander took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements. Once the data was received, the engineers realized that one of the airbags hadn't fully deflated and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for the forthcoming traverse of Sojourners descent ramp. To solve the problem, they sent commands to the lander to raise one of its petals and perform additional retraction to flatten the airbag. The procedure was a success and on Sol 2, Sojourner was released, stood up and backed down one of two ramps.|$|E

500|$|In {{reviews for}} the first five episodes of the series, Brian Lowry of Variety felt that [...] "Compared to Marvel's {{experience}} with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for ABC, operating in Netflix's pay-to-view world is clearly liberating" [...] in terms of what can be done and shown. Matt Patches of Esquire added, [...] "The show's exterior recasts the high fructose, splash page aesthethic of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America with neo-noir attitude. Goddard and DeKnight drench Daredevil in shadows and blood." [...] He compared Daredevil to [...] "a TV spinoff" [...] of Christopher Nolans Batman films, and praised Cox and D'Onofrio's portrayals, while criticizing a subplot involving Nelson and Page and noting that the slow pacing of Daredevil, in which story may be stretched out more than needs be, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for binge-watchers. Victoria McNally of MTV felt the early episodes' fight sequences were [...] "filmed beautifully" [...] and enjoyed that they featured little CGI, while also calling Henson [...] "perfectly cast and endlessly amusing" [...] as Nelson.|$|E
500|$|... "Marry Me a Little, Marry Me a Little More" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Greenstein and Bill Wrubel and was {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. It was the one-hundredth episode of Will & Grace, and the producers celebrated the milestone by planning an hour-long episode followed by a clip show featuring highlights and outtakes from past seasons. In an interview with The Jewish Journal in 2001, David Kohan, the co-creator of Will & Grace, in discussing the lead characters, stated that a marriage <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for the dynamic between the two characters: [...] "I'd love for [...] to find a Jewish love interest, but that relationship might actually work, and then there'd be no more 'Will & Grace'." [...] Kohan, however, changed his mind {{by the time of}} a follow-up interview in 2002: he noted that the characters had to [...] "move on forward in their lives in some way" [...] and it would be unlikely that Grace's possible husband would displace her gay best friend, Will. In July 2002, reports surfaced that a possible wedding involving Grace would happen, but the staff were not allowed to reveal anything.|$|E

500|$|While {{planning}} the fourth season, Marvel {{suggested that the}} series introduce Ghost Rider, after the character's film rights had returned to Marvel from Sony in May 2013. Loeb felt that this made the season unquestionably [...] "the series' biggest" [...] with the [...] "most ambitious story yet". He added that [...] "one {{of the things that}} we talked about is, S.H.I.E.L.D. always looked out for the weird, the unusual, the things that were and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for the public," [...] and Marvel realized that Ghost Rider's abilities, which are more mystical than anything seen in the series to date, opened up [...] "a quarter of the universe that we haven't really spent a lot of time exploring ... what happens if our very real, our very grounded agents who are very much a family have to take on something that is as bizarre and powerful and unique as Ghost Rider." [...] Bell added that the producers would have been willing to give an entire season of the show to a Ghost Rider arc if the season was 13 episodes or less, but 22 episodes seemed too long to [...] "feel like one flavor".|$|E
500|$|Flight Unlimited {{was placed}} in direct {{competition}} with several major flight simulator franchises. Before the game's release, Shelby Bateman of Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "1995 {{is going to be}} a real dogfight in the flight-sim and aerial-combat categories, and LookingGlass [...] is betting its bankroll ... that it can capture significant market share from the likes of Microsoft Flight Simulator and the debut of Spectrum HoloByte's Falcon 4.0, among others." [...] Describing the situation, Johnny L. Wilson of Computer Gaming World wrote, [...] "The games that sell big are the ones that allow you to blow stuff up, so, if anything, that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for Flight Unlimited." [...] Doug Church explained that, because the game did not feature combat and bore little resemblance to Microsoft Flight Simulator, the team spent [...] "many late nights" [...] on marketing strategies. However, he noted that the game had a wide appeal among those who tested it during development, which he called [...] "a really good sign". Talking to Bernie Yee of PC Gamer US, Paul Neurath said that he thought the game would sell well. Yee noted that Neurath [...] "fully [...] it to prove more popular than Microsoft Flight Simulator".|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Yaakov Ariel, {{the chief}} rabbi of Ramat Gan, criticized these minyanim in Hazofe, arguing {{that they do}} not conform to Jewish law or to Orthodox ideals of prayer, in which men and women must be kept {{separate}} at all times.

He argued that because this sexual distraction is part of human nature, waiving it is out of the question. He also wrote that there <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of kol isha (hearing a woman's singing voice).

2500|$|Accuracy and {{repeatability}} {{are different}} measures. Repeatability {{is usually the}} most important criterion for a robot and {{is similar to the}} concept of 'precision' in measurement—see accuracy and precision. ISO 9283 [...] sets out a method whereby both accuracy and repeatability can be measured. Typically a robot is sent to a taught position a number of times and the error is measured at each return to the position after visiting 4 other positions. Repeatability is then quantified using the standard deviation of those samples in all three dimensions. A typical robot can, of course make a positional error exceeding that and that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for the process. Moreover, the repeatability is different {{in different parts of the}} working envelope and also changes with speed and payload. ISO 9283 specifies that accuracy and repeatability should be measured at maximum speed and at maximum payload. But this results in pessimistic values whereas the robot could be much more accurate and repeatable at light loads and speeds.|$|E
2500|$|Battle is {{conducted}} {{from a combination}} of first and third-person perspectives. The character plans his or her attack from a first person perspective, selecting which opponents to target (including the ability to target specific monsters in a single group) and then switches to a moving third-person view to watch the main character's party and the monsters battle for the round. Combat includes a combo system available both to players and monsters. When two or more identical attacks are performed consecutively on the same opponent the attack damage increases by a multiplier. A two-hit combo receives a 1.1x multiplier (1.2x in the NA and UK version), a three-hit combo a 1.5x multiplier, and a four-hit combo a 2.0x multiplier. Experience points earned from battle are divided amongst all party members based on level; higher level characters receive a greater share of the experience points than lower level characters. [...] Characters who are killed during a battle still receive some experience as well, depending on how much of the battle they remained alive for. The tension system from Dragon Quest VIII makes a return, allowing characters to store up power to increase the potency of the next attack or spell. Also, some monsters will be provoked when certain actions are performed: provoked enemies will focus their attacks on the offending party member, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> if one character ends up provoking many enemies in one action as they run a great risk of being targeted by a combo.|$|E
60|$|Another savage {{trait of}} our time is the {{disposition}} to talk about material substances instead of about ideas. The old civilisation talked about the sin of gluttony or excess.

The thing is an inverted form of fetish worship; it is no sillier to say that a bottle is a god than to say that a bottle is a devil. The people who talk about the curse of drink will probably progress down that dark hill. In a little while we shall have them calling the practice of wife-beating the Problem of Pokers; the habit of housebreaking will be called the Problem of the Skeleton-Key Trade; and for all I know they may try to prevent forgery by shutting up all the stationers' shops by Act of Parliament.|$|E
