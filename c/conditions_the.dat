30|$|<b>The</b> <b>Condition</b> option {{has to be}} used in {{combination}} with the Observe option and can be used both in request and response messages. In a GET request message, <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> option represents <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>the</b> client wants to apply to the observation relationship. It is used to describe the resource states the client is interested in. In response to the initial GET request message, <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> option, together with the Observe option, indicates that the client has been added to the list of observers and that notifications will be sent only when the resource state meets <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> specified in <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> option. In all further notifications, <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> option identifies <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> to which <b>the</b> notification applies. In the following subsections we will further describe the semantics and usage of <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> option, illustrating <b>the</b> capabilities of this extension.|$|R
