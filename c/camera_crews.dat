5|$|<b>Camera</b> <b>crews</b> spent 10 {{days from}} November 5â€“18, 2005 to film {{sequences}} that would involve intense visual effects so Sony Pictures Imageworks could begin {{work on the}} shots early in the project. The same steps had been taken for Spider-Man 2 to begin producing visual effects early for sequences involving the villain Doctor Octopus.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to France2, the Associated Press and Reuters also had <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> at the junction. They captured brief {{footage of the}} al-Durrahs and Abu Rahma. Abu Rahma was the only journalist to film the moment the al-Durrahs were shot.|$|E
5|$|There was mayhem {{outside the}} court {{premises}} with large crowds gathering around restively and <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> waiting {{to capture the}} trouble. In some places, buses, taxis and autorickshaws were set on fire, in others areas public transport just stayed off the roads. The office of the state Congress spokesperson Sanjay Nirupam was also vandalised.|$|E

5|$|As a {{regional}} centre for the Riverina and South West Slopes, Wagga Wagga {{is home to}} a number of regional media outlets. Both WIN Television and Prime7 air half-hour local news programs on weeknights. The bulletins are presented from studios in Wollongong and Canberra respectively with reporters and <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> for both services based in newsrooms in the city. Since 2006, WIN's weeknight bulletin has also included coverage of the Griffith area. In addition, Southern Cross Nine runs a small sales office and airs short local news updates from its Canberra studios throughout the day. Since 2017, Southern Cross Nine's new hour long weeknight bulletin from Wagga Wagga is Nine News Riverina.|$|E
5|$|At 3:54p.m. BST on 23 July 2011, two {{ambulances}} {{were called}} to Winehouse's home in Camden, London. Winehouse was pronounced dead at the scene. Shortly afterwards, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that she had died. After her death was announced, media and <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> appeared, as crowds gathered near Winehouse's residence to pay their respects. Forensic investigators entered the flat as police cordoned off the street outside; they recovered one small and two large bottles of vodka from her room. After her death, the singer broke her second Guinness World Record: for the most songs by a woman to simultaneously appear on the UK singles chart, with eight.|$|E
5|$|Key issues include {{how much}} footage was shot; {{that it was}} blurred at the moment Jamal and Muhammad were hit; that France2 cut a few seconds in which the boy moves; and that the {{cameraman}} stopped filming at that point. Despite the presence of <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c.17minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one. There is no film {{of the death of}} the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the first}} scene filmed was the final scene {{to appear in the}} film (shot during the filming of Attack of the Clones in 2000), {{principal}} photography on the film occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with additional photography occurring at Shepperton Studios and Elstree Studios in London from August 2004 to January 31, 2005. The initial filming took place on sound stages at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film. These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk, which were filmed in Phuket, Thailand (they were later damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami). The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting {{at the same time that}} Mount Etna erupted in Italy. <b>Camera</b> <b>crews</b> were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar.|$|E
5|$|On July 17, 1955, Disneyland and the Disneyland Railroad opened, and the {{day began}} with Walt Disney driving the DRR's No. 2 {{locomotive}} and its passenger train into Main Street, U.S.A. Station with California Governor Goodwin J. Knight and AT Railway President Fred G. Gurley riding in the locomotive's cab. They were greeted at the station's platform by the park opening ceremony's host Art Linkletter, actor Ronald Reagan, and several television <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> broadcasting the festivities nationwide. After exiting the locomotive, Linkletter briefly interviewed Disney, Knight, and Gurley before they walked towards the town square in the Main Street, U.S.A. section where Disney officially dedicated Disneyland. The DRR eventually {{became one of the}} most popular steam-powered railroads in the world with an estimated 6.6 million passengers each year.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Spider-Man 3 {{began on}} January 16, 2006 and wrapped in July 2006 after over 100 days of filming. The team filmed in Los Angeles until May 19, 2006. In spring 2006, film location manager Peter Martorano brought <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> to Cleveland {{due to the}} Greater Cleveland Film Commission offering production space at the city's convention center at no cost. In Cleveland, they shot the battle between Spider-Man and Sandman in the armored car. Afterwards, the team moved to Manhattan, where filming took place at various locations, including One Chase Manhattan Plaza, from May 26, 2006 until July 1, 2006. Shooting placed a strain on Raimi, who often had to move between several units to complete the picture. Shooting was also difficult for cinematographer Bill Pope, as the symbiote Spider-Man, Venom, and the New Goblin were costumed in black during fight scenes taking place at night.|$|E

5|$|Promotion for the St-Pierre and Penn contest {{began in}} November 2008, with UFC President Dana White, {{and the two}} main event fighters embarking on {{publicity}} tours in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and Honolulu, Hawaii. The fighters answered various fan questions, and signed autographs. In an effort to further promote the contest, the UFC introduced UFC Primetime, a three-part series that cost $1.7 million to produce. UFC Primetime detailed the final preparations of St-Pierre and Penn's before their fight. Spike aired the half-hour episodes on the final three Wednesdays {{leading up to the}} fight, beginning on January 14, 2009 and concluding on January 28, 2009. <b>Camera</b> <b>crews</b> spent twenty five days with each fighter rather than the three days for a standard UFC Countdown preview show, and episodes aired shortly after they were filmed. The episodes were aired quickly to provide weekly updates on each fighter's current status. After the first episode aired, it was reported by MMAjunkie.com that B.J. Penn was unhappy with his portrayal in the program, and wanted to withdraw from the project. Penn made a subsequent appearance on TapouT radio to discuss this report and confirmed that he has taken issue with his portrayal on the show. He was adamant that he would not continue to allow filming unless his portrayal changed. In the end, UFC Primetime proved to be a ratings success, as it was announced by Spike that the program was the most watched UFC preview show ever, drawing 1.4 million viewers for its first episode (880,000 viewers for first airing and 614,000 viewers for an immediate repeat). The second episode averaged 825,000 viewers, while the third episode drew 662,000 viewers.|$|E

50|$|On October 30, 1979 an NBC <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> was {{following}} {{a group of}} Los Angeles Fire Department firefighters and paramedics. A call came in about a man having a heart attack. The <b>camera</b> <b>crew</b> and the paramedics rushed {{to the home of}} Brownie and Dave Miller. The <b>camera</b> <b>crew,</b> without consent from anyone, rushed into the house with the paramedics and taped footage of Mr. Dave Miller having what would be a fatal heart attack. The crew later that night would put the footage on the air, also without consent. Brownie Miller filed suit against NBC, Ruben Norte (a producer for NBC) and the city of Los Angeles for trespass, invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress.|$|R
25|$|Once the {{decision}} is made to arrest the suspect, or they have voluntarily surrendered, they are photographed and fingerprinted at a police station, and then taken to the appropriate courthouse for an arraignment or similar procedure that brings the case into the legal system. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) usually advises the media as to when this will happen in cases that may be of interest; other large departments do not, so photographers and <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> wait at the central location in hopes of getting a perp-walk image. In 2011, some New York <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> and photographers waited 15 hours for former International Monetary Fund director Dominique Strauss-Kahn to be brought by for his arraignment on charges of sexually assaulting a hotel maid.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of media, reporters, <b>camera</b> <b>crews,</b> {{satellite}} {{trucks and}} photographers {{descended on the}} small community, taking over yards and setting up camp outside the Sago Baptist Church and at the mine's coal processing plant.

25|$|Shooting {{episodes of}} Deadliest Catch is a {{dangerous}} occupation for the <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> on board the boats. In the early seasons, when many of the <b>camera</b> <b>crews</b> {{had little or no}} experience on crab boats, they frequently ran into dangers not normally encountered when shooting a documentary. Northwestern captain Sig Hansen told talk show host Jimmy Kimmel that he saved a cameraman's life during the first season, screaming at him {{to get out of the}} way just seconds before a 900-pound crab pot swinging from a crane crossed the space where the cameraman was standing. In another incident, showcased on the behind the scenes special, an inattentive cameraman had his leg fall through an open hatch on the deck of one of the boats when he unwittingly stepped into the hole, suffering three broken ribs (and, according to the cameraman, having to buy a case of beer for the entire crew as per tradition on crab boats).|$|E
