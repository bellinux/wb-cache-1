5|$|Whilst {{working on}} the Midland Railway's main line, Barlow {{established}} that the replacement of sleepers was a larger {{part of the cost}} of track maintenance than the replacement of rails because the sleepers decayed more quickly than the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>providing</b> and replacing sleepers, he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a wide flanged profile which could be laid directly on to track ballast without the need for sleepers, with just periodic tie-bars to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.|$|E
5|$|Henry III {{added to}} the {{endowment}} left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of £81, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost bankrupt. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an administrator, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems on the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>providing</b> hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king's sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey's income never recovered and it settled into what {{has been described as}} genteel poverty.|$|E

40|$|Heterogeneous Social Dilemmas: The Case of Social Support” {{studies the}} level of social support between {{heterogeneous}} actors. We consider heterogeneity with respect to several individual properties: the likelihood of needing support, the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>providing</b> support, and the benefits from receiving support. We investigate whether more support is provided by homogeneous actors than by heterogeneous actors for different kinds of heterogeneity. Social support in dyadic relations between two actors is modeled as an Iterated Support Game. We derive hypotheses on actors' supportive behavior from game-theoretic analyses and test them with data from laboratory experiments. We find, for instance, that actors who only differ in their likelihood of needing support help each other less, the more their likelihoods of needing support differ. However, if actors also differ in their <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>providing</b> support, this might decrease as well as increase support among the actors, depending on who has the higher <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>providing</b> support...|$|R

25|$|The {{reasons for}} the abbey's abrupt descent into debt are unclear. Local {{historian}} Frank Latham has speculated that the abbey's proximity to the Chester–Shrewsbury road proved an intolerable drain on its resources. The abbey {{was one of four}} to complain to Edward, the Black Prince in 1351 about the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>providing</b> hospitality to guests and their servants, horses and hunting hounds. The monks and abbot attributed their situation in 1328 to financial mismanagement by earlier abbots, who had leased out many of the abbey's estates to tenants, often at poor terms. In the early 15th century, previous abbots were again blamed for the abbey's poverty, this time for disposing of timber from the abbey's woods and allowing its buildings to fall into disrepair.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish Navy {{recruited}} their seamen {{using the}} same system as the army, but from coastal provinces and towns (including non-coastal towns). As with the infantry, the farms in coastal areas were organized into rotar, which would each provide a croft (båtmanstorp) for a navy volunteer. Recruits only had duties on board the ships, for example as artillerymen or sailors, and were not used for other combat duties, such as boardings and landings, which were executed by army units transported on the ships. The seamen often served in the navy six months over the summer of every third year. Later, {{from the middle of}} the 18th century, some of the rotar in the cities would pay a fee equal to the approximate <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>providing</b> a boatsman, instead of providing one from among themselves.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{underwriting}} is {{a health}} insurance term {{referring to the}} use of medical or health information in the evaluation of an applicant for coverage, typically for life or health insurance. As part of the underwriting process, an individual's health information may be used in making two decisions: whether to offer or deny coverage and what premium rate to set for the policy. The two most common methods of medical underwriting are known as moratorium underwriting, a relatively simple process, and full medical underwriting, a more indepth analysis of a client's health information. The use of medical underwriting may be restricted by law in certain insurance markets. If allowed, the criteria used should be objective, clearly related to the likely <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>providing</b> coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance system.|$|E
