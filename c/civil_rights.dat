5|$|In the 1950s, the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> legislation since Reconstruction: the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1957. This legislation authorized the Attorney General to sue for injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were deprived, created the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Division within the Department of Justice to enforce <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> through litigation, and created the Commission on <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|E

5|$|As the NAACP {{attracted}} {{more money and}} talent, and {{became the center of}} anti-Bookerite <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> activity, Trotter and the NERL became increasingly marginalized on the left. Trotter would not have as prominent a role in the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> dialogue again. By 1921 the League had been reduced to a handful of Trotter supporters.|$|E
5|$|Dworkin and MacKinnon, however, {{continued}} to discuss <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> litigation {{as a possible}} approach to combating pornography. In the fall of 1983, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the University of Minnesota, to teach a course in literature for the Women's Studies program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography, where they hashed out details of a <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> approach. With encouragement from community activists in south Minneapolis, the Minneapolis city government hired Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft an antipornography <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> ordinance as {{an amendment to the}} Minneapolis city <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> ordinance.|$|E

5|$|In February 2013, the Michigan Department of <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> (MDCR) filed a {{complaint}} with the US Department of Education's Office for <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964. In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.|$|E
5|$|King {{organized}} and led marches for blacks' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic <b>civil</b> <b>rights.</b> Most of these rights were successfully enacted into {{the law of}} the United States {{with the passage of the}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964 and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.|$|E

5|$|A local judge {{issued an}} {{injunction}} that barred any gathering of 3 {{or more people}} affiliated with the SNCC, SCLC, DCVL, or any of 41 named <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> leaders. This injunction temporarily halted <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> activity until King defied it by speaking at Brown Chapel on January 2, 1965. During the 1965 march to Montgomery, Alabama, violence by state police and others against the peaceful marchers resulted in much publicity, making Alabama's racism visible nationwide.|$|E

The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where MalcolmX said the emerging {{nations of the world}} would add their support.|$|E
