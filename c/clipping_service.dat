These services tend to specialize their coverage by subject, industry, size, geography, publication, journalist, or editor. The printed sources, which could be readily monitored, greatly expanded {{with the advent of}} telegraphy and submarine cables in the mid- to late-19th century; the various types of media now available proliferated in the 20th century, with the development of radio, television, the photocopier and the World Wide Web.

40|$|Abstract. Learning ranking {{functions}} {{is crucial}} for solving many problems, ranging from document retrieval to building recommendation systems based on an individual user’s preferences or on collaborative filtering. Learning-to-rank is particularly necessary for adaptive or personalizable tasks, including email prioritization, individualized recommendation systems, personalized news <b>clipping</b> <b>services</b> and so on. Whereas the learning-to-rank challenge has been addressed in the literature, little {{work has been done}} in an active-learning framework, where requisite user feedback is minimized by selecting only the most informative instances to train the rank learner. This paper addresses active rank-learning head on, proposing a new sampling strategy based on minimizing hinge rank loss, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the active sampling method for rankSVM on two standard rank-learning datasets. The proposed method shows convincing results in optimizing three performance metrics, as well as improvement against four baselines including entropybased, divergence-based, uncertainty-based and random sampling methods...|$|R
