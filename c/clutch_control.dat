500|$|The {{radar system}} {{includes}} a [...] wide by [...] high trailer-mounted rotatable antenna array, a power system, a cooling {{system and a}} radar control center. The power system has both no-break and transformer containers, with the former including a diesel generator, an inductive <b>clutch</b> <b>control</b> module and a diesel fuel tank. The transformer container houses transformers, a service generator, a direct current converter and switching racks. The radar's cooling system is a heat exchanger that makes use of inherently redundant cascade cooling machines and incorporates an integral coolant tank and control panels. The radar {{is made up of}} 2,000–2,300 transmit–receive modules and weighs [...] The system is transportable rather than mobile, as it can be moved to other prepared sites, but cannot be set up just anywhere. According to its developer, Green Pine's deployment at a new operational site takes [...] "less than 24 hours".|$|E

50|$|The FMX {{transmission}} is <b>controlled</b> through two <b>clutches</b> called the forward and rear clutches, and two band brakes, called the forward and rear bands. The clutches and bands are operated by hydraulic pressure. In this case, forward means {{closest to the}} engine. When applied, a clutch connects a rotational component to the engine, causing the component to turn, and a band holds the component, preventing it from turning. The forward <b>clutch</b> <b>controls</b> power to the primary sun gear. The rear <b>clutch</b> <b>controls</b> power to the secondary sun gear. Confusingly, the band that holds the rear clutch is called the front band. The rear band holds the planet carrier.|$|R

40|$|<b>Clutch</b> fill <b>control</b> in clutch-to-clutch {{transmissions}} influences shift quality considerably. An oncoming clutch {{should be}} applied synchronously {{with the release of}} an offgoing clutch to shift gear smoothly; therefore, the gap between the piston and clutch plates should be eliminated when the torque capacity is near zero {{at the end of the}} clutch fill phase. Open-loop control is typically implemented for the clutch fill because of the cost of pressure sensor. Low control precision causes underfill or overfill to occur, deteriorating shift quality. In this paper, a mathematical model of an electrohydraulic <b>clutch</b> shift <b>control</b> system is presented. Special dynamic characteristic parameters for optimal <b>clutch</b> fill <b>control</b> are subsequently proposed. An automatic method for predicting initial fill control parameters is proposed to eliminate distinct discrepancies among transmissions caused by manufacturing or assembling errors. To prevent underfill and overfill, a fuzzy adaptive control method is proposed, in which <b>clutch</b> fill <b>control</b> parameters are adjusted self-adaptively and continually. Road vehicle test results proved that applying the fuzzy adaptive method ensures the consistency of shift quality even after the transmission’s status is changed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Clutch</b> <b>control</b> {{refers to}} the act of {{controlling}} {{the speed of a}} vehicle with a manual transmission by partially engaging the clutch plate, using the clutch pedal instead of (or in conjunction with) the accelerator pedal. The purpose of a clutch is in part to allow such control; in particular, a clutch provides transfer of torque between shafts spinning at different speeds. In the extreme, <b>clutch</b> <b>control</b> is used in performance driving, such as starting from a dead stop with the engine producing maximum torque at high RPM.|$|E
50|$|While {{the use of}} <b>clutch</b> <b>control</b> at {{low speed}} {{can be used to}} obtain greater control of {{acceleration}} and engine braking, once a car has picked up sufficient speed the clutch should be fully engaged (pedal released).|$|E
50|$|This {{particular}} use of <b>clutch</b> <b>control</b> {{is frequently}} taught to learning drivers {{as a way}} to control acceleration when pulling away from a complete stop or when driving at very slow speeds while minimizing the chance of stalling the engine.|$|E

50|$|The DB 601 was a {{development}} of the DB 600G with direct fuel injection, which permitted better fuel economy, and eliminated the carburetor cutting out the engine during negative G-loads. The supercharger in the new engine was driven through a stage-less, automatically <b>controlled</b> hydraulic <b>clutch.</b> The supercharger speed was adjusted via the slip in the <b>clutch,</b> <b>controlled</b> by a barometric device. This solution minimized the power loss typical to multispeed superchargers with fixed supercharger gear ratios.|$|R
50|$|The German {{automobile}} manufacturer NSU {{produced an}} automated {{system for the}} rotary-engined NSU Ro 80 saloon car in the 1960s, similar in concept to VW's Automatic Stickshift: a three-speed manual gearbox with a vacuum operated dry <b>clutch</b> <b>controlled</b> by a contact in the gear lever, and a torque converter. There was no clutch pedal, but slightly moving the gearshift closed an electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the clutch. The gear lever itself then could be moved through a standard 'H pattern' gate.|$|R
50|$|The name Self-Changing Gears is {{sometimes}} confusing: the gearboxes {{are not fully}} automatic, selection of gear ratio remains a manual choice, but the gear-changing and any <b>clutch</b> <b>control</b> needed is automated. The gearboxes were {{used in conjunction with}} a fluid coupling so no clutch pedal was needed.|$|E

50|$|Within a year, the {{controller}} had become {{larger and more}} complex. A breadboard electronic version complete with sensor amplifiers and large control modules consumed the entire back end of a station wagon. Input data came from variable reluctance sensors installed at the front drive shaft, rear drive shaft, throttle, brakes, and steering. The goal was to <b>control</b> <b>clutch</b> actuation by <b>controlling</b> current.|$|R
50|$|When {{a car is}} {{in first}} gear, small {{variations}} in engine speed translate to large changes in acceleration and engine braking. However, {{with a combination of}} <b>clutch</b> <b>control</b> and careful use of engine speed, a much smoother ride can be achieved by allowing the clutch to slip. Variations in engine revs are not immediately translated into changes in drive shaft rotation speed, but rather the friction on the clutch plate allows the drive shaft to gradually equalize with the speed of the engine.|$|E
50|$|A {{variable}} force solenoid (VFS) is an electro-hydraulic {{device that}} controls pressure proportionally or inversely proportionally to a signal (voltage or current) {{obtained from the}} on-board controller of a powertrain. A low-flow VFS {{is used as a}} signal level devices for transmission line pressure control or application of clutches. A high-flow VFS controls line pressure directly or are used for direct shift <b>clutch</b> <b>control.</b> A VFS is a type of Transmission Solenoid. One or more VFS can be used in an automatic transmission or installed in an automatic transmission valve body.|$|E
50|$|Sports {{cars were}} made {{accessible}} to drivers with limited physical capabilities by equipping the cars {{with the necessary}} components to convert manual transmission vehicles to hand operation. This was achieved by transferring the <b>clutch</b> <b>control</b> to a small lever located on the gear shift knob; the brake control to a lever {{to the right of}} the lower portion of the steering wheel; and the gas control to an accelerator “ring” which was situated either in front of or behind the steering wheel. The system was easy to learn.|$|E

50|$|Cars with manual {{gearshift}} use a <b>clutch.</b> <b>Clutches</b> are <b>controlled</b> from pedal by {{bowden cable}} or hydraulic systems, some use the fluid {{in common with}} the brake system. As a dead end of the hydraulic system, the slave cylinder is equipped with a bleed screw.|$|R
50|$|The {{driver was}} {{seated on a}} Brooks bicycle saddle, which in {{recognition}} of the lack of vehicle suspension, was carried {{on the end of a}} cantilevered bar that acted as a leaf spring. A wide handlebar on the engine group was used for steering. A squeeze bar the width of this handlebar engaged the <b>clutch.</b> <b>Controls</b> included a hand throttle, a gear lever with two forward and one reverse gears, and a large handbrake lever. The engine unit rotated freely for a full 360° rotation. When used in reverse, the Auto-Truck could either be driven from the saddle, looking backwards over the driver's shoulder; or they could dismount, swivel the engine unit around and control it as a pedestrian-controlled truck from behind.|$|R
5000|$|Development of the [...] Model K street {{motorcycle}} {{began in}} 1950 {{in response to}} increased competition from UK brands Triumph, Norton, and BSA entering the US market in greater numbers due to post-World War II reductions in import duties, and the UK's need to boost exports. Technology found on the European imports, including a hydraulic fork front suspension, a rear swingarm, four-speed transmission, unit construction, and a hand, rather than foot, <b>clutch</b> <b>control,</b> were used on the new K and KR. Alongside the Model K street bike, the KR racer was developed to compete in Class C.|$|E
50|$|The classic scooter design {{features}} a step-through frame and a flat floorboard for the rider's feet. This design is possible because most scooter engines and drive systems {{are attached to}} the rear axle or under the seat. Unlike a conventional motorcycle, in which the engine is mounted on the frame, most modern scooters allow the engine to swing with the rear wheel, while most vintage scooters and some newer retro models have an axle-mounted engine. Modern scooters starting from late-1980s generally use a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while older ones use a manual transmission with the gearshift and <b>clutch</b> <b>control</b> built into the left handlebar.|$|E
50|$|Formula One cars use {{semi-automatic}} sequential gearboxes, with regulations {{stating that}} 8 forward gears (increased from 7 from the 2014 season onwards) and 1 reverse gear must be used, with rear-wheel drive. The gearbox is constructed of carbon titanium, as heat dissipation {{is a critical}} issue, and is bolted {{onto the back of}} the engine. Full automatic gearboxes, and systems such as launch control and traction control, are illegal, to keep driver skill important in controlling the car. The driver initiates gear changes using paddles mounted {{on the back of the}} steering wheel and electro-hydraulics perform the actual change as well as throttle control. <b>Clutch</b> <b>control</b> is also performed electro-hydraulically, except to and from a standstill, when the driver operates the clutch using a lever mounted on the back of the steering wheel.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the Wilson, these <b>clutches</b> were <b>controlled</b> by {{a simple}} {{dashboard}} or column-mounted switch, described as [...] "a cherry on a cocktail stick", and relays. There was no mechanical servo action, so {{no need for the}} Wilson's cam or toggle arrangements and the change gear pedal.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the motor}} driven, <b>clutch</b> <b>controlled</b> panel switch selectors, {{crossbar}} switches using the link principle required incoming and outgoing markers {{to find an}} idle path {{and set up the}} switch train for each call. Earlier crossbar exchanges had used the crossbar switch according to the selector principle, with one input and typically 100 or 200 outputs, similar to a stepping switch. 1XB pioneered the link principle, with each switch able to handle as many phone calls as it had inputs or outputs, typically ten. This innovation diminished the cost of switches, at the expense of more complex controls. The complexity of the circuitry challenged the art of circuit drawings, leading to the development of detached contact drawings, which in turn led to the application of Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps.|$|R
