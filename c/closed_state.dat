5|$|The state {{historic}} site at the Apple River Fort Site {{was set to}} close October 1, 2008 because of cuts in the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency's budget by Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. Supporters of the {{historic site}} in Elizabeth, led by the Apple River Fort Foundation, appealed in protest to legislators and the governor against the closing, lamenting the economic impact the fort's closing {{will have on the}} community. After delay, the proposal to close seven state parks and a dozen state historic sites, including Apple River Fort, went ahead on November 30, 2008. After the impeachment of Illinois Governor Blagojevich, new governor Pat Quinn reopened the <b>closed</b> <b>state</b> parks in February. In March 2009 Quinn announced he is committed to reopening the state historic sites by June 30, 2009.|$|E
25|$|It {{remained}} {{a relatively small}} community until the late 1940s, when developer Henry Doelger established Westlake, a major district of homes and businesses, including the Westlake Shopping Center. On March 22, 1957, Daly City was again the epicenter of an earthquake, this one a 5.3 magnitude quake on the San Andreas Fault, which caused some structural damage in Westlake and <b>closed</b> <b>State</b> Route 1 along the Westlake Palisades. In 1963, Daly City annexed the city of Bayshore. The Cow Palace, located in Bayshore and now within the city limits of Daly City, {{was the site of}} the 1964 Republican National Convention. The Daly City BART station opened on September 11, 1972, providing northern San Mateo County with rail service to downtown San Francisco {{and other parts of the}} Bay Area. The line was extended south to Colma in 1996 and then to Millbrae and the San Francisco International Airport in 2003.|$|E

The landslide <b>closed</b> <b>State</b> Route 530 to Darrington, cutting the town off, leaving Arlington as the center of the coordinated emergency response to the disaster. Arlington was recognized for its role in aiding victims of the disaster and hosted U.S. President Barack Obama during his visit to the site in April.|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms for the Ca 2 +-dependent gating {{of single}} large-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ {{channels}} from cultured rat skeletal muscle were developed using two-dimensional analysis of single-channel currents recorded with the patch clamp technique. To extract and display the essential kinetic information, the kinetic structure, from the single channel currents, adjacent open and closed intervals were binned as pairs and plotted as two-dimensional dwell-time distributions, and the excesses and deficits of the interval pairs over that expected for independent pairing were plotted as dependency plots. The basic {{features of the}} kinetic structure were generally the same among single large-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels, but channel-specific differences were readily apparent, suggesting heterogeneities in the gating. Simple gating schemes drawn from the Monod- Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model for allosteric proteins could approximate the basic features of the Ca 2 + dependence of the kinetic structure. However, consistent differences between the observed and predicted dependency plots suggested that additional brief lifetime <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> not included in MWC-type models {{were involved in the}} gating. Adding these additional brief <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> to the MWC-type models, either beyond the activation pathway (secondary <b>closed</b> <b>states)</b> or within the activation pathway (intermediate <b>closed</b> <b>states),</b> improved the description of the Ca 2 + dependence of the kinetic structure. Secondary <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> are consistent with the closing of secondary gates or channel block. Intermediate <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> are consistent with mechanisms in which the channel activates by passing through a series of intermediate conformations between the more stable open and <b>closed</b> <b>states.</b> It is the added secondary or intermediate <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> that give rise to the majority of the brief closings (flickers) in the gating...|$|R

500|$|This {{reliance}} on buffer conditions caused all devices to change {{state at the}} same time. Subsequent systems could change states based upon the presence of control strands, allowing multiple devices to be independently operated in solution. Some examples of such systems are a [...] "molecular tweezers" [...] design that has an open and a <b>closed</b> <b>state,</b> a device that could switch from a paranemic-crossover (PX) conformation to a double-junction (JX2) conformation, undergoing rotational motion in the process, and a two-dimensional array that could dynamically expand and contract {{in response to control}} strands. [...] Structures have also been made that dynamically open or close, potentially acting as a molecular cage to release or reveal a functional cargo upon opening.|$|E
500|$|Iselle brought {{damaging}} surf {{along the}} east coast of the island. Strong winds unroofed homes near Hilo and downed trees. These winds also felled power lines, causing widespread outages impacting roughly 23,000electricity customers. A geothermal plant in Puna released toxic hydrogen sulfide gases upon losing its power sources, prompting officials to urge an exodus of the immediate area, although a number of nearby residents reported health impacts. A water treatment plant in Kula on Maui also shut down due to power failure, prompting the conservation of water supplies in that area. Iselle's winds also damaged about 1,000 coffee trees and over 2,000 macadamia trees. Damage was heaviest to the papaya crop, with about 60% of the statewide crop destroyed, accounting for $55million in losses (2014USD). Other crops, including coffee, macadamia nuts, and flowers, were also damaged, and overall crop losses in the state were estimated at $66million (2014USD). Only one known death took place {{as a direct result of}} the storm [...] a 19-year-old woman who was swept away by flood waters while hiking in a <b>closed</b> <b>state</b> park. Over 250property owners reported damage, with at least 11houses destroyed, and 28 with major damage. Public damage and the cost to remove debris was estimated at $13.2million. Overall damage in the state is unknown, but estimated by a Hawaiian economist between $148325million (2014USD).|$|E
500|$|While major {{highways}} {{were generally}} cleared by December 29, some local roads reportedly remained covered {{for up to}} a month. About [...] of the New York State Thruway—nearly half its total length—was closed for 27 hours. The snowfall also caused widespread property damage, as the roofs of barns, sheds, and other buildings caved in {{under the weight of the}} snow. An airport hangar in Oneonta collapsed, destroying five aircraft inside. In the aftermath of the storm, many homes sustained water damage from melting snow. [...] "Innumerable" [...] traffic accidents were reported, and many motorists became stranded or were forced to abandon their vehicles. Four people in a stalled automobile died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Also in New York, one man froze to death, and three individuals were killed in a building collapse. In the Capital District, the snow fell with a high water content, occasionally mixing with freezing rain. As a result, it was much denser than normal and proved difficult to manage. The City of Albany spent a record $2million USD on snow removal, and the city restricted nearly all traffic except for vehicles necessary to maintain emergency supplies. Governor Nelson Rockefeller <b>closed</b> <b>state</b> offices in Albany on December 29 and 30, in an effort to enable efficient snow removal. Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd assessed the situation as a [...] "dire emergency".|$|E

2500|$|The most intensively studied type of voltage-dependent ion {{channels}} {{comprises the}} sodium channels involved in fast nerve conduction. These are sometimes known as Hodgkin-Huxley sodium channels {{because they were}} first characterized by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in their Nobel Prize-winning studies of the biophysics of the action potential, but can more conveniently {{be referred to as}} NaV channels. (The [...] "V" [...] stands for [...] "voltage".) [...] An NaV channel has three possible states, known as deactivated, activated, and inactivated. The channel is permeable only to sodium ions when it is in the activated state. When the membrane potential is low, the channel spends most of its time in the deactivated (<b>closed)</b> <b>state.</b> If the membrane potential is raised above a certain level, the channel shows increased probability of transitioning to the activated (open) state. The higher the membrane potential the greater the probability of activation. Once a channel has activated, it will eventually transition to the inactivated (<b>closed)</b> <b>state.</b> It tends then to stay inactivated for some time, but, if the membrane potential becomes low again, the channel will eventually transition back to the deactivated state. During an action potential, most channels of this type go through a cycle deactivated→activated→inactivated→deactivated. This is only the population average behavior, however — an individual channel can in principle make any transition at any time. However, the likelihood of a channel's transitioning from the inactivated state directly to the activated state is very low: A channel in the inactivated state is refractory until it has transitioned back to the deactivated state.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{an action}} {{potential}} has {{occurred at a}} patch of membrane, the membrane patch needs time to recover before it can fire again. [...] At the molecular level, this absolute refractory period corresponds to the time required for the voltage-activated sodium channels to recover from inactivation, i.e., {{to return to their}} <b>closed</b> <b>state.</b> There are many types of voltage-activated potassium channels in neurons, some of them inactivate fast (A-type currents) and some of them inactivate slowly or not inactivate at all; this variability guarantees that there will be always an available source of current for repolarization, even if some of the potassium channels are inactivated because of preceding depolarization. On the other hand, all neuronal voltage-activated sodium channels inactivate within several millisecond during strong depolarization, thus making following depolarization impossible until a substantial fraction of sodium channels have returned to their <b>closed</b> <b>state.</b> Although it limits the frequency of firing, the absolute refractory period ensures that the action potential moves in only one direction along an axon. [...] The currents flowing in due to an action potential spread out in both directions along the axon. However, only the unfired part of the axon can respond with an action potential; the part that has just fired is unresponsive until the action potential is safely out of range and cannot restimulate that part. [...] In the usual orthodromic conduction, the action potential propagates from the axon hillock towards the synaptic knobs (the axonal termini); propagation in the opposite direction—known as antidromic conduction—is very rare. [...] However, if a laboratory axon is stimulated in its middle, both halves of the axon are [...] "fresh", i.e., unfired; then two action potentials will be generated, one traveling towards the axon hillock and the other traveling towards the synaptic knobs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{initiation}} of gene transcription in eukaryotes occurs in specific steps. [...] First, an RNA polymerase along with general transcription factors binds to the promoter {{region of the}} gene to form a closed complex called the preinitiation complex. The subsequent transition of the complex from the <b>closed</b> <b>state</b> to the open state results in the melting or separation of the two DNA strands and the positioning of the template strand to the active site of the RNA polymerase. Without the need of a primer, RNA polymerase can initiate the synthesis of a new RNA chain using the template DNA strand to guide ribonucleotide selection and polymerization chemistry. However, many of the initiated syntheses are aborted before the transcripts reach a significant length (~10 nucleotides). During these abortive cycles, the polymerase keeps making and releasing short transcripts until {{it is able to}} produce a transcript that surpasses ten nucleotides in length. Once this threshold is attained, RNA polymerase passes the promoter and transcription proceeds to the elongation phase.|$|E

LID domains have been found in other kinases, and these domains are regions which are able to move after substrate binding.

40|$|Escherichia coli adenylate kinase (ADK) is a monomeric {{phosphotransferase}} {{enzyme that}} catalyzes reversible transfer of phosphoryl group from ATP to AMP with a large-scale domain motion.
