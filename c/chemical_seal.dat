In studies using cultured skeletal muscle cells, poloxamer 188 (P 188; an 8. 4 -kDa nonionic surfactant) blocks, and neutral dextran (10. 1 kDa) substantially retards, carboxyfluorescein release from electropermeabilized cell membranes. To test whether P 188 administered intravenously could have the same therapeutic effect in vivo, the rat biceps femoris muscle flap attached by its arteriovenous pedicle was electropermeabilized until its electrical resistivity dropped to 50 % of the initial value. P 188 (460 mg/kg) administered intravenously 20 min postshock restored the resistivity to 77 % of the initial value. When P 188 was administered intravenously 5 min before shock, a dose-dependent impedance recovery rate was observed. Neither neutral dextran (460 mg/kg) nor sterile saline was effective.

40|$|On a {{geological}} {{carbon dioxide}} storage site, wells (decommissioned or active) drilled through low-permeable caprock are potential connections between the CO 2 storage reservoir and overlying sensitive targets like aquifers. The integrity of wells over time is therefore essential for the fluids confinements (brine with or without dissolved CO 2 or buoyant gaseous CO 2). Well integrity {{can be defined as}} its capacity to maintain the isolation of fluids in the subsurface reservoirs. To ensure this isolation, the well casing and the caprock are bonded by a cement sheath; after abandonment, a cement plug is used to avoid upward migration within the casing. However, according to the literature wellbore integrity might be compromised by a) operational defects (during the drilling and cementing processes, during the operations where pressure and temperature changes can modify stress conditions, during the abandonment process) or b) chemical changes especially in the context of CO 2 storage where different chemical environments can be possibly found. The evolution of the well integrity is therefore a complex combination of several physical processes (hydrological, thermal, mechanical and chemical at least) on the different materials and elements (formation, cement, casing, interfaces, annuli). The issue addressed in this study is the behaviour of the complete wellbore system in different conditions and especially under influence of CO 2. An in situ experiment has been designed and is being run in an underground rock laboratory (Mont Terri, Switzerland) at an intermediate scale between the laboratory experiments (which offer the opportunity to assess specific phenomena over time) and field observations (which allow an assessment of the entire system in subsurface at a specific time). The purpose is here to follow the evolution of the integrity of the whole well system both for hydrogeological and geochemical aspects. Modelling and lab experiments, including material characterization are performed in parallel to enable a better interpretation and understanding of the observations. The experimental setup has been designed as follows: a small section of a wellbore is reproduced in the Opalinus Clay of the underground rock laboratory (caprock-like formation) at scale 1 : 1 (5. 5 '' casing and Ø 198 mm borehole), using carbon steel for the casing and class G cement. Below and above the well section, two different intervals have been designed for a continuous monitoring of the pressure and temperature conditions or for fluid injection and extraction (for fluid sampling for instance). The experimental protocol contains several stages: 1 - Drilling, relaxation and well completion; 2 - Initial state characterization; 3 - Temperature increase in the system and characterisation; 4 - Injection of pore water with dissolved CO 2 and tracers, and characterization. The characterization of the system includes both performing hydro-tests (continuous and constant-head tests) to quantify the hydraulic properties of the well and their evolution over time, and sampling the fluids to analyse the geochemical composition and changes. Stages 1, 2 and 3 are now completed and stage 4 is in progress. The first results (of stage 2 and 3) confirm the ability of the chosen design to assess well integrity over time. It also shows first trends in the evolution of integrity especially under influence of the temperature: the equivalent permeability of the wellbore decreased significantly during that stage, improving the well integrity. Three modelling methods are used to predict the results of the experiment or to use the recorded data: 1) flow and transport modelling, 2) geochemical modelling, and 3) reactive transport modelling (TOUGH 2 used for 1, and PhreeqC and TOUGHREACT for 2 and 3). Flow modelling has been associated with the hydraulic tests in order to quantify the well integrity in terms of equivalent permeability during stage 2 and 3. Temperature effects have been included in the models to understand the changes that occurred in terms of effective permeability during stage 3. Geochemical models have been developed to evaluate the validity of <b>chemical</b> <b>sealing</b> as a potential explanation for the increase of well integrity observed during stage 3. The models are also used as predictive tools on the potential evolutionary scenarios for stage 4, regarding water chemistry variations and mineralogical changes. They have been notably useful to calibrate the conditions of the dissolved CO 2 in terms of tracers used, and of sampling and in-line fluid analysis protocol. Each of those models will be progressively refined during the CO 2 -dissolved injection (stage 4) with the aim of aiding the interpretation of the observed processes and phenomena. Finally this field experiment-modelling integrated framework is completed by laboratory characterizations and experiments (in autoclave principally) carried out to provide input data for the modelling with regards to cement, caprock and their reactivity with pore water and CO 2...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 100 - 104. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A new technique for zone isolation in horizontal wells has been proposed. The new technique consists of three sequential stages: (i) setting a chemical wellbore plug in the horizontal section upstream of the zone to be isolated, (ii) spotting a gel just downstream of the wellbore plug and squeezing the gel into the zone to be isolated, and (iii) washing or drilling through excess gel and the wellbore plug to clean the borehole prior to production. The main objective of this research is to investigate the feasibility of setting a chemical wellbore plug in a horizontal wellbore. Two main problems associated with the wellbore plug were investigated: (a) method of placement of the plug so that slumping would not occur, and (b) selection and testing of chemicals {{that could be used to}} make wellbore plugs with sufficiently high holding pressures. Three chemicals, used in the oil industry for gas and/or water shut-off, were selected for the study. The commercial names of these <b>chemicals</b> were <b>SEAL,</b> PERMASEAL and TEXPLUG. Experimental apparatus were designed and constructed to study placement techniques and to measure the holding pressures of the wellbore plugs. The horizontal wellbore models consisted of PVC pipes internally lined with sand. The X-ray CT scanner was used to obtain cross-sectional images of the plug to help understand the shear mechanisms involved. The experimental results indicate that a plug could be placed in a horizontal wellbore with minimum slumping, if the plug is introduced into a viscous completion brine pill. For TEXPLUG, a suitable completion brine would contain 100, 000 ppm NaCi and 4 lb/bbl CMC (carboxyl methyl cellulose). Further, results indicate that only TEXPLUG has a sufficiently high holding pressure (about 340 psi for 37 in. long, 1 in. I. D. plug) necessary for a wellbore plug. Based on experimental results, the proposed new isolation technique appears to be viable. However, further experimental studies are required, particularly to evaluate the effectiveness of the wellbore plug in conjunction with displacement of formation gels...|$|R

40|$|Flame retardants, used {{primarily}} in consumer products, such as furniture and electronics, have become pervasive {{in the marine}} environment within the last decade. There are an estimated 175 types of flame retardants. Many of them are polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are easily absorbed by humans and marine species. Harbor seals, an indicator species {{for the health of}} our oceans, reveal the presence of PBDEs and other chemical toxins in their habitat. Studying the effects <b>chemicals</b> have on <b>seals</b> can inform us about their potential effects on human health because seals and humans are both mammals, are {{at the top of the}} food web, and occupy coastal environments. Seals also feed on many of the same fish humans consume. Some efforts to reduce PBDE levels in humans have been successful. After a ban of certain PBDEs in Sweden went into effect, researchers discovered that PBDE levels in human breast milk decreased. The ocean, however, is a “global sink”—higher levels of PBDEs are observed in the ocean than on land. Achieving such a reduction in the ocean thus requires a larger solution than simply banning industry use of PBDEs. Instead, reducing PBDE levels in seals and the ocean environment will require a comprehensive approach that impacts the entire range of PBDE usage—from creation to end-of-product-life management—and consists of actions by consumers, corporations, state legislatures, Congress, and foreign nations, including international treaties. To understand why such a widespread approach is required, Part II will explore the nature of the problem by identifying the sources of flame retardants, how flame retardants reach the ocean, and the consequences of ocean contamination. This Comment will then evaluate existing and proposed regulations that affect the lifecycle of PBDEs, including restrictions on the sale and use of flame retardants in Part III, and furniture disposal and electronic waste in Part IV.

Angered, he chased Diablo through his own castle, until he crushed a suit of armor into a giant ball, and threw it after him. Diablo ran from it, hiding within the crypt that the villagers had sealed him in. The Thing followed behind him and reinserted the giant, stone plug, and then smashed it with both fists, causing the entire castle to come crumbling down upon the crypt. The Fantastic Four were later freed, and the Human Torch melted the stone into slag to harden Diablo's prison.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Recent {{grouting}} {{projects in}} Sweden {{have concentrated on}} the grout itself. The only grout normally used in Sweden is cement-based. During the past 10 years, the acceptable flow of water into tunnels has been reduced significantly. The current requirements mean that an average fracture aperture of around 0. 05 mm must be <b>sealed.</b> <b>Chemical</b> grouts generally have a low initial viscosity {{and the absence of}} particles means that they can penetrate narrow fractures. Recently, the environmental impact of non-cement grouts has become an important issue. Silica sol is a material that seems to fulfil both requirements, as it is non-hazardous and capable of penetrating narrow fractures. The main objectives of this study are to investigate the basic concepts of how rheology affects penetration and to develop models for calculating penetration length. Other aims are to analyse the need for sealing narrow fractures and to find out how the grouting design can be linked to the characterisation of the rock mass. The papers deal with the grouting procedure with silica sol and analyse a concept for evaluating sealing efficiency and penetration length. In two laboratory studies conducted in a sand-column and pipes, parameters affecting the penetration length were studied. In both studies the aim was to equate the penetration length of the sand and in pipes with that in a slit. For the pipe, the equivalent aperture involves only the radius of the pipe and for the sand the aperture is proportional only to the porosity and calculated specific surface of the sand itself. The five papers outline the grouting procedure with silica sol and suggest a simple grouting model as well as a concept for evaluating the sealing efficiency and penetration length. The grouting design was based on the characterisation of the rock mass and the grouting parameters. A new design criterion for the grouting time was tested and evaluated to obtain a desired penetration length. The grouting time is strongly connected to the gel-time of the grout. The grout used was silica sol, a gelling liquid consisting of amorphous silica particles suspended in water. To initiate and accelerate the gelling process, salt solutions were used. Models were developed to calculate the grout penetration in both one and two dimensions. An interesting feature is that the penetration length calculated in 1 -D is about twice as long as that for 2 -D, which is verified partially by two field studies. The final penetration {{is the same as the}} penetration calculated using the analytical model with a grouting time equal to gel induction time, tG. Since the penetration models are based on the grout properties, the proposed calculations can be applied to most types of gelling liquids, provided the basics of the rheology are taken into account...|$|R

The main objectives of this study are to investigate the basic concepts of how rheology affects penetration and to develop models for calculating penetration length. Other aims are to analyse the need for sealing of narrow fractures and to find out how the grouting design can be coupled to the characterisation of the rock mass. The three papers that make up this study deal with the sealing of narrow fractures in the field. The papers outline the grouting procedure with silica sol and analyse a concept for evaluating sealing efficiency and penetration length. In a laboratory experiment conducted with a sand column, the sand was characterised and the grout penetration was measured. The objective of this experiment was to equate the penetration length of the sand with that in a slit. The hydraulic aperture of a fracture in rock can be used to calculate penetration lengths; the equation derived for the equivalent aperture of the sand is proportional only to the porosity and calculated specific surface of the sand itself. The papers outline the grouting procedure with silica sol and test a concept for evaluating the sealing efficiency and penetration length. The grouting design was based on the characterisation of the rock mass and the grouting parameters. To obtain the desired penetration length, the correct mixing ratio and grouting pressure were determined. The grout used was silica sol, a gelling liquid consisting of amorphous silica particles suspended in water. To initiate and accelerate the gelling process, salt solutions were used. Models were developed to calculate the grout penetration, with dimensionless parameters, in both one and two dimensions. An interesting feature is that the penetration length calculated in 1 -D is twice as long as that for 2 -D, which is verified partially by two field studies. In the sand column test, the equivalent aperture of the sand is directly linked to the aperture of a fracture. In {{the second part of the}} test, the grout penetration stops long before the gel time of the grout is reached. The final penetration is the same as the penetration calculated by the analytical model with a grouting time equal to gel induction time, tG. Since the penetration models are based on the grout properties, the proposed calculations can be applied to most types of gelling liquids, provided the basics of the rheology are taken into account...|$|R
