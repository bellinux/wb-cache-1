5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being <b>concave</b> (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also <b>concave.</b> The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E
5|$|Among the Eolambia {{specimens}} {{found to}} date, the best-preserved sacrum includes seven vertebrae. Given that this individual is immature, and hadrosaurs increase their sacral vertebra count with age, adults {{may have had}} more sacrals. The caudal (tail) vertebrae are amphicoelous, having both {{the front and back}} ends being <b>concave.</b> They have pedestal-like prezygapophyses and tab-like postzygapophyses, the latter of which are separated by a depression. The prezygapophyses lengthen to become stalks and the postzygapophyses shrink in the middle and rear caudals. Furthermore, the neural spines transition from rectangular to strongly curved (<b>concave</b> in front and convex behind), the centra become more elongated, and the transverse processes disappear as well.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{rigorous}} numerical formulation for TE-scattering from a conducting wedge with <b>concaved</b> edge {{is presented}} and numerical computations for scattered fields are shown. The radial mode matching technique {{is used to}} obtain the scattering field in a series form. The accuracy of the present method is checked with existing solutions of a semi-circular channel and sharp wedge, which are special case of the general geometry of a conducting wedge with <b>concaved</b> edge. 1...|$|R

40|$|This assay had as its aim {{to verify}} the {{relationship}} between hillslope sectors and the cornproduction on the subsistence agriculture. Samples had been collected in two hillslope sectors(straight and <b>concaves)</b> that were previously cultivated with corn. Variation on the soil watercapacity occurred along of the hillslope. Significant differences on the tillage and of the cornproduction were verified in each sector. The corn production on the straight sector was of 1340 kg ha, while on the <b>concaves</b> sector reached 4170 kg ha. The tillage and the corn productionwere affected by hillslope sectors (landforms) ...|$|R

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are manufactured}} with domed (convex) and dished (<b>concave)</b> bottoms. The dished profile {{allows them to}} stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some <b>concave</b> bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara spine {{is made up}} of hourglass-shaped amphicoelous vertebrae, <b>concave</b> {{both before}} and behind. This is the usual {{condition}} of fish vertebrae and some amphibians, but is unique to tuatara within the amniotes.|$|E
30|$|The {{main body}} of the {{framework}} presents a rectangular shape, mainly consisting of two side beams and two crossbeams. The support beams of the steady wheels are set below the center of the side beam in the framework, and the support beams of the guide wheels are set below the ends of the side beams. The center of the side beam in the framework <b>concaves</b> downward, to allow couplings to pass through. On both sides of the <b>concaved</b> part of the side beam within the framework, pull rod bases are set to install pull rods, aiming to improve the loading condition of the framework, as well as increase its strength.|$|R
30|$|The {{surface of}} a {{titanium}} wire (TW) featured a less expressed relief but a greater roughness that was uniform along its surface (Fig.  2 b). The diameter of <b>concaves</b> and protuberances was from 0.4 to 1  µm.|$|R
50|$|Leaves are shiny {{green in}} colour and newer leaves are {{generally}} reddish. The leaves grow to about 5mm {{in length and}} are ovate in shape, but rather acute and mucronate (pointy). They are generally flat, however sometimes can be slightly <b>concaved.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{characteristic}} that distinguishes Cetiosauriscus {{is that it}} has axially <b>concave</b> summits on the cranial and middle caudal neural spines. Barosaurus differs from it in having a more complex sculpting laterally and ventrally in the caudals; in having a larger humerus-femur ratio; and in having differently developed chevrons.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 2003, five flint {{artefacts}} {{were discovered}} near the Shimna River. A flake, two blades and a <b>concave</b> scraper {{were found in}} two locations in Tollymore Forest. The flake, scraper {{and one of the}} blades were identified as prehistoric. The second blade was identified as Late Mesolithic or Early Neolithic. A Bronze Age barbed and tanged arrowhead was found in a nearby field.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th and 13th centuries, Europe {{produced}} {{economic growth}} and innovations in methods of production. Major technological advances included {{the invention of the}} windmill, the first mechanical clocks, the manufacture of distilled spirits, {{and the use of the}} astrolabe. <b>Concave</b> spectacles were invented around 1286 by an unknown Italian artisan, probably working in or near Pisa.|$|E
50|$|Angel {{was never}} able to find the {{appropriate}} help that he needed during his adolescent years despite living a “normal” childhood. The peace didn’t last long, because it began rapidly <b>concaving</b> into darkness and confusion from the constant bickering that society directed upon him.|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} types of {{skateboard}}s are the longboard and the shortboard. The {{shape of the}} board is also important: the skateboard must be <b>concaved</b> to perform tricks. Longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing, while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks.|$|R

5|$|Many {{bivalves}} have no eyes, but a {{few members}} of the Arcoidea, Limopsoidea, Mytiloidea, Anomioidea, Ostreoidea, and Limoidea have simple eyes on the margin of the mantle. These consist of a pit of photosensory cells and a lens. Scallops have more complex eyes with a lens, a two-layered retina, and a <b>concave</b> mirror. All bivalves have light-sensitive cells that can detect a shadow falling over the animal.|$|E
5|$|On {{the bottom}} of the skull, the pterygoid is about twice as wide as it is long. At the front of the pterygoid is a small {{projection}} that extends backwards to form a ridge, on either side of which is a furrow-like depression (the choanal groove) containing the choanae. In Theriosuchus, unlike Knoetschkesuchus, the choanae are embedded in a wider bowl-like depression. Additionally, in both species, the bottom surface of the pterygoid is somewhat <b>concave.</b> Extending forward from either side of the pterygoid is the ectopterygoid; in both species, this bone is constricted near the middle to form an hourglass-like shape, but in K. langenbergensis it is also somewhat twisted to the side. The back of the bone is very <b>concave</b> in both species.|$|E
5|$|The 19 dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar}} to the pectoral vertebrae, being weakly <b>concave</b> and taller than long, but the neural spines are proportionally taller than the centra. The single-headed dorsal ribs are rounded but slightly flattened in cross-section, and some have a prong-like projection at the top end; their articular surfaces are slightly <b>concave.</b> Underneath, there are at least ten pairs of gastralia, each of which tapers to the sides and has a central groove on the bottom surface. The three sacral vertebrae are similar, but have much smaller, blunter, more oval-shaped ribs. The comparatively smaller first sacral rib is directed further outwards and backwards than the other two ribs. There initially were 25 caudal vertebrae preserved, with 22 still being accounted for. The last several caudal vertebrae are partially fused into a pygostyle-like structure. The preserved caudal ribs are flattened, triangular, and taper towards the tip of the tail.|$|E
50|$|In 1901 an American, William W. Humphreys, {{patented}} an idea - a 'Pneumatic Spring for Vehicles'. The design {{consisted of}} a left and right air spring longitudinally channeled nearly {{the length of the}} vehicle. The channels were <b>concaved</b> to receive two long pneumatic cushions. Each one was closed at one end and provided with an air valve at the other end.|$|R
40|$|Artificial sea forests {{assembled}} by spar buoy units are employed to protect eroding sand beaches. The spar buoy {{is made of}} PVC pipe, geo-textile sand bag, used car tires, chain or rope and accessories. According to experiences the wave behind the forest becomes smaller and sand will be accreted. Two forests can form a <b>concaved</b> beach which is stable. This may be a new coastal protection structure. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} bottom designs in wakeboards - it is a feature wakeboard shapers use to express their own style. On {{the bottom of the}} wakeboard can be seen <b>concaves,</b> channels or maybe nothing at all. Each performs a different function, fine-tuning how the wakeboard rides through the water according to its width from tip to tail, fin setup, rocker and tip and tail shape.|$|R
5|$|The {{main body}} of the {{lacrimal}} is a rounded square with both faces of the bone are <b>concave.</b> Its contact with the nasal is rather limited in both species. The oval-shaped antorbital fenestra is small, being only 9% the length of the eye socket; its presence is unique to both species of the genus among atoposaurids. Meanwhile, the eye socket is large and oval, being 54% longer than it is tall. The drop-shaped palpebrals project out from the tops of the eye sockets. In both species, the back two-thirds of the inner surface of the palpebral is slightly <b>concave.</b> Both species have a squamosal in which the back third is bevelled; in K. langenbergensis, the outer margin is somewhat convex.|$|E
5|$|The nests, built {{entirely by}} the female, are mud {{plastered}} to cave entrances or rocky outcrops in forest ravines. The nests are often constructed from the saliva {{of the females}} mixed in with vegetable matter and mud. The nest is shaped like a <b>concave</b> cup. The female typically lays two white eggs. The females incubates these eggs for about 25 to 28 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} function is <b>concave</b> in two dimensions and quasi-convex in three dimensions. This {{means that the}} longer Robinson works, the more coconuts {{he will be able}} to gather. But due to diminishing marginal returns of labour, the additional number of coconuts he gets from every additional hour of labour is declining.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 50s and 60s, {{surfboard}} designers {{experimented with}} a variety of components to make the nose hold up longer and noserider surfboard designs became the hot sellers throughout the 60s. The combinations of template (outline shape), thickness, weight, rocker, rail shape, <b>concaves,</b> convexs, flats and fins vary with the individual surfer's style and size, and continue to be an experiment. To this day, noserider designs continue to be refined.|$|R

5|$|The skull {{is unknown}} except for {{possibly}} {{a portion of}} lower jaw found at the same site {{as the rest of}} the known Coelurus material. Although it has the same preservation and coloring as the fossils known to belong to the Coelurus skeleton, it is very slender, which may mean it does not belong to the skeleton; this bone is 7.9centimeters long (3.1in) but only 1.1centimeters tall (0.43in). In general, its vertebrae were long and low, with low neural spines and thin walls to the bodies of the vertebrae. Its neck vertebrae were very pneumatic, with numerous hollow spaces on their surfaces (pleurocoels); these hollows were not evenly distributed among the vertebrae and varied in size. The neck vertebrae were very elongate, with bodies four times longer than wide, and they articulated with <b>concave</b> faces on both ends (amphicoely). The back vertebrae were not as elongate, lacked surface hollows, and had less developed <b>concave</b> faces and bodies that were hourglass-shaped. The tail vertebrae also lacked surface hollows.|$|E
5|$|Wok: The {{cast-iron}} Wok {{was invented}} in China during the Han dynasty. The round-bottomed cooking vessel is central to Chinese cooking and soon spread to other Asian culinary spheres due to its unique <b>concave</b> shape and ability to sear food at a fast pace.|$|E
5|$|A <b>concave</b> line of {{abrasion}} {{and polishing}} {{can be found}} on both one of the central kerb-stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb-stone on the south-east of the monument. These have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe-blades on these sarsens. It is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber levers and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb. Similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge.|$|E
50|$|Mount Gabriel located {{close to}} west Cork {{provides}} useful {{evidence for the}} exploitation of copper ore in the Early Bronze Age about 1700 BC. Through research thirty-two areas of activity were underlined. Shallow <b>concaves</b> and significant amount of dump with charcoal and tools are the evidences of Bronze Age copper extraction in the region. Mount Gabriel constitute until now the only locations, where primitive assemblages remained undisturbed by 19th century deeds due to the low quality of its veins.|$|R
40|$|Osteological {{features}} {{are important to}} study the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationship of fishes. Since there is no information is available about osteological features of Squalius orientalis, therefore this study was aimed to provide {{a detailed description of}} the osteological features of this species from the Urmia lake basin of Iran and comparing it with population of S. orientalis from the Caspian Sea basin. For this purpose, the specimens were collected from Zarineh River of the Urmia lake basin and cleared and stained with alizarin red S and alcian blue for osteological examinations. Finally, a detailed osteological features of this species was provided and compared with those of the Caspian Sea basin. Based on the results, having a longer pre-vomer, dorsally oriented parasphenoid alar, longer ventral blade-shaped process of the orbitosphenoid, <b>concaved</b> masticatory plate, pointed ascending process of the palatine, <b>concaved</b> posterior margin of the opercle, and a small posterior process of the cleithrum can differentiate S. orientalis of the Urmia Lake basin from those of the Caspian Sea basin. In addition, the observed osteological difference suggest that both studied populations belong to same taxon...|$|R
5000|$|The Atlantic tripletail has scales {{that extend}} onto its dorsal, anal, and caudal fins {{and a head}} profile that <b>concaves</b> as the fish ages. It has a {{compressed}} but deep body with a triangle-shaped head. The eyes are small, but the mouth is large. The bases of the dorsal and anal fins are scaled and the pectoral fins are shorter than the pelvic fins. The name [...] "tripletail" [...] is given because of the fish's three rounded fins: dorsal, caudal, and anal.|$|R
