5|$|A {{week before}} her death, Mary {{went through her}} papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but her journal survives, as do her letters to William and to Frances Apsley. The Jacobites lambasted her, but the {{assessment}} of her <b>character</b> <b>that</b> came down to posterity was largely the vision of Mary as a dutiful, submissive wife, who assumed power reluctantly, exercised it with considerable ability when necessary, and willingly deferred it to her husband.|$|E
50|$|UCS {{includes}} {{thousands of}} <b>characters</b> <b>that</b> Unicode designates as compatibility characters.

5|$|Sharks {{tend to be}} seen {{quite often}} in {{cartoons}} whenever a scene involves the ocean. Such examples include the Tom and Jerry cartoons, Jabberjaw, and other shows produced by Hanna-Barbera. They also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a <b>character</b> <b>that</b> is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them, or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{intended}} to show how Ben was a <b>character</b> <b>that</b> could manipulate even the best confidence man on the island, and if Sawyer could care for another person, as Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) is making her attempts to escape captivity. When the episode first aired, it was watched by 17.087million American viewers. Reviews were positive, praising the writing and the cliffhanger ending.|$|E
5|$|The highly {{decorative}} Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, {{and perfectly}} reflected {{the social order}} of the island at a time when, nominally ruled by Spain, {{it was in fact}} governed by a wealthy and often extravagant aristocracy into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural <b>character</b> <b>that</b> has lasted into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} must be aesthetically pleasing. Generally, <b>characters</b> <b>that</b> {{are written}} correctly, legibly, concisely, {{and in the}} correct context are also aesthetically pleasing to some degree. <b>Characters</b> <b>that</b> violate the above rules are often less aesthetically pleasing.|$|R

He also included a number of characters who had previously appeared in earlier adventures, among them Professor Cantonneau from The Shooting Star, General Alcazar from The Broken Ear, and Bianca Castafiore from King Ottokar's Sceptre.|$|E
5|$|The set was Haydn's first {{complete}} set of quartets since the Opus 33 set of 1781. While the Opus 33 set was apt for broad public consumption, the Opus 50 set is more serious and experimental. It is {{perhaps because of the}} Opus 50's intellectual <b>character</b> <b>that</b> other sets among Haydn's mature quartets have received more attention from performers.|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb, {{a special}} {{morphological}} arrangement of {{teeth in the}} anterior lower jaw, is best known in extant strepsirrhine primates, which include lemurs and lorisoid primates (collectively known as lemuriforms). This homologous structure is a diagnostic <b>character</b> <b>that</b> helps define this clade (related group) of primates. An analogous trait {{is found in the}} bald uakari (Cacajao calvus), a type of New World monkey.|$|E

5|$|After several {{diplomatic}} {{failures and}} military defeats in the 1730s, Austria {{seemed to be}} declining, or even {{on the verge of}} collapse. After her forty years reign, Maria Theresa left a revitalised empire that influenced the rest of Europe throughout the 19thcentury. She gave the Habsburg dominions an efficient administrative system that allowed it to remain a great power in its own right, without the support of the Holy Roman Empire. Her descendants followed her example and continued reforming the empire. The acquisition of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire an even more multinational <b>character</b> <b>that</b> would ultimately lead to its destruction. Her introduction of compulsory schooling, as a means of Germanisation, eventually triggered the revival of Czech culture.|$|E
5|$|Although both Futurama and The Simpsons {{were created}} by Matt Groening, overt {{references}} to the latter are mostly avoided in Futurama. One of the few exceptions to this rule is the appearance of Blinky, a three-eyed orange fish seen on The Simpsons, as Fry is going through the tube. A running gag of the series is Bender's fondness for Olde Fortran malt liquor, named after Olde English 800 malt liquor and the programming language Fortran. The drink was first introduced in this episode and became so {{closely associated with the}} <b>character</b> <b>that</b> he was featured with a bottle in both the Rocket USA wind-up toy and the action figure released by Moore Action Collectibles.|$|E
5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel. According to Seth Killian, a former community manager for Capcom, Marvel presented {{a list of}} their own characters that {{they were interested in}} seeing in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities in order to reach a consensus. Each company also had their own set of interests and priorities. Marvel characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming products. On the other hand, Capcom sought to bring more diversity into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like <b>character</b> <b>that</b> could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of Firebrand.|$|E

5|$|Episode 232 of the anime series had a {{defamatory}} {{depiction of}} a <b>character</b> <b>that</b> referenced a specific politician, the current Minister for Government Revitalisation Renhō Murata, {{which resulted in the}} cancellation of its rerun on AT-X. Series supervisor Shinji Takamatsu explained that TV Tokyo cancelled the rerun on its own. Renhō's representative denied having objected to the episode although a report from the Mainichi Shimbun paper stated the affected party contacted TV Tokyo. When the story arc the episode belonged to was completed, Takamatsu expressed doubts about the arc's release in DVD format.|$|E
5|$|Evelyn is a <b>character</b> <b>that</b> {{appears in}} {{flashback}} sequences in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. She is voiced and motion captured by Merle Dandridge. She is a celebrated historian and knew {{and worked with}} Cassandra Morgan, Nate and Sam's mother. One night, she caught the two boys breaking into her house {{when they went to}} retrieve their mother's belongings, but decided to share with them what their mother found. Just as the police arrive at the scene, Evelyn tells the boys that she will buy them some time, but suddenly collapses. She was a heavy smoker, and died from a lung disease and the boys are associated with her death.|$|E
5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be funny to have a baby <b>character</b> <b>that</b> did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any {{emotions}} that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E

5|$|In April 2010, Linguswamy's Paiyaa released. A romantic road-trip film, {{featuring}} a blockbuster album by Yuvan Shankar Raja, {{it was very}} successful. For the first time, he enacted a <b>character</b> <b>that</b> lives in an urban area. He said that he accepted the film because he desperately wanted to play a cool dude on screen. Karthi's performances in Aayirathil Oruvan and Paiyaa earned him further nominations at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Actor category. Both films were dubbed into Telugu as Yuganiki Okkadu and Aawara, respectively, and were successful.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{a casting}} call sheet {{leaked to the}} Internet {{revealed}} that Cobra Commander would appear in the sequel, though it was unknown who would play the character. Chu said that fans would {{get a glimpse of}} Destro in the film, but Christopher Eccleston would not reprise his role in the sequel. On May 1, 2012, it was confirmed by Jon Chu that G.I. Joe: Retaliations Cobra Commander is Rex Lewis, the same <b>character</b> <b>that</b> Joseph Gordon-Levitt played in The Rise of Cobra. Actor Robert Baker confirmed that he is the voice of Cobra Commander in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|Larry Wilmore, {{who plays}} the {{sensitivity}} trainer Mr. Brown, is {{a writer for the}} show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he was perfect for the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty <b>character</b> <b>that</b> Kelly later becomes.|$|E
