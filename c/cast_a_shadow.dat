5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow,</b> perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope {{captured}} a rare transit made by Ariel on Uranus, which <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> {{that could be}} seen on the Uranian cloud tops. Such events are rare and only occur around equinoxes, as the moon's orbital plane about Uranus is tilted 98° to Uranus's orbital plane about the Sun. Another transit, in 2008, was recorded by the European Southern Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E

5|$|Photography was {{provided}} by Willy Hameister, {{who went on to}} work with Wiene on several other films. The camera does not play a large part in Caligari, and is used primarily to show the sets. The cinematography tends to alternate only between medium shots at straight-on angles and abrupt close-ups {{to create a sense of}} shock, but with few long shots or panning movement. Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without intercutting, which gives Caligari a more theatrical feel than a cinematic one. Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to intensify the uneasiness created by the distortions of the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create an unsettling glow. Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films.|$|E

25|$|Hours {{after the}} {{assassination}} of Bakhtiar, a British hostage was released from Lebanon, presumably held by Hezbollah, but a French hostage was taken.

25|$|Whilst {{the full}} lifting of border {{restrictions}} in 1985 was significant and Spain transformed itself from a fascist state to a democracy, {{the legacy of}} Gibraltar's isolation by Franco continued to <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow.</b> Gibraltarian politicians and general public continued to distrust Spanish intentions, particularly whilst Spain refused to recognise the Government of Gibraltar as a competent authority and continued to pursue confrontational policies.

25|$|The Gnomon of Saint-Sulpice is {{an astronomical}} {{measurement}} device {{located in the}} Church of Saint-Sulpice (Église Saint-Sulpice) in Paris, France. It is a gnomon, a device designed to <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> {{on the ground in}} order to determine the position of the sun in the sky. In early modern times, other gnomons were also built in several Italian and French churches in order to better calculate astronomical events. Those churches are Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, San Petronio in Bologna, and the Church of the Certosa in Rome. These gnomons ultimately fell into disuse with the advent of powerful telescopes.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, Ciprian had also {{established}} himself as a leading modernist dramatist and director, with plays such as The Man and His Mule. Although his work in the field is described as the product of 1920s Expressionist theater, he was sometimes branded a plagiarist of his dead friend's writings. This claim was traced back to Arghezi, and was probably a publicity stunt meant to increase Urmuz's exposure, but taken with seriousness by another opinion maker, journalist Constantin Beldie. The ensuing scandal was amplified by the young Dadaists and Surrealists, who took the rumor to be true: Avramescu-Uranus, himself accused of plagiarizing Urmuz, made an ironic reference to this fact in a 1929 contribution to Bilete de Papagal. Unwittingly, Arghezi's allegations <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> of doubt on Ciprian's overall work for the stage.|$|E

25|$|The {{defeat of}} 1864 <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> over Christian IX's rule {{for many years}} and his {{attitude}} to the Danish case—probably without reason—was claimed to be half-hearted. This unpopularity was worsened as he sought unsuccessfully {{to prevent the spread of}} democracy throughout Denmark by supporting the authoritarian and conservative prime minister Estrup, whose rule 1875–94 was by many seen as a semi-dictatorship. However, he signed a treaty in 1874 which allowed Iceland, then a Danish possession, to have its own constitution, albeit one that still had Denmark ruling Iceland. In 1901, he reluctantly asked Johan Henrik Deuntzer to form a government and this resulted in the formation of the Cabinet of Deuntzer. The cabinet consisted of members of the Venstre Reform Party and was the first Danish government not to include the conservative party Højre, even though Højre never had a majority of the seats in the Folketing. This was the beginning of the Danish tradition of parliamentarism and clearly bettered his reputation for his last years.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of how {{access to}} piped water changed during the {{concession}} period vary considerably. According to the regulatory agency, access increased substantially. In the Palyja service area it almost doubled from 209,000 customers in 1998 to 399,000 customers in 2008, exceeding the renegotiated contractual target of 392,000. In the TPJ service area it increased less quickly {{during the same}} period from 278,000 to 380,000 customers, somewhat below the target of 403,000. In relative terms, Palyja says that in its concession area access almost doubled from 34 percent in 1998 to 59 percent in 2007 and 64 percent in 2011. In the TPJ service area, access increased from about 57 percent in 1998 to about 67 percent in 2004, but stagnated afterwards. However, the annual national socio-economic surveys (SUSENAS) of the National Statistical Agency BPS for the Special Capital City District (DKI) of Jakarta show a decline in the share of households with access to an improved water source from 59 percent in 1998 to 39 percent in 2008 and 28 percent in 2010. It remains unclear what could have caused such a massive decline, and substantial increases and decreases in the BPS figures from one year to the other <b>cast</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> of doubt on the reliability of these figures.|$|E
