25|$|The city of Asheville {{is home to}} a Duke Energy Progress {{coal power}} plant near Lake Julian. This power plant is {{designated}} as having Coal <b>Combustion</b> <b>Residue</b> Surface Impoundments with a High Hazard Potential by the EPA. In 2012 a Duke University study found high levels of arsenic and other toxins in North Carolina lakes and rivers downstream from the Asheville power plants coal ash ponds. Samples collected from coal ash waste flowing from the ponds at the Duke Energy Progress plant to the French Broad River in Buncombe County contained arsenic levels more than four times higher than the EPA drinking water standard, and levels of selenium 17 times higher than the agency's standard for aquatic life. In March 2013 the State of North Carolina sued Duke Energy Progress in order to address similar environmental compliance issues. In July 2013 Duke Energy Corp. and North Carolina environmental regulators proposed a settlement in the lawsuit that stated coal ash threatened Asheville's water supply. The settlement called for Duke to assess the sources and extent of contamination at the Riverbend power plant in Asheville. Duke would be fined $99,100 if the settlement is approved. Following the coal ash spill in Eden, NC resulting in 82,000 tons of coal ash leaking into the Dan River, the North Carolina DENR cancelled all previous settlements with Duke Energy. Duke said a stormwater drainage pipe under the utility's Dan River Steam Station lagoon ruptured Feb 2, allowing ash slurry to pour into the river. Duke Energy faces future legislation by Tom Apodaca, republican NCGA Senate leader forcing them to clean up their south Asheville coal ash ponds. Tom Apodaca expects the legislation will be filed as soon as the General Assembly returns to session in May 2014. Apodaca expects the ponds will be cleaned up in 5–10 years under his law.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this project}} was to study the reutilisation of the major ash components, {{predominantly}} silica and potassium, in wheat straw <b>combustion</b> <b>residues</b> to form alkali silicate binders for novel inorganic composite boards. Wheat straw of one variety and year was studied in detail on a lab-scale. Studies {{on the effects of}} combustion time and temperature show, for the first time, that the inherent alkali in the wheat straw is sufficient to solubilise up to 25 % of the silica in the ash at room temperature. Combustion at temperatures below 600 °C gives the highest silica extraction by producing the most alkaline solutions, preventing calcium solubility and maintaining silica in a more reactive form. The first detailed comparisons of the effect of wheat straw variety and growth year on the properties of its <b>combustion</b> <b>residues</b> show that their mineralogical composition, leaching of inorganic components, silica structure and alkalinity can be correlated to the initial elemental composition. Pretreatment of wheat straw by ethanol extraction indicates that this can reduce the potassium and chloride content similar to that achieved by water washing, potentially producing a less problematic material for combustion, without significantly reducing the alkalinity of the <b>combustion</b> <b>residues.</b> This {{is believed to be the}} first reported observation of this effect. Pyrolysis of the wheat straw followed by char washing prior to combustion demonstrates improved extractability of the silica present utilising the inherent alkalinity, compared to extraction of the ashes. The leached chars display a lower ash content, lower potassium content, lower chloride content and higher calorific value, making them more suitable for combustion than the initial straw. Finally, the formation of alkali silicate solutions from commercial biomass <b>combustion</b> <b>residues</b> is demonstrated. Biosilicate solutions comparable to commercial potassium silicate solutions are formed by extraction of the bottom ashes. These show potential as binders for inorganic composite boards.

However, the comprehensive characteristics of wood ashes will not be evaluated solely by information on the total amount, because of their complex chemical mixture. For instance, as discussed above, the total amount of K in the ash cannot always become plant available immediately after application, particularly bark ashes with low water-soluble K: effective K concentration in ash would be overestimated by the test of total amount. In addition, the phytoavailability of hazardous substances with amphoteric behavior might be overestimated by the leaching test using water.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to convert Illinois coal <b>combustion</b> <b>residues,</b> such as fly ash, bottom ash, and boiler slag, into novel cementitious materials {{for use in the}} construction industry. These residues are composed largely of SiO{sub 2 }, Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, MgO, and CaO, which are also the major components of cement. Since the residues are used as an integral component of the cement and not just as additives to concrete, larger amounts of the residues can be utilized. The process uses submerged combustion to melt blends of coal <b>combustion</b> <b>residues</b> with lime, clay, and/or sand. The submerged combustion melter utilizes natural gas-oxidant firing directly into a molten bath to provide efficient melting of mineral-like materials. Use of this melter for cement production has many advantages over rotary kilns including very little, if any, grinding of the feed material, very low emissions, and compact size. During {{the first year of the}} program, samples of coal <b>combustion</b> <b>residues</b> were blended and mixed, as needed; with lime, clay, and/or sand to adjust the composition. Six mixtures, three with fly ash and three with bottom ash, were melted in a laboratory-scale furnace.

In the hydraulic activity test, mortar cubes were found to have a strength comparable to standard mortar cements. In the compressive strength test, mortar cubes were found to have strengths that exceeded ASTM blended cement performance specifications. In the ASR expansion test, mortar bars were subjected to alkali-silica reaction-induced expansion, which is a problem for siliceous aggregate-based concretes that are exposed to moisture.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and transmission-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) were conducted on PCC fly ash (Baldwin), FBC fly ash (ADK unit l- 6), FBC fly ash (S. I. coal), FBC spent bed ash (ADM, unit l- 6), bottom ash, and scrubber sludge (CWLP) residues to characterize their geometrical shapes, mineral phases, and thermal stability. Our spectroscopic results indicate that the scrubber sludge is mainly composed of a gypsum-like phase whose lattice structure is different from the lattice structure of conventional gypsum, and sludge does not contain hannebachite (CaSO{sub 3 }. 0. 5 H{sub 2 }O) phase.
