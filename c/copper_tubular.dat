40|$|Abstract—The current on an infinitely-long carbon {{nanotube}} (CN) antenna fed by a delta-gap source is studied using a Fourier transform technique. The CN is modeled as an infinitely-thin tube {{characterized by a}} semi-classical conductance, appropriate for the frequencies of interest considered in this work. The CN’s current is compared with the current on solid and <b>tubular</b> <b>copper</b> antennas having similar or somewhat larger radius values. It is found that for radius values {{on the scale of}} nanometers, CNs exhibit smaller losses than cylindrical copper antennas having the same dimensions, assuming the bulk value of copper conductivity. When one assumes a more realistic, reduced copper conductivity that accounts for the nanoscopic radius of the wire, the advantage of the CN over a metallic wire is increased.

Here, the machining is done using rotary <b>tubular</b> <b>copper</b> and brass electrodes, in which the tool electrodes may have an additional rotary or orbiting motion, {{in addition to the}} servo-controlled feed. Taguchi's signal-to-noise ratio and grey relational analysis were applied in this work to improve the multi-response characteristics such as MRR and EWR on En 41 b steel and the optimum combination of control parameters such as current, gap voltage, pulse ON time and pulse OFF time were obtained...|$|R

The reference electrode was an electrically grounded tubular platinum electrode inserted in the flow stream. Comparison with a variable-wavelength UV absorbance detector showed that the CTE gave comparable response time and sensitivity, but was much more selective, showing response only to copper-binding molecules. The CTE has been applied to the analysis of urine and an intravenous amino acid preparation; no sample pre-treatment was required, other than filtration.

40|$|The use of <b>copper</b> <b>tubular</b> thrust {{chambers}} {{is particularly}} important in high performance expander cycle space engines. Tubular chambers have more surface area than flat wall chambers, and this extra surface area provides enhanced heat transfer for additional energy to power the cycle. This paper was divided into two sections: (1) a thermal analysis and sensitivity study; and (2) a preliminary design of a selected thrust chamber configuration. The thermal analysis consisted of a statistical optimization to determine the optimum tube geometry, tube booking, thrust chamber geometry, and cooling routing to achieve the maximum upper limit chamber pressure for a 25, 000 pound thrust engine. The preliminary design effort produced a layout drawing of a tubular thrust chamber that is three inches shorter than the Advanced Expander Test Bed (AETB) milled channel chamber but is predicted to provide a five percent increase in heat transfer. Testing this chamber in the AETB would confirm the inherent advantages of tubular chamber construction and heat transfer...|$|E

In the present work, an attempt has been made to model material removal rate, electrode wear rate, and surface roughness through response surface methodology in a die sinking EDM process. The optimization was performed in two steps using one factor at a time for preliminary evaluation and a Box-Behnken design involving three variables with three levels for determination of the critical experimental conditions. Pulse on time, pulse off time, and peak current were changed during the tests, while a <b>copper</b> electrode having <b>tubular</b> cross section was employed to machine through holes on EN 353 steel alloy workpiece. The results of analysis of variance indicated that the proposed mathematical models obtained can adequately describe the performances within the limits of factors being studied. The experimental and predicted values were in a good agreement. Surface topography is revealed with the help of scanning electron microscope micrographs...|$|R
5000|$|A {{soldering}} gun is an approximately pistol-shaped, electrically powered tool for soldering metals using tin-based solder {{to achieve a}} strong mechanical bond with good electrical contact. The tool has a trigger-style switch {{so it can be}} easily operated with one hand. The body of the tool contains a transformer with a primary winding connected to mains electricity when the trigger is pressed, and a single-turn secondary winding of thick copper with very low resistance. A soldering tip, made of a loop of thinner copper wire, is secured {{to the end of the}} transformer secondary by screws, completing the secondary circuit. When the primary of the transformer is energized, several hundred amperes of current flow through the secondary and very rapidly heat the copper tip. Since the tip has a much higher resistance than the rest of the <b>tubular</b> <b>copper</b> winding, the tip gets very hot while the remainder of the secondary warms much less. A tap on the primary winding is often used to light a pilot lamp which also lights the workpiece.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of copper and related {{changes have been}} studied in copper-loaded rat kidneys at the ultrastructural level by X-ray electron probe microanalysis, in order to clarify the pathogenesis of copper-induced damage and subsequent recovery in this organ. Male rats fed a high copper diet (1500 ppm) for 16 weeks were killed at intervals; their kidneys were removed and portions of kidney cortex fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and 2 % glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy: other samples were analysed for copper by AA spectrophotometry. Increasing copper accumulation was associated with progressive PCT cell disarray and characterized by irreversible nuclear damage coincident with the intranuclear accumulation of Cu, S, P, and Ca. Copper was also identified within structurally intact lysosomes associated with Zn and Fe (Type I lysosomes) or P and S (Type II lysosomes, putative Cu-MT). Subsequent <b>copper</b> decline and <b>tubular</b> recovery {{was associated with the}} facilitated lysosomal sequestration of copper and excretion of copper-containing cell products into the tubule lumina, Cu-MT and alpha- 2 urinary protein-copper. The cytotoxicity of copper in the kidney, as well as the liver, is associated primarily with irreversible nuclear damage, whereas lysosomal copper sequestration protects the cell from injury...|$|R
40|$|Non-traditional {{machining}} {{has grown}} out {{of the need to}} machine exotic engineering metallic materials, composite materials and high tech ceramics having good mechanical properties and thermal characteristics as well as sufficient electrical conductivity. Electrochemical Machining developed in late 1950 ’s has been accepted worldwide as a standard process in manufacturing and is capable of machining geometrically complex or hard material components, that are precise and difficult-to-machine such as heat treated tool steels, composites, super alloys, ceramics, carbides, heat resistant steels etc. being widely used in die and mold making industries, aerospace, aeronautics and nuclear industries. The principle of anodic dissolution of metal theory is the most accepted mathematical model for evaluating material removal from electrodes during electrochemical process. If two suitable metal poles are placed in a conducting electrolyte and a direct current passed through them, the metal on the positive pole get depleted and its material is deposited on the negative pole. Keeping this in view, the present work has been undertaken to finding the material removal rate by electrochemical dissolution of an anodically polarized work piece with a U-shaped <b>tubular</b> <b>copper</b> electrode. In the experiment, AISI D 2 steel is used as specimen. Experiments were carried out to study the influence of machining parameters such as feed rate, applied voltage, conductivity and flow rate on the over cuts in length, width and height of the specified cavity...|$|R
40|$|A model {{reduction}} methodology {{based on}} a Gauss-Jordan reaction factoriza- tion for thin-film deposition reaction systems is developed in this thesis. The fac- torization generates a transformation matrix {{that is used to}} create a new coordinate system that guides the separation of the deposition process time scales by decoupling the net-forward reaction rates to the greatest extent possible. The new coordinate space enables recasting the original model as a singular perturbation problem and consequently as a semi-explicit system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE) for the dominant dynamics in the pseudo-equilibrium limit. Additionally, the factor- ization reveals conserved quantities in the new reaction coordinate system as well as potential structural problems with the deposition reaction network. The reaction factorization methodology is formulated to be suitable for appli- cation to dynamic, spatially distributed reaction systems. The factorization provides a rigorous pathway to decouple the time evolution and the spatial distributions of deposition systems when the dynamics of reactor-scale gas-phase transport are fastrelative to the deposition process. Moreover, the factorization approach provides {{a solution to the problem}} of formulating Danckwerts-type boundary conditions where gas-phase equilibrium reactions are important. The reaction factorization is used to study the chemical vapor deposition of <b>copper</b> on a <b>tubular</b> hot-wall reactor using copper iodide as the Cu precursor. A film-growth mechanism is proposed from experimental observations that the copper films deposited on quartz substrates suggest a Volmer-Weber growth mode. A model based on this mechanism is used to track spatial distribution of the average Cu island size in the reactor. The rate expressions used in the Cu deposition model are determined using absolute rate theory. To carry out these calculations in an organized manner, a library of object-oriented classes are created in the Python programming language...|$|R
40|$|Descreve-se a ocorrência de um surto de intoxicação espontânea por Senecio brasiliensis em ovinos em um estabelecimento do município de Mata, Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, em meados {{de janeiro}} de 1997. De um total de 94 ovinos, 51 (54, 25 %) animais adoeceram e 50 (53, 2 %) morreram. Esse rebanho permaneceu durante aproximadamente 7 meses (de junho de 1996 a janeiro de 1997) em piquetes de pastagem nativa onde havia grande quantidade de S. brasiliensis. O quadro clínico manifestado pelos animais afetados consistia em fotossensibilização, emagrecimento progressivo, apatia, fraqueza, perturbações neurológicas como depressão, andar a esmo e desequilibrado, icterícia e hemoglobinúria. Houve melhora das lesões de pele naqueles ovinos que desenvolveram fotossensibilização hepatógena depois que foram retirados do sol. As principais lesões macroscópicas observadas em 9 dos 10 ovinos necropsiados incluíam fígado diminuído de tamanho, firme, difusamente marrom amarelado ou esverdeado, com quantidades variáveis de nódulos de 1 - 3 mm de diâmetro, bem circunscritos, salientes na cápsula, amarelados, distribuídos aleatoriamente por todo o parênquima. A vesícula biliar estava repleta e preenchida por bile verde escura e espessa. Havia também derrames cavitários (hidropericárdio e ascite). Crise hemolítica aguda fatal associada à intoxicação crônica hepatógena por cobre foi observada em cinco ovinos. Além das lesões hepáticas macroscópicas já mencionadas, foi observada icterícia generalizada da carcaça, rins tumefeitos, friáveis, difusamente escurecidos ou com fino pontilhado enegrecido; a urina era marrom escura (hemoglobinúria). As principais lesões microscópicas foram observadas no fígado e consistiam em hepatomegalocitose, proliferação de ductos biliares (hiperplasia ductal) e fibrose periportal moderada acompanhada de infiltrado inflamatório mononuclear. Macrófagos carregados de pigmento acastanhado formavam aglomerados nas tríades portais ou estavam dispersos entre os hepatócitos remanescentes. O {{material}} armazenado no citoplasma desses macrófagos correspondia a ceróide e cobre, positivo nas técnicas de PAS e rodanina, respectivamente. Nos rins de cinco animais, havia nefrose hemoglobinúrica caracterizada por degeneração e necrose do epitélio tubular, presença de hemoglobina e hemossiderina no citoplasma das células epiteliais dos túbulos contorcidos e cilindros de hemoglobina na luz tubular. Evidência morfológica de encefalopatia hepática incluía degeneração esponjosa (status spongiosus) da substância branca do encéfalo. Achados ultra-estruturais no fígado incluíam graus variáveis de degeneração hepatocelular caracterizada pelo acúmulo de numerosas gotas lipídicas no citoplasma das células hepáticas e presença de lisossomos carregados de material eletrodenso que, na maioria dos casos, correspondia à lipofuscina-ceróide. Adicionalmente, havia discreta dilatação do retículo endoplasmático rugoso e moderada hiperplasia do retículo endoplasmático liso em algumas regiões do citoplasma dos hepatócitos. No epitélio dos túbulos contorcidos proximais do rim foi observado edema intracelular e diversas alterações mitocondriais de caráter degenerativo que incluíam tumefação, desorganização e ruptura das cristas, matriz finamente granular, acúmulo de gotículas de gordura e ruptura das membranas em alguns casos. Lisossomos contendo material fortemente eletrodenso foram observados em muitas células tubulares renais. O exame laboratorial de fragmentos de fígado e rim dos ovinos afetados revelou níveis elevados de cobre que variaram respectivamente de 369 ppm a 1248 ppm e 152 ppm a 687 ppm com base na matéria seca. O diagnóstico de intoxicação por Senecio brasiliensis baseou-se em dados epidemiológicos, clínicos, de necropsia, histopatológicos e laboratoriais. An outbreak of spontaneous Senecio brasiliensis poisoning in grazing sheep {{in the county}} of Mata, Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil, is described. The disease occurred on one farm in middle January 1997. Fifty-one (54. 25 %) out of 94 sheep were affected, and 50 animals (53. 2 %) died. This flock of sheep had been grazing for approximately 7 months (from June 1996 to January 1997) in paddocks heavily infested with S. brasiliensis. Clinical signs included photodermatitis, progressive emaciation, apathy, weakness, neurological signs such as drownsiness, aimless walking and unsteady gait, jaundice and hemoglobinuria. There was amelioration of the skin lesions in those sheep that developed hepatogenous photosensitization. Main necropsy findings in 9 sheep included small, firm, tan or greenish liver with few to numerous small, yellowish, well-circumscribed nodules measuring up to 3 mm in diameter and randomly scattered throughout the hepatic parenchyma. There was also marked distension of the gallbladder which contained large amounts of inspissated, dark green bile and straw-colored cavitary effusions (hydropericardium and ascitis). Five sheep developed lethal acute hemolytic crisis, secondary to massive release into the blood stream of copper accumulated in the liver (hepatogenous chronic copper poisoning). Apart from the aforementioned liver lesions, other gross findings in those animals included severe and diffuse jaundice, dark brown urine (hemoglobinuria) and swollen, friable, finely stippled or diffusely dark kidneys. The main histopathological findings included hepatomegalocytosis, biliary ductal proliferation (bile duct hyperplasia) and moderate periportal fibrosis. The portal triads were infiltrated with variable numbers of mononuclear cells. There was heavy accumulation of brownish pigment in macrophages identified as ceroid or copper with PAS and rhodanine stainings, respectively. Those ceroid and copper-laden macrophages were scattered on the remnant hepatic parenchyma or formed small aggregates in the portal triads. Main histopathological findings in the kidneys of 5 sheep, that developed fatal hepatogenous chronic <b>copper</b> poisoning, included <b>tubular</b> nephrosis, accumulation of hemoglobin and hemosiderin in epithelial tubular cells and hemoglobin casts (hemoglobinuric nephrosis). Morphological evidence of hepatic encephalopathy included spongy degeneration (status spongiosus) of the cerebral white matter. Ultrastructural changes in the liver of affected sheep included degenerative hepatocellular changes of varying severity. There was accumulation of numerous lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes and lysosomes containing substances of high electron-density that corresponded to ceroid-lipofuscin {{in most of the}} cases. In addition, there was mild swelling of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and moderate hyperplasia of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in some areas of the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes. Proximal convoluted tubular epithelial cells showed intracellular edema and a variety of mitochondrial degenerative changes. These included disarrangement and breakup of cristae, finely granular matrix, accumulation of lipid globules and rupture of the membranes in a few cases. Many epithelial tubular cells displayed substances of high electron-density within lysosomes. Chemical analysis of copper in liver and kidney samples of affected sheep revealed high concentrations varying from 369 ppm to 1248 ppm in the liver and ranging from 152 ppm to 687 ppm in the kidneys (dry matter). The diagnosis of Senecio brasiliensis poisoning was based on epidemiological data, clinical signs, necropsy findings, histological lesions and laboratory data...|$|R
