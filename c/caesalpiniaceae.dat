No host species were herbaceous. Every host family and genus recorded contained species which were not documented as mistletoe host species. The two major genera of host species were Eucalyptus and Acacia with 2084, and 2559 records respectively. There were 187 species of Eucalyptus and 150 species of Acacia. Seven mistletoe species commonly parasitised exotic host species including L. exocarpi. The commonly recorded exotic host species included Nerium oleander, Citrus spp., Prunus spp., Schinus molle and Quercus spp.L. exocarpi was found in 901 records and 109 species. The host families were Apocynaceae, <b>Caesalpiniaceae,</b> Capparaceae, Casuarinaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Fabaceae, Fagaceae, Loranthaceae, Malvaceae, Meliaceae, Mimosaceae, Moraceae, Myoporaceae, Myrtaceae, Oleaceae, Pittosporaceae, Polygonaceae, Proteaceae, Rhamnaceae, Rutaceae, Santalaceae, Sapindaceae, Solanaceae and Zygophyllaceae. In a 1990 study of L. exocarpi subsp. exocarpi in Southern South Australia, Yan found that this species showed a specific preference for Alectryon oleifolius and Myoporum platycarpum supporting Barlow's view that all Australian mistletoes of open forest and woodland are host specific to some extent. He also found that rainfall was a determining factor in regulating the distribution.|$|E
5000|$|Olof Peter Swartz (September 21, 1760 [...] - [...] September 19, 1818) was a Swedish {{botanist}} and taxonomist. He is {{best known}} for his taxonomic work and studies into pteridophytes. He attended the University of Uppsala where he studied under Carolus Linnaeus the Younger and received his doctorate in 1781. He first traveled in 1780, to Lapland in the company of several other botanists. [...] In 1783 he sailed for North America and the West Indies, primarily in the area of Jamaica and Hispaniola, to collect botanical specimens. [...] His botanical collection, of an impressive 6000 specimens, is now held by the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as part of the Regnellian herbarium.By 1786 he left for London to prepare his collection. There he met Joseph Banks, who was impressed with his knowledge of Botany. He was offered a position with the British East India Company as a travelling physician, but turned it down, and returned to Sweden in 1787. Ten years later he proposed to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he became a member in 1789) the idea of a permanent travel grant, based on the methods he had seen employed by Banks within the British Empire. In 1791 he became Professor Bergianus at the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805.Swartz was the first specialist of orchid taxonomy, who published a critical review of orchid literature and classified the 25 genera that he recognized through his own work. He was also the first to realize that most orchids have one stamen, while slipper orchids have two. The genus Swartzia (<b>Caesalpiniaceae,</b> Fabaceae or Leguminosae) was named in his honor by Schreber.|$|E

40|$|WOS: 000177253200003 International audienceTo {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that primate populations are limited by food resources, we studied the feeding ecology of three cercopithecines and one colobine in a rain forest in central Gabon. Simultaneously, we monitored the fruiting phenology of trees and estimated the biomass of the monkey community. The Makande Forest is dominated by <b>Caesalpiniaceae</b> and characterized {{by a lack of}} secondary vegetation and of trees species producing fleshy fruits. Fruit production was irregular intra- and interannually. Fruiting peaks of dry fruits (mainly <b>Caesalpiniaceae)</b> and of fleshy fruits occurred at the same period. However, interseasonal and interannual variability was greater in <b>Caesalpiniaceae</b> than in other families. As a result, the Makande forest is subject to bottlenecks when food is scarce. On an annual basis, seeds (primarily <b>Caesalpiniaceae)</b> dominated the diet of all monkeys. On a seasonal basis, cercopithecines preferentially consumed fleshy fruits {{as long as they were}} available, whereas colobines increased consumption of young leaves when seed availability declined. The consumption of mature leaves was low. The monkey community biomass (ca. 204 kg/km(2)) is one of the lowest in Central Africa. We suggest that both cercopithecine and colobine populations are limited as a result of the combined effect of the dominance of <b>Caesalpiniaceae,</b> which provide dry fruits according to a mast-fruiting pattern and mature leaves of low quality, and the lack of seral successional stages, which provide fleshy fruit on a more regular pattern and leaves of better quality. During the period of food scarcity, cercopithecines should suffer from the low availability of fleshy fruit, which are their favorite food. At the same period, colobines should be limited by the low availability of edible leaves. Similar low primate biomasses are found in forests dominated by <b>Caesalpiniaceae</b> or Lecythidaceae in South America and in Dipterocarpaceae forests in South Asia, which suggests that their biological characteristics, in particular dry fruits and mast fruiting, are unfavorable to monkey populations. Our results confirm that habitat mosaics may support larger populations of primary consumers than homogeneous primary forests can...|$|E
