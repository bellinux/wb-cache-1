5|$|Crushed shells {{are added}} as a {{calcareous}} {{supplement to the}} diet of laying poultry. Oyster shell and <b>cockle</b> shell are often {{used for this purpose}} and are obtained as a by-product from other industries.|$|E
5|$|The many {{inhabitants}} of the tidal flats include lugworms, polychaete worms, sand hoppers and other amphipod crustaceans, and gastropod molluscs. These molluscs feed on the algae growing {{on the surface of}} the mud, and include the tiny Hydrobia, an important food for waders because of its abundance at densities of more than 130,000m−2. Bivalve molluscs include the edible common <b>cockle,</b> although it is not harvested here.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland pastures and marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the <b>cockle</b> industry.|$|E
50|$|Predators find it {{difficult}} to pierce the shell of adult <b>cockles.</b> Sea birds drop <b>cockles</b> from high up, smashing their shells, to eat the body, but fish (such as flounder) can't break the shells. Younger <b>cockles</b> are more vulnerable to predation because their shells aren't as hard as adult <b>cockles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Laevicardium, {{common name}} [...] "egg cockles", is a genus of {{saltwater}} clams or <b>cockles,</b> marine bivalve molluscs {{in the family}} Cardiidae, the <b>cockles.</b> [...] They are unusual among the <b>cockles</b> in that they have smooth, rounded, [...] "egg-like" [...] valves.|$|R
50|$|Dinocardium is a genus {{of large}} {{saltwater}} clams or <b>cockles,</b> marine bivalve mollusks {{in the family}} Cardiidae, the <b>cockles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Lobster {{fishing was}} done {{on a small scale}} {{especially}} in Cardigan Bay, but was reserved almost exclusively for export. Welsh fisherman {{would be more likely to}} eat the less profitable crabs. Cockles have been harvested since Roman times and are still harvested in a traditional manner with a hand rake and scraper. <b>Cockle</b> picking still happens in the Gower peninsula, but due to the difficulty in getting licences and reduced yield, villages near the Carmarthen Bay no longer gather them.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the <b>cockle</b> Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|The lagoons {{behind the}} shingle beach at Salthouse and Cley are salty {{due to the}} {{percolation}} of seawater through the bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including the starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, and lagoon <b>cockle.</b> These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the water beetle yellow pogonus, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E
30|$|Normally, blood <b>cockles</b> exhibit {{resistance}} to low salinity. For example, from a salt-resistance experiment on blood <b>cockles</b> by Davenport and Wong (1986), the <b>cockles</b> showed a clear shell-closing reaction upon exposure to salinity {{of less than}} 19  PSU; about 50  % of them survived at salinity of 16  PSU, while the mortality rate was 100  % upon exposure to salinity of lower than 10  PSU for a week. Therefore, mass mortality of blood <b>cockles</b> is extremely likely upon exposure to a low-salinity environment of lower than 10  PSU {{for a week or}} more, which affects the filtering activity that <b>cockles</b> can exhibit at a salinity level of 16 – 19  PSU.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cockles</b> {{are sold}} freshly cooked as a snack in the United Kingdom, {{particularly}} in {{those parts of}} the British coastline where <b>cockles</b> are abundant. Boiled, then seasoned with malt vinegar and white pepper, they can be bought from seafood stalls, which also often have for sale mussels, whelks, jellied eels, crabs and shrimp. <b>Cockles</b> are also available pickled in jars, and more recently, have been sold in sealed packets (with vinegar) containing a plastic two-pronged fork. A meal of <b>cockles</b> fried with bacon, served with laver bread, is known as a traditional Welsh breakfast.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cockles</b> live in {{harbours}} and estuaries in New Zealand. They {{live in the}} subtidal to intertidal zone, {{and when}} they are in the intertidal zone they live between the low tide mark and the mid tide mark. <b>Cockles</b> are unable to survive above the mid tide mark because of the increased exposure time. <b>Cockles</b> prefer to live in soft mud and fine sand, however they can be suffocated by extremely fine sand. For this reason, they mainly live in areas with a large grain size. The <b>cockles</b> bury 2 to 3 cm under the sand.|$|R
5|$|Arnold's Marsh and {{the other}} lagoons nearest the beach are salty due to the {{percolation}} of seawater through the shingle bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, the mysid shrimps Paramysis nouveli and Neomysis integer, lagoon <b>cockle,</b> the bug Orthotylus rubidus and spire snail. Little whirlpool ramshorn snail {{has been found in}} a freshwater channel. Rare beetles associated with these coastal environments include yellow pogonus, Bembidion ephippium and Tachys scutellaris. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the Pogonus species, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E
5|$|The first castle {{built on}} the site was {{probably}} of an octagonal design, running {{along the top of}} the ridge, protected by square and semi-circular mural towers, with a barbican guarding the eastern entrance. It probably resembled White Castle, remodelled by de Burgh in the same period, or Bolingbroke and Beeston Castles, both built in the 1220s. The castle was built of Kentish ragstone and cemented by a mortar containing a large proportion of seashells, particularly cockleshells from the <b>cockle</b> beds of neighbouring Canvey Island. A valuable tidal watermill had been built by 1249, essential for making bread for the castle; recent archaeological work suggests that it was positioned on a wharf reaching out into the estuary just to the south-east of the castle. Terraced gardens were built along the south side of the castle overlooking the estuary, probably including vineyards.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey by}} {{archaeologist}} Howard Thomas in 1979 unearthed {{a number of}} medieval potsherds {{in the vicinity of}} the farmhouse and found evidence of continuous occupation of the island including middens containing numerous animal bones along with oyster and <b>cockle</b> shells. Fragments of green glazed jugs and flagons from the late 12th to 13th century and shards of pottery from the 14th century were also found on the island. The presence of Pennant sandstone roofing tiles and a fragment of a 14th-century glazed ridge tile indicate the existence of a substantial medieval building, possibly a chapel, demolished when the present farmhouse was constructed. Property records from 1542 show that King Henry VIII granted a lease to farm the island to a gentleman by the name of Edmund Tournor. His family remained on Flat Holm until the end of the 17th century when the lease passed to Joseph Robins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cockles</b> were {{harvested}} {{for centuries}} by women {{to supplement their}} families' income. Once the <b>cockles</b> were gathered and bagged, they were transported on donkeys to the Ferryside railway station, a 2-hour round trip. The arduous work was {{in addition to the}} care they gave their families and home. Their husbands worked in the mines, at the brickworks or on the land. Women's harvesting of <b>cockles</b> ended in 1973.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cockles</b> are an {{effective}} bait {{for a wide}} variety of sea fishes. The folk song [...] "Molly Malone" [...] is also known as [...] "Cockles and Mussels" [...] because the title character's sale of the two foods is referred to in the song's refrain. The shells of <b>cockles</b> are mentioned in the English nursery rhyme [...] "Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary". <b>Cockles</b> are also eaten by the indigenous peoples of North America.|$|R
5000|$|The mantle {{has three}} {{apertures}} (inhalant, exhalant, and pedal) for siphoning water {{and for the}} foot to protrude. <b>Cockles</b> typically burrow using the foot, and feed by filtering plankton from the surrounding water. <b>Cockles</b> are capable of [...] "jumping" [...] by bending and straightening the foot. As {{is the case in}} many bivalves, <b>cockles</b> display gonochorism (the sex of an individual varies according to conditions), and some species reach maturity rapidly.|$|R
25|$|Sand and mudflats {{surrounding}} the shore platform contain cockles, pipi (Paphies australis), crabs and Polychaete worms. Because of the <b>cockle</b> bed {{out in the}} sea, the <b>cockle</b> shells wash up high on the beach during storms. The sand can be found underneath.|$|E
25|$|The coquaternions were {{initially}} introduced (under that name) in 1849 by James <b>Cockle</b> in the Londonndash&Edinburghndash&Dublin Philosophical Magazine. The introductory papers by <b>Cockle</b> were recalled in the 1904 Bibliography of the Quaternion Society. Alexander Macfarlane called {{the structure of}} coquaternion vectors an exspherical system when he was speaking at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900.|$|E

3000|$|... 2  kg of <b>cockles</b> (Anadara granosa) freshly {{delivered}} {{that day}} {{were obtained from}} the wet market in Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia and quickly brought to the laboratory in an iced cooler box. For the study, the <b>cockles</b> were divided into two groups, namely spiked and unspiked group with the assumption that <b>cockles</b> are harvested uniformly from the beginning of harvesting until being placed in cold storage at the market. Half of the <b>cockles</b> in both groups were pre-treated by being stored at − 20  °C for 24  h, followed by exposure to UV light at 20  °C for 4  h prior to DNA extraction. This pretreatment was considered as a preventive measure to limit or at least minimize naturally accumulated V. parahaemolyticus in the <b>cockles.</b> However, a higher pasteurization regime of 70  °C was not applied as the aim of the controlled condition in this study was to mimic the actual situation of fresh <b>cockles.</b> Meanwhile, {{the other half of the}} samples in both groups were directly sent for analysis as soon as the samples arrived in the laboratory.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of dietary 20 : 5 n- 3 (EPA), 22 : 6 n- 3 (DHA) and 20 : 4 n- 6 (ARA) for growth, survival and fatty acid composition of juvenile <b>cockles</b> (Cerastoderma edule) was investigated. <b>Cockles</b> of 6. 24 ± 0. 04 mm and 66. 14 ± 0. 34 mg (live weight) were distributed into three treatments where live microalgae diets were fed constantly below the pseudofaeces production threshold, for three weeks. Diets had distinct fatty acid profiles: high EPA (53 % Chaetoceros muelleri + 47 % Pyramimonas parkeae), no DHA (47 % Brachiomonas submarina + 53 % Tetraselmis suecica) and low ARA concentrations (73 % P. parkeae + 27 % Phaeodactylum tricornutum). Growth was positively affected by high EPA and low ARA diets, whereas no significant growth was observed {{for the no}} DHA diet. High mortality of <b>cockles</b> fed no DHA diet raises questions about its suitability for <b>cockles.</b> In balanced diets with EPA and DHA, lower concentrations of ARA do not limit growth. The impact of dietary fatty acids {{was evident in the}} fatty acids of neutral and polar lipids of <b>cockles.</b> In polar lipids of all <b>cockles,</b> there was a decrease in EPA, in contrast to an increase in DHA. The combination of EPA and DHA in a live microalgae diet was beneficial for the growth and survival of juvenile <b>cockles...</b>|$|R
