5|$|Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived {{together}} in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother remembered {{that he did not}} know his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett once took advantage of an extended <b>car</b> <b>ride</b> when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often the center of attention among his peers.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons go to {{the local}} movie theater to see a film. Bart and Lisa see Space Mutants VI, while Homer, Marge, and Maggie see The Stockholm Affair. As the film starts, Homer acts loud and obnoxious, {{embarrassing}} Marge. When he gives away the film's ending, Marge berates him and the audience heckles Homer, embarrassing them both. During the <b>car</b> <b>ride</b> home, Marge tries to apologize, but Homer will not accept it, by dropping Marge and the children off at home and goes off on a long drive into the night, finally stopping at a redneck bar called Beer 'N' Brawl, where he grabs a beer while listening to an attractive waitress named Lurleen Lumpkin performing on stage. She sings a song that follows Homer's current state with every detail, and once she finishes, Homer introduces himself to her.|$|E
5|$|Logan and Mac {{continue}} to make progress on his business school report, but Mac has to call Max (Adam Rose) to continue. Desmond goes skinny dipping at his party, while Mac and Max flirt in front of Logan. Veronica discovers that Desmond’s bag was actually switched with another person’s. Veronica and Piz retrieve it, and on the <b>car</b> <b>ride</b> home, they briefly discuss their kiss at the party before playing a CD with some of Desmond’s unreleased newer material. Keith reconnects with Leo D’Amato (Max Greenfield), who presents a case involving the Fitzpatricks to him. They stake out where the Fitzpatricks are, and Keith sees Vinnie Van Lowe helping them. However, they quickly learn that Vinnie is actually investigating the case and has trapped them in the store. Veronica and Piz supposedly get stuck in traffic and tell Desmond to play some of his newer songs until they get there, but they actually are at the concert venue and just want him to expose the audience to his solo material.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{a unique}} data set of driving {{behavior}} we find direct evidence that private information has significant effects on contract choice and risk in automobile insurance. The number of <b>car</b> <b>rides</b> {{and the relative}} distance driven on weekends are significant risk factors. While the number of <b>car</b> <b>rides</b> and average speeding are negatively related {{to the level of}} liability coverage, the number of <b>car</b> <b>rides</b> and the relative distance driven at night are positively related to the level of first-party coverage. These results indicate multiple and counteracting effects of private information based on risk preferences and driving behavior...|$|R

25|$|Super Go Karts: The karts {{were meant}} to be driven around a small loop track at a speed of about 20mph (32km/h) set by the {{governor}} devices on them. However, park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by wedging tennis balls into them, and they were known to do so for parkgoers. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine <b>car</b> <b>ride</b> became a chance to play bumper cars at 50mph (80km/h), and many injuries resulted from head-on collisions. Also, the engines were poorly maintained, and some riders were overcome by gasoline fumes as they drove.|$|E

25|$|Due to Reeves' neck injury, some of {{the action}} scenes had to be rescheduled to wait for his full recovery. As a result, the filming began with scenes that did not require much {{physical}} exertion, such as the scene in Thomas Anderson's office, the interrogation room, or the <b>car</b> <b>ride</b> in which Neo is taken to see the Oracle. Locations for these scenes included Martin Place's fountain in Sydney, half-way {{between it and the}} adjacent Colonial Building, and the Colonial Building itself. During the scene set on a government building rooftop, the team filmed extra footage of Neo dodging bullets in case the bullet time process did not work.|$|E

25|$|Mireille {{spent all}} of 1966 and 1967 touring. It was then, during a <b>car</b> <b>ride</b> to another concert, that Stark advised Mireille that she was finally debt free, and worth {{more than a million}} francs ($200k USD in 1967). She had always prayed that she could get her family out of poverty, but the touring and singing were much more {{important}} at the time. In her autobiography, she stated her first major purchases were a vehicle for her father's business and a large home for her parents and siblings. Most importantly, she had a telephone installed for the family, so her parents no longer {{had to go to the}} pharmacy to talk to her while she was in Paris. Her one regret, was that she was unable to see her grandmother Germaine in the hospital before she died because of all the tour contracts.|$|E
25|$|Morey {{demonstrated}} his {{engine in}} New York and Philadelphia {{and there are}} eyewitness reports for both. In Philadelphia, he demonstrated it powering a boat and a wagon. Unfortunately, {{when he decided to}} demonstrate the car on the street, he fell off after starting the engine and the vehicle powered across Market Street into a ditch. This was the second <b>car</b> <b>ride</b> in the world, and the first in the United States. Despite these mostly successful demonstrations, Morey could not find a buyer, and became frustrated. A letter from Reverend Dana of Orford written in October 1829 tells of Morey’s trip to Baltimore, “I am told, the Capt. Is determined to make one more vigorous effort, to sell his patent right for some of his modern inventions , and if he does not now succeed, he will give the matter up, and return to Orford, to spend his days in quiet.” Morey did not find a buyer, and as he was then in his late 60s, it made sense to stop traveling {{up and down the east}} coast and call it quits.|$|E
500|$|Cavallo {{was chosen}} as the main {{producer}} of the album, with Jerry Finn as the mixer. Green Day originally gave the first demo tape to Cavallo, and after listening to it during the <b>car</b> <b>ride</b> home he sensed that [...] " [...] had stumbled on something big." [...] The band's recording session lasted three weeks and the album was remixed twice. Armstrong claimed that the band wanted to create a dry sound, [...] "similar to the Sex Pistols' album or first Black Sabbath albums." [...] The band felt the original mix to be unsatisfactory. Cavallo agreed, and it was remixed at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California. Armstrong later said of their studio experience, [...] "Everything was already written, all we had to do was play it." ...|$|E
