40|$|The {{quality of}} many <b>consumer</b> <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> or {{services}} is sufficiently complex or obscure that consumers cannot completely verify the true quality {{in a single}} usage. For such ‘experience’ products or services, the accumulated consumer consumption experience of a brand is an important determinant of its sales or market share. The market share of a brand is in turn directly influenced by its own and the competitive price and advertising strategies, given the different levels of quality (among other factors). In this paper, we investigate {{the impact of the}} aggregate consumption experience on the firm's dynamic pricing and advertising strategies by developing a formal game-theoretic model of a dynamic duopoly. The model of competition does not yield explicit closed-form expressions for the dynamic price and advertising paths of the two firms. Hence, we simulate the equilibrium paths using a discrete-time algorithm. Our simulation results provide interesting insights into the dynamic equilibrium price and advertising paths, under a variety of realistic competitive scenarios...|$|E

This paper estimates a consumption function for <b>nondurable</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> and services which best utilizes {{the information contained in}} the data. The function satisfies high statistical standards and has a sound theoretical basis as well. Short-run dynamics are modeled together with long-run equilibrium behavior. The results show that short-run responses to changes in the determinants (income, prices) are smaller than those in the long run because consumers adapt their behavior to changes in the environment if these changes are viewed as permanent. This produces the stabilizing effect of consumption over the business cycle.

40|$|Separate {{macroeconomic}} consumption demand {{functions are}} developed and tested for (1) durable <b>goods,</b> (2) <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> and (3) services. These are compared for consistency with econometric studies of total consumer demand. Key factors determining demand for these goods are tested using U. S. 1960 - 2000 data. The econometric method used was 2 SLS with heteroskedasticity controls. Data in first differences {{are used to}} reduce multicollinearity, non stationarity and autocorrelation. The models explain 94 % {{of the variance in}} demand for consumer durables, 86 % of demand for <b>nondurable</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> and 81 % of services demand. Demand for durables like autos and appliances, was found to be driven by the disposable income, wealth, the exchange rate, availability of consumer credit, interest rates on consumer credit, demand for new housing, which affects appliance demand, and population growth. Demand for <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods,</b> such as groceries and clothes, was driven by the same factors, except for new housing demand and the exchange rate. Demand for consumer services such as laundry, restaurant, and entertainment services was found to be related to disposable income, wealth, and population growth, but not related to consumer credit availability, or consumer credit interest rates.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a structural econometric model of <b>consumer</b> demand for <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods,</b> which exhibits network externalities. The structural model {{allows us to}} identify the parameters, which determine {{the strength of the}} externalities in the underlying economic model from the empirical estimation results. The estimates of these parameters can then be employed to test the economic significance of the externalities and the compatibility of networks. The identifying assumption that drives our results is that consumers care about the lagged instead of the current network size. We argue that it does not necessarily bound their rationality. To complete our structural model, we provide an example of functional specification that yields a simple linear stochastic model of demand. Using this functional specification, we identify all structural parameters of the model. In the end, the estimation and the stochastic structure of the resulting econometric model are discussed...|$|R

This paper examines the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), and the Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE), a subcomponent of ICS also used in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators Index. Using simple two variable regressions ICS lagged one year explained considerable variance in current consumption (but not vice versa). Both the ICS and ICE lagged one year were found systematically related to <b>consumer</b> demand for <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods,</b> but not durable goods, services, or total consumer demand when an extensive list of other factors affecting demand such as income, wealth, interest rates, credit availability and the exchange rate were controlled for.

40|$|We study {{consumption}} of durable and <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> when the durable good {{is subject to}} transaction costs. In the model, agents derive utility from a service flow of a durable good and a consumption flow of a <b>nondurable</b> <b>good.</b> The key feature of the model is {{the existence of a}} fixed transaction cost in the durable good market. The fixed cost induces an inaction region in the purchase of the durable good. More importantly, the inability to adjust the durable stock induces variation in {{consumption of}} the <b>nondurable</b> <b>good</b> over the inaction region. The variation {{is a function of the}} degree of complementarity between durable and <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> in the period utility function, the rate of intertemporal substitution, and a precautionary motive induced by incomplete markets. We test the model using the PSID. Housing serves as the durable good. The data indicate an increase in consumption before moving to a smaller house and a decrease in consumption before moving to a larger house. This result is consistent with the model when there exists complementarity between the durable and <b>nondurable</b> <b>good</b> or when there is a strong precautionary effect.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study whether trade {{frictions}} in durable goods markets help account for the patterns of household consumption expenditures observed in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), namely that the response of durable goods expenditures to income shocks is 78 percent larger than that of <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> and the variance of the idiosyncratic part of log durable goods expenditures is four times as high as that of log <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> expenditures. To do so, I develop a model with a continuum of households that purchase durable as well as <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods.</b> The key assumption is that durable goods cannot be rented or sold after purchase.

40|$|This paper uses a two-good {{version of}} Hall's (1978) {{representative}} agent, permanent income model to derive a structural import demand equation for <b>nondurable</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>goods.</b> Under the identification restriction that taste shocks are stationary, {{the model is}} shown to imply that log imports, log domestic goods, and the log relative price of imports are co-integrated. The data decisively reject the null hypothesis that imports, the relative price of imports, and the consumption of home goods are not co-integrated. We employ the non-linear least squares technique recently proposed by Phillips and Loretan (1990 > to estimate {{the parameters of the}} import demand equation. The long-run price elasticity of import demand is estimated to be - 0. 95. The elasticity of import demand with respect to a permanent increase in real spending is estimated to be 2. 20. These estimates fall within the range reported in studies by Helkie and Hooper (1986), Cline (1989), and the many studies surveyed by Goldstein and Kahn (1985) The message of this paper is that, at least for non-durable consumer goods, it is possible to interpret the traditional import demand equation as a co-integrating regression, and to interpret the price and expenditure elasticities estimated from such a trade equation as a co-integrating vector. Estimates of the co-integrating vector can be used to recover estimates of the utility parameters of the representative household. The similarity between the OLS and Phillips-Loretan estimates of the parameters suggests that the simultaneous equation bias is not large. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{conducting}} empirical {{investigations of}} the permanent income model of consumption and the consumption-based intertemporal asset pricing model, various authors have imposed restrictions {{on the nature of}} the substitutability of consumption across goods and over time. In this paper we suggest a method for testing some of these restrictions and present empirical results using this approach. Our empirical analyses focuses on three questions: (i) Can the services from durable and <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> be treated as perfect substitutes? (ii) Are preferences completely separable between durable and <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods?</b> (iii) What is the nature of intertemporal substitutability of nondurable consumption? When consumers' preferences are assumed to be quadratic, there is very little evidence against the hypothesis that the services from durable <b>goods</b> and <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> are perfect substitutes. These results call into question the practice of testing quadratic models of aggregate consumption using data on nondurables and services only. When we consider S branch specifications, we find more evidence against perfect substitutability between service flows, but less evidence against strict separability across durable and <b>nondurable</b> consumption <b>goods.</b> Among other things, these findings suggest that the empirical shortcomings of the intertemporal asset pricing model cannot be attributed to the neglect of durable goods. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{classification}} of consumption <b>goods</b> into <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods,</b> durable goods {{and a new}} class which we call “memorable ” goods. A good is memorable if a consumer can draw current utility from its past consumption experience through memory. We propose a novel consumption-savings model in which a consumer has a well-defined preference ordering over both <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> and memorable goods. Memorable goods consumption differs from <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> consumption in that current memorable goods consumption may also impact future utility through the accumulation process of the stock of memory. In our model, households optimally choose a lumpy profile of memorable goods consumption even in a frictionless world. Using Consumer Expenditure Survey data, we then document levels and volatilities of different groups of consumption goods expenditures, {{as well as their}} expenditure patterns, and show that the expenditure patterns on memorable goods indeed differ significantly from those on <b>nondurable</b> and durable <b>goods.</b> Finally, we empirically evaluate our model’s predictions with respect to the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations and conduct an excess-sensitivity test of the consumption response to predictable income changes. We find that (i) the welfare cost of household-level consumption fluctuations may be overstated by 1. 7 percentage points (11. 9 % points as opposed to 13. 6 % points of permanent consumption) if memorable goods are not appropriately accounted for; (ii) the finding of excess sensitivity of consumption documented in important papers of the literature might be entirely due to the presence of memorable goods...|$|R

40|$|Household {{production}} varies substantially across {{developed and}} less developed countries. In this paper, I first provide a VAR-based evidence that services are more interest-sensitive than <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods.</b> To match that differential, a standard two-sector sticky price model requires an implausibly {{high degree of}} sectoral heterogeneity in price stickiness. In this paper, I build a model that mimics the above empirical fact without relying on such heterogeneity. A key feature of the model is {{the inclusion of a}} household sector, which produces services at home (caring for children, cooking, cleaning, etc.), that are substitutes to a subset of market-provided services. Therefore, when fixing their prices (following an expansionary monetary policy for example), producers of market-services internalize the fact that households might decide to produce the services on their own, if they raise their prices ”too much”. This causes an endogenous downward shift of the ”Augmented”New-Keynesian Phillips curve in the service sector, inducing a higher nominal rigidity in that sector. Conversely, firms in the <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> sector do not face the direct competition of households who typically produce services. As a consequence, the real effects of monetary shocks are stronger in the service sector than in the <b>nondurable</b> <b>goods</b> sector, which is consistent with empirical evidence...|$|R
