40|$|National Natural Science Foundation [51075343]; Fundamental Research Funds of Xiamen University [201212 G 011]The {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} corrective characteristics of {{three kinds of}} polishing methods for mid-frequency errors was studied, which was aimed to confirm the possibility that <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> optical surfacing and <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> active-lap can be replaced by bonnet polishing in the machining process. The {{first step was to}} calculate the removal functions of three kinds of polishing technologies and use fast Fourier transform to figure out the frequency spectrum of each method. After that, according to the frequency spectra, curves of cut-off frequencies related to the working ranges of spatial frequencies errors were obtained. It revealed that the affected scope of spatial frequencies is determined by the polishing method, diameter size of polishing tool and shape of removal function. Moreover, only low-frequency errors could be modified and mid-frequency errors could not be corrected or created by <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> active-lap, and <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> optical surfacing can correct part of the mid-frequency errors and low-frequency errors in the polishing process, {{but at the same time}} can produce some new mid-frequency errors; as for bonnet polishing, it can be <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> active-lap-like in smoothing which only modified and created the low-frequency errors or <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> optical surfacing-like which corrected and created the mid-frequency errors in local polishing. Otherwise, the efficiency of bonnet polishing is higher than the other two methods. As a result, seen from the point of correction ability of mid-frequency or polishing efficiency, bonnet polishing could replace <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> active-lap and <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> optical surfacing for finishing two polishing stages by only one tool, which is significant to extending the application of bonnet polishing in optical manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|The major {{objective}} of this program was to define the exact role of an on-board spacecraft <b>computer</b> in the <b>control</b> of ion thrusters. An initial <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> system with accurate high speed capability was designed, programmed, and tested with the computer as the sole control element for an operating ion thruster. The command functions and a code format for a spacecraft digital control system were established. A second <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> system was constructed to operate with these functions and format. A throttle program sequence was established and tested. A two thruster array was tested with these <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> systems and the results reported...|$|R

50|$|Data General Corp. v. Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls,</b> Inc. was a 1971 case {{in which}} the Delaware Court of Chancery {{determined}} that widespread, confidential disclosure of trade secrets does not necessarily compromise their secrecy. Data General Corporation distributed design documentation with its Nova 1200 minicomputer, notifying owners of the confidentiality of these design drawings through contractual agreements and explicit text on the drawings (essentially a shrinkwrap license). After acquiring drawings with a Nova 1200 purchase, Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls</b> designed its own nearly identical minicomputer. Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls</b> maintained that its use of the documentation was proper because Data General Corporation inadequately maintained the secrecy of the design drawings by distributing them to many customers. The court found that Data General Corporation had sufficiently protected the secrecy of the drawings and that Digital <b>Computer</b> <b>Controls</b> was thus in violation of trade secret law for improperly using confidential information.|$|R

The absence of a common definition of <b>computer</b> <b>control</b> may, in part, be due to the relative newness of <b>computer</b> <b>controls.</b> A key feature of many organisations today is change. Although not necessarily the driver of change, IT is invariably an intrinsec component and much of the change would not be possible without IT. IT has had a major impact on social, economic and political factors throughout the world. Not only has it {{led to the creation of}} new professions but it has also revolutionised others, such as office work, or, when combined with robotics, manufacturing industries. <b>control,</b> risk assessment, <b>computer</b> environment, data testing, impact of <b>computers</b> on <b>controls...</b>|$|R
