5|$|His {{successor}} at Ipswich was {{his assistant}} manager Bobby Ferguson. Under Ferguson, Town finished mid-table twice, but worsening performances {{meant that they}} began to struggle in the top division. The recent <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expensive new stand at Portman Road had limited the club's budget, despite the money gaining from sales of key players including Frans Thijssen and John Wark.|$|E
5|$|Lillehammer {{failed at}} its bid {{to host the}} 2012 Winter Youth Olympics, losing to Innsbruck, Austria, but was awarded the 2016 edition as the only bidder. The bid was based on reuse of the {{heritage}} and venues from the 1994 Olympics. Beyond the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Olympic Village, the only major upgrade to the venues is {{the addition of a}} curling rink in Kristins Hall.|$|E
5|$|Redfish and trout {{were once}} the main {{species of fish}} living in the lake, until the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{embankment}} reduced their populations. A large quantity of silt is now deposited in the lake from the Guadalupe River, after the dredging of a freshwater channel that supplies farmers and the Union Carbide plant in Seadrift. The channel has negatively affected the delta ecosystem by diminishing the river's nutritional input.|$|E

5|$|All-weather {{lifeboats}} (ALBs) {{are large}} boats with enclosed wheelhouses and survivor spaces below deck, which are self-righting and {{can go out}} in all weather conditions. Some ALBs carry an inflatable Y-class lifeboat or Y-boat for inshore work, launched by mechanical arm. There are six classes of ALB motor life boats, with speeds ranging from 17 to 25 knots. The RNLI's aim {{is to provide a}} 25-knot lifeboat to every all-weather crew, and has begun <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> All-weather Lifeboat Centre (ALC) in Poole which, when complete, will save £3million a year. The RNLI took over the ALC in 2015 with the expectation of becoming fully operational in 2019, when six Shannon-class lifeboats a year will be built.|$|E
5|$|An {{aircraft}} {{manufacturing industry}} {{was established in}} the town with the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Airspeed factory at Christchurch Airfield in 1942. In 1948 the factory became part of de Havilland and manufactured a wide range of aircraft such as the Vampire, Sea Venom and Sea Vixen. In the 1950s, Bournemouth Airport, a former RAF base situated on the outskirts of borough boundaries at Hurn, also became heavily involved in aircraft production after Vickers Armstrong—which later became the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC)—established a factory at the airport.|$|E
50|$|In 1957, Douglas R. Lewis became {{headmaster}} <b>of</b> Summit, <b>a</b> {{capacity in}} which he served for thirty-three years.

5|$|As Osijek grew as a city, the fort's {{presence}} hindered {{the potential}} for urban development. The demolition {{of most of the}} fort walls happened between 1923 and 1926, with the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electric tramway. The last gunpowder magazine, located behind the church of St. Michael, was demolished in 1958. While most of the fortifications have been demolished (only the first and eighth bastions and the northern wall with its so-called 'water gate' were kept), the center of Tvrđa remains intact. The Yugoslav People's Army maintained a garrison and a military hospital in Tvrđa, but in the 1980s these buildings were gradually being abandoned, and adapted into ateliers for local painters and sculptors.|$|E
5|$|At home, the U.S. {{experienced}} sustained {{economic expansion}} and a {{rapid growth of}} its population and middle class. <b>Construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments. In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state added to the country. The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination. Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the 2008 campaign, Hunter had served in Congress since 1981; {{representing}} California's 42nd (1981–83), 45th (1983-93), and 52nd (since 1993) congressional districts. During his tenure, he boasted a 92% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union (ACU). Some of his successes included the passage of legislation leading to the construction of the 14-mile double-fence from the Pacific Ocean to Otay Mesa along the U.S.-Mexico border. He also helped pass the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which provided for the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> additional 670 miles of fence. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Hunter pushed for increased military spending and advancements in military technology. He became chairman of the committee in 2003 and remained in the position until the Democratic Party won the majority of the House in the 2006 mid-term election.|$|E

5|$|Between 1925 and 1928, Ny-Ålesund saw four air {{expeditions to}} the North Pole, {{two of which}} {{required}} the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> airship hangar and mast. The first proposal for an airport in Ny-Ålesund was launched in 1956 by Norsk Polar Navigasjon, who proposed an airport at Kvadehuksletta. Soviet protests against the airport caused the Norwegian authorities to oppose the plans, which were laid {{to rest in the}} early 1960s. Construction at Hamnerabben started in 1965 following the decision to build Kongsfjord Telemetry Station. The airport first hosted service to temporary landing strips near Longyearbyen, but from 1975 served Svalbard Airport. Lufttransport started flights with helicopters in the 1980s, but from 1989 has flown with fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Bores {{are present}} on about 130 {{days in the}} year, {{concentrated}} on the days immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on {{such things as the}} time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, the amount of water coming down the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alternative route, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{was mostly}} done by volunteers; the {{building}} of the stadium required 31,000 man-hours in volunteer work and cost NOK 150,000. After the land was cleared, a layer of mixed sand and earth were laid. The pitch, with the dimensions , was sown in mid-1950. The work also included a grandstand, changing rooms, a watering system and kiosks. The stand could accommodate 2,500 spectators, and the stadium had a total permitted capacity of 6,000 people. The inaugural match was played against Sarpsborg on 7 July 1951 in front of 3,500 spectators. A training pitch beside the stadium pitch opened in 1953. The following year, a new steel entrance was built, following in 1955 with a referees' changing room and administrative offices. In 1959, after eight years of planning, <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> additional terrace started, which opened in 1960.|$|E
50|$|Nineteenth-century Corvallis saw {{a three-year}} boom {{beginning}} in 1889, {{which began with}} the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> privately owned electrical plant by L.L.

30|$|Key to the {{distinction}} between the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF and the GMSF, children’s simultaneous coordination of units was documented as a developmental prerequisite for the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> GMSF; however, simultaneous coordination of units was not found to be a developmental prerequisite for the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF. Although the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF was found to be positively related with the simultaneous coordination of three levels of units, several students were documented to have constructed a MSPF without simultaneously coordinating three levels of units. However, no students were found to have constructed a GMSF without first being able to simultaneously coordinate three levels of units. This finding is consistent with the proposed learning progression, in that some children who are only able to coordinate a three-level structure sequentially as two two-level structures can still solve tasks like that presented in Fig.  4 (a task designed to indicate the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> MSPF). However, this sequential coordination of units is not sufficient for the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> GMSF, which is required for tasks like the one presented in Fig.  5.|$|R
5|$|Development around Sovereign Harbour Marina, Britain's largest {{composite}} marina, {{has created}} more than 3,000 new luxury homes {{over the past}} 10 years and future plans include the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> innovation mall for small businesses and start-ups. The Eastbourne business community is well connected and mutually supportive. The Chamber of Commerce is strong with around 600 members and holds many networking events to facilitate local B2B links. There are many business events for local entrepreneurs to promote their goods and services. Large revenues are generated through tourism and conference tourism with reports showing a £365 million revenue from visitors in 2010, 3.1% greater than 2009 and estimated to support 7,160 jobs. The council's blueprint for future development in the town centre maps out a strategy for further boosting these numbers by attracting even more residents, shoppers and visitors to the town.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{ordered the}} <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{artillery}} blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539–40 {{as part of}} a major scheme to fortify the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his break from the Pope and the Catholic Church, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, {{a member}} of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. {{strategic}} thinker, wrote a book titled The Influence of Sea Power upon History in which he argued {{for the creation of a}} large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy.

5|$|In 1931, the Government of Canada {{enacted the}} Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which {{provided}} {{public works projects}} in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included {{construction of a new}} registration facility at Banff's east gate and <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper.
