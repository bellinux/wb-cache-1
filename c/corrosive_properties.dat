Due to the <b>corrosive</b> <b>properties</b> of quick lime, the product of the kiln, it was essential that kilns should be situated as closely as possible to the agricultural fields on which it was to be spread. Should the quick lime become wet during transport by the farmer to his farm, it would corrode its container and damage the wagon or pack-animal on which it was being transported. [...] Culm, a form of imperfect anthracite, was mined in Devon at Tavistock and Chittlehampton as well as being imported from South Wales via Bideford. The limestone largely came from Caldey Island off the South Wales coast, although Devon had quarries at Landkey, Swimbridge, Filleigh, South Molton and Combe Martin.|$|E

With proportionately greater carbon content, the hardness of SHCCI will first increase and then decrease, while the toughness and <b>corrosive</b> wear <b>properties</b> will decrease gradually SHCCI’s corrosive wear performance was significantly better than that of Cr 26 cast iron.

40|$|Bio-oil {{produced}} via {{fast pyrolysis}} of biomass {{has the potential}} to be processed in a FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) unit to generate liquid fuel. However, this oil requires a significant upgrade to become an acceptable feedstock for refinery plants due to its high oxygen content. One promising route to improve the quality of bio-oil is to pyrolyse the parent biomass in the presence of a catalyst. This work investigates the influence of faujasite catalysts on the pyrolysis of pinewood. Pyrolysis process with Na-faujasite, Na 0. 2 H 0. 8 -faujasite, and H-faujasite (Na-FAU, Na 0. 2 H 0. 8 -FAU, and H-FAU) were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at 500 °C. It is shown that, in the same condition, catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapour is superior to in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of biomass when it comes to quality of bio-oil. The yields of coke, gas and water increase while that of organic phase decreases proportional with the concentration of protons in catalysts. Compared to the other two catalysts, Na 0. 2 H 0. 8 -FAU removes the most oxygen from bio-oil, reduces amount of acids and aldehydes/ketones which result in a higher energy-contained and more stable oil with less <b>corrosive</b> <b>property.</b> However, the biggest contribution to the oxygen removal is via the formation of reaction water, which is not an optimum path.

The amount {{of carbon dioxide and}} hydrogen sulfide in the biogas directly affects its energy content and <b>corrosive</b> <b>property.</b> Many processes were used to remove these gases from the biogas stream. The current research aimed to isolate a pure bacterial strain capable of simultaneous removal both gases, and apply it in the biotrickling filter designed for carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide removal. Pure isolate of bacteria capable of thiosulfate oxidation was isolated from an activated sludge seed, and was identified by 16 S rDNA method. The isolated microbe was closely related to Halothiobacillus neapolitanus (HTN), an obligately chemolithoautotrophic bacteria able to utilized carbon dioxide as a carbon source, and oxidize sulfide as a energy source. Optimum buffer concentration for thiosulfide oxidation activity was evaluated by varying phosphate buffer concentration in the range of 26 - 78 mM (pH 7. 3). The optimum buffer concentration for the growth and thiosufate oxidation was 52 mM. At this buffer concentration, HTN can remove thiosulfate up to 69. 8 % within 36 h, and maximum thiosulfate removal was 79. 1 % after 120 h incubation at the initial concentration of 10 g/L thiosulfate. The sulfate production rate was 147. 7 ± 9. 76 mg/L·h.

The reaction of 1 with BTMA Br 3 in protic solvents such as methanol and acetic acid gave the corresponding dibromo adducts along with substantial amounts of solvent-incorporated products in a regioselective manner.

Lead exposure in children is through various pathways and the major concentrated sources are the soil and drinking water. Children are most susceptible to lead exposure is due to their growing/developing bodies which are very sensitive to lead. Lead poisoning in children is a preventable environmental disease affecting many children around the world. This paper discusses how soil and water {{plays a major role in}} lead exposure to children’s routine life. The adverse effects of lead poisoning range widely from delayed to severe health outcomes. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the blood lead levels should be no higher than 5 µg/dl, which is considered as the new reference value. The epidemiological studies in the article details some statistical evidence that how children are affected by lead exposure through soil and water. Animal behavioral studies are mentioned in order to compare the toxic levels to humans. Even though there has been decline in the blood lead levels in children from 1970 ’s, very small amounts of blood lead can also result in various health outcomes. These blood lead levels in children are due to the lead based paints in old houses and the service lines made by lead and lead solder. Due to some regulatory interventions by the state and federal agencies the developed countries have reduced the lead exposure to an extent, but the developing countries are still at greatest concern in childhood lead poisoning...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the largest}} {{potential}} threats of ocean acidification to marine invertebrates is the <b>corrosive</b> <b>properties</b> of undersaturated waters with respect to calcium carbonate skeletons/shells, and a theoretical inability to calcify under these conditions. Ocean acidification is a lowered pH of ocean waters caused by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, which results in more CO2 dissolving into the ocean. This {{poses a threat to}} corals and calcifying macroalgae, two main calcifying groups that occur in reefs, as well as other shelled organisms and the organisms that depend on them. Corals and calcifying macroalgae such as coralline red algae and calcifying green algae are extremely sensitive to ocean acidification because they build their hard structures out of calcium carbonate. The sinking pH of ocean waters makes it difficult for these shelled creatures to produce enough calcium carbonate to build and maintain their skeletal structures. Echinoderms, such as sea stars and sea urchins, and mollusks, including squid and clams, as well as many other species are also at risk because of thinning shells and weakened skeletal structures. By targeting calcifying organisms, ocean acidification threatens the health of reef ecosystems as a whole.|$|E
