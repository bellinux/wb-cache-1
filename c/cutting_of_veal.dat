Consumers, however, may reject pale cuts <b>of</b> <b>veal</b> labeled as “grain-fed. ” This article uses questionnaire data from six groceries in the province of Quebec, Canada, to investigate frequency <b>of</b> <b>veal</b> purchases and perceived importance of price, color, and production type as determinants <b>of</b> <b>veal</b> purchases. Consumers do not appear to have clear preferences for milk-fed <b>veal</b> characteristics. Frequency <b>of</b> consumption and importance <b>of</b> <b>veal</b> meat attributes were influenced more by variables of habit formation than by price, income, or education. The veal industry might be advised to encourage consumption <b>of</b> <b>veal</b> as a means to diversify consumers' meat menu.
