25|$|Cordwood {{construction}} {{can save}} significant space and was often used with wire-ended components in applications where space {{was at a}} premium (such as fuzes, missile guidance, and telemetry systems) and in high-speed computers, where short traces were important. In cordwood construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The components were either soldered together with jumper wire, or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the <b>component</b> <b>leads.</b> To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed <b>component</b> <b>leads</b> to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that special nickel-leaded components had {{to be used to}} allow the interconnecting welds to be made. Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause physical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are difficult to replace. Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components.|$|E

The sub-nanosecond MOV response claim {{is based on the}} material's intrinsic {{response time}}, but will be slowed down by other factors such as the inductance of <b>component</b> <b>leads</b> and the mounting method. That response time is also qualified as insignificant when compared to a transient having an 8µs rise-time, thereby allowing ample time for the device to slowly turn-on. When subjected to a very fast, <1 ns rise-time transient, response times for the MOV are in the 40–60nbsp&ns range.|$|E

25|$|Originally, every {{electronic}} component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The components' leads were then {{passed through the}} holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which <b>component</b> <b>leads</b> were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 {{was assigned to the}} U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.|$|E

In through-hole technology, the <b>component</b> <b>leads</b> are inserted in holes surrounded by conductive pads; the holes keep the components in place. In surface-mount technology (SMT), the component {{is placed on the}} PCB so that the pins line up with the conductive pads or lands on the surfaces of the PCB; solder paste, which was previously applied to the pads, holds the components in place; if surface-mount components are applied to both sides of the board, the bottom-side components are glued to the board. In both through hole and surface mount, the components are then soldered.|$|E

A discussion of every disease caused by modification of the various apoptotic pathways would be impractical, but the concept overlying each one is the same: The normal functioning of the pathway has been disrupted {{in such a way as}} to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis. This results in a cell that lives past its [...] "use-by-date" [...] and is able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to its progeny, increasing the likelihood of the cell's becoming cancerous or diseased.|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature of}} {{circular}} polarization {{and its relationship}} to other polarizations is often understood by thinking of the electric field as being divided into two components which are at right angles to each other. Refer to the second illustration on the right. The vertical component and its corresponding plane are illustrated in blue while the horizontal component and its corresponding plane are illustrated in green. Notice that the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) horizontal <b>component</b> <b>leads</b> the vertical component by one quarter of a wavelength. It is this quadrature phase relationship which creates the helix and causes the points of maximum magnitude of the vertical component to correspond with the points of zero magnitude of the horizontal component, and vice versa.
