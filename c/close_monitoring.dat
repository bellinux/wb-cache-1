5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to <b>close</b> <b>monitoring</b> that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, <b>close</b> <b>monitoring</b> of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E

5|$|Stacy Warner is {{a fictional}} {{recurring}} character portrayed by Sela Ward on the Fox Broadcasting Company's medical drama House. She {{was in a}} relationship with Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), when a clotted aneurysm in his right thigh led to an infarction during a game of golf, causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. Regarding House's treatment, Stacy acted against House's wishes when he was put into a chemically induced coma. She authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure by removing just the dead muscle, leaving House with a lesser, but serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive her and they broke up. The two meet again, five years later, at the end of season one; Stacy wants House to treat her husband, Mark. House correctly diagnoses Mark with acute intermittent porphyria, and so he has to remain at the hospital for <b>close</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Stacy becomes the hospital's lawyer, and she and House grow closer together. When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him, House tells her to go back to Mark, which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city.|$|E
5|$|Women with anti-TPO {{antibodies}} who {{are trying}} to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, <b>close</b> <b>monitoring</b> of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, {{in the sense that the}} TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases.|$|E

25|$|For the ovarian {{hyperstimulation}} in itself, injectable gonadotropins (usually FSH analogues) {{are generally}} used under <b>close</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Such monitoring frequently checks the estradiol level and, {{by means of}} gynecologic ultrasonography, follicular growth.

25|$|Transfusions {{with large}} amounts of red blood cells, whether due to severe hemorrhaging and/or {{transfusion}} inefficacy (see above), can lead to an inclination for bleeding. The mechanism {{is thought to be}} due to disseminated intravascular coagulation, along with dilution of recipient platelets and coagulation factors. <b>Close</b> <b>monitoring</b> and transfusions with platelets and plasma is indicated when necessary.|$|E
25|$|Patients with decompensated {{cirrhosis}} generally require {{admission to}} a hospital, with <b>close</b> <b>monitoring</b> of the fluid balance, mental status, and emphasis on adequate nutrition and medical treatment – often with diuretics, antibiotics, laxatives or enemas, thiamine and occasionally steroids, acetylcysteine and pentoxifylline. Administration of saline is avoided, {{as it would}} add to the already high total body sodium content that typically occurs in cirrhosis.|$|E
30|$|At present, E-FAST is used {{widely in}} {{emergency}} unit to aid diagnosis and management in acute emergency and trauma.

30|$|Conclusion: Diaphragmatic {{paralysis}} {{is a rare}} but serious {{complication of}} cardiac surgery in children. It commonly occurs after open-heart surgery, and specifically after arterial switch operation. Plicatured patients were younger than non-plicatured patients and needed more frequently a ventilatory support. A <b>closer</b> <b>monitoring</b> may be required for young patients and mechanically ventilated patients. Indeed, both {{are more likely to}} be treated by a diaphragmatic plication, reducing mechanical ventilation and intensive care duration.|$|R
25|$|The {{concurrent}} use of opioids with other depressant {{drugs such as}} benzodiazepines or ethanol increases the rates of adverse events and overdose. As with an overdose of opioid alone, the combination of an opioid and another depressant may precipitate respiratory depression often leading to death. These risks are lessened with <b>close</b> <b>monitoring</b> by a physician, who may conduct ongoing screening for changes in patient behavior and treatment compliance.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} risk of {{recurrence}} and ensuing problems, <b>close</b> <b>monitoring</b> of dogs undergoing chemotherapy is important. The {{same is true for}} dogs that have entered remission and ceased treatment. Monitoring for disease and remission/recurrence is usually performed by palpation of peripheral lymph nodes. This procedure detects gross changes in peripheral lymph nodes. Some of the blood tests used in diagnosing lymphoma also offer greater objectivity and provide an earlier warning of an animal coming out of remission.|$|E
25|$|Posterior {{urethral}} valve (PUV) {{disorder is}} an obstructive developmental anomaly in the urethra and genitourinary system of male newborns. A posterior urethral valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra {{as a result}} of abnormal in utero development. It is {{the most common cause of}} bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. The disorder varies in degree, with mild cases followed conservatively. More severe cases can have renal and respiratory failure from lung underdevelopment as result of low amniotic fluid volumes, requiring intensive care and <b>close</b> <b>monitoring.</b> It occurs in about one in 8000 babies.|$|E

SSRIs are efficacious in the {{treatment of}} OCD; patients treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo. Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term treatment trials of 6 to 24 weeks and in discontinuation trials of 28 to 52 weeks duration.|$|E
25|$|The falls {{are used}} for {{canyoning}} by an Auckland Regional Parks licensed operator. The issuing of the licence was a 'hot issue' at the 2002 AGM of the Piha Ratepayers and Residents Association where residents voiced concern over the environmental impact to the Kitekite Falls. However, ARC recreation coordinator Lee Whiley {{said there were no}} concerns. This recreational activity continues to this day under <b>close</b> <b>monitoring</b> by council. Climbing on the falls (going off track) is strictly prohibited and can only be done with a permit or licensed guide.

Abusive relations have been associated with malnutrition among both mothers and children. In India, for example, the withholding of food is a documented form of family abuse.|$|E
40|$|In {{environmental}} health studies air pollution measurements from the <b>closest</b> <b>monitor</b> {{are commonly used}} {{as a proxy for}} personal exposure. This technique assumes that air pollution concentrations are spatially homogeneous in the neighborhoods associated with the monitors and consequently introduces measurement error into a model. To model the relationship between maternal exposure to air pollution and birth weight we build a hierarchical model that accounts for the associated measurement error. We allow four possible scenarios, with increasing flexibility, for capturing this uncertainty. In the two simplest cases, we specify one model with a constant variance term and another with a variance component that allows the uncertainty in the exposure measurements to increase as the distance between maternal residence and the location of the <b>closest</b> <b>monitor</b> increases. In the remaining two models we introduce spatial dependence in these errors using spatial processes in the form of random effects models. We detail the specification for the exposure measure to reflect the sparsity of monitoring sites and discuss the issue of quantifying exposure {{over the course of a}} pregnancy. The model is illustrated using Bayesian hierarchical modeling techniques and data from the USEPA and the North Carolina Detailed Birth Records. Dissertatio...|$|R

25|$|Hyperkalemia (high {{concentration}} of potassium in the blood) is another possible complication of treatment with an ACE inhibitor {{due to its}} effect on aldosterone. Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in aldosterone levels. Since aldosterone is responsible for increasing the excretion of potassium, ACE inhibitors can cause retention of potassium. Some people, however, can continue to lose potassium while on an ACE inhibitor. Hyperkalemia may decrease the velocity of impulse conduction in the nerves and muscles, including cardiac tissues. This leads to cardiac dysfunction and neuromuscular consequences, such as muscle weakness, paresthesia, nausea, diarrhea, and others. <b>Close</b> <b>monitoring</b> of potassium levels is required in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors {{who are at risk}} of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Pegylated {{interferon}} (PEG IFN) is dosed {{just once}} a week as a subcutaneous injection and is both more convenient and effective than standard interferon. Although it does not develop resistance as do many of the oral antivirals, it is poorly tolerated and requires <b>close</b> <b>monitoring.</b> PEG IFN is estimated to cost about $18,000 {{per year in the}} United States, compared to $2,500-8,700 for the oral medications; however, its treatment duration is 48 weeks as opposed to the oral antivirals, which require indefinite treatment for most patients (minimum 1 year). PEG IFN is not effective in patients with high levels of viral activity and cannot be used in immunosuppressed patients or those with cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|George Schaller {{began his}} 20-month {{observation}} of the mountain gorillas in 1959, subsequently publishing two books: The Mountain Gorilla and The Year of the Gorilla. Little was known {{about the life of}} the mountain gorilla before his research, which described its social organization, life history, and ecology. Following Schaller, Dian Fossey began what would become an 18-year study in 1967. Fossey made new observations, completed the first accurate census, and established active conservation practices, such as anti-poaching patrols. The Digit Fund, which Dian Fossey started, continued her work and was later renamed the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. The Fund's Karisoke Research Center monitors and protects the mountain gorillas of the Virungas. <b>Close</b> <b>monitoring</b> and research of the Bwindi mountain gorillas began in the 1990s.|$|E
