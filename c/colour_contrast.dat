5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including <b>colour,</b> <b>contrast</b> and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements of pattern design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither {{of which could be}} saved by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent paints absorb higher {{frequency}} light {{to which the}} human eye is relatively insensitive and emit lower frequencies, which are more easily detected. The emitted light and the reflected light combine and may be considerably more visible than the original light. The most visible frequencies are also those most rapidly attenuated in water, so the effect is for greatly increased <b>colour</b> <b>contrast</b> over short range, until the longer wavelengths are attenuated by the water.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the lack}} of <b>colour</b> <b>contrast</b> in the {{monochromatic}} aizuri-e, late Edo artists began to experiment with techniques to increase image complexity. This {{led to the development}} of bokashi, a printing technique which allowed for the reproduction and mixing of differing colour tones within a single image. This is achieved through carefully graded applications of water and pigment mixtures to the woodblock with a hake brush. The result is a single-coloured print characterised by shading and tonality. It was practiced most effectively in the rendering of skies and water. While aizuri-e themselves were inexpensive to print, bokashi was costly. It is therefore generally seen in formal prints, and not regularly seen in cheaper media such as uchiwa-e. Kunisada has, however, used the technique on this fan print, most notably in the cloud and ground regions, where the value of the blue pigment deepens from very pale blue to near-black opacity.|$|E
40|$|There {{are lots}} of surimposed informations on risk maps. Thus, risk data are {{difficult}} to portray. Colour is generally used thanks to its selective, symbolic and aesthetic qualities. We believe that a best use of colour to risk maps could clarify their legibility. Therefore, we propose a model to automatically improve <b>colour</b> <b>contrasts.</b> Our model is based on Itten <b>colour</b> <b>contrasts</b> theory, a German painter of the Bauhaus of the twentieth century. In our model, each graphic sign analyses <b>colour</b> <b>contrasts</b> with its neighbours. Then, this analysis is validated at a more global level. If systematisms are detected, another graphic solution is proposed. We repeat the process until we obtain a more legible map...|$|R

40|$|Many orb-weaving spiders in {{the tropics}} forage in open sites {{during the day and}} some of them have both bright and dark colourations. The {{conspicuous}} UV-reflective colour markings of these spiders have been reported to be attractive to visually oriented prey and thus could increase the spiders' foraging success. Using a combination of field and laboratory studies, we examine whether or not the body colouration of orb-weaving spiders exhibits optical properties that are attractive to insect prey from the viewpoint of insect visual physiology. We compared the prey interception rates and <b>colour</b> <b>contrasts</b> of the typical and melanic morphs of the giant wood spider, Nephila pilipes. Results of the field study showed that the typical morph caught significantly more insects than the melanic morph. <b>Colour</b> <b>contrasts</b> calculated from spectral reflectances of the background and body surface of spiders showed that the brightly coloured body parts of the typical morph exhibited rather high values, but those of the dark body parts were below the discrimination threshold. The differential <b>colour</b> <b>contrasts</b> of body parts generated a visual signal unlike that of a spider but rather like certain forms of food resources. On the other hand, the melanic morphs did not have bright colouration and the <b>colour</b> <b>contrasts</b> of every part of the body were significantly higher than the threshold, making the contour of spiders quite clear to bees...|$|R
