It is recognized that universities and colleges in Japan are required to have professional staff with the necessary expertise or skills in educational and learning support in order to pursue higher quality education and learning outcomes. The problem we have faced is that the <b>core</b> <b>competency</b> of such staff is not always clear. This roundtable was therefore organized to discuss the draft <b>core</b> <b>competency</b> composed {{on the basis of}} the surveys and research conducted by Chiba University’s Academic Link Center. After the presentation of the draft proposal and reaction reports from two prominent university staff members, a workshop with participants from various universities was conducted to exchange ideas or opinions on the draft <b>core</b> <b>competency...</b>|$|R

25|$|The MR5 {{advisory}} committee {{was appointed by}} AAMC in fall 2008. Highlights of the MR5 process were surveys of what undergraduate institutions teach and surveys of medical school faculty in which they ranked undergraduate subjects for importance in medical school curricula of the future. Late in 2011, the MR5 recommendations were formalized as <b>core</b> <b>competencies</b> that will be tested in 2015. MR5 recommendations were enacted by the AAMC in 2012. The largest changes consist of testing in biochemistry, multicultural/behavioral concepts, and critical analysis/reasoning from the humanities. Because college freshmen, entering in fall 2012, took a new MCAT, undergraduate premedical advisers studied the MR5 documents to translate tested <b>core</b> <b>competencies</b> into premedical course recommendations at their campuses. The MR5 MCAT revision {{has the potential to}} lead to changes in mathematics, physics, psychology, sociology, and general education recommendations in addition to changes in biology, chemistry and biochemistry. One scientific society to comment on the new MCAT and its implications for the undergraduate curriculum is the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Though ASBMB noted that the premedical curriculum in mathematics, physics, social sciences and the humanities is likely to change, the society confined its recommendations to coursework in biology, chemistry and biochemistry.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{school of thought}} on Honda's {{strategy}} was put forward by Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad in 1989. Creating the concept of <b>core</b> <b>competencies</b> with Honda as an example, they argued that Honda's success was due to its focus on leadership in the technology of internal combustion engines. For example, the high power-to-weight ratio engines Honda produced for its racing bikes provided technology and expertise which was transferable into mopeds. Honda's entry into the U.S. motorcycle market during the 1960s {{is used as a}} case study for teaching introductory strategy at business schools worldwide.|$|E

The development of technical and commercial expertise in all stages of this vertical integration, from the initial search for oil (exploration) through its harvesting (production), transportation, refining and finally trading and marketing established the <b>core</b> <b>competencies</b> on which the company was founded. Similar competencies were required for natural gas, which {{has become one of}} the most important businesses in which Shell is involved, and which contributes a significant proportion of the company's profits. While the vertically integrated business model provided significant economies of scale and barriers to entry, each business now seeks to be a self-supporting unit without subsidies from other parts of the company.|$|E
40|$|The <b>core</b> <b>competency</b> of an {{organization}} is a unique signature composed of {{tangible and intangible assets}} that are used to differentiate a company from its competitors. As organization has moved into the global marketplace, many have attempted to simply extend their domestic <b>core</b> <b>competency</b> to compete with global competitors. The cultural imprint of the <b>core</b> <b>competency</b> is a western, United States orientation. To effectively differentiate U. S. M. N. Cs in the global competitive arena, these organizations must become more multicultural. One means of accomplishing this diversity of strategic perspective is to inpatriate foreign managers into the domestic management team to a permanent basis. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to outline the need for inpatriation while presenting the issues which will arise in the inpatriation process. A step-by-step process to accomplish inpatriation is also presented. While this process is not free of difficulties, It may be a cost-effective way of globalizing the <b>core</b> <b>competency</b> of {{an organization}} in a permanent way. ...|$|R

2500|$|Like for {{business}} companies in general, for media enterprises their core assets and <b>core</b> <b>competencies</b> are decisive {{for the long-term}} success. <b>Core</b> <b>competencies</b> considerably contribute to the perceived customer benefit of a product and ensure the competitive advantage of an enterprise. Competencies which are crucial to successful media management can be classified as technical skills, human skills, conceptual skills, financial skills and marketing skills. <b>Core</b> <b>competencies</b> of media enterprises are, for example, an exceptional editorial ability or cross-media marketing competence.

Further, <b>core</b> <b>competency</b> is difficult to duplicate, as it involves the skills and coordination of people {{across a variety of}} functional areas or processes used to deliver value to customers. By outsourcing, companies expanded the concept of the value chain, with some elements within the entity and others without. <b>Core</b> <b>competency</b> is part of a branch of strategy called the resource-based view of the firm, which postulates that if activities are strategic as indicated by the value chain, then the organization's capabilities and ability to learn or adapt are also strategic.|$|R
