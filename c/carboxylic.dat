5|$|A {{variety of}} peptide {{coupling}} reagents {{can also be}} used to prepare Weinreb–Nahm amides from <b>carboxylic</b> acids. Various carbodiimide-, hydroxybenzotriazole-, and triphenylphosphine-based couplings have been reported specifically for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation, and imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide bond formation, and decarboxylation for the <b>carboxylic</b> acid group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into organic compounds {{in the form}} of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases to move the amino group to another alpha-keto <b>carboxylic</b> acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.|$|E
5|$|Other {{metabolites}} {{isolated from}} different species include dibenzonaphtyridinone alkaloids, prenylated phenols, benzofurans, chromenes, natural rubber (polyisoprene), sterols, and the sugar alcohol volemitol. Among toxic substances, Lactarius turpis contains the mutagenic alkaloid necatorin, {{and the small}} compound cycloprop-2-ene <b>carboxylic</b> acid {{has been identified as}} the toxic agent in Russula subnigricans. Some secondary metabolites showed antibiotic properties in laboratory tests. An ethanolic extract of Russula delica was antibacterial, and a lectin from Russula rosea showed antitumor activity.|$|E
5|$|The acetyl group, {{formally}} {{derived from}} acetic acid, {{is fundamental to}} all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it {{is central to the}} metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. Unlike longer-chain <b>carboxylic</b> acids (the fatty acids), acetic acid does not occur in natural triglycerides. However, the artificial triglyceride triacetin (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.|$|E
5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of <b>carboxylic</b> acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic <b>carboxylic</b> acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via amino acid transporters, since the amine and <b>carboxylic</b> acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, {{occurring in the}} liver and kidneys, often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often {{the same as those}} used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and <b>carboxylic</b> acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid {{molecule}} can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the <b>carboxylic</b> acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a <b>carboxylic</b> acid. Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydroxyl}} group on <b>carboxylic</b> acids may {{be replaced with}} a chlorine atom using thionyl chloride to give acyl chlorides. In nature, <b>carboxylic</b> acids are converted to thioesters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboxylic</b> acids also {{react with}} {{alcohols}} to give esters. This process is widely used, e.g. {{in the production}} of polyesters. Likewise, <b>carboxylic</b> acids are converted into amides, but this conversion typically does not occur by direct reaction of the <b>carboxylic</b> acid and the amine. Instead esters are typical precursors to amides. The conversion of amino acids into peptides is a major biochemical process that requires ATP.|$|E
25|$|Salts and esters of <b>{{carboxyl}}ic</b> acids {{are called}} carboxylates. When a carboxyl group is deprotonated, its conjugate base forms a carboxylate anion. Carboxylate ions are resonance-stabilized, and this increased stability makes <b>carboxylic</b> acids more acidic than alcohols. <b>Carboxylic</b> acids {{can be seen}} as reduced or alkylated forms of the Lewis acid carbon dioxide; under some circumstances they can be decarboxylated to yield carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|The direct {{oxidation}} {{of primary}} alcohols to <b>carboxylic</b> acids normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an aldehyde hydrate (R-CH(OH)2) by reaction with water {{before it can}} be further oxidized to the <b>carboxylic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboxylic</b> acids {{often have}} strong odors, {{especially}} the volatile derivatives. Most common are acetic acid (vinegar) and butyric acid (human vomit). Conversely esters of <b>carboxylic</b> acids {{tend to have}} pleasant odors and many are used in perfume.|$|E
25|$|Acyl {{chlorides}} {{can be used}} {{to prepare}} <b>carboxylic</b> acid derivatives, including acid anhydrides, esters, and amides by reacting acid chlorides with: a salt of a <b>carboxylic</b> acid, an alcohol, or an amine respectively. The use of a base, e.g. aqueous sodium hydroxide or pyridine, or excess amine (when preparing amides) is desirable to remove the hydrogen chloride byproduct, and to catalyze the reaction. While it is often possible to obtain esters or amides from the <b>carboxylic</b> acid with alcohols or amines, the reactions are reversible, often leading to low yields. In contrast, both reactions involved in preparing esters and amides via acyl chlorides (acyl chloride formation from <b>carboxylic</b> acid, followed by coupling with the alcohol or amine) are fast and irreversible. This makes the two-step route often preferable to the single step reaction with the <b>carboxylic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|The Schmidt {{reaction}} converts <b>carboxylic</b> acids to amines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboxylic</b> acids are decarboxylated in the Hunsdiecker reaction.|$|E
25|$|Classically, it {{converts}} <b>carboxylic</b> acids to acyl chlorides.|$|E
25|$|In ketonic {{decarboxylation}} <b>carboxylic</b> acids are {{converted to}} ketones.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} reaction, PBr3 also {{converts}} <b>carboxylic</b> acids to acyl bromides.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboxylic</b> acids {{are used}} in the {{production}} of polymers, pharmaceuticals, solvents, and food additives. Industrially important <b>carboxylic</b> acids include acetic acid (component of vinegar, precursor to solvents and coatings), acrylic and methacrylic acids (precursors to polymers, adhesives), adipic acid (polymers), citric acid (beverages), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (chelating agent), fatty acids (coatings), maleic acid (polymers), propionic acid (food preservative), terephthalic acid (polymers).|$|E
25|$|All the {{reactions}} mentioned for <b>carboxylic</b> acids are also possible for benzoic acid.|$|E
25|$|Formic acid {{is unique}} among the <b>carboxylic</b> acids {{in its ability}} to {{participate}} in addition reactions with alkenes. Formic acids and alkenes readily react to form formate esters. In the presence of certain acids, including sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids, however, a variant of the Koch reaction occurs instead, and formic acid adds to the alkene to produce a larger <b>carboxylic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|The iminium {{intermediate}} {{reacts with}} the <b>carboxylic</b> acid, abstracting an oxide, and regenerating the DMF catalyst.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboxylic</b> acids are {{organic acids}} that contain an acidic {{hydroxyl}} group and a carbonyl (C=O bond). <b>Carboxylic</b> acids {{can be reduced}} to the corresponding alcohol; the replacement of an electronegative oxygen atom with two electropositive hydrogens yields a product which is essentially non-acidic. The reduction of acetic acid to ethanol using LiAlH4 (lithium aluminium hydride or LAH) and ether is an example of such a reaction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboxylic</b> acids tend to {{have higher}} boiling points than water, {{not only because of}} their {{increased}} surface area, but also because of their tendency to form stabilised dimers. <b>Carboxylic</b> acids tend to evaporate or boil as these dimers. For boiling to occur, either the dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporised, both of which increase the enthalpy of vaporization requirements significantly.|$|E
25|$|Complexes with polyamino <b>carboxylic</b> acids find a {{wide range}} of applications. EDTA in {{particular}} is used extensively.|$|E
25|$|The {{oxidation}} product is a salt of a <b>carboxylic</b> acid and the reduction product is an alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Alcohols can be {{oxidised}} to give aldehydes, ketones or <b>carboxylic</b> acids, or {{they can}} be dehydrated to alkenes. They can react with <b>carboxylic</b> acids to form ester compounds, and they can (if activated first) undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions. The lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen of the hydroxyl group also makes alcohols nucleophiles. For more details, see the reactions of alcohols section below.|$|E
25|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{synthesis}} of haloalkanes from <b>carboxylic</b> acids are the Hunsdiecker reaction and the Kochi reaction.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{industrial}} {{routes to}} <b>carboxylic</b> acids {{differ from those}} used on smaller scale because they require specialized equipment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboxylic</b> acids are Brønsted–Lowry acids {{because they}} are proton (H+) donors. They {{are the most common}} type of organic acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carboxylic</b> acids {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by the hydrolysis of nitriles, esters, or amides, in general with acid- or base-catalysis.|$|E
25|$|Catalysis of {{protection}} groups Nafion-H increases reaction rates {{of protection}} via dihydropyran or o-trialkylsilation of alcohols, phenol, and <b>carboxylic</b> acids.|$|E
