5000|$|The {{industrial}} application of fluidized bed started long back. In 1923, Winkler's <b>coal</b> <b>gasifier</b> represented {{the first significant}} large-scale use of fluidized bed [...] (Kunii and Levenspiel, 1991). Nowadays, the world's largest CFB unit is operating since 2009 at Lagisza, Poland, 460 MW supercritical CFB, Foster and Wheeler. Even though the cheap liquid and gaseous fuels have decelerated the coal and solid fuels R&D.; many sectors increasingly use CFB viz. electricity generation and industrial sectors, because of the CFB's advantages. The 1970th cries reactivated the interest to the solid fuel and coal again. Moreover, the increasing concern of GHGs, cheap cost of coal and its abundant sources motivate again the researches of CFB (IEA-CIAB, 2013). The CCS was considered as an important technology to mitigate GHGs. To apply CCS, novel techniques viz. pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-combustion are raised. Subsequently, the R&D are undertaken for understanding the effects of new operation conditions like using gaseous mixture comparing with conventional units. This chapter is dedicated toward the detailed review of literature {{in the fields of}} CFB's hydrodynamic behaviour, oxy-fuel combustion and generations of oxy-fuel combustion. It also discusses the literature on lower or zero carbon energy sources (biofuel). The special focus on the biofuel usage for CFB is to service lower or zero carbon energy technology.|$|E
