40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the use of <b>cash</b> <b>cards</b> in points of sale (POS), applying the theory of planned behavior. A field survey was conducted in Tehran, Iran. Data was collected and analyzed from 163 customers who have referred to chain stories {{in the area of}} Tehran. Findings indicate that the theory of planned behaviour is a suitable instrument to predict using <b>cash</b> <b>cards</b> by customers. In addition, multiple regression analysis revealed that attitude towards <b>cash</b> <b>cards,</b> subjective norms and perceived behavioural control have a positive and significant impact on intention to use <b>cash</b> <b>cards</b> by customers. Managers should consider various facets of customer decision-making process and try to enhance quality of provided payment services to satisfy customers...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} framework aimed to model the pricing of electronic money (electronic <b>cash</b> <b>cards)</b> and the market domain in which it will be used. We first calculate the fee structures of electronic cash- and charge-card industries for the monopoly and competitive cases. We show that the different market structures do not affect the domain of electronic <b>cash</b> <b>cards</b> and the displacement of currency in daily transactions. We provide a welfare analysis {{to determine whether a}} market equilibrium generates an underutilization or overutilization of the electronic <b>cash</b> <b>cards</b> relative to currency. Finally, we evaluate the threshold investment costs, both general and POS-specific, which would prevent the emergence of this industry. electronic money; smart cards; displacement of currency...|$|R
25|$|A {{credit card}} is {{different}} from a charge card, where it requires the balance to be repaid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card also differs from a <b>cash</b> <b>card,</b> {{which can be used}} like currency by the owner of the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.|$|E
25|$|Discount brands {{are often}} smaller, {{regional}} chains or independent stations, offering lower prices on gasoline. Most purchase wholesale commodity gasoline from independent suppliers {{or from the}} major petroleum companies. Lower-priced gas stations are also found at some supermarkets (Albertsons, Kroger, Ingles, Lowes Foods, Giant, Weis Markets, Safeway, Vons, Meijer, Loblaws/Real Canadian Superstore, and Giant Eagle), convenience stores (7-Eleven, Circle K, Cumberland Farms, Quick Chek, Road Ranger, Sheetz and Wawa), discount stores (Walmart, Canadian Tire) and warehouse clubs (Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's Wholesale Club). At some stations (such as Vons, Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club, or Sam's Club), consumers are required to hold a special membership card {{in order to be}} eligible for the discounted price, or pay only with the chain's <b>cash</b> <b>card,</b> debt card or a credit card issuer exclusive to that chain. In some areas, such as Oregon and New Jersey, this practice is illegal, and stations are required to sell to all at the same price. Some convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Circle K, have co-branded their stations with one of the premium brands. After the Gulf Oil company was sold to Chevron, northeastern retail units were sold off as a chain, with Cumberland Farms controlling the remaining Gulf Oil outlets in the United States.|$|E
