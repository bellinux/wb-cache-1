He contributed substantially towards the war effort during the Great War, and received a 9-gun salute in recognition of his services. His early death in 1926 ushered in a ten-year regency for his son, Yeshwantrao Patangshah V. The latter assumed full ruling powers in 1938, having received perhaps the best education by any member of his family. He continued the good work achieved under the regency by expanding development activity, encouraging the <b>chemical,</b> <b>paper,</b> textile, dyeing, printing, liquor and starch industries.

50|$|The {{effects of}} {{droughts}} and water shortages {{can be divided}} into three groups: environmental, economic and social consequences. In the case of environmental effects: lower surface and subterranean water levels, lower flow levels (with a decrease below the minimum leading to direct danger for amphibian life), increased pollution of surface water, the drying out of wetlands, more and larger fires, higher deflation intensity, losing biodiversity, worse health of trees and the appearance of pests and den droid diseases. Economic losses include lower agricultural, forests, game and fishing output, higher food production costs, lower energy production levels in hydro plants, losses caused by depleted water tourism and transport revenue, problems with water supply for the energy sector and technological processes in metallurgy, mining, the <b>chemical,</b> <b>paper,</b> wood, foodstuff industries etc., disruption of water supplies for municipal economies. Meanwhile, social costs include the negative effect on the health of people directly exposed to this phenomenon (excessive heat waves), possible limitation of water supplies and its increased pollution levels, high food costs, stress caused by failed harvests, etc. This is why droughts and fresh water shortages may be considered as a factor which increases the gap between developed and developing countries.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to verify experimentally {{the possibility of using}} coal mine drainage and gypsum from the „stabilizate“ (the final product from the combustion desulphurisation) as the source of sulphate for the cultivation of SRB with the prospect of: purging of mine waste waters inclusive sulphates, recycling of desulphurisation agent (limestone) and production of elemental sulphur from hydrogen sulphide. The results confirmed the theoretical assumptions on the use of gypsum, which forms the substantial component of „stabilizate“, as the source of sulphate for sulphate-reducing bacteria, which produce hydrogen sulphide in the process of bacterial reduction of sulphates. They also showed the possibility of recycling the desulphurisation agent – limestone, as well as the realistic alternative of using „stabilizate “ in the production of elemental sulphur which still represents an important raw material needed in <b>chemical,</b> <b>paper</b> or other industries...|$|E

The types of models used are discussed, and a scheme for putting the models together to provide total process plant energy optimization is summarized. The types of optimization which can be implemented in a process plant is thus presented.
