Pyrrolidones are commercially important functional groups {{because of the}} high polarity and hence high hydrophilicity and surface affinity. An array of alkali metal ion complexes of a podand bearing two pendant pyrrolidone functionalities, namely 1 - 2 -[2 -(2 -oxo-pyrrolid- 1 -yl) -ethoxy]-ethyl-pyrrolid- 2 -one (1) are reported. Reaction of this ligand with sodium hexafluorophosphate gives two discrete species of formulae [Na(1) 2]PF 6 (3) and [Na 3 (H 2 O) 2 (μ- 1) 2](PF 6) 3 (4), and a coordination polymer [Na 3 (μ 3 - 1) 3 (μ 2 - 1) ](PF 6) 3 n (5). The same reaction in methanol gives a 1 : 1 complex, namely [Na 2 (μ- 1) 2 (MeOH) 2](PF 6) 2 (6). Use of tetraphenyl borate as a less <b>coordinating</b> <b>counter</b> ion gives [Na 2 (1) 2 (H 2 O) 4](BPh 4) 2 (7) and [Na 2 (1) 4](BPh 4) 2 (8).

40|$|The palladium-catalysed {{asymmetric}} allylic alkylation is a {{mild and}} versatile bond forming reaction between a nucleophile and allylic electrophile. The wide scope of nucleophiles used, {{and the high}} regio- and stereoselectivity obtainable renders this transformation an important technique in enantioselective synthesis. The mechanism is known to go via a key palladium π-allyl intermediate, followed by nucleophilic addition occurring at the terminal allylic carbon. Both {{the formation of the}} palladium π-allyl, and the nucleophilic addition to generate the alkylated product and palladium(0) proceed with high levels of inversion of stereochemistry, and both provide an opportunity for the induction of stereochemistry. However in the case of ligand controlled nucleophilic addition memory effects have been observed. The epimerisation of the palladium π-allyl before nucleophilic attack is key to achieving high levels of selectivity when racemic starting materials and chiral ligands are employed. Previous work in the Lloyd-Jones group has determined that prolonging the lifetime of the palladium π-allyl species, either by the use of weakly <b>coordinating</b> <b>counter</b> ions or slow addition of the nucleophile reduces this memory effect, however increasing the rate of epimerisation would have a result in a similar effect. One of the mechanisms resulting in the epimerisation of the palladium π-allyl species is mediated by palladium(0), however the details of the mechanism are not well understood. We describe the synthesis of a diastereotopic palladium cyclohexenyl ester and labelled the complex with 108 palladium and d 3 at the cyclohexenyl ester. Using simultaneous 31 P NMR and mass spectrometry, we have acquired strong evidence against mechanisms involving a single electron transfer, as proposed by Stille, of formation of a dinuclear palladium(I) species followed by an inversion event, and we have gained evidence supporting the direct nucleophilic addition of the palladium(0), resulting in inversion of stereochemistry. The differences in rates of nucleophilic attack involving monodentate and bidentate phosphine ligands on both the palladium I-cyclohexenyl ester have also been explored. Throughout the mechanistic investigation, it was noted that the 31 P NMR spectroscopy experiment used gave non-quantitative results, and in fact the differences in quantification of the species varied with the spectrometer used. We also describe our investigations into where these differences arise from and an optimum set of parameters for quantitative 31 P NMR spectroscopy. The conclusions are also applicable to other heternuclear NMR spectroscopic experiments...|$|R

Major General Williams distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the vicinity of Chu-Dong, Korea, on the morning of 15 July 1953.

The X-ray images {{are used to}} detect human body's invisible parts. The problem of blurring and uneven illumination is always faced. Although it is partially solved by the physicians via lighting the X-rays, this method is not working properly in some cases such as Vesico Ureteral Reflux disease. This may cause loss of some meaningful part of the information and failure in diagnosis process. In order to decrease such errors, some computational methods has been developed by means of image processing. Due to its very nature, reconstruction, retrieving and registration of x-ray images has been chosen as a subject of this study. We have begun attacking the problem of reconstruction and extraction, then started to generate multi-layer hierarchical solutions. We have tried so many different approaches for each layer in our experiments. In each experiment, some methods produced accurate results, some methods did not. Thus, we have exerted every effort to optimize the solution for each layer. Although we have worked with limited number of sample images,(due {{to the problem of}} retrieving x-rays which is seen in this case) the results show us that, all the samples that we have processed, could have been reconstructed and stored as we have expected. Storing of the huge amount of data is an another problem in our area of interest, because of image characteristics. Every kidney image consists of nearly 120. 000 (around 300 x 400) pixels. However, in our case, the boundaries of kidney region are sufficient for diagnosis. In other words, storing the boundaries instead of complete image has the same precision. We detected and stored the kidney's boundary coordinates on both x and y axis. Although this was sufficient for our study, we have decided to develop a much more flexible file format by ordering x and y <b>coordinate</b> couples in <b>counter</b> clockwise direction with the same information for further studies such as computer aided diagnosis systems...|$|R
