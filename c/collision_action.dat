40|$|Due to grave {{potential}} human, {{environmental and}} economical consequences of collisions at sea, collision avoidance {{has become an}} important safety concern in navigation. To {{reduce the risk of}} collisions at sea, appropriate <b>collision</b> avoidance <b>actions</b> need to be taken in accordance with the regulations, i. e., International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.

To better help navigators in collision avoidance, this paper develops a comprehensive collision avoidance decision making model for providing whether a <b>collision</b> avoidance <b>action</b> is required, when to take action and what action to be taken.

This paper presents decentralized collision avoidance algorithms for systems with second order dynamics and acceleration constraints, using a switching control law. The technique augments existing multi-agent control laws with the capability to switch to provably safe collision avoidance maneuvers when required. Two algorithms with low computational cost are presented, one for two vehicles and one for more vehicles. In both methods, each vehicle computes avoid sets with respect to every other vehicle. When one or more vehicles are on the boundary of their avoid sets, <b>collision</b> avoidance <b>action</b> is taken. These algorithms are applied in simulation scenarios for which existing techniques either fail or are computationally expensive, and used for information theoretic control of a mobile sensor network to reduce the computational complexity.

30|$|In {{the past}} few years the focus in {{automotive}} related ITS research has shifted towards automated driving and autonomous vehicles. The assumption is that by automating vehicles human errors, which are often the cause of accidents, can be eliminated and hence a future, in which no person dies in traffic accidents, could be realised. Autonomous driving is made possible through developments in Artificial Intelligence technology. This involves the collection of a wide amount of data, including all potential traffic environments and environmental conditions. A main issue with VRUs is their wide variety, e.g. pedestrians with strollers, cyclists. A huge effort will be needed to be able to detect reliably pedestrians in all potential traffic and environmental conditions. And the problem is even larger for identifying cyclists, as was reported by Fairley [11].

The between-subjects manipulation was the flight ascent dynamics. In one flight dynamic condition, the boundary of collision was defined by an invariant distance to arrival across the different forward speed conditions. In the other flight dynamics condition, the boundary was defined by an invariant time to arrival across forward speeds. Subject performance in the two groups indicated a sensitivity to the appropriate information defining the critical boundaries, although there was also a conservative distance bias and response variability that increased with forward speed.

40|$|By {{the year}} 2044 the {{population}} aged over sixty in Australia {{is predicted to}} double. The consequences of this increase include a greater cost to the community in road trauma. It is known that elderly drivers have the highest crash rates at intersections, {{are most likely to}} be at fault in a crash and have the highest mortality rate in accidents. The cost of crashes will therefore increase disproportionally to the increase in elderly drivers on the road. This research project identifies the likely ways that elderly drivers will cause increased road trauma, based on data from the Toowoomba area compared to that from the rest of Queensland. Toowoomba already has a higher than average proportion of elderly drivers on the road in Queensland, and so it provides an indicator of likely future trends for the rest of the state. The dissertation quantifies historical trends in intersection crash rates for elderly drivers in Toowoomba and shows how these trends compare to the rest of Queensland and a comparable overseas country (Canada). The causes of accidents in which elderly drivers feature are discussed and include issues such as physical frailty, skill levels and road hazards. The road hazards investigated include traffic control, intersection types, traffic flow, weather conditions, available lighting, pre <b>collision</b> <b>actions</b> and the affects of common driver behaviours. The project concludes that roundabouts are a major frustration for elderly drivers, and one of the most common features in crashes. Our senior drivers also feature prominently in crashes at unsignalised cross intersections. A major conclusion is that the State should attempt to make unsignalised road intersections friendlier for drivers over sixty, and that this could be done by reducing the number of decision points required when navigating the intersection. For heavily trafficked intersections the use of traffic signals remains the safest design feature for such drivers. It is also argued that there is a need for increased education for older drivers on the need to maintain driving skills and to adapt to their changing physical capabilities. These programs would best be delivered through workshops and seminars at retirement villages and supermarkets where elderly people tend to be concentrated. Modern communication technologies, based on internet delivery, are not likely to be widely used by the target audience...|$|R

The proposed tracking algorithm {{is based on a}} probabilistic generative model that incorporates observations of the point cloud and the physical properties of the tracked object and its environment.

Our modification makes it practical to perform the inference through calls to a physics simulation engine. This is significant because (i) it allows for the use of highly optimized physics simulation engines for the core computations of our tracking algorithm, and (ii) it makes it possible to naturally, and efficiently, account for physical constraints imposed by <b>collisions,</b> grasping <b>actions,</b> and material properties in the observation updates.

This {{control strategy}} is based on nullification of virtual forces applied to the end-effector by a hypothetical spring-plus-damper attached to the object's surface. In the proposed approach, the real-time arm control software continuously monitors the object distance measured by the arm-mounted proximity sensors. When this distance {{is less than a}} preset threshold, the <b>collision</b> avoidance control <b>action</b> is initiated to inhibit motion toward the object and thus prevent collision. This is accomplished by employing an outer feedback loop to perturb the end-effector nominal motion trajectory in real-time based on the sensory data. The perturbation is generated by a proportional-plus-integral (PI) collision avoidance controller acting on the difference between the sensed distance and the preset threshold. This approach is computationally very fast, requires minimal modification to the existing manipulator positioning system, and provides the manipulator with an on-line collision avoidance capability to react autonomously and intelligently.

Vessel collisions are {{a serious threat to}} the right whale and the program was among the first formal attempts to reduce this threat. Under the provisions of the MSR, all ships > 300 gross tons are required to report their location, speed, and destination to a shore-based station when entering two key right whale habitats: one in waters off New England and one off coastal Georgia and Florida. In return, reporting ships receive an automatically-generated message, delivered directly to the shipâ€™s bridge, that provides information about right whale vulnerability to vessel <b>collisions</b> and <b>actions</b> mariners can take to avoid collisions. The MSR has been in operation continuously from July 1999 to the present. Archived incoming reports provided a 15 -plus year history of ship operations in these two locations. We analyzed a total of 26, 772 incoming MSR messages logged between July 1999 and December 2013. Most ships that were required to report did so, and compliance rates were generally constant throughout the study period. Self-reported vessel speeds when entering the systems indicated that most ships travelled between 10 and 16 (range = 5 â€“ 20 +) knots. Ship speeds generally decreased in 2009 to 2013 following implementation of vessel speed restrictions. The number of reports into the southern system remained relatively constant following a steady increase through 2007, but numbers in the northern system decreased annually beginning in 2008. If reporting is indicative of long-term patterns in shipping operations, it reflects noteworthy changes in marine transportation. Observed declines in ship traffic are likely attributable to the 2008 â€“ 2009 economic recession, the containerized shipping industry making increased use of larger ships that made fewer trips, and diminished oil/gas US imports as previously inaccessible domestic deposits were exploited. Recent declines in shipping activity likely resulted in lowered collision risks for right whales and reduced their exposure to underwater noise from ships...|$|R
30|$|The {{results suggest}} that if PF-TX is not {{actively}} monitoring the traffic situation, then the conditional collision risk is high, and then the role of PF-TO, ATCo-R, and alerts in restricting the risk is rather limited. This {{can be explained by}} the condition considered in this experiment regarding the intent situation awareness of PF-TX. Here, PF-TX crosses the runway without contacting ATCo-R because he is not aware about the runway crossing. PF-TX can only detect a conflict in two cases: 1) when PF-TX observes that AC-TO is approaching AC-TX (Event E 3 in FigureÂ  10) or 2) when PF-TX timely receive an R/T call from ATCo-R (Event 8 in FigureÂ  10). This means that if PF-TX is not actively monitoring the traffic situation, the only way to detect a conflict is through an R/T call from ATCo-R (Event E 8). For PF-TX, this call often comes too late because AC-TX has already started crossing. A similar evaluation of the results for the PF-TO shows another picture. For PF-TO, the call from ATCo-R does restrict the collision risk considerably. This can be noticed by comparing cases C 5 and C 8. This is mainly because PF-TO has more time compared to PF-TX to start a <b>collision</b> avoidance braking <b>action,</b> as is manifest from the recorded aircraft positions. The comparison of both of these cases also shows that the call from ATCo-R was mainly triggered by the ATC alerting system.|$|R
