The degree of reproductive isolation of <b>cytotypes,</b> that is, the frequency of heteroploid crosses and subsequent formation of viable and (partly) fertile hybrids, plays a crucial role for the long-term integrity of lineages in contact zones. Here, we assessed fine-scale distribution, spatial clustering, and ecological niches as well as patterns of gene flow in parental and hybrid <b>cytotypes</b> in zones {{of immediate}} contact of di-, tetra-, and hexaploid Senecio carniolicus (Asteraceae) in the Eastern Alps. <b>Cytotypes</b> were spatially separated also at the investigated microscale; the strongest spatial separation was observed for the fully interfertile tetra- and hexaploids. The three main <b>cytotypes</b> showed highly significant niche differences, which were, however, weaker than across their entire distribution ranges in the Eastern Alps. Individuals with intermediate ploidy levels were found neither in the diploid/tetraploid nor in the diploid/hexaploid contact zones indicating strong reproductive barriers. In contrast, pentaploid individuals were frequent in the tetraploid/hexaploid contact zone, albeit limited to a narrow strip in the immediate contact zone of their parental <b>cytotypes.</b> AFLP fingerprinting data revealed introgressive gene flow mediated by pentaploid hybrids from tetra- to hexaploid individuals, but not vice versa.

Since this species occupies a great diversity of artificial and natural ecotopes, its eradication is extremely difficult. In order to assist control efforts, we used chromosome analyses and DNA amount as taxonomic markers to study genetic variability in populations of T. dimidiata from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Colombia. We differentiated three groups or cytotypes defined by characteristic chromosome C-banding patterns and genome size measured by flow cytometry. The three cytotypes are restricted to different geographic locations. <b>Cytotype</b> 1 occurs in Mexico (excluding Yucatan), Guatemala (excluding Peten), El Salvador and Colombia. <b>Cytotype</b> 2 occurs in Yucatan and <b>cytotype</b> 3 occurs in Peten. <b>Cytotype</b> 1, commonly associated with domestic and peridomestic environments but also inhabiting sylvatic ecotopes, is the most widespread and with major epidemiological significance.

Poor ability to colonize human dwellings, together with their restricted geographic distribution, indicate that the Yucatan and Peten putative species probably have much less epidemiological significance than <b>cytotype</b> 1.

Here, we study Jacobaea carniolica, which comprises diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid individuals regularly forming contact zones.

Irrespective of the direction of crosses, seed viability and seedling survival in diploid-polyploid crosses were substantially lower than in tetraploid-hexaploid crosses. In contrast, seedling growth traits indicated neither transgressive character expression nor any selection against hybrid offspring. Congruent with a model of genome dosage effects, these traits differed between reciprocal crosses, especially of diploids and tetraploids, where trait values resembled those of the maternal parent.
