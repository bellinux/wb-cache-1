40|$|Understanding host {{relationships}} between invasive species and their non-native hosts has important economic and ecological considerations. The red clover <b>casebearer</b> <b>moth</b> (RCCB), Coleophora deauratella Lieneg and Zeller (Lepidoptera: Coleophoridae), is an invasive {{red clover seed}} pest introduced to Canada in the 1960 ’s. RCCB larvae feed on developing seed from June to late August then overwinter in crop debris. RCCB can cause seed yield losses of ≥ 80 % in second-year seed stands of red clover. There are no registered pesticides for RCCB. Both larvae and adults {{have been reported in}} alsike clover fields but little damage is seen on these plants, and female moths display lower fecundity on alsike clover. The purpose of this research was to compare the larval abundance and development of RCCB on red clover (Trifolium pratense) and alsike clover (Trifolium hybridium). I also wanted to compare moth species diversity and larval abundance in red and alsike clover seed crop fields and volunteer clover patches. In addition, host quality was assessed by rearing field-collected larvae on laboratory-grown clover flower heads and observing growth and development. No larvae were recovered from alsike clover fields or volunteer alsike patches, while 338 larvae were recovered from red clover fields and volunteer patches. Larvae reared on alsike clover had a 30 % mortality rate during the rearing period, while larvae reared on red clover had a 5 % mortality rate. More weight was gained by larvae reared on red clover (mean weight gain= 0. 00438 grams, n= 19) compared to larvae reared on alsike clover (mean weight gain= 0. 00274 grams, n= 109, t = - 2. 9093, p= 0. 01407). This suggests that the difference in damage and fecundity may be due to lower host quality...|$|R
40|$|Three field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} white clover seed crops at Lincoln, Canterbury, to determine: (a) the incidence of pest and beneficial arthropods by suction sampling in three positions (edge, quarter and centre) into seven crops during the 1993 - 94 growing season (Survey Experiment). (b) the seed yield losses incurred by different intensities of potato mirid (PM, Calocoris norvegicus) released in 0. 81 m² field cages (Cage Experiment). (c) the economic impact and effects on arthropod numbers from the application of two recommended insecticides (flu valin ate and dichlorvos), applied at the traditional timing for clover <b>casebearer</b> <b>moth</b> (Coleophora spissicornis and C. frischella) control (Spray Experiment). Of the insect pests collected in the survey experiment, PM, blue-green lucerne aphid (BGLA, Acyrthosiphon kondoi), and brown shield bug (BSB, Dictyotus caenosus) were the most prevalent and most likely to cause economic injury to the developing flower heads and reductions in seed yields. PM nymphs and BGLA numbers peaked in mid-November (survey experiment), while BGLA numbers peaked in mid-January (spray experiment). BSB numbers occurred {{later in the season}} coinciding with the end of flowering and seed set in mid-January through to harvest (early February). In the cage experiment the level of PM injury was highest on the stolon's second flower head and resulted in seed yield losses equivalent in value to $ 348 / ha at the PM (equivalent to 14 18 PM/m²). In the spray experiment fluvalinate controlled insect pest numbers for a longer period compared to dichlorvos. BGLA numbers in the fluvalinate-treated plots were significantly lower for up to 30 days after treatment. Lower numbers of the predatory Tasmanian lacewing (Micromus tasmaniae) also occurred in these plots. Seed yield gains from the application of either insecticide were financially profitable...|$|R
40|$|Comprehensive {{wildlife}} conservation strategies must include {{consideration of the}} agricultural matrix and its integration into the greater landscape. Bats are postulated to provide critical pest suppression services, but the effects of agricultural intensification on insectivorous bats are not clear. Few studies have thoroughly investigated the ecosystem services provided by bats due, in part, to limited understanding of species-specific habitat use in agricultural landscapes, difficulties in prey identification, {{and the challenge of}} quantifying the impact of bats on pest populations and crops. My dissertation integrates these components to describe ecological relationships between the insects and bats associated with a pecan agroecosystem in central Texas. Specifically, I focus on the predator-prey relationship between bats and the pecan nut <b>casebearer</b> <b>moth</b> (PNC), a devastating pest of pecans. I begin with a literature review of the ecosystem services of insectivorous bats and the data necessary to thoroughly evaluate these services. I then assess the potential factors influencing species composition and spatio-temporal distributions of bats within the pecan agroecosystem. My results demonstrate higher activity and diversity of bats within the pecan agroecosystem than in the surrounding landscape likely due to roosting opportunities, but species-specific and seasonal differences exist in the effects of management intensity. Next, I investigate direct interactions between bats and PNC by measuring prey consumption patterns. I found that five species of bats prey upon PNC moths during all three critical population peaks prior to insecticide application, but there is variability in consumption among species. Finally, I assess indirect interactions between bats and pecans, by evaluating the effect of bat predation risk on pecan damage by PNC larvae. A negative relationship between foraging activity by bats and both PNC moths and PNC larval damage to pecans provides evidence that bat predation has quantitative downstream effects. My results highlight the conservation value of the agricultural matrix for bats and the complexities of accurately documenting ecosystem services provided by free-ranging mobile organisms...|$|R
