5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous air sacs under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones. The air sacs {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how air sacs are inflated. The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also <b>cushion</b> <b>the</b> impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to <b>cushion</b> <b>the</b> impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePlants {{affect the}} spatial {{distribution}} of soil microorganisms, but {{the influence of the}} local abiotic context is poorly documented. We investigated the effect of a single plant species, <b>the</b> <b>cushion</b> plant Silene acaulis, on habitat conditions, and microbial community. We collected soil from inside (In) and outside (Out) of <b>the</b> <b>cushions</b> on calcareous and siliceous cliffs in the French Alps along an elevation gradient (2, 000 – 3, 000 masl). The composition of the microbial communities was assessed by Capillary-Electrophoresis Single Strand Con-formation Polymorphism (CE-SSCP). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to characterize the response of the microbial beta-diversity to soil parameters (total C, total N, soil water content, N − NH + 4, N − NO − 3, and pH). <b>Cushions</b> affected <b>the</b> microbial communities, modifying soil properties. The fungal and bacterial communities did not respond to the same abiotic factors. Outside <b>the</b> <b>cushions,</b> <b>the</b> bacterial communities were strongly influenced by bedrock. Inside <b>the</b> <b>cushions,</b> <b>the</b> bacterial communities from both types of bedrock were highly similar, due to the smaller pH differences than in open areas. By contrast, the fungal communities were equally variable inside and outside of <b>the</b> <b>cushions.</b> Outside <b>the</b> <b>cushions,</b> <b>the</b> fungal communities responded weakly to soil pH. Inside <b>the</b> <b>cushions,</b> <b>the</b> fungal communities varied strongly with bedrock and elevation as well as increases in soil nutrients and water content. Furthermore, the dissimilarities in the microbial communities between the In and Out habitats increased with increasing habitat modification and environmental stress. Our results indicate that cushions act as a selective force that counteracts the influence of the bedrock and the resource limitations on the bacterial and fungal communities by buffering soil pH and enhancing soil nutrients. Cushion plants structure microbial communities, and this effect increases in stressful, acidic and nutrient-limited environments...|$|R

25|$|Faced {{with the}} {{destruction}} {{of many of the}} farmlands and the displacement of farmers and other workers the government had to search for a long term solution to address the issue.

25|$|Because of {{the weak}} economy, the Gulf War and its aftermath, and rising {{operational}} costs, many airlines lost money in 1990 and 1991. The ongoing liberalisation enforced the competition additionally, and Swissair lost 99million Swiss Francs {{in the first half}} year, and so Swissair was not able to pay dividends to its shareholders. In the years 1991 and 1992 Swissair had to dissolve financial reserves to <b>cushion</b> <b>the</b> losses from the commercial aviation sector.|$|E

25|$|The coat {{provided}} some protection against swords and other edged weapons, however, the buff coat was ineffective against firearms, possibly excepting spent bullets.
