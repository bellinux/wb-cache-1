From independent process variable studies to investigate the conversion of a methanol/ethanol feed to isobutanol, the best performance to date has been achieved with the 2 % Pt on Zn/Mn/Zr oxide catalyst. Using Hyprotech Hysim v 2. 5 process simulation software, and considering both gas and liquid recycle loops in the process flow diagram, the overall carbon conversion is 98 % with 22 % selectivity to isobutanol. The expected production of isobutanol is 92 MT/day from 500 MT/day of methanol and 172 MT/day of ethanol feed. An additional 13 MT/day of isobutryaldehyde intermediate is recovered in the liquid product and vent streams. Because of the low selectivity (22 %) of the methanol conversion catalyst to isobutanol, the process is uneconomical, even if the isobutanol is valued as a solvent ($ 903 /MT) and not as isobutylene for MTBE production ($ 352 /MT) ...|$|E

This report describes pilot plant testing using a 10 / 1 methanol/ethanol feed blend to identify potential catalysts for the conversion of lower alcohols derived from synthesis gas to isobutanol and other C{sub 4 +} oxygenates. The previous work in this project found that a typical Cu/Zn/Al oxide methanol synthesis catalyst is capable of producing isobutanol and isobutryaldehyde from a feed consisting of a blend of methanol and ethanol. Best performance was obtained at moderate temperature (300 {degree}C) and low pressure (30 psig). This report describes the results of space velocity testing with this catalyst to elucidate the reaction pathway. It {{has been found that}} at high ethanol conversion levels (low space velocities), yields of isobutanol and other C{sub 4 +} oxygenates do not increase with increasing methanol conversion. This suggests that Cu/Zn/Al oxide is not active for the condensation of methanol alone to higher alcohols. Therefore, new catalyst formulations are being evaluated for this reaction using the Cu/Zn/Al oxide performance as a baseline. Promising materials will also be examined at high ethanol conversion levels and with a methanol only feed to determine their capability to condense methanol...|$|E

The hydrogenation of CO 2 into C 1 products, such as methane and methanol, can be achieved with high selectivities towards the corresponding hydrogenation product. More challenging, however, is the selective production of high (C 2 +) hydrocarbons and oxygenates. These products are desired as energy vectors, owing to their higher volumetric energy density and compatibility with the current fuel infrastructure than C 1 compounds, and as entry platform chemicals for existing value chains. The major challenge is the optimal integration of catalytic functionalities for both reductive and chain-growth steps. This Minireview summarizes the progress achieved towards the hydrogenation of CO 2 to C 2 + hydrocarbons and oxygenates, covering both solid <b>and</b> molecular <b>catalysts</b> <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> in the gas and liquid phases.

40|$|The initial {{objective}} of this program {{was to develop a}} <b>catalyst</b> <b>and</b> <b>process</b> for the conversion of synthesis gas to isobutylene via the isosynthesis process. Preliminary work directed at identifying potential catalysts for this reaction did not have promising results. Therefore, the objectives of this program were revised {{to the development of a}} <b>catalyst</b> <b>and</b> <b>process</b> for the conversion of synthesis gas to isobutanol. Two approaches have been investigated in this area: the direct conversion of synthesis gas to higher alcohols and indirect conversion via methanol produced using conventional methanol synthesis technology. The isosynthesis reaction for the conversion of synthesis gas to branched hydrocarbons was pioneered by German workers during World War II The primary products of this reaction are either isobutane or isobutylene depending on the catalyst system used. Thoria-based catalysts were found to give the highest yields, but virtually all of the products were alkanes. More recently, there have been several reports of olefin production using ZrO{sub 2 }-based. The preliminary work in this program focussed on the evaluation of ZrO{sub 2 } and modified ZrO{sub 2 } catalysts for the direct conversion of CO/H{sub 2 } to isobutylene via the isosynthesis reaction. All of the catalysts and conditions evaluated in this work gave isobutylene yields of less than 4 % which is far below that required for an economically viable process. A summary of the key results from this portion of the project is given in Section 3. 6. In view of the poor performance of these catalysts and the lack any encouraging results from other research groups working in the isosynthesis area, this approach was abandoned in favor of approaches related to higher alcohols synthesis...|$|E

Previous work had identified Pt and Pd on Zn/Mn/Zr oxide and Pd on Zn/Mn/Cr oxide as promising catalysts for the conversion of a 10 / 1 methanol/ethanol blend to higher oxygenates. The reproducibility of these catalyst preparations {{has been found to}} be generally good, although some variations in performance have been observed between the Pd containing samples. Further characterization of the catalysts showing performance differences is in progress to determine whether compositional variations can account for the discrepancies. Several new 2 % Pt on metal oxide catalysts have been prepared and tested. None of these materials performed better than the original 2 % Pt on Zn/Mn/Zr (34 / 34 / 32 molar) oxide catalyst. However, a lower Zr content support (45 / 45 / 10 Zn/Mn/Zr oxide) gave similar results. Evaluation of the 2 % Pd on Zn/Mn/Cr oxide at high space velocities has indicated that this material may be substantially less active for the C{sub 1 }{minus}C{sub 1 }, condensation step necessary for methanol only conversion to higher alcohols. In view of this finding, subsequent research will focus on the development of the Zn/Mn/Zr oxide support.

This report describes the preparation and testing {{of a variety of}} potential higher alcohols synthesis catalysts based on a bifunctional formulation consisting of a noble metal dehydrogenation function on a basic mixed metal oxide support. A pilot plant catalyst screening test using a 10 / 1 methanol/ethanol feed blend has been used to identify a new class of catalysts that afford higher selectivities and productivities. of the desired isobutanol and other C{sub 4 +}, products than the Cu/Zn/Al oxide methanol synthesis catalyst that is being used as a baseline for this work. 2 % Pd or Pt on a Zn/Mn/Zr oxide support and 2 % Pd on a Zn/Mn/Cr support have given the best performances to date. In addition to isobutanol, these catalysts afford significant quantities of isobutyraldehyde and methyl isobutyrate. In order to elucidate the reaction pathway occurring with this class of catalyst, the 2 %Pd on Zn/Mn/Zr oxide catalyst has been evaluated over a range of space velocities. It has been found that isobutanol and higher oxygenates yields increase with decreasing space velocity at ethanol conversions greater than 90 %. This suggests that this catalyst is capable of converting methanol alone to higher alcohols. This is different from the result obtained with the Cu/Zn/Al oxide baseline catalyst, which showed no change in product yields at high ethanol conversions. Therefore, further effort will be focussed on the development of these noble metal/basic metal oxide catalysts for this application...|$|E

Previous work identified Pt or Pd on Zn/Mn[Zr co-precipitated metal oxides as promising catalysts for the conversion of a 10 / 1 methanol/ethanol blend to higher oxygenates. A series of catalysts have been prepared {{to determine the effects}} of metal oxide support composition and noble metal loading on the performance of these catalysts. The three components of the metal oxide have been systematically varied from 10 % to 60 %. These supports have been tested in the pilot plant with 2 % Pt and 2 % Pd added. Support composition has shown a surprisingly minor affect on both catalyst activity and selectivity. Supports with high Zn (> 45 %) and low Zr (< 33 %) have afforded the best selectivities for the desired branched C{sub 4 } products. The Zn/Mn/Zr (60 / 20 / 20) support from this series has been impregnated with 0. 5, 1, 2 and 5 % Pt to evaluate the affect of noble metal loading. The best selectivities to the desired C{sub 4 } oxygenates has been observed with the 2 % Pt loading. However, the other catalysts showed higher activities as well as lower selectivities in the standard test. Therefore, a more detailed testing protocol will be employed to establish a selectivity versus conversion relationship in order to properly compare these materials.

The results of this run {{will be used as}} a basis for the economic evaluation of a higher alcohols process. The ability of the Pt on Zn/Mn/Zr oxide catalyst to produce isobutanol in the presence of high partial pressures of H{sub 2 } has been investigated. Such operation could allow the integration of a higher alcohol process with a conventional methanol synthesis plant by placing it within the methanol synthesis recycle loop. However, higher alcohol yields are severely suppressed by a large H{sub 2 } cofeed, even at pressures as low as 50 psig. Elimination of the H{sub 2 } co-feed did not restore the performance of the catalyst to expected levels, suggesting that the high H{sub 2 } partial pressure has caused degradation of the catalyst. No further testing of high H{sub 2 } conditions is planned. The commercial system has been modeled using the product slate obtained from the ``best case`` pilot plant conditions combined with the assumption of equilibrium CO, H{sub 2 }O, CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 } makes.

In addition, the commercial potential of the new process will be evaluated by an economic analysis. The effects of temperature, pressure and methanol/ethanol molar feed ratio {{on the performance of}} the 2 % Pt on Zn/Mn/Zr Oxide catalyst has been evaluated in a series of pilot plant tests. Temperature has been varied from 325 {degrees}C to 375 {degrees}C, pressure from 30 psig to 300 psig and MeOH/EtOH ratio from 1 0 / 1 to 1 / 1. Raising temperature increases alcohol conversion, but reduces selectivity and productivity to the desired branched C 4 oxygenates. The higher pressure operation shifts the product ratio from isobutyraldehyde to isobutanol. Decreasing the feed ratio from 10 / 1 to 7 / 1 increases methanol conversion as well as selectivity to each of the iC 4 oxygenates. However, further reduction of the feed ratio to 4 / 1 does not give additional improvement. Based on these findings a pilot plant test at optimized conditions is planned using the 2 % Pt on Zn/Mn/Zr oxide catalyst. The effects of H{sub 2 }, CO and CO{sub 2 } co-feeds on the performance of the cztalyst have also been evaluated using the reference catalyst. Co-feeding H{sub 2 } has very little effect, whereas CO has a deleterious effect. CO{sub 2 } addition results in higher CO formation, but no substantial change in CO{sub 2 } selectivity. Therefore, it appears that the use of a CO{sub 2 } recycle would not be effective for reducing the formation of carbon oxide products. A copper-lined reactor has been constructed that gives acceptable blank activity at temperatures up to 450 {degrees}C and used to evaluate the activity of the 2 % Pt on Zn/Mn/Zr oxide catalyst for methanol-only conversion.

The Euro-Claus process is {{a modified version of the}} super-Claus process, which was developed to eliminate recovery losses of escaped SO 2...|$|R
40|$|A review; in this chapter, the {{emphasis}} moves to reactivity at metal ion sites in zeolites. One {{of the recent}} trends {{in the development of}} heterogeneous catalysts is connected with metal-contg. zeolites. Metal cations can be introduced into a zeolite at the synthesis stage as well as via various methods of zeolite modification (such as liq. - or solid-state ion-exchange technique, chem. vapor deposition). There are now a no. of unique catalysts (esp. MFI zeolites-based ones) showing high activity and selectivity in the diverse processes. Typical examples of such <b>catalysts</b> <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> are: Ti-contg. zeolites (hydrocarbon oxidn. by hydrogen peroxide); Fe zeolites (direct oxidn. of benzene into phenol by nitrous monoxide); Zn and Ga zeolite (dehydrogenation and aromatization of alkanes) and Cu, Fe, and Co zeolites (SCR of NOx).
