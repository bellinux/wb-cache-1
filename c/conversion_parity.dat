40|$|Nowadays, optical {{networks}} {{are composed of}} point-to-point links with electronically switching and routing functions in the network nodes (SDH-, ATM-hierarchy). The evolution of the network will go to more advanced nodes, where the signal will stay in the optical domain and will be switched, routed and processed by all-optical signal processing methods. The vision is a packet-switched optical network, where optical packets find their path through the network by self-routing through the optical nodes. For some selected functions like all-optical high-speed switching, wavelength conversion and 3 R-regeneration all-optical signal processing devices are investigated in system experiments and have shown their merits. They can be modified and combined to optical circuits to perform more complex signal processing functions needed for future all optical networks. Among these functions are: 3 R-regeneration, wavelength <b>conversion,</b> <b>parity</b> checking, add-drop multiplexing, signal comparison, header recognition, format conversion. We discuss the key optical signal processing devices, which are the main building blocks of the all-optical network. Further we discuss in which way we can use these basic devices at an early stage...|$|E
40|$|We study {{resonant}} mode <b>conversion</b> in <b>parity</b> time (PT) -symmetric multimode waveguides, where symmetry breaking {{manifests itself in}} the sequential destabilization (i. e., the appearance of complex eigenvalues) of the pairs of adjacent guided modes. We show that efficient mode conversion is possible even {{in the presence of}} the resonant longitudinal modulation of the complex refractive index. The distinguishing feature of the {{resonant mode}} conversion in the PT-symmetric structure is a drastic growth of the width of the resonance curve when the gain/losses coefficient approaches a critical value, at which symmetry breaking occurs. We found that in the system with broken symmetry, the resonant coupling between the exponentially growing mode and the stable higher-order one effectively stabilizes dynamically coupled pairs of modes and remarkably diminishes the average rate of the total power growth.

30|$|Residue {{number system}} (RNS), a {{parallel}} number system, {{is based on}} Chinese remainder theorem (CRT), which divides a large integer into several independent and parallel smaller ones with a specific modulus set. Due to the carry-free and parallel properties, RNS further simplifies the computations by decomposing a problem into a set of parallel, independent residue computations. Thus, RNS has received wide attention in very large scale integration applications. The activities of RNS focus on RNS-to-binary <b>conversion,</b> RNS <b>parity</b> check, and RNS scaling scheme [11 – 13]. Recently, more attention is also paid to RNS in a parallel communication field because of its parallel and fault-tolerant properties [14 – 19]. For instance, the RNS-based parallel communication scheme like CDMA has been proposed in [14, 15], which focused on the system architecture and the BER performance improvement at the receiver. An RNS arithmetic aided frequency-hopping pattern is designed in [16 – 18], where RNS is invoked {{as a tool for}} constructing uniform pilot patterns with limited interference. In [19], we proposed an RNS-based OFDM transmission scheme to reduce the PAPR without nonlinear distortion.|$|R
30|$|The {{index of}} undervaluation, the main {{covariate}} in the model, {{is a measure}} of domestic price level adjusted for the Balassa–Samuelson effect. 2 The index is computed in three steps: first, by calculating the real exchange rate (RER) through the purchasing power <b>parity</b> <b>conversion</b> factor (PPP); second, by regressing the RER on per capita GDP we obtain the estimated Balassa–Samuelson effect; finally, the undervaluation index is obtained by the ratio of the real exchange rate to the predicted value from the second step, i.e., the Balassa–Samuelson-adjusted rate. Whenever the undervaluation index exceeds one, the currency is considered undervalued. Fortunately, as an index it allows comparisons across countries and over time.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates how {{estimates}} of the extent and trend of income poverty in China between 1990 and 2001 vary {{as a result of}} alternative plausible assumptions concerning key parameters that influence the poverty line and estimated consumption levels. Our methodology focuses on the following sources of variation: alternative purchasing power <b>parity</b> <b>conversion</b> factors, alternative {{estimates of}} true per capita private incomes, alternative {{estimates of the}} share of income assumed to be consumed by the lower income groups, and alternative consumer price indices. We find that regardless of the assumptions we make within a reasonable range, a remarkable reduction in consumption poverty occurred in China during the 1990 s. However, estimates of the extent of Chinese poverty in any year are greatly influenced by the assumptions made. China’s record of reducing aggregate deprivations is encouraging, but must be interpreted with care, especially in view of some recent evidence concerning possible increases in consumption poverty (especially in urban areas) and worsening nutrition.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundSeveral {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. Despite its widespread use in developing countries, limited data exist on its cost-effectiveness in these settings. ObjectiveTo evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ICD in CHF patients under {{the perspective of the}} Brazilian Public Healthcare System (PHS). MethodsWe developed a Markov model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ICD compared with conventional therapy in patients with CHF and New York Heart Association class II and III. Effectiveness was evaluated in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and time horizon was 20 years. We searched MEDLINE for clinical trials and cohort studies to estimate data from effectiveness, complications, mortality, and utilities. Costs from the PHS were retrieved from national administrative databases. The model's robustness was assessed through Monte Carlo simulation and one-way sensitivity analysis. Costs were expressed as international dollars, applying the purchasing power <b>parity</b> <b>conversion</b> rate (PPP US$). ResultsICD therapy was more costly and more effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness estimates of PPP US$ 50, 345 /QALY. Results were more sensitive to costs related to the device, generator replacement frequency and ICD effectiveness. In a simulation resembling the MADIT-I population survival and ICD benefit, the ICER was PPP US$ 17, 494 /QALY and PPP US$ 15, 394 /life years. ConclusionsIn a Brazilian scenario, where ICD cost is proportionally more elevated than in developed countries, ICD therapy was associated with a high cost-effectiveness ratio.

40|$|The 2014 {{release of}} {{a new set of}} {{purchasing}} power <b>parity</b> <b>conversion</b> factors (PPPs) for 2011 has prompted a revision of the international poverty line. In order to preserve the integrity of the goalposts for international targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the World Bank's twin goals, the new poverty line was chosen so as to preserve the definition and real purchasing power of the earlier 1. 25 line (in 2005 PPPs) in poor countries. Using the new 2011 PPPs, the new line equals 1. 90 per person per day. The higher value of the line in US dollars reflects the fact that the new PPPs yield a relatively lower purchasing power of that currency vis- 0 -vis those of most poor countries. Because the line was designed to preserve real purchasing power in poor countries, the revisions lead to relatively small changes in global poverty incidence: from 14. 5 percent in the old method to 14. 1 percent in the new method for 2011. In 2012, the new reference year for the global count, we find 12. 7 percent of the world's population, or 897 million people, are living in extreme poverty. There are changes in the regional composition of poverty, but they are also relatively small. This paper documents the detailed methodological decisions taken in the process of updating both the poverty line and the consumption and income distributions at the country level, including issues of inter-temporal and spatial price adjustments.

40|$|BACKGROUND Training {{healthcare}} providers in Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) {{has been shown}} to be effective in improving their capacity to provide this critical care package for mothers and babies. However, little is known about the costs and cost-effectiveness of such training. Understanding costs and cost-effectiveness is essential in guaranteeing value-for-money in healthcare spending. This study systematically reviewed the available literature on cost and cost-effectiveness of EmOC trainings. METHODS Peer-reviewed and grey literature was searched for relevant papers published after 1990. Studies were included if they described an economic evaluation of EmOC training and the training cost data were available. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, and selected studies that met the inclusion criteria, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Quality of studies was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards statement. For comparability, all costs in local currency were converted to International dollar (I) equivalents using purchasing power <b>parity</b> <b>conversion</b> factors. The cost per training per participant was calculated. Narrative synthesis was used to summarise the available evidence on cost effectiveness. RESULTS Fourteen studies (five full and nine partial economic evaluations) met the inclusion criteria. All five and two of the nine partial economic evaluations were of high quality. The majority of studies (13 / 14) were from low- and middle-income countries. Training equipment, per diems and resource person allowance were the most expensive components. Cost of training per person per day ranged from I 33 to I 90 when accommodation was required and from I 5 to I 21 when training was facility-based. Cost-effectiveness of training was assessed in 5 studies with differing measures of effectiveness (knowledge, skills, procedure cost and lives saved) making comparison difficult. CONCLUSIONS Economic evaluations of EmOC training are limited. There is a need to scale-up and standardise processes that capture both cost and effectiveness of training and to agree on suitable economic evaluation models that allow for comparability across settings.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{perform a}} {{cost-effectiveness}} evaluation {{from the perspective}} of the Brazilian National Health System of alternatives strategies (i. e., conventional interferon, pegylated interferon, and lamivudine) for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B who present elevated aminotransferase levels and no evidence of cirrhosis at the beginning of treatment. MethodsA Markov model was developed for chronic hepatitis B (hepatitis B antigen e [HBeAg] positive and negative) with 40 years' time horizon. Costs and benefits were discounted at 5 %. Annual rates of disease progression, costs due to complications, and the efficacy of medicines were obtained from the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis evaluated uncertainties. ResultsFor HBeAg positive patients, peginterferon (48 weeks) resulted in an increase of 0. 21 discounted life-years gained compared to interferon (24 weeks). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) converted to US dollars using the 2009 purchasing power <b>parity</b> <b>conversion</b> factor was US$ 100, 752. 24 per life-year gained. For HBeAg negative patients, it was observed that interferon (48 weeks) compared with long-term lamivudine presented an increase of 0. 45 discounted life-years gained and ICER of US$ 15, 766. 90 per life-year gained. In the sensitivity analysis, the ICER was more sensitive to variation in the probability of transition from chronic hepatitis B to compensated cirrhosis, discount rate, and medicine prices. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve for HBeAg positive (pegylated interferon vs. conventional interferon) and negative (conventional interferon vs. lamivudine) showed that conventional interferon was cost-effective until three times the gross domestic product per capita. ConclusionsFor patients with chronic hepatitis B with elevated aminotransferase levels in the pretreatment and no cirrhosis who were HBeAg positive, pegylated interferon (48 weeks) provided more life-years gained when compared to conventional interferon (24 weeks), and the ICER surpasses the country's buying power, which makes conventional interferon the chosen alternative. For HBeAg negative patients, conventional interferon (48 weeks) compared to lamivudine provided more life-years gained at a favorable ICER...|$|R
