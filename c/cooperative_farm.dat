25|$|On the {{theoretical}} level, Bordiga developed {{an understanding of}} the Soviet Union as a capitalist society. Bordiga's writings on the capitalist nature of the Soviet economy, in contrast to those produced by the Trotskyists, also focused on the agrarian sector. In analyzing the agriculture of the Soviet Union, Bordiga sought to display the capitalist social relations that existed in the kolkhoz and sovkhoz, one a <b>cooperative</b> <b>farm</b> and the other a wage-labor state farm. In particular, he emphasized how much of the national agrarian produce came from small, privately owned plots (writing in 1950) and predicted the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Russia had been such a large exporter from the 1880s to 1914.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cooperative</b> <b>farming</b> led by {{smallholder}} farmers {{might be}} the future of Bangladesh’s agriculture. The paper examines rice‑farming surveys from Kurigram Sadar, Bangladesh, and explores the potential of <b>cooperative</b> <b>farming</b> and mechanization. It reveals {{that a number of}} informal, community‑supported cooperative practices are already in place, although rice farming is still labor intensive and inefficient. The paper argues that mechanization of key activities and institutionalization of <b>cooperative</b> <b>farming</b> may reverse the situation and improve food security. Kurigram Sadar rice farming is relevant to other parts of rural Bangladesh as well, as most of the country is employing similar agricultural practices...|$|R

25|$|After {{returning}} from Calexico, Lopez-De La Cruz {{and her husband}} recognized {{the power of their}} labor and knowledge and became inspired to start their own farm. In spring 1973 they started their own farm with five other families, thanks to Rodger McAfee (the same small farmer responsible for sending the $102,000 bail out to Angela Davis in 1972) who leased them 6 acres.They had some success as the first people to grow, sell, and nationally distribute cherry tomatoes under the label Rancho El Bracero (Also the name of their farm.) They made $64,000 off the sales from the cherry tomatoes, and used that money to purchase land. In 1974, the Lopez-De La Cruz family and three other families decided to purchase 40 acres near Raisin City, CA and started their own <b>cooperative</b> <b>farm</b> selling cherry tomatoes and other produce to local and national sellers. They attempted to expand their land and acquire some land with water by purchasing land from millionaire farmer Giffen, but he refused to sell any plot for less than a half of a million dollars.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Hudson Kelley {{played an}} {{important}} role in farming as one of the founders of the National Grange, along with several other clerks in the United States Department of Agriculture. [...] The movement grew out of his interest in <b>cooperative</b> <b>farm</b> associations following the end of the Civil War, and he established local Grange chapters in Elk River and Saint Paul. [...] The organization worked to provide education on new farming methods, as well as to influence government and public opinion on matters important to farmers. [...] One of these areas of concern was the freight rates charged by the railroads and by the grain elevators. [...] Since there was little or no competition between railroads serving Minnesota farm communities, railroads could charge as much as the traffic would bear. [...] By 1871, the situation was so heated that both the Republican and Democratic candidates in state elections promised to regulate railroad rates. [...] The state established an office of railroad commissioner and imposed maximum charges for shipping. [...] Populist Ignatius L. Donnelly also served the Grange as an organizer.|$|E

40|$|Most <b>cooperative</b> <b>farms</b> {{carry out}} diversified {{activity}} {{in the field of}} production and services of agricultural and non-agricultural character. The aim of the article is to determine income functions of various sectors and to determine their profitability. Research was based on the study of about 100 <b>cooperative</b> <b>farms</b> in Poznań province. The following sectors have been distinguished: agricultural production, divided into stock and vegetable production, agricultural processing, services and the remaining production. Economic effects have been presented by means of three income categories: farm income, gross income and net income. Costs for respective sectors were calculated {{on the basis of the}} accounting system in force in <b>cooperative</b> <b>farms.</b> Profitability of particular sectors was calculated by comparing costs and income. The analysis shows that the profitability of, production in <b>cooperative</b> <b>farms</b> and in their separate sectors was subject to annual variations. Thus, the income function of separate sectors was also subject to annual changes. However, one may state with certainty that non-agricultural sectors are more significant providers of income in <b>cooperative</b> <b>farms</b> than in other branches of agriculture. Besides, non-agricultural sectors showed usually higher profitability than agricultural production sector. However, vast differences appeared within agricultural production. Vegetable production was always profitable and brought high income, whereas stock production was characterized by low profitability and in some years was even unprofitable. Thus, finding a solution for the problem of low efficiency of stock production is of vital importance for <b>cooperative</b> <b>farms.</b> The article proves that efficiency of agricultural activity is to a great extent determined by the structure of production.
