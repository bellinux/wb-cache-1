When Ralph does not get any cards and breaks down in tears, Lisa hastily gives him a <b>card</b> <b>out</b> of sympathy. Ralph immediately cheers up, and develops a romantic interest in her. Ralph begins to annoy Lisa at every turn. Lisa tries to escape the situation by telling Ralph she is not ready to be romantic, but Ralph uses his position as Chief Wiggum's son to get her tickets to Krusty the Clown's upcoming 29th Anniversary Special, as well as a leading part for himself in a President's Day pageant in which Lisa also stars. Ralph receives the role of George Washington opposite Lisa as Martha Washington.|$|E

Meanwhile, the tugboat [...] based at Subic Bay in the Philippines was placed on standby, and later {{received}} similar orders to head for South Vietnam. Upon their arrival in Saigon, U.S. Navy divers and salvage teams tried to pump water out from Cards flooded compartments, but their initial attempts were hindered {{by a combination of}} malfunctions in the pumping equipment, and the poor diving conditions in the river. Ultimately it took the salvors 17 days to refloat Card, and when that was completed they began the process of moving the ship out of Saigon by installing a 6-inch pump and a load of generators inside Card to get rid of excess water while at sea. Reclaimer and Tawakoni then towed the damaged <b>Card</b> <b>out</b> of Saigon, and headed for Subic Bay where it underwent further repairs.|$|E
500|$|Federal troops {{combed the}} rural area's woods and swamps for Booth {{in the days}} {{following}} the assassination, as the nation experienced an outpouring of grief. On April 18, mourners waited seven abreast in a mile-long line outside the White House for the public viewing of the slain president, reposing in his open walnut casket in the black-draped East Room. A cross of lilies was at the head and roses covered the coffin's lower half. Thousands of mourners arriving on special trains jammed Washington for the next day's funeral, sleeping on hotel floors and even resorting to blankets spread outdoors on the Capitol's lawn. Prominent abolitionist leader and orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an [...] "unspeakable calamity" [...] for African Americans. Great indignation was directed towards Booth as the assassin's identity was telegraphed across the nation. Newspapers called him an [...] "accursed devil," [...] "monster," [...] "madman," [...] and a [...] "wretched fiend." [...] Historian Dorothy Kunhardt writes: [...] "Almost every family who kept a photograph album on the parlor table owned a likeness of John Wilkes Booth of the famous Booth family of actors. After the assassination Northerners slid the Booth <b>card</b> <b>out</b> of their albums: some threw it away, some burned it, some crumpled it angrily." [...] Even in the South, sorrow was expressed in some quarters. In Savannah, Georgia, the mayor and city council addressed a vast throng at an outdoor gathering to express their indignation, and many in the crowd wept. Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston called Booth's act [...] "a disgrace to the age". Robert E. Lee also expressed regret at Lincoln's death by Booth's hand.|$|E

500|$|A {{few months}} after the sale, Edwards asked Connelly if he would accept the card for his auction. Connelly consented and took the card across the country to {{prospective}} buyers. Meanwhile, HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel decided to cover the progress of Cobb and Edwards' struggles with the card. Connelly met a card dealer in New York City, Mike Mangasarian, who was sent on behalf of a prominent collector to check the <b>card</b> <b>out.</b> Mr. Mangasarian said the card seemed authentic and stated he would attend the auction for the card later on if the card could be taken out of the thick lucite holder for a closer examination. A promise was made that this could be done the day of the auction in Binghamton, NY. After the auction and by not bidding on the card Mr. Mangasarian revealed to HBO that he felt the back of the card was indeed real but in his opinion the front was not. He explained that all T-206's have dark brown letters printed for the team and players name and this one was in black. Additionally, he stated that he was not comfortable with the print process exhibited on the card front. Meanwhile, a number of card collectors who doubted the card contacted eBay and demanded that the card's listing on the website be removed. eBay officials finally pulled the plug the day before the actual Connelly auction was to begin. As a result, a number of previously interested collectors decided not to bid for the card at the auction the next day. As Connelly pointed out, the collectors chose not to make bids because [...] "hen eBay pulled the card ... it raised too many questions about its authenticity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{presentation}} {{of the problem is}} to say : pick a random <b>card</b> <b>out</b> of the three, what are the odds that it has the same color on the other side? Since only one card is mixed and two have the same color on their sides, it is easier to understand that the probability is [...] Also note that saying that the color is black (or the coin is gold) instead of white doesn't matter since it is symmetric: the answer is the same for white. So is the answer for the generic question 'same color on both sides'.|$|E
2500|$|On May 2, {{the next}} game after a day off, Gehrig {{approached}} McCarthy before the game in Detroit against the Tigers and said, [...] "I'm benching myself, Joe", telling the Yankees' skipper {{that he was doing}} so [...] "for the good of the team." [...] McCarthy acquiesced, putting Ellsworth [...] "Babe" [...] Dahlgren in at first base, and also said that whenever Gehrig wanted to play again, the position was his. Gehrig, as Yankee captain, himself took the lineup <b>card</b> <b>out</b> to the shocked umpires before the game, ending the fourteen-year streak. Before the game began, the Briggs Stadium announcer told the fans, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, {{this is the first time}} Lou Gehrig's name will not appear on the Yankee lineup in 2,130 consecutive games." [...] The Detroit Tigers' fans gave Gehrig a standing ovation while he sat on the bench with tears in his eyes. A wire service photograph of Gehrig reclining against the dugout steps with a stoic expression appeared the next day in the nation's newspapers. He stayed with the Yankees as team captain for the rest of the season but never played in a major league game again.|$|E

50|$|As {{indicated}} earlier, {{the game}} {{can either be}} played with all the <b>cards</b> laid <b>out</b> or with the cards overlapping each other.
