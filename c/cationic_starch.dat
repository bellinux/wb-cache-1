This study investigated the potential effects of chitosan, <b>cationic</b> <b>starch,</b> chitosan modified soils (MS-C) and <b>cationic</b> <b>starch</b> modified soils (MS-S) on the aquatic organisms by using a bioassay battery. The toxicity potential of these four fiocculants was quantitatively assessed using an integrated biotic toxicity index (BTI).

Results showed that median effect concentrations (EC 50) of the MS-C and MS-S were 31 - 124 times higher than chitosan and <b>cationic</b> <b>starch,</b> respectively. D. magna was the most sensitive species to the four fiocculants. Histological examination of C carpio showed that significant pathological changes were found in gills.

Rosin, Alkyl Ketene Dimer (AKD) and Alkenyl Succinic Anhydride (ASA) internal sizing agents exist for this purpose. ASA {{is added to the}} papermaking process {{in the form of an}} emulsion. The dispersion of ASA oil, water, and a stabilizing agent (stabilizer) are mixed under shear forces to create the emulsion. In this master’s thesis, different emulsions, emulsification techniques and stabilizers in the process industry were studied. Emulsions in food, medical, petroleum and papermaking processes had potential stabilizers to be used for hydrophobation of paper and board with ASA. The comparison between rosin, AKD and ASA internal sizing agents was also done. The goal was to find optimal emulsification methods and emulsion stabilizers for ASA emulsification.

40|$|This {{work has}} shown that a {{reproducible}} ASA emulsification with optimal particle size is possible, and well controllable, in the laboratory. The most important factors for the adjustment of particle size are emulsification time, shear forces, ASA concentration and temperature. The protection colloid and the emulsifier used are also important factors for the particle size that can be achieved. Concerning the emulsification there is an optimum as regards particle size- which is mainly dependent on the starch or polymer to ASA ratio. The stability and hydrolysis of ASA emulsions depend mainly on pH, temperature and water hardness (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +). However, the tendency to build up agglomerates and deposits is only caused by calcium ions, {{due to the fact}} that the ASAcid calcium salts are of much lower solubility than the magnesium salts. Agglomeration and hydrolysis can be reduced by increased starch addition or by the introduction of long-chain polymers such as polyacrylamides. It is surprising that the cationic charge of the used protection colloid showed almost no or even a negative influence on the emulsion and hydrolysis stability of the ASA. Furthermore, particle size plays an important role during the evaluation of hydrolytic stability and deposition. Therefore, it is very important that emulsions and different protection colloids should only be compared at the same particle size. However, high <b>cationic</b> liquid <b>starches</b> or the new “particle stabilized ASA ” (bentonite or colloidal silica) seem to be the best alternative solution, as compared to the standard cooking starches. ...|$|R

40|$|Starches and celluloses can be {{chemically}} modified {{in order to}} affect their physiochemical properties. Modification of these carbohydrate polymers entails derivatising their free hydroxyl groups with functional groups.

Unfortunately, the correlation between the distribution of modifications and the obtained properties is not fully understood. In order to facilitate the investigation of this correlation, new analytical tools are needed. Starch and cellulose are too large to be analysed by most conventional analysis techniques. In this thesis this problem was remedied by using hydrolysis (either acid hydrolysis or enzymatic hydrolysis) to form smaller molecules that are more easily analysed. The hydrolysates were then analysed by ESI-MS. LC-MS, HPAEC-PAD, SEC-RI and reducing-end determination were employed as well. Four modified polysaccharides were investigated: two modified starches (hydroxypropylated amylopectin potato <b>starch</b> and <b>cationic</b> amylopectin potato <b>starch)</b> and two modified celluloses (carboxymethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose). The information obtained on the hydrolysates could be utilised both in understanding the distribution of modifications in investigated compounds and in understanding of the function of the employed enzymes...|$|R
