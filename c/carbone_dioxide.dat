It is necessary to develop new alternative fuel to improve the efficiency of conventional systems, reduce emissions (NOx, SOx, soot particles) and recover for its materials. A new fuel called bio-hythane, a mixture of natural gas up to 20 % hydrogen and up to 50 % <b>Carbone</b> <b>dioxide,</b> from the recovery of the waste from households and agriculture, via suitable digesters provides a source of renewable energy and usable, is a very interesting solution to improve emission standards and optimization of the combustion chambers. This experimental study is led in a non-reacting configuration and in combustion in order to focus on the effects of hydrogen addition and CO 2 dilution in the fuel on the velocity profiles, the turbulence intensity and the turbulent kinetic energy. From Ply measurements the results show that from the velocity and fluctuations profiles the high diffusivity and the low density of hydrogen allow bio-hythane jet to spread more efficiency in the combustion. The combustion decreases the entrainment of the ambient fluid and raises the viscosity of the flow, leading to an increase of the longitudinal velocity along the bio-hythane jet and a reduction of the turbulence in comparison with non-reacting configuration. The <b>Carbone</b> <b>dioxide</b> addition reduces the fall of the turbulence because the temperature of the flame is less important. Effects of hydrogen and CO 2 are also highlighted by analysis of turbulent kinetic energy along the bio-hythane. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{new world}} energy {{policies}} encourage {{the use of}} renewable energy sources with clean technologies, and abandon progressively the fossil fuel dependence. Another energy generation trend called commonly the “Waste-to-Energy” solution, uses organic waste as a response for two major problems: energy generation and waste management. Thanks to the anaerobic digestion, the organic waste can provide a biogas composed essentially from <b>Carbone</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CO 2) and Methane (CH 4). This work aims essentially to help students, researchers and even decision makers to consider the importance of biogas generation. The proposed tool is the last version of our previous tool which is enhanced and completed. It presents the potential to produce biogas of any shortlisted kind of waste, including also some energy valorization ways. A technical economical data are introduced for eventual feasibility studies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{possible}} to find plenty of information about kinetics of reaction between amine and <b>carbone</b> <b>dioxide</b> in the literature. However, there are several experimental techniques and several possible mechanisms which lead to observe sometimes high dispersion of experimental results with various interpretations. A method which enables to compare kinetic constant got by different authors is proposed in this work. First, we present experimental techniques and justify comparison of data obtained by stopped-flow technique. Then, we plot kinetic data for all amines studied in the literature by a power law dependency with the concentration. This representation illustrates some structure-activity relationships and enables to confront experimental results with the different mechanisms. Advantages and limits of each mechanism are discussed. Finally, we justify {{the choice of the}} termo-lecular model to compare data got by different authors. This model leads to a compensation effect which is an argument in favour of this mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{solubility}} of gases is {{an important}} issue in the industries. Carbon Dioxide Through gas transmission line exists as sour gas therefore it is eliminated by solvent in industry. <b>Carbone</b> <b>Dioxide</b> is nonpolar molecule that has lower solubility in liquid solvent. In this study the solubility of carbon dioxide in some polar and nonpolar solvents (include Acetone, Acetic Acid, Benzene, Carbon Tetra Chloride, Chlorobenzene, Chloroform, Cyclo-hexane, Di-Methyl Formamid, Ethanol, Ethyl acetate, Methanol, NButanol, N-Heptane, N-Hexane) at atmospheric pressure and temperatures range from 5 - 35 ºC was determined. A laboratory unit was made for this experience and the solubility of CO 2 was reported. The solubility of carbon dioxide in these solvent was low due to unreactivity and nonpolarity nature of these material. The solubility of CO 2 in Ethyl Acetate and Methanol was highest and lowest respectively. This investigation showed that the solvent with carbonyl group have higher activity than other...|$|E
40|$|The oil {{recovery}} {{can be enhanced}} by surfactant alternating carbonated water (SACW) injection which is considered a new tertiary recovery method. <b>Carbone</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CO 2) concentration, injection pressure and temperature may {{have a significant effect}} on the {{oil recovery}} factor. Sand pack core flooding experiments were performed in this research. Glass beads were compacted into stainless steel tube (34. 5 cm length and 3. 8 cm diameter). The synthesis brine water and crude oil saturated the sand pack and aged for 4 days to established real oil reservoir conditions at reservoir temperature, pressure and NaCl salinity of 30, 000 ppm. In addition, Sodium dodecly sulfate (SDS) surfactant solution was used for surfactant flooding. The effectiveness of three parameters on the recovery factor have been studied by applying SACW. Firstly, different carbonation levels of CO 2 in brine water injection such as 100 %, 50 % and 0. 0 %. Secondly, different injection pressures including 1500, 2100 and 2750 psi. Finally, different reservoir temperatures of 40 C, 50 C and 60 C. The procured results revealed that oil recovery factor substantially affected by these parameters. It exhibited a markedly increase in the recovery factor as a result of CO 2 concentration in brine water injection increases. Furthermore, higher injection pressure illustrated higher recovery factor. Similarly, the higher reservoir temperature depicted a significant increase in the recovery factor. Consequently, more oil production rate may be attributed to reservoir temperature and pressure due to CO 2 concentration...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMotivated by the {{possibility}} of comparing theoretical predictions of Lake Vostok's composition with future in situ measurements, we investigate the composition of clathrates that are expected to form in this environment from the air supplied to the lake by melting ice. In order to establish the best possible correlation between the lake water composition with that of air clathrates formed in situ, we use a statistical thermodynamic model based on the description of the guest-clathrate interaction by a spherically averaged Kihara potential with a nominal set of potential parameters. We determine the fugacities of the different volatiles present in the lake by defining a "pseudo" pure substance dissolved in water owning the average properties of the mixture and by using the Redlich-Kwong equation of state to mimic its thermodynamic behavior. Irrespective of the clathrate structure considered in our model, we find that xenon and krypton are strongly impoverished in the lake water (a ratio in the 0. 04 [...] 0. 1 range for xenon and a ratio in the ∼ 0. 15 [...] 0. 3 range for krypton), compared to their atmospheric abundances. Argon and methane are also found depleted in the Lake Vostok water by factors in the 0. 5 [...] 0. 95 and 0. 3 [...] 0. 5 ranges respectively, compared to their atmospheric abundances. On the other hand, the <b>carbone</b> <b>dioxide</b> abundance is found substantially enriched in the lake water compared to its atmospheric abundance (by a factor in the 1. 6 [...] 5 range at 200 residence times). The comparison of our predictions of the CO_ 2 and CH_ 4 mole fractions in Lake Vostok with future in situ measurements will allow disentangling between the possible supply sources...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{a theoretical}} and experimental {{investigation of the}} generation of microparticles by rapid cooling crystallization. Extremely high cooling rates are achieved by direct contact cooling with liquid <b>carbone</b> <b>dioxide,</b> which is throttled down to environmental pressure. The starting point of the investigation was a theoretical consideration {{of the relationship between}} the resulting particle size distribution, the cooling rate and the kinetic of nucleation and crystal growth. For this, the unsteady crystallization process during a batch cooling was calculated for an idealized crystallization model. It was possible to identify those ranges of the nucleation and crystal growth, which enable the generation of microparticles in principle. The minimum required cooling rates for each kinetic could be estimated on this basis. Finally, this theoretical investigation provided evidence for the existence of those materials, which require very high cooling rates for the production of micron sized particles. It could also be shown, that the influence of the heat of crystallization can be neglected for typical values of crystallization enthalpy, heat capacity of the solution and gradient of the solubility curve. A test bench has been developed for the experimental investigation of this crystallization technique, where the mean values of the cooling rates are in the range of 300000 K/min to 720000 K/min. In the framework of the following experimental investigation 14 solute-solvent systems have been tested systematically with different cooling techniques in order to check their qualification. The experimental strategy allowed the determination of the attainable particle size and the evaluation, if the coolant itself has an additional influence on the crystallization process. Three solute-solvent systems have been found in total, where the generation of micron sized particles bases exclusively on rapid cooling crystallization. The crystallization of the other solute-solvent systems are influenced by the coolant, whereas in all cases the coolant effects the crystallization of smaller particles compared to the pure cooling crystallization. Some solute-solvent systems are not suitable for rapid cooling as the crystallization is too slowly in relation to the cooling rate. It has also been investigated, if the unsteady heat release during crystallization could be a used for an initial estimation of the suitability of a system for the production of micron sized particles by rapid cooling. The differential scanning calorimetry proved to be a helpful testing method for the verification, if a solute-solvent system is in priciple suitable or not for the new technique and if a mechanismen change of the solid state transformation occurs with increasing cooling rate. The solute azelaic acid and the solvent acetone have been chosen as a model system for more a detailed investigation of the crystallization method. It could be shown for this system, that beside the cooling rate the most important parameter for the particle size is the end temperatur and respectivley the equilibrium concentration. A decrease of nucleation at very low temperatures could not be detected here and the smallest particle size of 1 µm is produced at - 78 °C. The initial solute concentration has no significant influence on the particle size. Obviously, the attained increase of the supersaturation is compensated by the simultaneous increase of the produced solid mass...|$|E
