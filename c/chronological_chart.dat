The novelty of multi-layered <b>chronological</b> <b>charts</b> lies {{in their ability to}} enrich the visualization of a temporal connection between personal and social contextual factors based on categories determined by the researcher. In doing so, such charts make existing interview data more accessible and processable. In-depth, thematic data analysis can be supported through the visualization of prominent life aspects or the presentation of integrative perspectives of individuals 2 ̆ 7 lives. Case examples are presented to demonstrate how methodological and theoretical objectives are fulfilled through the customized use of genealogy software. Based on the underlying research problem, multi-layered biographical charts can be customized for different research purposes and connected to an array of complex linkage systems...|$|R

60|$|The {{beginning}} of this twentieth century happens to coincide with a very interesting phase in that great development of means of land transit {{that has been the}} distinctive feature (speaking materially) of the nineteenth century. The nineteenth century, when it takes its place with the other centuries in the <b>chronological</b> <b>charts</b> of the future, will, if it needs a symbol, almost inevitably have as that symbol a steam engine running upon a railway. This period covers the first experiments, the first great developments, and the complete elaboration of that mode of transit, and the determination of nearly all the broad features of this century's history may be traced directly or indirectly to that process. And since an interesting light is thrown upon the new phases in land locomotion that are now beginning, it will be well to begin this forecast with a retrospect, and to revise very shortly the history of the addition of steam travel to the resources of mankind.|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a new model}} for understanding the sudden success of prose in four literatures: Greek, Latin, French and Old Norse. Through comparison and quantitative observations, and {{by focusing on the}} success of prose rather than its invention, it is shown that in all four cases two or three decades were crucial for creating prose literature. This turn can be described by the term »librarization«: the fact that private book collections and reading habits emerged helps us understand the space into which a host of prose writers were suddenly writing. This reading habit factor (inlcuding reading aloud) has been underplayed in previous scholarship mostly focused on authorial choices and invention. For two of the literatures (Greek, French) the fast dynamics of the rise of prose has already been identified and discussed, but for the two others (Latin, Old Norse), the observation is new. It is also suggested that the exactly contemporary rise of French and Old Norse prose (c. 1200 - 1230) most probably is connected. The four literatures are each shown in <b>chronological</b> <b>charts</b> so as to visualize the timeline and the relation between poetic and prosaic works. The article furthermore reflects on a number of characteristics and implications of prose literature by drawing on comparisons and contrasts between the ancient and the medieval, important among which is the profound effect of prose librarization on the canonization of existing poetic literature...|$|R
40|$|Ren Bonian {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{productive}} painters in late nineteenth-century China who produced more than fifteen hundred pieces of paintings. When Ren Bonian became addicted to opium in the late 1880 s, he slowed down his artistic development and his daughter and students began to paint for him. Some followers even forged his paintings after Ren’s death under the financial pressure. Therefore, a large number of questionable paintings are collected in the museums and private hands today. In addition to the stylistic analysis on his painting, we should consider an understanding of Ren Bonian’s habitual use of seals a useful tool for studying the authenticity of his painting. My study of Ren Bonian’s seals is building on the forty-three seals collected in the Zhongguo shuhuajia yinjian kuanshi (Index of seal and signature of Chinese painters and calligraphers, Shanghai: Shuhua chubanshe, 1996), and on fifty-eight seals collected in Wang Yuntian’s “Ren Bonian changyong yinkao” (Wang Yuntian, “Ren Bonian changyong yinkao”, Shanghai Museum Bulletin, No. 7, 1996, 233 ~ 247). After several years of fieldwork in the museum storages in the world and having examined around one thousand paintings attributed to Ren Bonian, in this paper I gather an index of seventy-three seals, list of sources, and <b>chronological</b> <b>charts</b> of the use of each seal. Although one cannot make a judgment on the precise number of seals Ren had actually used or the precise starting dates of each seal, and although different degrees of humidity of the ink pad and the varied strength with which one pressed the stamp on different materials would also bring different visual results, still a knowledge of his seals and a scientific analysis can help us to identify a fabrication especially when the forger is familiar with the exemplar’s painting style and writing...|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth's {{room had}} been set to rights for the {{accommodation}} of the visitor, so that it suited most people's ideas of comfort better just then, than in its usual state. A number of books and papers had been cleared from the table, to leave it free for Anne's toilette apparatus, and a heap of school girls' frocks and tippets, which had originally been piled up on two chairs, but, daily increasing in number, had grown top-heavy, fallen down and encumbered the floor, had that morning been given away, {{so that there was}} at least room to sit down. Elizabeth's desk and painting box were banished to the top of her chest-of-drawers, where her looking-glass stood in a dark corner, being by no means interesting to her. Near the window was her book-case, tolerably well supplied with works both English and foreign, and its lower shelf containing a double row of brown-paper covered volumes, and many-coloured and much soiled little books, belonging to the lending library. The walls were hung with Elizabeth's own works, for the most part more useful than ornamental. There were genealogical and <b>chronological</b> <b>charts</b> of Kings and Kaisars, comparisons of historical characters, tables of Christian names and their derivations, botanical lists, maps, and drawings--all in such confusion, that once, when Helen attempted to find the Pope contemporary with Edward the First, she asked Elizabeth why she had written the Pope down as Leo Nonus Cardinal, on which she was informed, with a sufficient quantity of laughter, that the word in question was the name of a flower, Leonurus Cardiaca, looking like anything but what it was intended for in Elizabeth's writing, and that Pope Martin the Fourth was to be found {{on the other side of}} the Kings of France and Spain, and the portrait of Charles the First. The chimney-piece was generally used as a place of refuge for all small things which were in danger of being thrown away if left loose on the table; but, often forgotten in their asylum, had accumulated and formed a strange medley, which its mistress jealously defended from all attacks of housemaids. In the middle stood a plaster cast of the statue of the Maid of Orleans, a present from her little brother Horace; above it hung a small Geneva watch, which had belonged to Elizabeth's own mother; and there were besides a few treasures of Horace's, too tender to be trusted in the nursery in his absence at school.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the main historical {{aspects of the}} information design development and initial sample data visualization, infographics. Their practical expediency caused their existence long before the definition of information design. Geographical discoveries and research, popularization of historical knowledge, mathematical development, and other fields of science stimulated {{the creation of the}} first maps, diagrams, <b>chronological</b> <b>charts.</b> These were the original sample data of visualization which are characteristic for information design. The practical expediency specified their emergence long before defining of the notion. Objectives. The aim is to identify both the key aspects of formation and individuals who have made a contribution to the development of information design. Methods. Information design is based on functional and aesthetic principles. One of the most important functional principles is to provide clear, accurate message structure, adherence to the unity of its elements to facilitate an ease of reading and learning. The historical aspects were considered in the works of such authors: Nancy Duarte («Slide: ology: The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations»), Mark Smiciklas («The Power of Infographics: Using Pictures to Communicate and Connect with Your Audiences»). Results. The need to present visual information was originated a long ago. The geographical discoveries and research, popularization of historical knowledge, mathematical development and other fields of science stimulated {{to the creation of the}} first maps, diagrams, <b>chronological</b> <b>charts.</b> These were the original sample data of visualization which are characteristic for information design. The practical expediency specified their emergence long before defining of the notion. Some scientists believe that information design as a phenomenon emerged comparatively not long ago and was practiced on a large scale in collaterally with development of the Internet. In fact mankind throughout its history enjoyed icons, graphics, and images to tell about the events, to share information, and to learn. The first samples of protoinfographics dated the end of Stone Age when our ancestors began drawing animals on the walls of caves in southern France 30, 000 BC. Another example can serve as an early infographic hieroglyphics that is components of the written languages of the ancient civilizations that existed about 3, 000 years BC. Maya, the ancient Egyptians used icons and graphic symbols to transmit text information. Charles Joseph Minard, 1781 - 1870, French engineer-builder, at the 50 - 70 th of the 19 th century began to accompany geographical data of Statistics and historical works with schemes. His most famous creation is the visualization of the movement of Napoleon's army during the war with Russia. Analyzing the causes of losses and defeats of the French army, Minardi illustrated the crucial moments (location, direction of movement, loss of the troops, lower temperature) within only infographics. The modern Scottish engineer William Pleyfeyra (William Playfair, 1759 - 1823) is considered to be the ancestor of the modern diagram. In 1786 he published his first graphic outcomes as line and bar graph (histogram) in his book «Commercial and Political Atlas». His first pie chart appeared in the book «Statistical Breviary» in 1801. In 1858 the famous English social worker and nurse Florence Nightingale (1820 - 1910) pioneered the use of a pie chart for setting area. This technique was used in her chart that shows the level and causes of death of British soldiers during the Crimean War. According to statistics, more soldiers died from poor sanitary conditions in hospitals than in battles. Publication of the chart in the report of the Royal Commission drew attention and demonstrated useful information. This approach to data visualization and contributed to the overall approval of the reform of military medicine. Historians and researchers of visual culture consider an ancestor of the modern information graphics to be Austrian Marxist philosopher Otto Neurath, 1882 - 1945, who in 1925 with his wife Mari Neurath and Gerd Arntz illustrator developed a system of the visual language International System of Typographic Picture Education (ISOTYPE). By developing the language of images, they appealed for assistance to socio-economic education of the residents of Vienna. The inventors of the language of images have earnestly sought to assist the people with varying levels of literacy and knowledge in training, to make the material interesting, clear, and easy-remember. According to their plan the information and data had to be transferred into a simple visual symbols and signs. Now in order to expand communication capabilities many people and organizations use information design. Private entrepreneurs, small and medium businesses, non-profit institutions and large corporations — all of them can be used this means of transmitting information. Nowadays, due to information overload the attention span is reduced. Specific people and organizations use data visualization and infographics to pass the concentrated information to both internal and external audiences, to facilitate and accelerate the process of perception. The use of tools making the information more accessible and interesting to the target audience is an important step on the path to success. Novelty. These historical aspects of information design development enable to understand that both today and afterwards information penetrates virtually into all spheres of life. It gives understanding that infographics can be used in almost any industry and discipline. Information design is a perfect marketing tool for the treatment of any person or team to existing or potential customers. This is an effective tool not only for external communication, but also for improvement and simplifying of communication within the company. Conclusuion. It is clear that both social and traditional media are an important part of the information society; they actively promote various kinds of information. Increase of public information awareness by means of social media and traditional media persuades and convinces in the practical usefulness of information design as one of the most effective modern forms of content for data transmission...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 7405 The aim of {{this thesis}} is to provide an {{explanatory}} narrative for the geography of distress and relief in Co. Donegal during the Great Famine. A further critical component seeks to set Donegal within a western seaboard and all-Ireland context. Mindful of a complex historiography, an extensive review of literature charts {{the study of the}} Great Famine, noting strengths, gaps and weaknesses, while homing in on the regional dimensions of the crisis. In setting the scene, the eve of the Famine within Donegal and Ireland is outlined in a cogent series of demographic and socio-economic indices. Then the study assumes tight <b>chronological</b> order, <b>charting</b> a partial potato failure and response in 1845 - 6, and a dramatic lurch from crisis to catastrophe in 1847, in which the provision of Public Works featured prominently. At the same time, {{in the spring and summer}} of 1847, a new departure commanded the relief of distress by way of the provision of soup kitchens. Thereafter, from the autumn of 1847 onwards, the relief of distress was supported mainly through the provision of workhouse and outdoor relief under an extended Poor Law system. To end, intra-regional patterns of relief and distress in Co. Donegal are outlined and inteipreted; the anomalous status of Donegal within Ireland is opened up to scrutiny and exploration; and the adequacy of state relief evaluated...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the origins and}} development of the English mahogany trade from its origins {{to the beginning of the}} French Revolutionary War. It is based primarily on statistical and commercial information, most of which is drawn from government and other official sources. The bulk of the text is a <b>chronological</b> account, <b>charting</b> the growth of the trade from its small beginnings in Jamaica after 1700 to its late eighteenth century heyday. It considers the effect of economic conditions, shipping costs, government commercial policy and imperial colonial strategy, and shows how these had a direct bearing on the scale and direction of the trade. The various sources of mahogany are discussed, together with the characteristics and uses of the timber. Popular conceptions about the various types of mahogany used in 18 th century furniture making are discussed in the light of statistical and other contemporary evidence. The thesis also considers the effects of the introduction of mahogany on furniture manufacturing in England. It investigates the cost of mahogany relative to other furniture woods, and suggests that its chief appeal in the initial years of importation was its low cost. This suggestion is born out by the early use of mahogany as a joinery rather than a cabinet wood. The thesis goes on to argue that the cost of mahogany was often a primary determinant of stylistic and technical development. As demand for the wood grew, so costs rose and inflation became at times a notable feature of the mahogany market. The effects of this inflation are recorded in the archives of contemporary furniture makers and are apparent in extant 18 th century furniture. The most important single finding of the thesis is the paramont role of government in determining the scale and direction of the mahogany trade. In this respect mahogany reflects the historical development of British West Indian commercial policy. Mahogany was not merely an art-historical phenomenon, but a symbol of Britain's rise to commercial dominance in the 18 th century...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the origins, development and {{decline of the}} Class Meeting. Section one contains an overview of religious and societal change from the sixteenth century onwards. The heritage of John and Charles Wesley is studied within this milieu, and the inheritance which John Wesley drew from that examined. The consideration of the Unitary Societies and Fetter Lane is both <b>chronological</b> and analytical, <b>charting</b> the methods adopted to accommodate a desire for association, and reviewing the distinctive purposes of each societal model. The study of English religious association has not been previously brought together {{in the manner of}} this thesis, and is vital to a full understanding of the following sections. The material collated for section two, the Class Meeting as the crown of Methodism is original, and draws on testimony, diary and journal records. Wesley's class was a successful conflation of disparate doctrines, and modelled growth in grace and holiness, which promoted a vital affective journey. An analysis of the primary aims of the class, which gave the Methodist people their distinct characteristics, is followed by a study of the social identity and group processes that occurred when prospective members considered joining the Methodists. Section three considers the Class Meeting's decline prior to Wesley's death in 1791. Using the work of Weber (routinisation), Durkheim (totemism) and Troeltsch (primary/secondary religion) as themes, the section evaluates reasons why the class became a cross. Journal, diary and testimonial material supports the Methodists' declining interest in the class which led to its irrelevance to a people seeking respectability. This thesis adds to the body of knowledge in relation to the Class Meeting by investigating the origins, rise and decline of the class in Wesley's lifetime, particularly through the use of social sciences to examine reasons for success and decline of the class.

The Department of Archaeology at the University of Turku began to study the finger relic of St Eric and other items in the assemblage of Turku Cathedral in 2007. Relics and reliquaries are being opened and documented and organic as well as inorganic samples are being taken for a range of scientific analyses. So far the project has concentrated on building a <b>chronological</b> <b>chart</b> of individual artefacts. The majority of the relics date to the fourteenth century, although much more recent datings have also been obtained. The challenge of the project is not to stop when a better understanding of materials, their origins and age has been accomplished, but to use the results as a steppingstone into a study of the practices of medieval relic veneration. Medieval bodies and those material processes which authenticate relics, or distinguish saints’ bodies from other human remains, are thus {{at the heart of this}} article discussing embodiment...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedPrior to the Civil Rights Movement, Native American Off-Reservation Boarding Schools (ORBS) were harsh, militaristic {{institutions}} {{with the objective}} of stripping Native American children of any attachment to their traditions and culture. Much of the existing literature on ORBS critiqued the conditions and assimilation-oriented policies. Few scholarly works were written about ORBS after World War II. This study investigated the causes of the shift in conditions and attitudes at ORBS after 1960 and whether existing literature accurately portrayed the life experience of ORBS students. It sought to provide an alternative way of looking at boarding schools and a broader view. The methodology included a case study of the author's own ORBS: Stewart Indian School (SIS) in Carson City, Nevada, during 1970 - 1980. In addition to tape-recorded interviews, twenty alumni answered a 21 -question survey. A cultural biography depicted the author's empirical knowledge about ORBS and SIS.; Overall, the results showed a wider range of positive ORBS experiences than previously reflected in the literature. Largely Native American, SIS teachers and staff reinforced ideas of the students' ability to succeed. The living, teaching, and learning conditions were safe and nurturing. ORBS allowed Native Americans to share dance, language, dress, and tribal affiliations.; A <b>chronological</b> <b>chart</b> of Policies, Treaties, Laws, and Events identified social forces, federal policies, and other factors that contributed to changes in ORBS. The Civil Rights period of the 1960 s impacted ORBS; the American Indian Movement gained its strength during this era; pan-Indian identity was fostered in ORBS; and Congress passed numerous laws during the 1960 s and 1970 s that created educational programs for Indian students. This study presented a variety of subjective experiences. Between 1970 and 1980 students proactively elected to attend SIS, which offered a more enjoyable and pleasant educational environment for the majority of its students. For many, the ORBS became places of positive experience that reinforced their tribal identities and allowed for self-acceptance. This study differs from other works (Dixon and Trafzer 2006; Lomawaima 1994) in its approach and findings...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1937 It is {{the purpose}} of this thesis to present a course of study in general "Power Mechanics" which would enable the junior high school student to {{understand}} the elementary principles of power generation and distribution, and to appreciate the relationships of the use of power to our social order. The course is "general" in that it includes a study of all forms of power used by man, which naturally implies that emphasis has been placed on present forms of power generation and consumption. The course is "mechanical" in that the student studies the elementary principles of generation. He manipulates and makes models whenever it is deemed advisable. The procedure followed in the construction of this course of study was to: 1. Analyze the uses of power by society. 2. Make a historical study of the development of power in Man's progress through the ages. 3. Make an analysis of the characteristics of the newer courses of study. These characteristics are included as part of the thesis. 4. Set up aim, select and organize content and method in accordance with the newer courses of study and the general aims of education. The following aims were set up to guide the construction of the course of study: First, to orientate youth with the elementary principles of power generation and distribution and to show the relationship of power to civilized life. Second, to integrate the different phases of the industrial arts program and to integrate that program with other areas of the school curriculum. Third, to develop manipulative abilities which will serve as prevocational and leisure-time activities now and in the future. Fourth, to maintain the interest of the student: in curricular activities by helping him reconstruct the story of power and by pointing out to him the fact that the material covered in this course is definitely related to other subjects in his secondary school program. Fifth, to develop an appreciation of the mechanical refinements which are our heritage, and of the qualifications and characteristics of the men who made these refinements possible. In order to achieve the above aims, the following phases of the subject were presented: man and animal power; the principle of the wheel and axle and how it affects power generation and transmission; wind and water power; steam power; internal combustion engines; and electric power. The study includes only the elementary principles of these different phases of power, for it is believed that more technical information would be beyond the capacity of junior high school students. However, the application of the functional principles of these different phases of power will meet the aims stated, giving the student insight into many of the mysteries which surround his everyday life. At the close of each of the units, outcomes are given in an analyzed form, making it possible for the teacher to see the relationship of outcomes within a section; also the relation of that section to other sections and to the aims of general education. In addition to the general bibliography of reference material contributing to this thesis, the course of study carries a selected bibliography particularly useful in the teaching of such a course. A <b>chronological</b> <b>chart</b> of significant events in the progress of power is included as a supplement to the thesis. It is believed that the course of study exhibits a reasonable validity, especially in terms of its pioneering nature. The author realizes that experimentation and evaluation will be required; that the program is too new for a definite statement of values, and that future applications will undoubtedly develop additional criteria for revision...|$|E
40|$|Aristophanes’ appeal {{as a poet}} is universal, and his {{contribution}} to the literary world is important and obvious. The importance of Aristophanes to the historian, however, is much less clearly defined. The {{subject matter of the}} comedies is certainly clear enough, but its meaning has been much and, variously disputed. Aristophanes’ elusiveness is well summed up in one line of the Acharnians: "Did you understand what he said? No, by Apollo, I did not. " 1 The difficulty of determining the exact political views of Aristophanes has moved one writer to say: "A sympathetic reader of Aristophanes can hardly fail to perceive that, while his political and intellectual tendencies are well marked, his opinions, in so far as they color his comedies, are too indefinite to reward, or indeed to tolerate, analysis. " 2 Whether or not Aristophanes’ political opinions will reward analysis depends entirely on the analyst himself, but they will certainly tolerate analysis. While the subject is admittedly thread-bare, much can be learned if we approach it in the correct way. 3 This thesis proposes to show Aristophanes’ stand with respect to the politics of his city, Athens. To avoid the pitfall which is inevitable if we do not understand the true Athenian spirit, it is imperative that we obtain such an understanding, for Aristophanes was an "Athenian", if he was anything at all. For this reason, it will be unnecessary to enumerate Aristophanes’ views one by one. If we can see Aristophanes in his own environment, we need merely let him speak, and we will understand. In order to place Aristophanes into his environment, it has been thought necessary to present as complete a picture as is possible, within the scope of the thesis, of the conditions of the time, and of the historical facts which were important in their development. Some information which may appear irrelevant has been included partly because it provides a fuller picture of Aristophanes’ personality. For example, {{it is important to know}} what historical events preceded each comedy, even if the comedy does not contain any references to those events. Sometimes events or personalities become conspicuous by Aristophanes failure to mention them in his comedies. Similarly, it was felt that the origin and nature of comedy should be described in considerable detail. However, special points on which there are divergent opinions, have not been included because they add little or nothing to an understanding of Aristophanes' politics. The main idea has been to provide the casual reader of Aristophanes’ with a fairly reliable guide to what he must know in order to understand the poet’s political personality. Further, the information on comedy has been included for another reason. It helps to detract from too serious a view of Aristophanes as politician; for the tendency has often been to allow the poet to disappear in the politician. The thesis is presented under three main headings. The first treats of Aristophanes’ career as a whole and includes historical details surrounding the comedies. The next division shows how Aristophanes felt about various personalities and institutions of the democracy. Under the third heading comes a discussion of various aspects of the oligarchy and Aristophanes; views concerning them. In the same chapter, some attention is devoted to Aristophanes' relations with Alcibiades, a much neglected or perhaps underestimated facet of Aristophanes’ political life. The concluding chapter presents some philosophic aspects of Aristophanes’ politics and discusses the validity and influence of Aristophanes’ views generally. The relative justice or injustice of particular charges made by Aristophanes is not given much attention throughout the thesis, since this is not its purpose. Finally, it was felt that it would be difficult to sum up, in the conclusion, all of Aristophanes’ political views. The important thing is his political attitude in general, and the reader will come to a gradual understanding of this attitude during the course of the thesis. A map and a <b>chronological</b> <b>chart</b> have been added as appendices, and it is hoped that these will help the reader to follow more closely the events during the course of which Aristophanes wrote his plays. 1.
