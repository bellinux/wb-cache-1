25|$|The 2014 poetry book 'Spark In The Dark' is prefaced by Blake's epigram: “Without <b>Contraries</b> is no progression” - {{and this}} idea is {{implicit}} {{in many of the}} poems. The last part of the book, Spirit Songs, draws freely on British traditions like the Queen of the May at Beltane. By contrast, the final poem Queen of the Moon ('Queen of the vision revealed in the vine / And the leaves of the Shining Tree...') evokes the Brazilian Santo Daime tradition.|$|E
25|$|For we {{all agree}} that the most {{excellent}} man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their <b>contraries</b> are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), {{it is clear that the}} intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.|$|E

500|$|John Locke in his Essays on the Law of Nature {{argued that}} the {{widespread}} fact of human conscience allowed a philosopher to infer the necessary existence of objective moral laws that occasionally might contradict those of the state. Locke highlighted the metaethics problem of whether accepting a statement like [...] "follow your conscience" [...] supports subjectivist or objectivist conceptions of conscience as a guide in concrete morality, or as a spontaneous revelation of eternal and immutable principles to the individual: [...] "if conscience be a proof of innate principles, <b>contraries</b> may be innate principles; since some men with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid." [...] Thomas Hobbes likewise pragmatically noted that opinions formed {{on the basis of}} conscience with full and honest conviction, nevertheless should always be accepted with humility as potentially erroneous and not necessarily indicating absolute knowledge or truth. William Godwin expressed the view that conscience was a memorable consequence of the [...] "perception by men of every creed when the descend into the scene of busy life" [...] that they possess free will. Adam Smith considered that it was only by developing a critical conscience that we can ever see what relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions; or that we can ever make any proper comparison between our own interests and those of other people. John Stuart Mill believed that idealism about the role of conscience in government should be tempered with a practical realisation that few men in society are capable of directing their minds or purposes towards distant or unobvious interests, of disinterested regard for others, and especially for what comes after them, for the idea of posterity, of their country, or of humanity, whether grounded on sympathy or on a conscientious feeling. Mill held that certain amount of conscience, and of disinterested public spirit, may fairly be calculated on in the citizens of any community ripe for representative government, but that [...] "it would be ridiculous to expect such a degree of it, combined with such intellectual discernment, as would be proof against any plausible fallacy tending to make that which was for their class interest appear the dictate of justice and of the general good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also, {{traditional}} man's {{dissatisfaction with}} the post-mythical age expresses itself as {{a feeling of being}} [...] "torn and separate". In many mythologies, the lost mythical age was a Paradise, [...] "a paradoxical state in which the <b>contraries</b> exist side by side without conflict, and the multiplications form aspects of a mysterious Unity". The coincidentia oppositorum expresses a wish to recover the lost unity of the mythical Paradise, for it presents a reconciliation of opposites and the unification of diversity: ...|$|E
2500|$|Realist and constructivist {{theories}} are normally {{taken to be}} <b>contraries.</b> However, Karl Popper argued that a number statement such as [...] can be taken in two senses. In one sense it is irrefutable and logically true. In the second sense it is factually true and falsifiable. Another way of putting {{this is to say}} that a single number statement can express two propositions: one of which can be explained on constructivist lines; the other on realist lines.|$|E
5000|$|In Chinese, {{a similar}} phrase {{exists in the}} Analects of Confucius from 2nd to 4th century B.C.: [...] "Look not at what is <b>contrary</b> to propriety; listen not to what is <b>contrary</b> to propriety; speak not what is <b>contrary</b> to propriety; make no {{movement}} which is <b>contrary</b> to propriety" [...] (...)
