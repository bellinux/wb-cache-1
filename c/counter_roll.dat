40|$|Introduction: Astronauts {{experience}} {{disturbances in}} sensorimotor function after spaceflight {{during the initial}} introduction to a gravitational environment, especially after long-duration missions. Our goal {{is to develop a}} countermeasure based on vestibular stochastic resonance (SR) that could improve central interpretation of vestibular input and mitigate these risks. SR is a mechanism by which noise can assist and enhance the response of neural systems to relevant, imperceptible sensory signals. We have previously shown that imperceptible electrical stimulation of the vestibular system enhances balance performance while standing on an unstable surface. Methods: Eye movement data were collected from 10 subjects during variable radius centrifugation (VRC). Subjects performed 11 trials of VRC that provided equivalent tilt stimuli from otolith and other graviceptor input without the normal concordant canal cues. Bipolar stochastic electrical stimulation, in the range of 0 - 1500 microamperes, was applied to the vestibular system using a constant current stimulator through electrodes placed over the mastoid process behind the ears. In the VRC paradigm, subjects were accelerated to 216 deg. /s. After the subjects no longer sensed rotation, the chair oscillated along a track at 0. 1 Hz to provide tilt stimuli of 10 deg. Eye movements were recorded for 6 cycles while subjects fixated on a target in darkness. Ocular <b>counter</b> <b>roll</b> (OCR) movement was calculated from the eye movement data during periods of chair oscillations. Results: Preliminary analysis of the data revealed that 9 of 10 subjects showed an average increase of 28 % in the magnitude of OCR responses to the equivalent tilt stimuli while experiencing vestibular SR. The signal amplitude at which performance was maximized was in the range of 100 - 900 microamperes. Discussion: These results indicate that stochastic electrical stimulation of the vestibular system can improve otolith specific responses. This will {{have a significant impact on}} development of vestibular SR delivery systems to aid recovery of function in astronauts after long-duration spaceflight or in people with balance disorders...|$|E

Between saccades, the angular velocities of the head are approximately two times lower than those of he thorax, and lie mostly in the range of 0 - 100 °/s for any rotation (yaw, pitch, and roll). These velocities are low enough to keep the visual blur attributable to rotation limited.

40|$|A {{recently}} developed high-speed digital correlator is especially {{well suited for}} processing readings of a passive microwave polarimeter. This circuit computes the autocorrelations of, and the cross-correlations among, data in four digital input streams representing samples of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of two intermediate-frequency (IF) signals, denoted A and B, that are generated in heterodyne reception of two microwave signals. The IF signals arriving at the correlator input terminals have been digitized to three levels (- 1, 0, 1) at a sampling rate up to 500 MHz. Two bits (representing sign and magnitude) are needed to represent the instantaneous datum in each input channel; hence, eight bits are needed to represent the four input signals during any given cycle of the sampling clock. The accumulation (integration) time for the correlation is programmable in increments of 2 (exp 8) cycles of the sampling clock, up {{to a maximum of}} 2 (exp 24) cycles. The basic functionality of the correlator is embodied in 16 correlation slices, each of which contains identical logic circuits and counters (see figure). The first stage of each correlation slice is a logic gate that computes one of the desired correlations (for example, the autocorrelation of the I component of A or the negative of the cross-correlation of the I component of A and the Q component of B). The sampling of the output of the logic gate output is controlled by the sampling-clock signal, and an 8 -bit counter increments in every clock cycle when the logic gate generates output. The most significant bit of the 8 -bit counter is sampled by a 16 -bit counter with a clock signal at 2 (exp 8) the frequency of the sampling clock. The 16 -bit counter is incremented every time the 8 -bit <b>counter</b> <b>rolls</b> over...|$|R

50|$|A skeg is {{employed}} {{in the type of}} kayak used on more open water such as the sea. Its purpose and use are rather {{different from those of the}} surfing skeg. In the kayak, the amount of exposure of the skeg to the water, and also its effect on the position of the boat's centre of lateral resistance (CLR), is freely adjustable by the crew. The adjustment varies the degree to which the wind affects the boat - that is, the amount of lateral movement the wind can cause by impacting the upper parts of the boat and the crew. In more conventional calculations, this would be the centre of effort of the sail area (CE). In still water, where the wind is pushing the boat sideways, a contrary force (lateral resistance) develops, resisting that movement. If the central points of the application of those two forces coincide, the boat moves steadily sideways. Otherwise, it rotates in the horizontal plane, until they are in line. By varying the CLR, it is possible to better control the boat's attitude towards the wind and waves. Irregular flowing movement of the water complicates the issue, however. This link explains the subtleties of the kayak skeg. They may be made of wood, fiberglass or aluminum. Some are deployed using internal cables, but others use external ropes and bungee cord.Typically, these are retractable, and they are not a rudder. If properly configured (e.g., use of street sign aluminum in a narrow box that extends through the hull) they will not flex, and will greatly decrease and <b>counter</b> pitch, <b>Roll</b> and yaw, like a centerboard on a sailboat, when the craft is moving.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{theoretical}} analysis {{has been presented}} for the calendering process of incompressible Newtonian and non-Newtonian materials when they pass through the small gap between two <b>counter</b> rotating <b>rolls.</b> The calendering phenomena of a material ?ow betweentwo co-rotating rolls to produce sheets of speci?c thicknessand ?nal appearance is an important process in many industries, such as the plastics, paper, rubber and steel industries {{for the production of}} rolled sheets of speci?c thickness and ?nal appearance. In particular, the calendering of molten polymers is a process for the production of continuous sheet or ?lm by squeezing the melt between a pair of heated counter-rotating rolls. A bench-top apparatus simulates the process. In this study two types of calendering processes are considered. In the ?rst process, a molten material is transformed into a sheet by passing through a pair of rollers, whereas in second process a uniform ?lm of liquid is deposited on a moving sheet. These two processes are quite similar, there is a convergingdiverging character to the kinematics, and we can expect the dynamics to be similar to that described in the ?rst process. The major di?erence is in the character of the separation region, where the material splits and adheres to both moving surfaces. In the ?rst process, it is assumed that the material separates clearly from the roll, whereas, in a second process, it is assumed that the material evenly wets both the roll and the sheet. The lubrication approximation theory (LAT) is outlined together with its calculations for viscoelastic and viscoplastic materials. Measurements of the gap between the roll surfaces, velocity and pressure pro?les, ?lm thickness, roll-separating force and power input to the rolls were made for a known roll speed and external load. The control of these engineering parameters are of excessive signi?cance during the manufacture process.

5000|$|The {{flight crew}} testified {{that they had}} not engaged the flaps, and the NTSB {{concluded}} that [...] "if the flightcrew's recollections are accurate," [...] the slat extension must have been caused by a mechanical failure or defect. However, the NTSB ultimately concluded that the flight crew was probably attempting to use 2º of flaps at cruising speed: While cruising at Mach 0.816 and 39,000 feet pressure altitude and with the autopilot controlling the aircraft, an attempt was made to extend 2º of trailing edge flaps independently of the leading edge slats, probably in an effort to improve aircraft performance When retraction of the flaps was ordered, the Number 7 leading edge slat failed to retract, causing the uncommanded roll to the right. The Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the isolation of the No. 7 leading edge slat in the fully or partially extended position after an extension of the Nos. 2, 3, 6, and 7 leading edge slats and the subsequent retraction of the Nos. 2, 3, and 6 slats, and the captain's untimely flight control inputs to <b>counter</b> the <b>roll</b> resulting from the slat asymmetry. Contributing to the cause was a preexisting misalignment of the No. 7 slat which, when combined with the cruise condition airloads, precluded retraction of that slat. After eliminating all probable individual or combined mechanical failures, or malfunctions which could lead to slat extension, the Safety Board determined that the extension of the slats {{was the result of the}} flightcrew's manipulation of the flap/slat controls. Contributing to the captain's untimely use of the flight controls was distraction due probably to his efforts to rectify the source of the control problem. [...] Captain Gibson appealed the NTSB's findings, first to the NTSB itself, and then to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

40|$|A {{study of}} fully {{developed}} plane turbulent channel flow subject to spanwise system rotation through direct numerical simulations is presented. In order to study both {{the influence of}} the Reynolds number and spanwise rotation on channel flow, the Reynolds number Re = U_b h/ν is varied from a low 3000 to a moderate 31 600 and the rotation number Ro = 2 Ω h/U_b is varied from 0 to 2. 7, where U_b is the mean bulk velocity, h the channel half gap and Ω the system rotation rate. The mean streamwise velocity profile displays also at higher Re the characteristic linear part with a slope near to 2 Ω and a corresponding linear part in the profiles of the production and dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy appears. With increasing Ro a distinct unstable side with large spanwise and wall-normal Reynolds stresses and a stable side with much weaker turbulence develops in the channel. The flow starts to relaminarize on the stable side of the channel and persisting turbulent-laminar patterns appear at higher Re. If Ro is further increased the flow on the stable side becomes laminar-like while at yet higher Ro the whole flow relaminarizes, although the calm periods might be disrupted by repeating bursts of turbulence, as explained by Brethouwer (2016). The influence of the Reynolds number is considerable, in particular on the stable side of the channel where velocity fluctuations are stronger and the flow relaminarizes less quickly at higher Re. Visualizations and statistics show that at Ro= 0. 15 and 0. 45 large-scale structures and large <b>counter</b> rotating streamwise <b>roll</b> cells develop on the unstable side. These become less noticeable and eventually vanish when Ro raises, especially at higher Re. At high Ro, the largest energetic structures are larger at lower Re...|$|R
40|$|The tyre {{lateral force}} is a {{function}} of side slip and camber. While the lateral force due to side slip is {{the main part of the}} total cornering force, it saturates at a certain level of side slip angle even when the available tyre-road friction has not been fully utilised. In such a situation, the use of an appropriate extra camber could increase the safety, stability, and manoeuvrability of the car. This research serves as a further step to put the theory of variable caster steering into eect. The key idea of the theory is actively varying the caster to produce the required extra camber in a good fashion. In this investigation, the theory was examined in a specic case: developing a variable caster scheme to counteract roll camber - a phenomenon that generally limits the tyre lateral force and hence the maximum lateral acceleration of the car. By applying the variable caster scheme, the lateral force is increased. Therefore, the lateral grip capacity of the car is expanded. The benet of the variable caster was also further exploited to improve the steering returnability during low speed cornering. The theory of variable caster steering began with the development of road steering wheel kinematics. In order to do that, a number of coordinate systems was introduced to suciently describe the steering motion of a road steering wheel. The homogeneous transformation was then utilised to map coordinates between the systems. By doing so, the kinematics was developed. It was then used in two ways. The rst was to determine the camber, which is the orientation of the wheel, as a function of steering axis orientation, vehicle motion, suspension geometry, and steering angle, for a cornering car. The other was for developing a novel method to determine kingpin moment which aects the returnability of the steering wheels during low speed cornering. Then a rollable vehicle model, which is capable of capturing important characteristics of a turning car such as load transfer and roll motion, was constructed. The Magic Formula was used for tyre force modelling to take the camber contribution and the non-linear characteristics of the tyre into account. MATLAB/Simulink was used to simulate the dynamic response of the vehicle to steering input. The steering wheel kinematics and the dynamics model of the car were later validated using both multi-body and experimental data. More specically, the validation of the wheel kinematics was done by a road steering wheel model built in ADAMS software; the dynamic vehicle model was validated using data from eld tests and from a full car model constructed in the CarSim environment. A kinematics analysis of the camber function determined earlier was carried out. On the basis of the analysis, a scheme of varying the caster with the primary aim of <b>countering</b> the <b>roll</b> camber was proposed. The dynamic responses of the vehicle to dierent steering inputs were examined to evaluate its dynamic performance with and without the variable caster strategy. The simulation results show that the roll camber phenomenon, for the caster-controlled car, is reduced signicantly. The associated lateral acceleration and yaw rate increase without compromising other handling characteristics. The variable caster strategy, therefore, provides a more manoeuvrable car with expanded turning capacity compared to the passive car. To take advantage of the variable caster, a caster conguration that can improve the returnability of the steering wheels in low speed cornering manoeuvres was also suggested. Using the novel method for determining the kingpin moment, we showed that the caster conguration provides a better steering returnability during low speed cornering...|$|R
