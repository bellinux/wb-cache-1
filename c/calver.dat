30|$|There was {{a gradual}} {{increase}} in milk yield from parity 1 to 4 in Jersey cattle. This suggests that milk yield increases as parity proceeds because large cows produce more milk than small cows due to large body size and increased udder development {{that comes with}} repeated pregnancies as well as full development of tissues of the udder. Also, multiparous cows reach their peak earlier in the lactation than first parity cows and consume more feed, eat larger meals and drink more water therefore their persistency will be longer {{than that of the}} first <b>calvers</b> leading to less milk yield produced by first <b>calvers.</b> The milk yield was also lower in early parities because the feed that was provided to the heifers was also channeled to their growth as they were still growing. As the parities proceeded, milk yield increased because the feed requirements for growth were declining (Keown and Everett 1986).|$|R
6000|$|In {{the course}} of the {{dredging}} of the Porcupine, it was frequently found that, while few objects of interest were brought up within the dredge, many living creatures came up sticking to the outside of the dredge-bag, and even to the first few fathoms of the dredge-rope. The mouth of the dredge doubtless rapidly filled with mud, and thus the things it should have brought up were shut out. To remedy this inconvenience Captain <b>Calver</b> devised an arrangement not unlike that employed by the coral- fishers. He fastened half a dozen swabs, such as are used for drying decks, to the dredge. A swab is something like what a birch-broom would be if its twigs were made of long, coarse, hempen yarns. These dragged along after the dredge over the surface of the mud, and entangled the creatures living there--multitudes of which, twisted up in the strands of the swabs, were brought to the surface with the dredge. A further improvement was made by attaching a long iron bar {{to the bottom of the}} dredge bag, and fastening large bunches of teased-out hemp to the end of this bar. These [...] "tangles" [...] bring up immense quantities of such animals as have long arms, or spines, or prominences which readily become caught in the hemp, but they are very destructive to the fragile organisms which they imprison; and, now that the trawl can be successfully worked at the greatest depths, it may be expected to supersede them; at least, wherever the ground is soft enough to permit of trawling.|$|E

I had even had a glimpse of some of these treasures, for I had seen, the year before, with Prof. Sars, the forms which I have already mentioned dredged by his son at a depth of 300 to 400 fathoms off the Loffoten Islands. I propounded my views to my fellow-labourer, and we discussed the subject many times over our microscopes.

One hundred fifty reproductive records of 45 cross bred (Friesian- Kenana) cows were chosen from the dairy herd of the University. of Khartoum. farm, located at Shambat, Khartoum North. The consulted records covered a period of five years (2005 - 2010) and six parities. The data pertaining to calving season and parity order were compiled and analyzed statistically to assess their impact on calving interval, days open and number of services per conception. The calving seasons were partioned to three groups of four months each: dry summer calving season (March –June),wet summer calving season (July –October) and winter calving season (Nov-Feb). The results indicated that neither the calving season nor the parity order and their interaction exerted any significant effect on calving interval. The overall mean of calving intervals was (428. 6 days). The parity order also did not influence the calving interval significantly. The longest calving interval (442. 2 days) was recorded in the 4 th parity, while the shortest calving interval (411. 9 days) was recorded in the 5 th parity. The interaction between calving season and parity order also demonstrated non significant effect on the calving interval. The parity order and season of calving did not affect days open.
