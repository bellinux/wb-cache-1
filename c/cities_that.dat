They also state that the proposals have never gone from being mere declarations.|$|E
5|$|Calakmul {{has a long}} {{occupational}} {{history and}} excavations have revealed evidence from the Middle Preclassic right through to the Postclassic. The causeway network that linked Calakmul with the cities of El Mirador, Nakbe and El Tintal suggest strong political links between the four <b>cities</b> <b>that</b> may have begun in the Preclassic, when both Calakmul and El Mirador were important cities, and continued into the Classic period when Calakmul itself was the most powerful city in the region.

As of 2001, the two cities have been sending high school age students on a three-week-long exchange to gain more knowledge about their differences in society and culture.|$|E

5|$|Seattle {{was one of}} {{the major}} <b>cities</b> <b>that</b> benefited from {{programs}} such as the WPA, CCC, UCL, and PWA.

However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction industries as Los Angeles prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building contracts that rivaled New York City and Chicago, but lost to LA as well. Seattle’s eastern farm land faded due to Oregon’s and the Midwest’s, forcing people into town.|$|E

A significant Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.|$|E
