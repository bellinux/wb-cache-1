2500|$|At Yale, Collins {{worked under}} the {{direction}} of Sherman Weissman, and in 1984 the two published a paper, [...] "Directional Cloning of DNA Fragments at a Large distance From an Initial Probe: a Circularization Method". The method described was named chromosome jumping, to emphasize the contrast with an older and much more time-consuming method of copying DNA fragments called <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Chromosome jumping {{is a tool}} of {{molecular}} biology that {{is used in the}} physical mapping of genomes. It is related to several other tools used for the same purpose, including <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{chromosome}} jumping, the DNA {{of interest}} is identified, cut into fragments with restriction enzymes, and circularised (the {{beginning and end of}} each fragment are joined together to form a circular loop). From a known sequence, a primer is designed to sequence across the circularised junction. This primer is used to jump 100 kb-300 kb intervals: a sequence 100 kb away would have come near the known sequence on circularisation. Thus, sequences not reachable by <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> can be sequenced. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> can be used from the new jump position (in either direction) to look for gene-like sequences, or additional jumps can be used to progress further along the chromosome.|$|E
40|$|Using <b>chromosome</b> {{jumping and}} <b>walking</b> and {{restriction}} fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, we have defined the region which must contain the cystic fibrosis gene. DNA segments spanning approximately 250 kb {{in the direction}} of the gene were isolated and used to identify several new polymorphisms informative in cystic fibrosis families. These RFLPs include a highly polymorphic, CA/GT repeat, and a 10 bp insertion uncovered using the polymerase chain reaction. By analyzing a family with a recombination near the gene, we can exclude this region as containing the mutation. Data on the extent of linkage disequilibrium of these markers provides additional information on where the gene is located...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of a gene coding for bombinin-like peptides (BLP) in Bombina orientalis was determined. It comprises two exons separated by a 1337 bp intron. Exon 1 codes for the signal peptide, while exon 2 contains the genetic information for BLP- 7 and a bombinin H-type peptide (GH- 2). The promoter region contains putative recognition sites for nuclear factors, such as NF-IL 6 and NF-kappaB. The analysis of the {{structure of}} this gene, compared with that of the previously reported BLP- 3 gene sequence, suggests the occurrence of a gene duplication event, rather than an alternative splicing mechanism, which leads to the generation of both inter- and intra-families variability in this class of cytolytic peptides. Furthermore, <b>walking</b> <b>chromosome</b> analysis indicates that this gene family is not densely clustered. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A large region {{containing}} the extra sex combs (esc) gene of Drosophila has been cloned by microdissection from polytene <b>chromosomes</b> and chromosomal <b>walking.</b> Within this DNA, the segment comprising the esc gene has been narrowed down in several steps. First, a deletion of the esc+ gene, Df(2 L) esc 10, defined {{a region of}} 380 kb. Then, a duplication carrying the esc+ gene, Dp(2; 2) GYL, and a deletion not eliminating esc+, Df(2 L) prd 1. 7. 20, further reduced this region to 160 kb. Finally, because esc transcripts {{are expected to be}} present in follicles but absent in adult males, mapping of follicle and adult male transcripts limited the esc region to ˜ 10 kb. Rigorous proof that this DNA contained the esc+ gene was obtained by P-element-mediated transformation. We conclude that the 12 kb of DNA used for transformation include the esc+ gene as well as all flanking sequences required for its proper regulation in the female germ line...|$|R
50|$|Chromosome jumping is used {{to bypass}} regions {{difficult}} to clone, such as those containing repetitive DNA, that cannot be easily mapped by <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking,</b> and is useful in moving along a chromosome rapidly {{in search of a}} particular gene.|$|E
50|$|Before 1980 {{very few}} human genes had been {{identified}} as disease loci until advances in DNA technology gave rise to positional cloning and reverse genetics. Discovering disease loci using old forward genetic techniques was a very long and difficult process {{and much of the}} work went into mapping and cloning the gene through association studies and <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b> Cystic fibrosis however demonstrates how the process of forward genetics can elucidate a human genetic disorder. Genetic-linkage studies were able to map the disease loci in cystic fibrosis to chromosome 7 by using protein markers. Afterward, <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> and jumping techniques were used to identify the gene and sequence it. Forward genetics can work for single-gene-single phenotype situations but in more complicated diseases like cancer, reverse genetics is often used instead.|$|E
5000|$|That way, {{the short}} {{part of the}} long DNA that is {{sequence}}d keeps [...] "walking" [...] along the sequence. The method {{can be used to}} sequence entire chromosomes (thus, <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking).</b> A different method with the same purpose which becomes more popular for large-scale sequencing (e.g., the Human Genome Project) is shotgun sequencing.|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} cloned a yeast DNA fragment that, when fused {{with the}} bacterial lacZ promoter, produced O 6 -methylguanine DNA repair methyltransferase (MGT 1) activity and alkylation resistance in Escherichia coli (Xiao et al., EMBO J. 10, 2179). Here {{we describe the}} isolation of the entire MGT 1 gene and its promoter by sequence directed <b>chromosome</b> integration and <b>walking.</b> The MGT 1 promoter was fused to a lacZ reporter gene to study how MGT 1 expression is controlled. MGT 1 is not induced by alkylating agents, nor is it induced by other DNA damaging agents such as UV light. However, deletion analysis defined an upstream repression sequence, whose removal dramatically increased basal level gene expression. The polypeptide deduced from the complete MGT 1 sequence contained 18 more N-terminal amino acids than that previously determined; the role of these 18 amino acids, which harbored a potential nuclear localization signal, was explored. The MGT 1 gene was also cloned under the GAL 1 promoter, so that MTase levels could be manipulated, and we examined MGT 1 function in a MTase deficient yeast strain (mgt 1). The extent of resistance to both alkylation-induced mutation and cell killing directly correlated with MTase levels. Finally we show that mgt 1 S. cerevisiae has a higher rate of spontaneous mutation than wild type cells, indicating that there is an endogenous source of DNA alkylation damage in these eukaryotic cells and that one of the in vivo roles of MGT 1 is to limit spontaneous mutations...|$|R
50|$|The {{strategy}} of <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> {{is based on}} the assumption that it is difficult and time consuming to find DNA markers that are physically close to a gene of interest. Recent technological developments invalidate this assumption for many species. As a result, the mapping paradigm has now changed such that one first isolates one or more DNA marker(s) at a physical distance from the targeted gene that is less than the average insert size of the genomic library being used for clone isolation. The DNA marker is then used to screen the library and isolate (or 'land' on) the clone containing the gene, without any need for <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> and its associated problems. Chromosome landing, together with the technology that has made it possible, is likely to become the main strategy by which map-based cloning is applied to isolate both major genes and genes underlying quantitative traits in plant species.|$|E
5000|$|At Yale, Collins {{worked under}} the {{direction}} of Sherman Weissman, and in 1984 the two published a paper, [...] "Directional Cloning of DNA Fragments at a Large distance From an Initial Probe: a Circularization Method". The method described was named chromosome jumping, to emphasize the contrast with an older and much more time-consuming method of copying DNA fragments called <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Chromosomal landing is {{a genetic}} {{technique}} {{used to identify}} and isolate clones in a genetic library. Chromosomal landing reduces the problem of analyzing large, and/or highly repetitive genomes by minimizing the need for <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b> It {{is based on the}} principle that the expected average between-marker distances can be smaller than the average insert length of a clone library containing the gene of interest.|$|E
50|$|One major use of genomic {{libraries}} is hierarchichal shotgun sequencing, {{which is}} also called top-down, map-based or clone-by-clone sequencing. This strategy {{was developed in the}} 1980s for sequencing whole genomes before high throughput techniques for sequencing were available. Individual clones from genomic libraries can be sheared into smaller fragments, usually 500bp to 1000bp, which are more manageable for sequencing. Once a clone from a genomic library is sequenced, the sequence can be used to screen the library for other clones containing inserts which overlap with the sequenced clone. Any new overlapping clones can then be sequenced forming a contig. This technique, called <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking,</b> can be exploited to sequence entire chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|Tests {{used for}} this purpose include cross-species hybridization, {{identification}} of unmethylated CpG islands, exon trapping, direct cDNA selection, computer analysis of DNA sequence, mutation screening in affected individuals, and tests of gene expression. For genomes in which the regions of genetic polymorphisms are known, positional cloning involves identifying polymorphisms that flank the mutation. This process requires that DNA fragments from the closest known genetic marker are progressively cloned and sequenced, getting closer to the mutant allele with each new clone. This process produces a contig map of the locus and is known as <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b> With the completion of genome sequencing projects such as the Human Genome Project, modern positional cloning can use ready-made contigs from the genome sequence databases directly.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the full}} {{sequences}} of the BAC contigs is not known, their orientations relative {{to one another}} are known. There are several methods for deducing this order and selecting the BACs {{that make up a}} tiling path. The general strategy involves identifying the positions of the clones relative to one another and then selecting the least number of clones required to form a contiguous scaffold that covers the entire area of interest. The order of the clones is deduced by determining {{the way in which they}} overlap. Overlapping clones can be identified in several ways. A small radioactively or chemically labeled probe containing a sequence-tagged site (STS) can be hybridized onto a microarray upon which the clones are printed. In this way, all the clones that contain a particular sequence in the genome are identified. The end of one of these clones can then be sequenced to yield a new probe and the process repeated in a method called <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days, <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> from genetically linked DNA markers {{was used to}} {{identify}} and clone disease genes. However, the large molecular distance between known markers and the gene of interest was complicating the cloning process. In 1987, a human chromosome jumping library was constructed to clone the cystic fibrosis gene. Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease affecting 1 in 2000 Caucasians. This was the first disease in which {{the usefulness of the}} jumping libraries was demonstrated. Met oncogene was a marker tightly linked to the cystic fibrosis gene on human chromosome 7, and the library was screened for a jumping clone starting at this marker. The cystic fibrosis gene was determined to localize 240kb downstream of the met gene. Chromosome jumping helped reduce the mapping “steps” and bypass the highly repetitive regions in the mammalian genome. Chromosome jumping also allowed the production of probes required for faster diagnosis of this and other diseases.|$|E
50|$|The DNA {{is first}} digested with a random {{digestion}} method, commonly by cutting the DNA with restriction enzymes (enzymes that cut DNA). A partial restriction digest cuts {{only some of}} the restriction sites, resulting in overlapping DNA fragment lengths. The DNA fragments are put into individual plasmid vectors and grown inside bacteria. Once in the bacteria the plasmid is copied as the bacteria divides. To determine if a useful gene is present on a particular fragment the bacterial library is screened for the desired phenotype. If the phenotype is detected then {{it is possible that the}} bacteria contains the target gene. If the gene does not have a detectable phenotype or a DNA library does not contain the correct gene, other methods can be used to isolate it. If the position of the gene can be determined using molecular markers then <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> is one way to isolate the correct DNA fragment. If the gene expresses close homology to a known gene in another species, then it could be isolated by searching for genes in the library that closely match the known gene.|$|E
50|$|Yeast {{artificial}} chromosomes (YACs) {{are genetically}} engineered chromosomes {{derived from the}} DNA of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is then ligated into a bacterial plasmid. By inserting large fragments of DNA, from 100-1000 kb, the inserted sequences can be cloned and physically mapped using a process called <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b> This is the process that was initially used for the Human Genome Project, however due to stability issues, YACs were abandoned {{for the use of}} Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC). Beginning with the initial research of the Rankin et al., Strul et al., and Hsaio et al., the inherently fragile chromosome was stabilized by discovering the necessary autonomously replicating sequence (ARS); a refined YAC utilizing this data was described in 1983 by Murray et al. The primary components of a YAC are the ARS, centromere, and telomeres from S. cerevisiae. Additionally, selectable marker genes, such as antibiotic resistance and a visible marker, are utilized to select transformed yeast cells. Without these sequences, the chromosome will not be stable during extracellular replication, and would not be distinguishable from colonies without the vector.|$|E
30|$|Based on conserved {{motif of}} certain enzymes, <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> {{provided}} a new method to identify functional enzymes [44]. A functional P 450 monooxygenase from Rhodococcus sp. ECU 0066 was identified by <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> by several rounds of PCR, with capability in the enantioselective oxidation of sulfides [45].|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel PCR method, termed SiteFinding-PCR, for gene or <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b> The PCR was primed by a SiteFinder at a low temperature, and then the target {{molecules}} were amplified exponentially with gene-specific and SiteFinder primers, and screened out by another gene-specific primer and a vector primer. However, non-target molecules could not be amplified exponentially owing to the suppression effect of stem–loop structure {{and could not be}} screened out. This simple method proved to be efficient, reliable, inexpensive and time-saving, and may be suitable for the molecules for which gene-specific primers are available. More importantly, large DNA fragments can be obtained easily using this method. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of SiteFinding-PCR, we employed this method to do <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> and obtained 16 positive results from 17 samples...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a self-formed adaptor PCR (termed SEFA PCR) {{which can be}} used for <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b> Most of the amplified flanking sequences were longer than 2. 0 kb, and some were as long as 6. 0 kb. SEFA PCR is simple and efficient and should have broad applications in the isolation of unknown sequences in complex genomes...|$|E
40|$|Yeast {{artificial}} chromosomes (YACs; 1) {{are rapidly}} becoming the major cloning system to study eukaryotic genomes by physical mapping and <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> projects (1 - 6).

40|$|Abstract—The {{selective}} {{suppression of}} the polymerase chain reaction and methods based upon it (construction ofcDNA libraries from low amounts of biological material, subtractive hybridization and differential display of mRNA, fast cloning of full-size cDNA, <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking,</b> cloning in vitro, and others) are reviewed. These methods display a high effectiveness and, taken together, enable intricate DNA analyses to be performed—from the search for nontrivial sequences to the total sequencing of the corresponding genes.

40|$|For many agronomically {{important}} plant genes, {{only their}} position on a genetic map is known. In {{the absence of an}} efficient transposon tagging system, such genes have to be isolated by map-based cloning. In bread wheat Triticum aestivum, the genome is hexaploid, has a size of 1. 6 × 1010 bp, and contains more than 80 % of repetitive sequences. So far, this genome complexity has not allowed <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> and positional cloning. Here, we demonstrate that <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones is possible in the diploid wheat Triticum monococcum (Am genome). BAC end sequences were mostly repetitive and could not be used for the first walking step. New probes corresponding to rare low-copy sequences were efficiently identified by low-pass DNA sequencing of the BACs. Two walking steps resulted in a physical contig of 450 kb on chromosome 1 AmS. Genetic mapping of the probes derived from the BAC contig demonstrated perfect colinearity between the physical map of T. monococcum and the genetic map of bread wheat on chromosome 1 AS. The contig genetically spans the Lr 10 leaf rust disease resistance locus in bread wheat, with 0. 13 centimorgans corresponding to 300 kb between the closest flanking markers. Comparison of the genetic to physical distances has shown large variations within 350 kb of the contig. The physical contig can now be used for the isolation of the orthologous regions in bread wheat. Thus, subgenome <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> in wheat can produce large physical contigs and saturate genomic regions to support positional cloning...|$|E
40|$|A <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> {{method was}} {{improved}} in this work. The new method was named as nonspecific primer anchored PCR (NPA-PCR). Nested gene specific primers were designed {{based on the}} known region and long random primer using degeneracy oligonucleotides for nonspecific anchoring. Annealing temperatures were varied to control the priming. Target sequences were obtained by PCR with random primer and gene-specific primer. Nonspecific sequence with long random primers at both ends formed stem loop structure due to inverted terminal repeats. The method was employed to isolate a gene with newly-isolated actinomycin producing strain Streptomyces setonii Z-L- 22. A 0. 77 kb fragment of actinomycin synthetase gene cluster was isolated from the strain. The fragments of 1474 bp and 701 bp were obtained, respectively, at {{the up and down}} streams of known fragment through the this method. NCBI Blast analysis showed that the walking sequence and the known sequence were located conjointly in the same cluster gene. It demonstrated that the result was correct and this technique could be useful and efficient for <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> or isolating the gene...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{restriction}} fragment length polymorphism-based strategy {{to analyze the}} distribution of meiotic crossover events throughout specific genetic intervals. We have isolated 64 recombinant chromosomes carrying independent meiotic crossover events in the genetic interval eth- 1 -un- 2 on linkage group I of Neurospora crassa. Thirty-eight crossover events were physically mapped with reference to a 200 -kb region cloned by <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking,</b> using N. crassa λ and cosmid libraries. Crossovers were homogeneously distributed at intervals of 5. 0 +/- 2. 3 kb along the entire cloned interval. The ratio of physical to genetic distance appears to be higher in the region than in the overall N. crassa genome, suggesting that recombinational activity is less in large chromosomes than in small ones. The present work provides a method for defining the centromeric-telomeric orientation of single cloned DNA fragments. Their physical distance can also be estimated with respect to linked loci, provided that crossover events are distributed homogeneously in the interval. This strategy overcomes typical difficulties in defining the position and direction of <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> steps on conventional linkage maps...|$|E

A shortened fragment (1. 8 kb) containing acyA was subcloned with pIJ 350.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies we reported {{the identification of}} several AFLP, RAPD and RFLP molecular markers linked to apospory in Paspalum notatum. The objective of this work was to sequence these markers, obtain their flanking regions by <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> and perform an in silico mapping analysis in rice and maize. The methylation status of two apospory-related sequences was also assessed using methylation-sensitive RFLP experiments. Fourteen molecular markers were analyzed and several protein-coding sequences were identified. Copy number estimates and RFLP linkage analysis showed that the sequence PnMAI 3 displayed 2 - 4 copies per genome and linkage to apospory. Extension of this marker by <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> revealed an additional protein-coding sequence mapping in silico in the apospory-syntenic regions of rice and maize. Approximately 5 kb corresponding to different markers were characterized through the global sequencing procedure. A more refined analysis based on sequence information indicated synteny with segments of chromosomes 2 and 12 of rice and chromosomes 3 and 5 of maize. Two loci associated with apomixis locus were tested in methylation-sensitive RFLP experiments using genomic DNA extracted from leaves. Although both target sequences were methylated no methylation polymorphisms associated with the mode of reproduction were detected...|$|E

40|$|Dozens of PCR-based {{methods are}} {{available}} for <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> from a known sequence to an unknown region. These methods are of three types: inverse PCR, ligation-mediated PCR and randomly primed PCR. However, none of them has been generally applied for this purpose, because they are either difficult or inefficient. Here we describe a simple and efficient PCR strategy—T-linker-specific ligation PCR (T-linker PCR) for gene or <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b> The strategy amplifies the template molecules in three steps. First, genomic DNA is digested with 3 ′ overhang enzymes. Secondly, primed by a specific primer, a strand of the target molecule is replicated by Taq DNA polymerase and a single A tail is generated on the 3 ′ unknown end of the target molecule, and then a 3 ′ overhang-T linker (named T-linker) is specifically ligated onto the target. Thirdly, the target is amplified by two rounds of nested PCR with specific primers and T-linker primers. T-linker PCR significantly improves the existing PCR methods for walking because it uses specific T/A ligation instead of arbitrary ligation or random annealing. To show the feasibility and efficiency of T-linker PCR, we have exploited this method to identify vector DNA or T-DNA insertions in transgenic plants...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Fruit ripening is a unique process in plant developmental biology. Ripening patterns, based on respiratory behavior of fruit, are classified into two groups: climacteric and non-climacteric. Tomato is an example of climacteric fruit which are characterized by a dramatic increase in respiration accompanied by marked production of ethylene during ripening. rin (ripening inhibitor) is a single locus tomato mutation showing non-climacteric development which essentially arrests ripening at the mature green stage. To isolate the rin gene, a map-based cloning strategy was used. This strategy includes genetic mapping, physical mapping, and <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking.</b> DNA markers in the region of rin were used to screen a tomato YAC library to obtain candidate YAC clones. Candidate YACs were recovered by others and here physical mapping, fine mapping, and <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> have been conducted. For <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking,</b> a candidate rin-containing YAC, designated Yrinl 2 was subcloned and ligated into a cosmid vector to make a representative library. This library was screened with four markers (YrinllR, Yrinl 2 R, Shcl, and Shc 7) tightly linked to the rin locus. Positives recovered by YrinllR, Shcl, and Shc 7 were aligned and span around 30 kb in a cosmid contig. Two additional cosmid clones obtained by cosmid library screening, 5 Bl 2 and llA 5, were used as probes for the investigation of RFLPs between RinlRin and rinlrin. No polymorphisms were detected indicating if the mutation resulting in rin is a chromosome rearrangement, such as a deletion, it must be within a very narrow region around the rin locus. Physical mapping was conducted to estimate the kilobase distance among four DNA markers (Yrin 2 R, YrinlIR, 45 Dll, and pYAC 4 R) on Yrinl 2. A physical map around the rin locus was generated suggesting a maximum of 110 kb between Yrin 2 R and pYAC 4 R of which 30 kb was spanned by <b>chromosome</b> <b>walking</b> using the Yrinl 2 cosmid library. In attempting to isolate a tomato YAC end as a marker more closely linked to rin than any currently designed from the YAC vector adjacent to the tomatok insert terminus. However, this clone seems to be an artifact recovered by false signals from either bacterial DNA or yeast genomic DNA. In summary, a tomato YACclone (Yrinl 2) which we expect to contain the tomato rin locus has been physically mapped, and construction of a cosmid contig representing the tomato DNA sequences contained in this high molecular weight clone has been initiated...|$|E
