5|$|Indiana Jones is {{distributed}} by one entity, Paramount, but owned by another, Lucasfilm. The pre-production arrangement {{between the two}} organizations granted Paramount 12.5% of the film's revenue. As the $185 million budget was larger than the original $125 million estimate, Lucas, Spielberg and Ford turned down large upfront salaries so Paramount <b>could</b> <b>cover</b> the film's costs. In order for Paramount to see a profit beyond its distribution fee, the film had to make over $400 million. At that point, Lucas, Spielberg, Ford and those with smaller profit-sharing deals would also begin to collect their cut.|$|E

5|$|Roguelike {{games were}} {{initially}} developed for computing environments with limited memory, including shared mainframe systems and early home computers; this limitation prevented developers from retaining {{all but a}} few dungeon levels in memory while the game was running, leading to procedural generation to avoid the memory storage issue. Roguelikes were also often written in languages like BASIC, which are not as efficient in memory and data management compared to modern languages, further limiting the scope the game <b>could</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
5|$|At 21:21 the North Vietnamese {{resumed their}} {{artillery}} attack on Phou Pha Thi, followed by several infantry assaults by the VPA 766th Regiment, which prompted Sullivan {{to order the}} evacuation of six technicians by 08:15 the next morning, from a contingent of 19 U.S. personnel. Starting at 01:00 on 11March, the North Vietnamese moved into their assigned positions in order to launch their attack. About 02:00, a U.S. adviser at the airstrip reported to Secord and CIA officers at Udorn that he heard gunfire on top of Phou Pha Thi, and communication with U.S. technicians at Lima Site 85 was completely cut off. Afterwards, Secord briefed U.S. A-1 Skyraider pilots in Thailand on the situation at Lima Site 85, to familiarize them with friendly positions around the facility, so they <b>could</b> <b>cover</b> the evacuation of U.S. personnel and support the Hmong counterattack.|$|E
5|$|By December 1941, the M2A1, M2A2 and M2A3 {{were used}} for {{training}} only. The majority of M2A4s, which went to the US Army, were also used only for training between 1940 and 1942. The U.S. Marine Corps ordered M3 Stuart tanks to outfit its armored units in 1940, but as the new tank was not yet in production, it received 36 M2A4s, after which point production of the M3 had come on line. Many of these tanks were deployed during the Battle of Guadalcanal while assigned to A Company, 1st Tank Battalion, where they and M3 Stuarts were typically spread out among infantry units. Their use was generally limited to providing mobile fire support to the Marines, either in disabling Japanese bunkers or using canister shot against Japanese attacks. In defensive engagements, the M2A4s and Stuarts would deploy in pairs, so they <b>could</b> <b>cover</b> each other with machine gun fire against Japanese soldiers armed with satchel charges.|$|E

5|$|The German Navy {{had decided}} on a {{strategy}} of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast {{in an attempt to}} draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier raid on Yarmouth on 3 November 1914 had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was later devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper. The fast battlecruisers would conduct the bombardment, {{while the rest of the}} High Seas Fleet stationed itself east of Dogger Bank, so they <b>could</b> <b>cover</b> the battlecruisers' return and destroy any pursuing British vessels. Having broken the German naval codes, the British were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey, although they were not aware of the High Seas Fleet's presence. Admiral Beatty's 1st BCS (now reduced to four ships, including New Zealand) and the 2nd Battle Squadron (consisting of six dreadnoughts) were detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{approached}} Port Stanley, {{the capital}} of the Falklands, early on the morning of 8 December; the British quickly spotted them, and raised steam to go out and meet them. Von Spee initially thought the smoke clouds to be the British burning their coal stocks to prevent the Germans from seizing them. Upon realizing the presence of the powerful British squadron, he broke off the attack and turned to flee. The British quickly steamed out of the harbor in pursuit. By 12:55, the battlecruisers had caught up to the retreating Germans, and opened fire on Leipzig, the last ship in the German line, though she was not hit. Von Spee ordered the light cruisers to detach and flee while Scharnhorst and Gneisenau turned on their pursuers, in the hope that he <b>could</b> <b>cover</b> their escape. In response, Sturdee sent his cruisers to chase down Nürnberg, Dresden, and Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|When skirmishing, light {{infantry}} {{fought in}} pairs, {{so that one}} soldier <b>could</b> <b>cover</b> the other while loading. Line regiments fired in volleys, but skirmishers fired at will, taking careful aim at targets. While some consideration was given to equipping light infantry with rifles, due to their improved accuracy, the expected difficulty and expense in obtaining sufficient rifled weapons resulted in the standard infantry musket being issued to most troops. The accuracy of the musket decreased at long range and, since the French chasseurs and voltigeurs also used muskets, {{it is likely that}} skirmishers' firefights took place at ranges of only 50 yards (or less). 10 yards provided the accuracy of point-blank range. Although the French infantry (and, earlier, the Americans) frequently used multi-shot and grapeshot in their muskets, the British light infantry used only standard ball ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Viking raids {{took place}} for {{instance}} in 987 and 997 at Watchet and the Battle of Cynwit. King Alfred was driven to seek refuge from the Danes at Athelney before defeating them at the Battle of Ethandun in 878, usually considered to be near Edington, Wiltshire, but possibly the village of Edington in Somerset. Alfred established a series of forts and lookout posts linked by a military road, or Herepath, so his army <b>could</b> <b>cover</b> Viking movements at sea. The Herepath has a characteristic form which is familiar on the Quantocks: a regulation 20m wide track between avenues of trees growing from hedge laying embankments. The Herepath ran from the ford on the River Parrett at Combwich, past Cannington hill fort to Over Stowey, where it climbed the Quantocks {{along the line of}} the current Stowey road, to Crowcombe Park Gate. Then it went south along the ridge, to Triscombe Stone. One branch may have led past Lydeard Hill and Buncombe Hill, back to Alfred's base at Athelney. The main branch descended the hills at Triscombe, then along the avenue to Red Post Cross, and west to the Brendon Hills and Exmoor. A peace treaty with the Danes was signed at Wedmore and the Danish king Guthrum the Old was baptised at Aller. Burhs (fortified places) had been set up by 919, such as Lyng. The Alfred Jewel, an object about 2.5inch long, made of filigree gold, cloisonné-enamelled and with a rock crystal covering, was found in 1693 at Petherton Park, North Petherton. Believed to have been owned by Alfred the Great it is thought to have been the handle for a pointer that would have fit into the hole at its base and been used while reading a book.|$|E

25|$|Even when {{passports}} {{were not}} usually required, Americans requested U.S. passports. Records of the Department of State show that 130,360 passports were issued between 1810 and 1873, and that 369,844 passports were issued between 1877 and 1909. Some of those passports were family passports or group passports. A passport application <b>could</b> <b>cover,</b> variously, a wife, a child, or children, {{one or more}} servants, or a woman traveling {{under the protection of}} a man. The passport would be issued to the man. Similarly, a passport application <b>could</b> <b>cover</b> a child traveling with his or her mother. The passport would be issued to the mother.
