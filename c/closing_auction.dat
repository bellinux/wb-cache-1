40|$|The London Stock Exchange is {{constantly}} changing {{as the global}} financial landscape evolves. By aggregating detailed intraday trading data, I analyse its liquidity for a period spanning {{the introduction of a}} pure electronic order book platform for the most liquid stocks in 1997, its expansion to include less liquid stocks with market maker participation, the structural and environmental changes brought about by MiFID regulation in 2007, {{and the beginning of the}} global financial crisis. By all measures, liquidity has increased over the years, although recently intensified competition from alternative trading venues may be limiting further improvement. The most liquid stocks are the constituents of the FTSE 100 index, which are picked by largest market capitalization. When a new stock is added to this index there is a temporary price effect which I ascribe to the <b>closing</b> <b>auction</b> just before the index is revised. This is a natural time for passive investors who track the index by replicating its composition to adjust their portfolio holdings. The auction trade is facilitated by a build-up of liquidity on the opposite side of the order book in advance, as limit orders are placed in competition to take the other side of this information-free order flow at a premium. Naturally, ordinary trading in index constituents does contain information about individual stocks, groups of stocks and the entire market. Conveniently, another liquid security trades on the market which can be used as a conduit for the latter information: the FTSE 100 exchange-traded fund. Due to arbitrage opportunities its price is closely related to the index, and in fact I determine that they are cointegrated, even intraday. According to the eo integration analysis the fund makes a significant contribution to the index price discovery process, and this is especially evident when order flows are incorporated into the model.

Using an original dataset of eBay auctions for brand new and used video games, this article shows that sellers of used commodities charge reputation premiums. Reputation, however, {{have no effect}} on the price of relatively inexpensive brand new commodities. Reputation did not have significant effects on the probability of making sales or bidding late. Timing of the bids on eBay auctions for brand new goods. The existing literature on online auctions has pointed out an empirical regularity with respect to the timing of the bids: Most of the bidding activity is concentrated {{at the end of the}} auctions. Roth & Ockenfels (2002) argued that bidders wait until the end to avoid falling into bidding wars. I used a unique dataset on auctions for a Playstation II game to provide an empirical assessment of the sniping theory. I do not find empirical support for this theory. Effects of competing and sequential auctions on bidders' behavior on eBay auctions. In most of the economic literature, online auctions are studied in isolation from each other. We study the effects of competing auctions that end at different times on Bidders' behavior. We use an original dataset of video games auctioned on eBay. Our main result shows that bidding activity tend to stop closer to the end of an auction when the difference between the closing times of that auction and the previous one is small. We also found that bidders facing competing auctions tend to bid in the first <b>closing</b> <b>auction.</b> These results suggest that late bidding in auctions with a hard stop time may not be equivalent to bidders waiting until the end of the auction to send their bids. We also found support for the idea that when facing competing auctions that end at similar times, bidders tend to bid at the auction with the lowest price. Our results also show that a bigger number of competing auctions reduces the final prices of the goods...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is motivated}} by two major factors. First, {{there have been no}} direct studies conducted for the relationship between market integrity and market efficiency and the driving forces behind the cross-sectional variations in market quality. Second, a better understanding the relationships among market integrity, market efficiency and other mechanism design factors for securities exchanges will facilitate securities exchanges achieve a satisfactory level of market quality. This dissertation consists of three chapters. In Chapter 1, a review of literature on market manipulation will be given. A series of common securities market manipulation strategies and corresponding market surveillance alerts will be explained and defined. In Chapter 2, we develop a testable hypothesis that market manipulation as proxied by the incidence of ramping alerts would raise transaction cost for completing larger trades. We find ramping alert incidence positively related to effective spreads in 8 of 10 turnover deciles from most liquid to thinnest-trading securities. The magnitude of the increase in effective spreads when ramping manipulation incidence doubles is economically significant, 30 to 40 basis points in many moderate liquidity deciles. This compares with an average effective spread of 72 basis points for index-listed securities in the most efficient electronic markets worldwide. In Chapter 3, In Chapter 3 of this thesis, we test the correlation between the levels of market integrity as proxied by the incidence of ramping alerts and a combination of proxies for factors from the following four potential drivers deciding the market quality across securities exchanges: &# 149;	Securities Markets Trading Regulations &# 149;	Securities Markets Technologies &# 149;	Securities Market Infrastructure &# 149;	Securities Market Participants The model we developed to test the correlation between the proxies for level of market integrity and seven proxies for the four potential drivers were estimated with Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Two-stage Least Square (2 SLS) error structures assumed, respectively to learn the most about the possible endogeneity of spreads and volatility. By performing Hausman-Wu specification tests, we concluded that simultaneity bias in the thickly-traded deciles is not material for the AI-Volatility and AI-Spread equation pairs. Subsequently, we used the PROBIT model to analyse the probability of adopting RTS across the 240 securities exchange deciles and the likelihood proves to be systematically related to four determinants in our sample. Finally we estimate the structural equations to investigate possible cross-equation correlation of the disturbances with either seemingly unrelated regression (SURL) estimation. Our findings are three-fold. Firstly, in the moderately-traded deciles, we find that the presence of a <b>closing</b> <b>auction</b> (CloseAucDum) reduces the incidence of ramping alerts. Trade-based manipulation proves more difficult when a manipulator&# 146;s counterparties can use closing auctions to unwind their intraday exposures. The RTS dummy variable is significantly positively related to alert incidence. In the absence of any panel data on the dynamic effects of adopting RTS, what we are observing in cross section is the perceived vulnerability of certain exchanges to manipulation and their consequent adoption of RTS plus the regulatory regimes required to have a salutary effect on market integrity. Second, in the moderately-traded deciles, we find that the closing auctions and more regulations in pursuit of market integrity lower quoted spreads. RTS and a regulation specifically prohibiting ramping indicate in cross-section the perceived likelihood of more ramping. Thirdly, in terms of the probability of the deployment of a real-time surveillance system, the estimations again differ by liquidity decile grouping. In the moderately-traded deciles, higher alert incidence, the presence of DMA, and higher FDI again increase the likelihood of adopting a real-time surveillance system. Our findings have a couple of policy implications for many securities exchanges in terms of market design and market surveillance. First, the exhibited relationship between alert incidence and effective spreads indicates trade-based manipulation has a significant impact on execution costs. Therefore, the prevention of securities market manipulation not only serves the indirect purpose of improving an exchange&# 146;s reputation for market integrity but also contributes directly to achieving a more efficient marketplace. Second, our results indicate that some market design changes can enhance the regulatory efforts to prevent securities market manipulations. For example, to prevent manipulators from marking the closing price, some exchanges could choose to adopt a <b>closing</b> <b>auction</b> or a random closing time, which would make manipulation more costly. Nevertheless, no securities exchange can be designed perfectly. Consequently, exchange and broker-level surveillance backed by effective regulatory enforcement is a necessary and pivotal complement to good design choices...|$|E
40|$|Stock exchanges {{have become}} more popular and serve {{as one of the}} most {{important}} investment channels for investors in different capitalist classes. As a result, the core objectives of the major capital market regulators is to maintain and promote market efficiency and integrity, and is becoming more critical than ever. Recently, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) experienced several major regulatory/market design changes, such as the introduction of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) and the closing call auctions (CCA), both of which are aimed at improving market quality. HKSE therefore provides an ideal environment to determine whether the impacts of these recent microstructure/regulatory changes have a beneficial or a harmful effect on market quality. This dissertation consists of three main essays. In the first essay, I estimate the incidence of suspicious illegal insider trading on the HKSE, and investigate whether the introduction of the SFO leads to a reduction in illegal insider trading cases. I find that the introduction of the SFO and the commencement of the first prosecution under the SFO have greatly improved market integrity. Results show that market integrity is lowest for stocks in the medium deciles, and suspected illegal insider trading cases are dominated by insiders buying prior to a price sensitive announcement. The second essay investigates the impact of the SFO on information asymmetry, transaction costs and volatility. Results indicate that the probability of informed trading (PIN) decreases significantly following the introduction of the SFO. Both quoted and effective spreads narrow following the implementation of the SFO. Results indicate volatility rises after the implementation of the SFO. The third essay examines the impact of the introduction and suspension of the closing call (CCA) auction mechanism on liquidity and the price discovery process. Results show that the introduction of the closing call auction does not generate new volume, but merely shifts volume from normal trading to the <b>closing</b> <b>auction.</b> Order depth in the continuous trading session decreases significantly, which leads to an increase in transaction costs. Following the suspension of the CCA, investors in the top four quintiles execute more of their trades during the last half hour of normal trading hours. The price discovery process is improved after the introduction of the auction. However, the suspension of it leads to a substantial deterioration...|$|E
