5|$|As Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) {{with the}} {{incorporated}} VoMi Himmler was {{deeply involved in}} the Germanization program for the East, particularly Poland. As laid out in the General Plan for the East, the aim was to enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make Lebensraum ("living space") for Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to <b>colonise</b> the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.|$|E
5|$|Hume has {{suggested}} that the Mascarene parrots have a common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to <b>colonise</b> many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.|$|E
5|$|It is believed, {{based on}} the {{ecological}} conditions, that C.maenas could eventually extend its range to <b>colonise</b> the Pacific coast of North America from Baja California to Alaska. Similar ecological conditions {{are to be found}} on many of the world's coasts, with the only large potential area not to have been invaded yet being New Zealand; the New Zealand government has taken action, including the release of a Marine Pest Guide in an effort to prevent colonisation by C.maenas.|$|E

40|$|High {{rates of}} {{carriage}} of group B streptococci were found among men (38 %) and women (42. 3 %) attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases. Swabs from the perineal/anorectal area gave the highest isolation rate and {{those from the}} urethra the lowest. The subpreputial sac was an important site for carriage of the organism, {{and there was a}} strong association between streptococcal isolation and balanitis. Of 92 couples studied, neither partner was <b>colonised</b> with group B streptococci in 36. In a further 36 one or other was <b>colonised</b> and in 20 both were <b>colonised.</b> Serotyping and phage typing showed that only three of these 20 couples were <b>colonised</b> with similar strains of the organism...|$|R
5|$|Killed by bushfire, Grevillea juniperina regenerates {{afterwards}} by {{seeds that}} germinate after lying dormant in the soil, stimulated {{by exposure to}} heat and smoke. Plants over 1m (3ft) high produce more seed. Intervals of 10 to 15 years between fires {{are thought to be}} most beneficial for the species' survival, as this allows seed numbers to build up in the soil over time. Grevillea juniperina can also <b>colonise</b> disturbed areas, though overgrowth of Bursaria spinosa can negatively impact its spread.|$|E
5|$|Many endemic Mascarene birds, {{including}} the dodo, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and the English palaeontologist Julian Hume has proposed {{that this may}} also be the case for all parrots there. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to <b>colonise</b> some of these less isolated islands. Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared common features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones. Hume has suggested that they all have a common origin in the radiation of the tribe Psittaculini, members of which are known as Psittaculines, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to <b>colonise</b> many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Other members of the genus Psittacula from the Mascarenes include the extant echo parakeet (Psittacula eques echo) of Mauritius, as well as the extinct Réunion parakeet (Psittacula eques eques), and Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni) of both Mauritius and Réunion.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{repeating the}} devolved {{arrangements}} of previous treaties, Edward chose to permanently <b>colonise</b> North Wales instead. The remaining royal family of Llwelyn and Dafydd was crushed and their lands divided amongst major English nobles. The governance of Wales was reformed, and the arrangements {{set out in}} the Statute of Rhuddlan, enacted on 3March 1284. Wales was divided into counties and shires, emulating how England was governed, with three new shires created in the north-west: Caernarfon, Merioneth and Anglesey.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] While {{there are}} reports on the outcome in adults and {{teenagers}} with cystic fibrosis of colonisation with Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia, there is little information in children. METHODS [...] In December 1991 only one of 115 children with cystic fibrosis attending a paediatric centre was <b>colonised</b> with B cepacia. Over the next 12 months there was a rapid increase with 23 (20 %) becoming colonised; eighteen (79 %) of these became <b>colonised</b> in hospital {{at a time that}} overlapped with the admission of a B cepacia positive child. Three different bacteriocin types were isolated, with one type (S 22 /PO) being present in 17 (74 %) patients. The outcome for children who became <b>colonised</b> with B cepacia was compared with that in 33 children who continued to be <b>colonised</b> with Pseudomonas aeruginosa alone. RESULTS [...] Children <b>colonised</b> with B cepacia were older and more poorly nourished than those <b>colonised</b> with P aeruginosa, but did not have poorer pulmonary function. After colonisation, the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) deteriorated between consecutive annual tests, with the average deterioration being greater in those with higher initial levels. Five children with B cepacia died from respiratory failure although none showed a fulminant deterioration. Introduction of segregation measures within hospital led to a dramatic {{decrease in the number of}} newly <b>colonised</b> patients. CONCLUSIONS [...] This study provides further evidence for person-to-person spread of B cepacia and confirms the effectiveness of simple isolation measures in interrupting spread. Colonisation with B cepacia and P aeruginosa in children is associated with a more rapid decline in lung function and a significantly increased mortality compared with cases <b>colonised</b> with P aeruginosa alone...|$|R

COPD patients with severe disease and frequent exacer-bations were categorised according to chronic colonisation by P. aeruginosa.

5|$|The dodo, and its extinction, {{was more}} typical of the extinctions of pigeons in the past. Like many species that <b>colonise</b> remote islands with few {{predator}}s, it {{lost much of its}} predator avoidance behaviour, along with its ability to fly. The arrival of people, along with a suite of other introduced species such as rats, pigs, and cats, quickly spelled the end for this species and all the other island forms that have become extinct.|$|E
5|$|The redback spider's {{affinity}} for human-modified habitat has enabled it to spread to several countries via international shipping and trade. Furthermore, its tolerance to cold {{means that it}} {{has the ability to}} <b>colonise</b> many temperate countries with a winter climate cooler than Australia. This is concerning due to the risks to people being bitten who are unaware of its venomous nature, and also to the conservation of local threatened insect species that the redback might prey upon.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of life on Earth lives in mesophyllic (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them microbes, have managed to <b>colonise</b> extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are bacteria, for example, living in Lake Whillans, half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence of sunlight, they must rely on organic material from elsewhere, perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from the underlying rock. Other bacteria can be found in abundance in the Mariana Trench, the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; marine snow drifts down from the surface layers of the sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how legal processes utilised by institutions established {{to reverse the}} effects of colonisation, can continue the <b>colonising</b> agenda. The processes reflect 'deep', rather than 'de-', <b>colonising</b> practices. The Australian Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC), which tabled its National Report {{over a decade ago}} and which was heralded as the inquiry which would transform race politics for Indigenous Australians, is used {{as an example of a}} 'decolonising' institution that inadvertently adopted deep <b>colonising</b> practices. Using data from interviews with 48 Indigenous and non-Indigenous people who were associated with the RCIADIC, this paper expands Deborah Bird Rose's theoretical construct of 'deep <b>colonising</b> practices' and illustrates how difficult it is to shift hegemonic legal processes and beliefs despite intentions to empower and embrace Indigenous views.

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species's southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this {{may also be the}} case for all the parrots there. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to <b>colonise</b> some of these less isolated islands.|$|E
5|$|From 1350 to 1400—the {{period in}} which the poem is thought to have been written—Wales {{experienced}} several raids {{at the hands of the}} English, who were attempting to <b>colonise</b> the area. The Gawain poet uses a North West Midlands dialect common on the Welsh–English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem through the lens of postcolonialism, and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role in the poem. Most critics agree that gender plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact in the poem.|$|E
5|$|Within the York {{distribution}} {{the beetles}} {{are dependent on}} tansy as their sole food source; if a clump disappears the beetles are forced to walk to a new location as they rarely fly, despite having fully working wings and being capable of doing so. The loss of habitat impacts upon {{the ability of the}} tansy beetle to find an alternative source of the host plant. Additionally, tansy is a ruderal species and thus has a naturally high rate of turnover of plants, forcing beetles to regularly seek out new tansy patches to <b>colonise.</b>|$|E

A 2015 genetic study by Jackson et al. found the other Mascarene Psittacula taxa to group within a clade of rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri) subspecies from Asia and Africa.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{have played}} an {{important}} military, economic and social role in Great Britain and Ireland since their introduction following the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Although {{a small number of}} castles had been built in England in the 1050s, the Normans began to build motte and bailey and ringworks castles in large numbers to control their newly occupied territories in England and the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century the Normans began to build more castles in stone– with characteristic square keeps– that played both military and political roles. Royal castles were used to control key towns and the economically important forests, while baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates. David I invited Anglo-Norman lords into Scotland in the early 12th century to help him <b>colonise</b> and control areas of his kingdom such as Galloway; the new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over the south of the kingdom. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 1170s, under Henry II, castles were established there too.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{barnacle}} studies {{convinced him}} that variation arose constantly {{and not just in}} response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to <b>colonise</b> distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that are rich in mineral resources. The aim of the game is to <b>colonise</b> and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and then sell the ore to the Federation. The player can use the {{proceeds}} for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships and missiles, spying, trading and also to pay fines should the Federation impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to sell to the Federation is not straightforward. The game has a stock market where commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a black market offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores and missiles. The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore on the black market will be terminated.|$|E
5|$|In 1532, Pedro de Alvarado, {{governor}} of Guatemala, was issued with royal authorisation {{to conquer the}} general area of Higueras, {{in order to establish}} a Caribbean port for Guatemala. Less than a year after permission was given to Alvarado, then {{governor of}} Honduras and Higueras, Diego Alvítez, was given royal authorisation to pacify and <b>colonise</b> the Naco valley and the area around Puerto de Caballos. Soon afterwards, in 1533, Francisco de Montejo, governor of Yucatán, was granted governorship over a huge area extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ulúa River, Naco and Puerto de Caballos, so long as neither Alvarado nor Alvítez had established themselves in those regions. At the same time, Alvardo received reconfirmation of his permission to conquer those parts of Higueras that had not been pacified by the governors of Yucatán and Honduras-Higueras. Effectively, all three governors had royal permission to conquer and settle the same general region, and could interpret the royal authorisations as they chose.|$|E
