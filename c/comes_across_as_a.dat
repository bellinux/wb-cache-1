In describing it as a [...] "type of history painting", she argues that it was intended as more than a mere documentary piece. Jovanović's decision to use the triptych format would have been highly unusual otherwise.|$|E
500|$|One biographer of Cosby, Linda Etkin, said, [...] "Cosby <b>comes</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> father figure, a teacher, and a friend" [...] in his advertisements. William Turner, in 1982 the {{marketing}} manager for Texas Instruments' consumer products group, said Cosby [...] "represents comfort, and people trust him".

500|$|No Lifeguard on Duty {{received}} a favorable review from Publishers Weekly. The review concluded: [...] "The book is sometimes predictable and psychologically simplistic, but Dickinson <b>comes</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> triumphant survivor. Her willingness to recognize her own flaws {{makes it easy}} to relate to her positive message and should inspire readers searching for solutions to career and personal conflicts." [...] The review praised the author's ability at being: [...] "honest enough to acknowledge the stimulating aspects of success and glamour, explaining why they lure insecure personalities and imprison them past the point of no return." [...] Women's Wear Daily reviewed the book and wrote: [...] "What keeps the book from becoming too tawdry is Dickinson's sense of humor. She applies a healthy dose to both her conquests and disaster's alike." ...|$|E

500|$|Critic John Leonard, in {{a review}} in The New York Times, {{described}} The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five as [...] "a remarkable recovery" [...] from Shikasta, which he called a [...] "disaster". He said The Marriages works for him because it <b>comes</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fable, like an instructive Sufi tale. Writing in HuffPost Culture, University of Bristol academic Tom Sperlinger called the book [...] "a legend" [...] and listed it amongst his five recommended Lessing books that she as written since The Golden Notebook (1962). Pierson found the book [...] "enjoyable", despite the [...] "dry and bookish sound" [...] dialogue which felt like a translation. He added that readers familiar with Lessing's fortitude in The Golden Notebook may not appreciate her allegory in The Marriages. While she is still [...] "passionate, opinionated and outraged" [...] here, Pierson said Lessing has withdrawn from writing about {{the real world and}} chosen to [...] "soar unsteady currents of whimsy, dreams [...] mysticism".|$|E
500|$|Aside from {{background}} vocal stylings from Lorenz {{and other}} females, Carey added her own lowered vocals into the song, {{giving the impression}} of a [...] "doubled voice." [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] samples R and dance singer Stacy Lattisaw's [...] "Attack of the Name Game". The song's hook and loop were taken and incorporated into the melody of [...] "Heartbreaker", as well as being used as its main instrumental components. The lyrics are constructed in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form. Carey starts with the hook [...] "Gimme your love, gimme your love," [...] repeated eight times. Carey repeats the chorus four times, ending the song with a final [...] "Gimme your love, gimme your love." [...] Chuck Taylor from Billboard described its instrumentation as a [...] "persistent guitar lick" [...] and wrote [...] "There's an identifiable chorus here, and some semblance of verses, but more than anything, this song <b>comes</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> blur of jumbled in the background, including Carey's own repetitive harmonies, which in this case sound more like a competition than a compliment." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Yale Daily News writer Catherine Halaby {{called it a}} [...] "well-executed ballad", while observing that [...] "it <b>comes</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hybrid of advice to her young female fans {{on how to deal}} with puberty, and an explanation of her girly but not childlike attitude." [...] Jim Farber of the Daily News while reviewing the Dream Within a Dream Tour, called the song [...] "sugar pop dittie", along with Spears' previous ballad single [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know". Nikki Tranker of PopMatters considered the song [...] "Britney's standout statement on , [...] a power ballad that allows [...] to showcase her expert vocals while still adhering to the rules of safe pop." [...] Tranker compared the song to powerful ballads written by Diane Warren. Katie Perone of the Loyola Greyhound said the song [...] "clearly defines the theme of the record: Britney's growing up, and wants to do her own thing." [...] Despite the positive response from critics, the song won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song in 2003.|$|E

500|$|Choosing to self-title the album, Lazzara said: [...] "We haven’t had , {{and going}} back to the {{original}} lineup, it seems appropriate." [...] Nolan mentioned a recurring theme throughout the album: [...] "The issue of being an adult with a real life and a long-term relationship or marriage, and trying to make that work." [...] The album's sound has been described as rock. Band members made up their own sequences for the track listing, then noted the similarities. Lazzara said [...] "...with El Paso ... Why not come out swinging?" [...] The track {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album, and Lazzara said it encapsulates [...] "both the mood of the environment we were in down there and the mood we were in about being back together again and writing new music". Lazzara called it [...] "probably the heaviest rock song we've ever written". After the group finished the track, they listened to it 15 or 16 times in a row, and proceeded to exclaim: [...] "Holy shit." [...] "When everybody's like 'Holy shit' about something, you're onto something. It's a total motorcycle-raging-down-the-highway kind of song." [...] Lazzara said [...] "Faith (When I Let You Down)" [...] matches a [...] "huge, punishing" [...] chorus with a soft verse, which <b>comes</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "roller coaster" [...] to him. Lazzara mentioned that the track took longer to work on compared to the other songs on the album, going through 4 or 5 sets of lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed to negative reception from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented that the}} episode [...] "feels like an amalgamation of elements from prior holiday programs and never really elicits much humor. Christmas is commercialized and corporations use and abuse their customers? Those aren’t exactly rich insights, so [...] <b>comes</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> below average episode." [...] In his review of the DVD Christmas With the Simpsons, Digitally Obsessed critic Joel Cunningham wrote that the episode [...] "comes from Season 11, well past the point when the series had sacrificed character for absurdist humor. Unless you don't think evil toy marketers, sentient Furbys, and Gary Coleman qualify. Anyway, after the school nearly goes bankrupt, Principal Skinner signs a contract with corporate backers who use the kids to conduct market research. There are some good gags, but the story doesn't hang together very well." [...] Adam Tyner of DVD Talk argued that the episode [...] "has {{a couple of good}} gags (Gary Coleman chatting on the phone being my favorite) but is quickly forgettable". Brian James of PopMatters described Coleman's cameo as [...] "hysterical" [...] in 2004, and Meghan Lewit of the same website listed [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] at number eight on her 2009 list of the [...] "10 best holiday themed TV episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|The System Has Failed has {{received}} mainly positive reviews from critics, {{with some of}} them describing the album as a return to form. AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier commented that Megadeth hasn't sounded this vital since Countdown to Extinction, and called the album [...] "damn near perfect". Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles reviewer Martin Popoff described the album as a mix of several previous records, and praised a number of the album's tracks. Popoff acknowledged the fact that Mustaine only used hired session players on the album was the album's only low point. Jeff Kerby of KNAC gave a positive, if at times slightly sarcastic review, as well as a detailed track-by-track commentary. David E. Gehlke of Blistering said despite that Mustaine's best days were behind him, this record <b>comes</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "warm return"; although the album fails to recapture past glory, it succeeds in being a solid, reliable metal album. In addition, Gehlke noted that Mustaine's vocals were [...] "as strong as ever", but panned the album for the lack of any [...] "thrash burners". Neil Arnold of Metal Forces had a slightly different opinion, and credited this album for putting Megadeth [...] "back on track". He praised the album artwork, which reminded him of the 80's style of graphics. Another positive review was posted on Entertainment Weekly. Reviewer Nancy Miller called The System Has Failed Megadeth's best since 1990's Rust in Peace and praised Mustaine's collaboration with Poland, calling the result [...] "Righteous!" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the first three}} episodes, The New York Times saw in [...] "prim, righteous Brother Justin [...] more of a caricature, but Clancy Brown finds ways to bring some subtle glints of personality to the role." [...] Time commented, [...] "Brother Justin <b>comes</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> typical whited sepulcher [...] if there's one thing more trite than a dwarf in a surreal drama, it's a preacher with a dark side [...] and Brown's campy performance largely involves shouting 'Enough!' and 'No-o-o-o!' with horror-flick pathos." [...] Entertainment Weekly considered Brown's Brother Justin [...] "delightfully unsettling as the creepy evangelist taking his orders from the wrong superpower", and Variety thought Brown was doing [...] "a superb job straddling the line between stoic and menacing, and there are hints about his weaknesses, conveyed quickly with subtlety." [...] A season 1 DVD review by DVD Talk saw Clancy Brown's performance as [...] "nothing short of brilliant. [...] Brown also has a difficult task capturing the duality of Brother Justin, a man who presents a physically intimidating presence but who wants little more than to be a subdued and loyal servant of his Lord, and he succeeds on every level." [...] DVDverdict stated in a season 2 review that [...] "Brown's presence and charisma is dazzling; he is both likable and frightening. He is an actor {{with a great deal}} of range, and he uses all of it in this series." [...] Referring to Brown's portrayal as [...] "a man of God in Carnivale", the Los Angeles Times saw Brown's [...] "eyes always betray him as someone who, all things considered, would probably be happier caving in your skull and smoking a cigarette afterward than talking to you for another minute." [...] Time Magazine's James Poniewozik depicted the Boardwalk Empire character Nelson Van Alden (played by Michael Shannon) as [...] "such a histrionic, guilt-wracked, damnation-obsessed monster that he reminds me of Brother Justin".|$|E
500|$|Jab Tak Hai Jaan {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics overseas. Priya Joshi of the website Digital Spy gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "The film is invested {{with a healthy}} dose of Shah Rukh, the very heart and saans of Yash Chopra and the message which he lived and breathed through his films: that love is eternal." [...] Simon Foster of Australia's Special Broadcasting Service also gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, calling it [...] "a grand cinematic work boasting all {{the pros and cons of}} the genre." [...] He observed: [...] "Chopra fans will not hear complaints that the great producer-director had become mired in a rut, or that his films are rote melodramas reliant on boisterous music (here, a typically string-heavy work from the omnipresent A.R. Rahman) and over-active camerawork. One could argue that it's their very vivid cinematic nature that makes them particularly noteworthy, even when the dialogue (at times, awful) and plotting (rarely based in logical realism) can test one's patience." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "The film has a freshness that would never lead one to think it was directed by an 80-year-old while at the same time it has a sureness of tone, a certainty about itself even at its most audacious, that only comes from the hand of a seasoned master...Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra." [...] Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "Director-producer Yash Chopra's film, his final project before he died, delivers not only the romance and human touch, but also reflects a modern sensibility." [...] Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this story's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties." [...] Mazhar Farooqui of Dubai's the Gulf News wrote: [...] "Despite its inherent flaws, JTHJ <b>comes</b> <b>across</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> beguiling romantic film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of high emotions set amidst picture postcard locales but more than anyone the movie belongs to Chopra. In his swan song, the celebrated director once again proved why his legacy will be hard to match." ...|$|E
