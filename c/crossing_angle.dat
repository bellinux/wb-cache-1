Nanofibrils, bundles of nanofibrils, helical features and a layered structure with a <b>cross</b> <b>angle</b> between nanofibrils in different layers were observed for all silks. Similar log-normal distributions of fibril widths were obtained from all silks with the geometric mean fibril widths covering the range of 90 – 170 nm.
