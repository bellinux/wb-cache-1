However, {{if one can}} convert such wastes into useful product economically, there will be great contribution to the market. In the present investigation, therefore, torn-out garments were firstly cut, then opened and <b>carded.</b> The <b>carded</b> <b>slivers</b> were afterwards fed into the Dref 2 Machine, and yarns were spun at different card cylinder and perforated spinning drum speeds.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the effect of {{humidity}} on nep movement in electrostatic field, a self-made experiment instrument was made. By this instrument, under the several kinds of different humidity, fiber neps and SCNs (seed coat neps) gotten randomly from <b>card</b> <b>sliver</b> or raw cotton were laid on down-pole-plate and then the up-pole-plate voltage was increased gradually. The voltages when the neps leaving the down-pole-plate were recorded. With statistical method, the take-off voltage averages {{of different kinds of}} nep under different humidity were calculated. It can be concluded that charging time of neps decreases largely and the take-off voltages of neps also reduce with the increase of air humidity in certain range...|$|R

40|$|Sliver has a {{huge impact}} on yarn quality {{parameter}} like evenness, imperfection index, Cvm%, U % of yarn. In general doubling means the increase in weight per unit length. Doubling is a process used in yarn manufacturing by which a single product is produced from a several intermediate feed product. The study was performed on 0. 12 hank <b>card</b> <b>sliver</b> which was used to produce 24 / 1 Ne carded yarn. At first the number of doubling in the breaker and finisher drawing was 6, 7, and 8 respectively. The paper is to find out whether the change of number of doubling has any effect on yarn quality or to find out the suitable number of sliver doubling in passage 1 and passage 2...|$|R
50|$|All {{spinning}} machines, whether ring or open-end, need yarn joining {{to repair}} breaks or start new <b>sliver</b> <b>cans.</b> Joining the yarn {{has historically been}} a labor-intensive activity {{and a source of}} quality defects. Autopiecing units are robots that automate this process. Market leaders like Schlafhorst, Rieter, Savio, have machines that incorporate good quality autopiecers and autodoffing. This automation leads to less material handling costs and helps improve quality of the final product.|$|R
40|$|Carding is {{the most}} vital process in spinning, which infl uences the sliver quality and the {{resulting}} yarn characteristics. The eff ect of carding on single fibre and bundle fibre properties were studied by employing advanced fibre information system (AFIS) and diff erences in properties are reported. For a good quality yarn, the process parameters and setting in the carding are needed to be selected properly. The paper presents the results due {{to the effect of}} points per square inch (PPSI) in stationary flats of licker-in side (SFL). The effect of setting between the flats and cylinder was also studied. The sample was prepared using LMW spinning line using LC- 333 carding machine.

50|$|In {{early days}} large {{machines}} were equipped with less distance between rotors (gauge of machine). This led to creeling of very small cans, which required frequent can changes. Each can change requires {{a break in}} the yarn. All major manufacturers currently allow cans up to 18” diameter leading to less breakage, less joining of yarn, hence better quality and higher productivity. Originally round cans were used. Rectangular cans are used because they double sliver capacity in the same <b>sliver</b> <b>can</b> footprint.|$|R

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} for the rate modeling of flexible granular solids based on affine average motion of interparticle contacts. We allow contacts {{to form and}} break continually but assume {{the existence of a}} finite friction coefficient rendering contacts force free as they form or break. The resulting constitutive equations are of the hypoelastic type. A specific model for the deformation of a fiber mass is then developed. The model improves on previous theories for fiber masses in at least two respects: First, it is more general ill that it is not restricted to uniaxial compression, although it is restricted to predominantly compressive deformations histories, due to neglect of frictional dissipation. Second, by allowing torsion as well as bending of fibers, this theory covers a larger deformation range. Compression experiments are performed on <b>carded</b> <b>slivers</b> of PA 6 fibers under various conditions. The measured response is found to be in close agreement with that predicted by the model...|$|R
50|$|In general, combing is done {{to filter}} or sieve out any short length fibers (for example, fibers shorter than 21 mm). Combing or carding is a primary process, {{followed}} by the gilling process, which removes hooks and involves three separate machines. Combing is then followed by two gillings to remove irregularity in the sliver and randomize fiber ends. This post-combing process is required if spinning is to follow. It is known that a <b>sliver</b> <b>can</b> be spun to a yarn of only 21 fibers with a suitable average length of 150 mm.|$|R

On the one hand, achieve the <b>sliver</b> color’s order <b>can</b> be matched at will, and every single <b>sliver</b> <b>can</b> be changed about the color and length, and the length of changeover portion can be designed easily, so that the final product color can be achieved in a color from deep to shallow gradients, and also can be two colors that is one of them becomes shallow gradually while another color deepened gradually; on the other hand, achieve the ratio of the colored sliver is adjustable without basal sliver feeding. In the other words, on the premise of output sliver thickness to maintain constant, the cross-section’s color of the sliver is ensured to be any independent color of the four feeding <b>sliver</b> colors, you <b>can</b> also have two or more color combinations. Using this {{new technology}} to produce the gradient product has been very popular in foreign countries, but is still rare in the domestic market.

40|$|The {{potential}} of biocomposites in engineering applications {{is demonstrated by}} using aligned flax fibre/polylactate composites as a materials model system. The failure stress of flax fibres is measured by tensile testing of single fibres and fibre bundles. For both fibre configurations, {{it is found that}} failure stress is decreased by increasing the tested fibre volume. Based on two types of flax fibre preforms: <b>carded</b> <b>sliver</b> and uniaxial non-crimp fabric, aligned flax fibre/polylactate composites were fabricated with variable fibre content. The volumetric composition and tensile properties of the composite were measured. For composites with a fibre content of 37 % by volume, stiffness is about 20 GPa and failure stress is about 180 MPa. The tensile properties of the composites are analysed with a modified rule of mixtures model, which includes the effect of porosity. The experimental results are well predicted by the model. The back-calculated effective stiffness and failure stress of the flax fibres are in the ranges 56 - 60 GPa and 515 - 730 MPa, respectively. Finally, model predictions are used to present overall guidelines for the comparisons between tensile performance of flax fibre composites and traditional fibre composites (exemplified by glass fibre composites). The stiffness per volume, per weight and per cost is compared for these two types of composites. Godkänd; 2008; Bibliografisk uppgift: USB; 20081010 (joffe...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{simulations}} {{can benefit}} {{a lot from}} an appropriate damping approach. For example, the stability is improved and a larger time step can be chosen. Furthermore, badly shaped meshes, e. g. containing sharp angles or <b>slivers,</b> <b>can</b> be handled if a proper damping approach is used. However, it must be ensured that the damping forces do not change the global movement of the object, i. e. they have to preserve linear and angular momentum. In this paper, we present a novel damping approach {{that is based on}} iterative spring damping to further improve the stability. We show that the resulting forces can be computed directly without actually performing the iterations. The approach does not require any connectivity information about the object and therefore, it can be used for arbitrary object representations. Further, it is independent of the integration scheme and the deformation model. The approach provides a simple parameter setting and guarantees that the damping forces do not overshoot. Finally, we illustrate that our approach allows for larger time steps compared to existing damping methods...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze manual material handling (MMH) working posture of the operators using 3 D Static Strength Prediction Program (3 DSSPP) software and to identify major areas causing long last injury of operators. The research has investigated the fit between the demands of tasks and the capabilities of operators. At the existing situations, the actual capabilities of operators have been computed with the help of 3 DSSPP software and compared with NIOSH standards.

40|$|It will be {{seen that}} {{irrespective}} {{of the type of}} feed, the precentage of hooked fibers in the outcoming sliver is fairly high, and varies only between the narrow limits 66 - 74. Further, in every case the trailing hooks are in the majority as in normally processed sliver. It should be particularly noted that there is hardly any difference between slivers B and C with regpect to the percentages of trailing and leading hooks, in spite of large differences in the percentages of such hooks fed to the card. Also, the percentages of trailing hooks in sliver B and of leading hooks in sliver C are less than those in the feed. It is clear, therefore, that the card more or less obliterates the fiber arrangement in the feed and gives it a treatment which results in a fairly constant percentage of hooked fibers in the sliver. From an examination of slivers D and E one might conclude that with combed feed the percentage of trail-ing hooks is significantly reduced while that of leading hooks is increased, but this conclusion is not borne out by the fiber arrangement of sliver F which is also from a combed feed. The combing ratio of the different slivers indicates that while there is hardly any difference in the fiber disorder of slivers prepared from blow room lap or from <b>card</b> <b>slivers,</b> the general fiber disorder is sig-nificantly less in slivers D, E, and F, which were pre-pared from combed sliver. The lower combing ratio of these slivers may be ascribed to greater fiber extent and better alignment of fibers arising out of the combed feed with its straightened and well separated fibers. The smaller percentage of short fibers in slivers D, E, and F, as compared to slivers A, B and C, would also be. partly responsible for lowering the value of the combing ratio in the former set of slivers.

5000|$|Nul’s pragmatism, its sober {{approach}} to the world, to the product of art, to being an artist and to reality, is expressed in the formal characteristics of its works, but also in its everyday practice, in the way works were created and exhibited, the way artists operated and presented themselves. The Nul artists aimed to shed the stereotyped image of the bohemian in a painting smock and had a fresh attitude toward the consumer society, quite {{at odds with the}} artistic scene of the early 1960s. Nul was a search for new relationships between art and reality, with at its base the rejection of uniqueness, authenticity and decorative attractiveness in the traditional sense of the word. The group reduced the multi-coloured to the monochrome and opted for repetition, seriality and the directness of everyday materials and objects, in use and effect. Even its conceptual aspect, the splitting of thought and action, of conception, production as well as the possibility of repeat production was, in the footsteps of Marcel Duchamp, linked to a different interpretation of ideas like craftsmanship and expertise. At the Amsterdam Stedelijk Museum in 1962, for instance, Armando and Jan Henderikse left the setting up of their installations to museum staff, and in 1965, at Peeters’s request, Yayoi Kusama produced a work in his material, <b>card</b> <b>sliver,</b> a spun synthetic fibre. ‘The process of creation is [...] [...] [...] completely unimportant and uninteresting; a machine can do it,’ Peeters said. ‘The personal element lies in the idea and no longer in the manufacture.’The identity of the Dutch Nul group navigated between a cheerful orientation toward the world of the everyday and the cool sobriety of the serial monochrome. Whereas the German Zero artists were still ‘painting’ with the elements, with the effects of fire, light, shadow, movement and reflection, the Nul artist preferred to let reality speak for itself by isolating it, usually in raw form. Among the Dutchmen, only Henk Peeters worked with the elements water and fire - although Peeters saw his ‘pyrographs’, soot and scorch marks on various surfaces, as a typically Nul solution to the elimination of any excessively personal element: to work with the fickleness of a flame is ‘[...] [...] {{to let go of the}} work and to become the spectator of a self-directed performance.’ [...] In terms of form, Peeters’s tactile cotton balls, whether on a canvas or on a wall as a three-dimensional installation, are balanced on the cusp between Nul and the German Zero. 'It is not our job to educate, any more than it is our job to convey messages,’ said Piero Manzoni in 1960. This might as easily have been a statement by Henk Peeters, by Jan Henderikse and even by the German Zero group. And yet the sober-minded outlook of the Dutchmen distinguished itself from the German Zero. ‘Yes, I dream of a better world. Should I dream of a worse?’ wrote Otto Piene in ‘Paths to Paradise’ in 1961. [...] With their clear-eyed view of reality, the members of Nul were not dreaming of the world, neither a better nor a worse, and certainly not of ‘paths to paradise’. During the Nul period, radicalism and a sincerely felt admiration for what was new and contemporary went hand in hand; nimble provocation is what Nul seemed to have a patent on.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: SLIVER {{cells are}} thin, {{single-crystal}} silicon solar cells fabricated using standard fabrication technology. SLIVER modules, composed {{of several thousand}} individual <b>SLIVER</b> cells, <b>can</b> be efficient, low cost, bifacial, transparent, flexible, shadow-tolerant and lightweight. Compared with current conventional PV technology, mature SLIVER Technology will need less than 10 % of the pure silicon, and fewer than 5 % of the wafer starts per MWp of factory output. There are two distinct challenges for SLIVER technology: devising a robust cell fabrication method for high yield, high efficiency SLIVER cells, suitable for transfer to industry; and handling, electrically interconnecting, and encapsulating billions of SLIVER cells at low cost. We have recently fabricated SLIVER cells with efficiencies exceeding 20 % using an optimised process. We {{believe this is the}} first commercial thin crystalline-type technology to reach 20 % efficiency. We believe there is a path to laboratory cell efficiencies of 22 % and commercially-produced cell efficiencies of 21 %. A 100 MWp SLIVER factory will produce several billion individual SLIVER cells annually. We have developed a sub-module technology for rapid, reliable, and low-cost assembly of arrays of SLIVER cells to form two main types of conventional solar cell analogues that, because of their appearance, we call “Rafts ” and “Sheets”. Using our invention, Rafts and Sheets can be reliably produced at high speed using low-cost equipment and entirely conventional materials, and can be assembled into solar power modules using simple adaptations of conventional solar cell handling and stringing equipment...|$|R
40|$|Three {{seasons of}} {{fieldwork}} at Charlie Lake Cave, British Columbia, have revealed {{a sequence of}} stratified deposits that spans the Late Pleistocene and entire Holocene. Analyses of sediments, radiocarbon dates, faunal remains, and artifacts show that the site was first occupied by people at about 10 500 B. P., when local environments were more open than today. By 9500 B. P., boreal forest had moved into the area, and human use of the site was minimal until about 7000 B. P., when a brief occupation of the site probably included a human burial. Use of the site intensified after about 4500 B. P., possibly because the cave became more accessible. The site was used both as a residential base camp and as a more temporary hunting station or lookout.   Article Summary by Jonathan C. Driver, May 2015   After we had completed our excavations in 1991 {{we decided that we}} should focus on writing up what we had excavated, and not undertake further excavations at the site. This paper was written to summarize our state of knowledge about the archaeological remains at the site, and focused on describing the stone tools, the overall stratigraphy, and the dating. The stratigraphic summary replaced earlier work based on the 1983 excavations, {{and we were able to}} refine our dating of the site as a result of more radiocarbon dates. The different cultural periods were based mainly on the work done by Martin Handly for his M. A. thesis at Trent University. The long list of authors reflects the need for a team approach to archaeological work, and include the project directors (Knut Fladmark and Jon Driver), stone tool analysis and development of the cultural sequence (Martin Handly), animal bone analysis (Randall Preston and Jon Driver), sediment analysis (Greg Sullivan and Knut Fladmark), and radiocarbon dating (Erle Nelson). The most important aspect of the site is that it preserves a very rare record of humanly made artifacts dating from the end of the last ice age (at least 10, 500 BC) to very recent times. The many layers at the site allow us to separate the different cultural periods. Good preservation of bone allowed us to submit radiocarbon dates that provide approximate ages for the various cultures that used the site. The artifacts that exhibit the most change through time are projectile points – the sharp stone tips for spears, darts and arrows. In much of western Canada it is difficult to date archaeological sites, because many of them are found in shallow soils where radiocarbon dating is difficult for two reasons. First, animal bone is often not preserved due to the acidic nature of the soils. Second, although charcoal is often found, it cannot be reliably associated with human activity, because natural forest fires also produce charcoal. As a result, archaeologists look at the style of the projectile points to assign approximate ages. Tse’K’wa provides an opportunity to link artifacts of different styles to radiocarbon dates in a site with many distinct layers. So Tse’K’wa is a foundation for understanding the sequence of different cultures in the region. The article also discusses the possible early presence of microblade technology. Microblades are the most efficient way of producing a cutting edge when the base technology is chipped stone. A small piece of high-quality raw material (known as the core) is shaped in such a way that numerous parallel-sided <b>slivers</b> of stone <b>can</b> be removed. These “microblades” can then be hafted in wood or antler to form knives or arrow barbs. The concept is rather like our utility knives that have replaceable blades. This technology allows people to carry small quantities of high quality stone with them, ensuring that they always have a sharp blade available. Not all archaeologists agree that the early microblade core from Tse’K’wa is part of this technology, because it doesn’t conform to the classic methods of core manufacture. However, we argue that evidence for the removal of microblades is very obvious, and the lack of classic core preparation is because of the tabular nature of the raw material. The paper also introduces some information about animal bones, including the raven burials, evidence for environmental change, and the presence of collared lemming. These topics were subsequently explored in more detail in other papers...|$|R
