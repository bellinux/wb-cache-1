40|$|A {{fundamental}} assumption in neuroscience is that {{brain function}} is constrained by its structural properties. This motivates {{the idea that}} the brain can be parcellated into functionally coherent regions based on anatomical connectivity patterns that capture how different areas are interconnected. Several studies have successfully implemented this idea in humans using diffusion weighted MRI, allowing parcellation to be conducted in vivo. Two distinct approaches to connectivity-based parcellation can be identified. The first uses the <b>connection</b> <b>profiles</b> of brain regions as a feature vector, and groups brain regions with similar <b>connection</b> <b>profiles</b> together. Alternatively, one may adopt a network perspective that aims to identify clusters of brain regions that show dense within-cluster and sparse between-cluster connectivity. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model for connectivity-based parcellation that unifies both approaches. Using the model we are able to obtain a parcellation of the human brain whose clusters may adhere to either interpretation. We find that parts of the connectome consistently cluster as densely connected components, while other parts consistently result in clusters with similar connections. Interestingly, the densely connected components consist predominantly of major cortical areas, while the clusters with similar <b>connection</b> <b>profiles</b> consist of regions that have previously been identified as the ‘rich club’; regions known for their integrative role in connectivity. Furthermore, the probabilistic model allows quantification of the uncertainty in cluster assignments. We show that, while most clusters are clearly delineated, some regions are more difficult to assign. These results indicate that care should be taken when interpreting connectivity-based parcellations obtained using alternative deterministic procedures...|$|R

The parcellation is performed in two steps. First, the cortical mantle is split at a macroscopic level into 36 large gyri using a sulcus recognition system.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of object binding-by-synchronization {{in the visual}} cortex has been supported by recent experiments in awake monkeys. They demonstrated coherence among gamma-activities (30 – 90 Hz) of local neural groups and its perceptual modulation {{according to the rules}} of figure-ground segregation. Interactions within and between these neural groups are based on axonal spike conduction with finite velocities. Physiological studies confirmed that the majority of transmission delays is comparable to the temporal scale defined by gamma-activity (11 – 33 ms). How do these finite velocities influence the development of synaptic connections within and between visual areas? What is the relationship between the range of gamma-coherence and the velocity of signal transmission? Are these large temporal delays compatible with recently discovered phenomenon of gamma-waves traveling across larger parts of the primary visual cortex? The refinement of connections in the immature visual cortex depends on temporal Hebbian learning to adjust synaptic efficacies between spiking neurons. The impact of constant, finite, axonal spike conduction velocities on this process was investigated using a set of topographic network models. Random spike trains with a confined temporal correlation width mimicked cortical activity before visual experience. After learning, the lateral connectivity within one network layer became spatially restricted, the width of the <b>connection</b> <b>profile</b> being directly proportional to the lateral conduction velocity. Furthermore, restricted feedforward divergence developed between neurons of two successive layers. The size of this <b>connection</b> <b>profile</b> matched the lateral <b>connection</b> <b>profile</b> of the lower layer neuron. The mechanism in this network model is suitable to explain the emergence of larger receptive fields at higher visual areas while preserving a retinotopic mapping. The influence of finite conduction velocities on the local generation of gamma-activities and their spatial synchronization was investigated in a model of a mature visual area. Sustained input and local inhibitory feedback was sufficient for the emergence of coherent gamma-activity that extended across few millimeters. Conduction velocities had a direct impact on the frequency of gamma-oscillations, but did neither affect gamma-power nor the spatial extent of gamma-coherence. Adding long-range horizontal connections between excitatory neurons, as found in layer 2 / 3 of the primary visual cortex, increased the spatial range of gamma-coherence. The range was maximal for zero transmission delays, and for all distances attenuated with finite, decreasing lateral conduction velocities. Below a velocity of 0. 5 m/s, gamma-power and gamma-coherence were even smaller than without these connections at all, i. e., slow horizontal connections actively desynchronized neural populations. In conclusion, the enhancement of gamma-coherence by horizontal excitatory connections critically depends on fast conduction velocities. Coherent gamma-activity in the primary visual cortex and the accompanying models was found to only cover small regions of the visual field. This challenges the role of gamma-synchronization to solve the binding problem for larger object representations. Further analysis of the previous model revealed that the patches of coherent gamma-activity (1. 8 mm half-height decline) were part of more globally occurring gamma-waves, which coupled over much larger distances (6. 3 mm half-height decline). The model gamma-waves observed here are very similar to those found in the primary visual cortex of awake monkeys, indicating that local recurrent inhibition and restricted horizontal connections with finite axonal velocities are sufficient requirements for their emergence. In conclusion, since the model is in accordance with the connectivity and gamma-processes in the primary visual cortex, the results support the hypothesis that gamma-waves provide a generalized concept for object binding in the visual cortex...|$|E

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) is a highly {{specified}} structure, involved in a large range of function, from sensory processing to motor behavior to cognition. The CNS development is genetically programmed but also heavily dependent on environmental cues. The CNS is a highly plastic structure, most prominently at the synaptic level. Plasticity is a physiological process allowing a rapid change of synaptic strength depending on experience, use and surrounding neuronal activity. It allows the integration of neurons into neuronal networks and is also {{believed to be the}} mechanism underlying learning and memory. During development, plasticity underlies the adaptation to the environment, via synapse refinement, and experience-dependent plasticity. Synapse refinement, together with input competition, is marked by synapse pruning and formation, to eliminate early-formed redundant synaptic contacts. Located in the occipital part of the brain, the cerebellum is involved in motor control and coordination, motor learning and memory, as well as cognition. Endowed with a very peculiar cytoarchitecture, the cerebellar circuitry is centered around Purkinje Cells (PC). PCs integrate inputs arising from the two main afferents to the cerebellum, with a direct connection for climbing fibers (CF), with a relay of the parallel fibers (PF) for the mossy fibers. In the mature cerebellum, each PC is innervated by an unique CF and this strong connection {{is the result of a}} very precise developmental process. Early on, PCs are innervated by multiple CFs. This situation evolves to the mature <b>connection</b> <b>profile</b> through a well-characterized four stages process, which is highly dependent on the proper development of other connections to PCs, notably the PF-PC synapse. We studied this process in a model for disturbed cerebellar maturation. Nogo-A is a major neurite outgrowth inhibitor of the CNS. It has been principally studied in CNS injuries, where it restricts the capacity of axons to grow and regenerate. In the cerebellum, the absence of Nogo alters the development of the PF-PC synapse, but does not alter the elimination process of supernumerary CFs. At P 14 as well as P 28, the proportion of reminiscent supernumerary CF is not affected by the lack of Nogo-A. However, it remains to test how the absence of Nogo-A and its effect of the maturation of PF-PC synapse affect the cerebellar physiology. Neurodevelopmental disorders have been linked to defects in cellular physiology in numerous areas of the brain. Lately, several studies revealed that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can be linked to defects in several synaptic proteins, involved in maintaining the structure and anchoring of synaptic contacts. Amongst others, it has been shown that proteins such as neuroligins exhibit genetic alterations in ASD and are responsible for defects in cerebellar physiology. Neuroligin 3 is an adhesion molecule, present at the postsynaptic site, forming a trans-synaptic complex with neurexins, present on the presynaptic site. This complex is essential for synapse stabilization and function, but not for synapse formation. Defects in cerebellar plasticity have been associated with particular deficits observed in ASD patients. Plasticity in the cerebellum is a developmental process and is inducible by a wide range of protocols. We studied the effect of the absence of neuroligin 3 on long-term depression (LTD) at PF – PC synapses, a well-established model for cerebellar plasticity. In neuroligin 3 KO mice, our stimulation protocol did not produce a decrease of the evoked response in the adult, while a clear reduction was observed in young (P 21 - 30) mice. In WT mice, our stimulation protocol induced a clear decrease of the response in the adult, but not in young mice. Our results suggest that the occlusion of mGluR-LTD observed in adult KO mice is a developmental process. Determining the subtleties underlying this developmental process is a major importance for the development of new treatment strategies in ASD. The visual cortex is a part of the brain that has been extensively studied, because of the ability to record and image neuronal activation upon presentation of clearly defined sensory inputs, but also because of a peculiar time-window for enhanced experience-dependent plasticity. This critical period is characterized by the ability for monocular deprivation to induce the strengthening of the input from the open eye, at the expense of those from the closed eye. Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is an activity-dependent plastic process playing an important role in the adaptation of cortical connectivity to the flow of inputs neurons receive. In STDP, the polarity and the amplitude of the response vary according to the relative timing between the presynaptic input and the postsynaptic backpropagating action potential (bAP). We tested if bAPs and STDP were subject to any modifications between several time-points of the critical period. Our results revealed that when pairing a presynaptic spike with the postsynaptic train of bAPs, at a positive timing, the amplitude of the response observed varied throughout the critical period. Our results show that bAPs and STDP are mechanisms of premier importance for the cellular integration of inputs. These two mechanisms participate in sensory input integration, as well as development and refinement of cellular connections during the critical period, in V 1 layer 2 / 3 pyramidal cells. In summary, my thesis reveals important insights on neuronal physiology and factors implicated in synapse refinement and activity-dependent plasticity, during development...|$|E

Recently, new models were also introduced in order to characterize connection patterns in networks through mixed memberships. This work was motivated by the need of analyzing a historical network where a partition of the vertices is given and where edges are typed. A known partition {{is seen as a}} decomposition of a network into sub-graphs that we propose to model using a stochastic model with un-known latent clusters. Each subgraph has its own mixing vector and sees its vertices associated to the clusters. The vertices then connect with a probability depending on the subgraphs only, while the types of the edges are assumed to be sampled from the latent clusters...|$|R
