6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Crawford, after {{a course}} of rapid {{questions}} and reluctant answers; [...] "I am happier than I was, because I now understand more clearly your opinion of me. You think me unsteady: easily swayed by the whim of the moment, easily tempted, easily put aside. With such an opinion, no wonder that. But we shall see. It is not by protestations that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged; it is not by telling you that my affections are steady. My conduct shall speak for me; absence, distance, time shall speak for me. They shall prove that, {{as far as you}} can be deserved by anybody, I do deserve you. You are infinitely my superior in merit; all that I know. You have qualities which I had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature. You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what--not merely beyond what one sees, because one never sees anything like it--but beyond what one fancies might be. But still I am not frightened. It is not by equality of merit that you can be won. That is out of the question. It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest, who loves you most devotedly, that has the best right to a return. There I build my confidence. By that right I do and will deserve you; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I declare it, I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes. Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny. Nay" [...] (seeing her draw back displeased), [...] "forgive me. Perhaps I have as yet no right; but by what other name <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>you?</b> Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other? No, it is 'Fanny' that I think of all day, and dream of all night. You have given the name such reality of sweetness, that nothing else can now be descriptive of you." ...|$|E

I Have to Dispose of the Body." [...] The Henry Clay People were also featured in a 2010 episode of the television series Parenthood entitled [...] "Date Night." [...] The band appeared in the episode as themselves and a portion of the episode was said to be set at The Henry Clay People's album release party. The songs [...] "This Ain't a Scene" [...] and [...] "Working Part-Time" [...] were played on the show.|$|E

5000|$|... "Starlight" [...] is {{the second}} single from the album. It was {{released}} 6 June 2011 in Ireland and United Kingdom. The song debuted at number 57 on the UK Singles Chart. Unreality Shout gave the single [...] saying: [...] "A more sophisticated effort. It recalls the sound of girl bands from the 90's, perhaps a little too much" [...] Entertainment Focus added: [...] "The track is similar in style to the band's debut single with each girl getting the opportunity to sing a few lines. A driving beat moves the song through the verses to a radio-friendly chorus whilst the girls showcases impressive vocal prowess. The end result is something more mature than Girls Aloud or The Saturdays and perhaps {{a little closer to}} The Corrs at their peak." [...] Totally Vivid stated: [...] "It starts slow and subtle before launching into a soaring, spacey chorus - properly epic in all sense of the word. The chorus of 'I wanna dance underneath your light, cos you pull me in like you're on my side. When I die in the day, I'm revived at night. <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>you</b> mine,' is just amazing; one of those real bliss on the dancefloor moments. And just {{at the end of the}} clip you can hear the beginnings of a dub-step breakdown. The mix just got even better. What I really love is that as dancey as this version is, it retains enough pop sensibility that it could just as easily be presented as the radio version of the track. In terms of the studio version, it's got a real drive to it and like Not A Love Song, really plays to the strengths of the girls' impressive harmonies. The music video was directed by Nigel Dick and was shot over three days (13-15 April 2011) around the Salton Sea area in Brawley, Glamis, Los Angeles, California, the production was a massive challenge for the director and his team - battling 35 degrees of dry heat and threatened by gales of 75mphâ€¦ It sees the band embark on a Californian road trip in their 1970's Airstream RV. It premiered on both UK music channels and on YouTube in May 2011. iheartmusic described it [...] "as a shiny new video, mainly different clips of the ladies having a laugh with each other and a bit of singing in between. I love the hilarious footage of them marching up, then rolling down, the sand dunes - also, don't ask Jodi if you can have some of her ice cream, she will splat you on the nose with it!" [...] Same with [...] "Not a Love Song", a remix bundle from 7th Heaven, Club Junkies, and now TM Cosmos and was publicly leaked but was not officially released.|$|E
