40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of concentrically braced steel frames and moment resisting steel frames during the January 17, 1994, Northridge, California, earthquake is examined. Most of the observations {{made during the}} reconnaissance visits confirmed the current knowledge on the inelastic response of these structural systems. This permits the anticipation of proper seismic behavior for buildings designed according to the seismic provisions that have been recently introduced in the Canadian building code and standard for steel structures. In some cases, however, the observed damage raised concerns that should be addressed in future investigations or next editions of these codes. Preventing potentially hazardous nonstructural damage, avoiding premature nonductile failures anywhere along the lateral load paths, limiting structural and nonstructural damage due to brace buckling, and accounting for the vertical ground motion are among those issues. Key words: earthquake, seismic, steel, concentrically braced frames, moment resisting frames, weld.

40|$|The French {{engineer}} Robert Le Ricolais (1894 - 1977) is at {{the forefront}} of the inventors of spatial structures of the 20 th Century. He practically built only models and ephemeral buildings, during his life shared between France and the USA. However, in May 2017, we found in Cameroon one of the twin large warehouses that he had erected in 1950 for the Ministry of Finances of the former french colony. Tracing the production of its projects and real-scale models, built in France for exhibitions or Post-War experimentations, this article introduces the « garage » of Yaounde among the theories and practices of the engineer, who was considered by his friend Louis Kahn and by a variety of French architects like Laprade, Pingusson, Prouvé, Huet, Chemetov, Emmerich and Mimram, like one of the most important source for their own architectural design and work. Thus, this only testimony existing in the world of a big wood and metal APLEX structure (a spatial concept patented by Le Ricolais) represents an important moment of the History of Construction and Architecture. One of its former student at Penn, the professor Peter McCleary, has reported in 1994 on the methods adopted by the engineer. He wrote: « Le Ricolais accepted the engineer's task of minimizing the potential energy of the loading and maximizing the strain energy of the structure. To reach this goal of "infinite span, zero weight" he built interminable comparisons of opposed solutions to a project, believing that deductions and propositions must prove themselves, and not be mere seduction or good intentions; they must come to the facts. » The warehouse in Yaounde is the only survivor of these "facts" of Le Ricolais. The building, called « garage administratif », covers some 36 700 square feet (328 x 112 feet), over the River Mingoa, in the neighborhood of the Municipal Lake. Surprisingly, after 68 seasons of equatorial rainfall, after periods of violent winds, after some years of poor maintenance, its state of preservation is pretty good, whether its concrete base, the pieces of wood of its framework or the metal connecting elements. This testifies of the foreknowledge of its architectural design and of its high quality construction. Nevertheless, this amazing building is nowadays extremely threatened, for several reasons. The first is the total lack of interest or study on this garage during more than 67 years: we hope that after our research, this point will be no longer a problem. The second point is that these very past years, the twin-building near this one has been destroyed without any protest of anyone. The third is that there is a new big project for the urban redevelopment of the Mingoa Valley, in which the warehouse by Le Ricolais is totally unknown and neglected. La redécouverte en mai 2017 du garage administratif de Yaoundé, le rescapé des deux hangars construits au Cameroun selon le brevet APLEX de l'ingénieur Robert Le Ricolais (1894 - 1977), ouvre un champ d’observation et de réflexion sur l’architecture qui outrepasse l’intérêt historique de ce bâtiment. En effet c’est le seul survivant des grands ouvrages singuliers de cet ingénieur qui a révolutionné le champ de la morphologie des structures en inventant les premières <b>charpentes</b> tridimensionnelles. Quasiment non documenté à ce jour, le garage administratif fait l’objet de cet article, qui le situe parmi les travaux et les recherches de Le Ricolais avant son départ pour les USA en 1951 et démontre les menaces qui pèsent sur sa survie...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the heart}} of the Loire valley, Orleans offers the image of a town widely rebuilt after the 100 years war, {{scattered}} with residences and town houses dating from the Renaissance. In many areas of the town centre, the successive town-planning operations, and bombing of the second world war contributed towards the change in building. This last element also lead to a lack of documentation due to the destruction of {{a large part of the}} County Archives in 1940. The examination of the former iconographical data, crossed with the excavations of the past 30 years and the building analysis recently carried out, have enabled us to rediscover part of the medieval dwellings previous to the siege of 1429, and the important economic rise that immediately followed. This article does not propose any final result, but the first results on this particular subject. This presentation deals firstly with cellars, which often constitute the sole element remaining from these buildings. The heterogynous aspect due to the numerous modifications of these spaces makes the use of building archaeology necessary in each different case, before any attempt of characterisation or typology. A systematic analysis of the cellars situated on either side of a “test street” (rue des Trois-Maries) revealed an important number of cellars built in the 13 th and 14 th centuries, whereas the elevations of the houses appeared to have been modified during Modern Times. The comparison with other cellars located in the neighbouring blocks indicates that the potential is important despite the absence of a systematic inventory at the scale of the town. The study of the cellars confirms the fact that the plots already existed in the 13 th century, and in certain sectors does not seem to have fluctuated since that time. Along with this duration of the plot also appears a correspondence between the cellar and the constructed area of a parcel. Except in a few particular cases, the walls of cellars serve as foundation to the existing buildings. These cellars are sometimes composed of several levels (3 maximum), the lowest of which can have a very irregular plan and often correspond to some ancient quarries. However, the building analysis as shown as well that the inferior level of some of the cellars had been bored below a pre-existing cellar. These cellars present a large diversity of vaults, mainly cross-ribbed vaults, but also groined vaults, lowered cradle vaults reinforced with transverse ribs, and sometimes some plain ceilings. In the case of large scale plans, these vaults are sometimes reinforced with isolated supports such as pillars or columns (Fig. 1). The economic process of reuse remains quite limited, and meticulous construction making use of specific techniques, such as the systematic use of springing stones or the base of cross-ribbed vaults, or of the discharging arches reinforcing the stability of the walls can be noticed. As many techniques that reveal an elaborated building logic, and that enable one to make comparison with other categories of the town’s buildings. The exterior openings are quite numerous (straight stairs accessible from the front door opening onto the street or sometimes the courtyard, traps, basement windows) (Fig. 1). The openings, plus the quality of the interior decoration of the cellars (neat mouldings, capital with plant-like ornamentation, brackets sculpted with human faces or animal, but also murals) open in due time the question of the use of these spaces in the general economy of a house. Finally, it is possible to make the link between these cellars and the building situated above through the examples of remaining or known elevations (Fig. 2). These houses are characterized by the use of course of medium sized stones of Beauce hard limestone for the face of the walls, the systematic us of lintel broadened in their center for the doors (often pedimented lintels), coach doors (or arcades) of “broken” vault, and windows divided in two lights for the upper levels underlined by a ledge height string-course and an impost string-courseAu sein de la vallée de la Loire, Orléans offre l’image d’une ville en grande partie reconstruite après la guerre de Cent ans, parsemée de ses maisons et hôtels de la Renaissance. Une partie de l’habitat antérieur au siège de la ville de 1429 a pu être redécouverte grâce aux analyses de bâti menées depuis les années 2000 dans le cadre de travaux universitaires, qui sont croisées à la relecture des sources iconographiques et aux résultats des fouilles urbaines réalisées depuis la fin des années 1970. L’exposé s’attache tout d’abord à rappeler brièvement les éléments qui caractérisent certaines élévations de ces bâtiments médiévaux (modes de construction, structures et décors des ouvertures, <b>charpentes,</b> etc.). Mais, ce sont les espaces situés en sous-sol qui constituent souvent les témoins les plus tangibles de cet habitat médiéval, lorsque les élévations en surface ont été reconstruites ou profondément remaniées à une époque ultérieure. Sous l’appellation générale de « caves », il convient en fait de distinguer plusieurs espaces : les « salles basses excavées », s’apparentant à des celliers, au-dessous desquelles se trouvent parfois une ou plusieurs « caves », réparties sur un ou deux niveaux. L’étude des « caves » apporte un nouveau regard sur l’évolution de la ville médiévale d’Orléans. Elle indique que la trame parcellaire actuelle était déjà en grande partie fixée vers le 13 e siècle dans bien des quartiers. Elle permet également de restituer un paysage urbain irrégulier, où des maisons étroites sur parcellaire laniéré côtoient quelques grands logis barlongs en front ou en retrait de la voie publique. L’étude des caves et salles basses excavées nous renseignent également sur les habitants de ces maisons...|$|E
