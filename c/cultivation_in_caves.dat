5000|$|Trogloxene cannot live {{permanently}} <b>in</b> <b>caves,</b> but {{may enter}} caves and spend {{parts of their}} life cycles <b>in</b> <b>caves.</b> Unusual South African Tettigoniidae in a few genera such as Cederbergeniana are trogloxenes that feed on plants by night and shelter <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> by day.|$|R

30|$|Clone {{libraries}} {{were constructed}} {{to determine the}} bacterial community composition in the soil samples collected as described above. The names of clone libraries were designated as Pre-treatment, UTC (untreated control, or irrigated without wheat bran incorporation), UTC-Spinach (after spinach <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> UTC), BSD (wheat bran BSD-treatment), BSD-Spinach (after spinach <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> BSD-treated soil), CP, and CP-Spinach (after spinach <b>cultivation</b> <b>in</b> CP-treated soil).|$|R
2500|$|Many of the figural and {{ornamental}} carvings <b>in</b> <b>Cave</b> 20 {{are similar}} to Cave 19, {{and to a lesser}} degree to those found <b>in</b> <b>Cave</b> 17. This may be because the same architects and artisans were responsible for the evolution of the three caves. The door frames <b>in</b> <b>Cave</b> 20 are quasi-structural, something unique at the Ajanta site. The decorations are also innovative <b>in</b> <b>Cave</b> 20, such as one showing the Buddha seated against two pillows and [...] "a richly laden mango tree behind him", states Spink.|$|R

50|$|Causeyella causeyae, Causey's cave millipede, is a millipede, ghostly {{white in}} color, which was first noticed, but not identified, in 1964.

25|$|Contrary to {{what the}} {{scientific}} name (Pan troglodytes) may suggest, chimpanzees do not typically spend their time <b>in</b> <b>caves,</b> {{but there have been}} reports of some of them seeking refuge <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> because of the heat during daytime.|$|R
40|$|The Trichoptera {{from the}} group “Stenophylax” are {{frequent}} <b>in</b> <b>caves.</b> Until now, following Jeannel’s thought (1926), most authors believed that these animals were found <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> by hazard and were doomed to perish in them. With {{the use of a}} light trap it is now demonstrated that cavernicolous Trichoptera not only stay <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> during the entire summer, but also that during autumn (September-October) they leave the caves to lay their eggs in the nearby rivers...|$|R

50|$|Many {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the scribe who copied 4Q175 also copied the Community Rule (1QS) found <b>in</b> <b>Cave</b> 1 {{as well as a}} Samuel manuscript also found <b>in</b> <b>Cave</b> 4. All have been dated by the style of script (palaeography) to the Hasmonean period.|$|R
50|$|Oilbirds are nocturnal. During the day {{the birds}} rest on cave ledges and leave at night to find fruit outside the cave. It was once thought that oilbirds only roosted <b>in</b> <b>caves,</b> and indeed never saw daylight, but studies using GPS/acceleration loggers found that non-breeding birds only roosted <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> or other rock shelters one night in three, the other nights {{roosting}} in trees. The scientists responsible for the discovery also found that birds roosting <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> were highly active through the night, whereas birds roosting in the forest were far less active. They hypothesised that each environment carried costs; birds roosting in the forest were more vulnerable to predators and birds roosting <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> expended considerable energy competing with rivals and defending nesting and roosting ledges.|$|R
