25|$|As {{part of a}} 2002 {{marketing}} campaign, {{the plant}} conservation charity Plantlife chose the <b>cuckooflower</b> as the county flower. Previously, a sheaf of golden wheat was the county emblem, {{a reference to the}} Earl of Chester's arms in use from the 12th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} laid singly {{on a wide}} range of food plants {{including}} hedge mustard (Sisybrium officinale), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), <b>cuckooflower</b> (Cardamine pratense), water-cress (Rorippa nastutium-aquaticum), charlock (Sinapis arvensis), large bitter-cress (Cardamine amara), wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum), and so it is rarely a pest in gardens or field crops. The caterpillar is green and well camouflaged. When full grown it is green above with black warts, from which arise whitish and blackish hairs. There is a darker line along the back and a yellow line low down on the sides. Underneath the colour is whitish-grey. The spiracular line is dusky but not conspicuous, and the spiracles are blackish surrounded with yellow. There is extensive overlap with other leaf-feeding larvae of large and small whites in some wild populations (e.g. in Morocco). It is often found feeding on the same plant as the orange tip but rarely competes for food because it usually feeds on the leaves whereas the orange tip caterpillar feeds on the flowers and developing seed pods. Like other Pieris species it overwinters as a pupa. This is green in colour, and the raised parts are yellowish and brown. This is the most frequent form, but it varies through yellowish to buff or greyish, and is sometimes without markings.|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} area is now unimproved and cowslip, tormentil, <b>cuckooflower</b> and bird's-foot-trefoil flourish. The bee orchid {{has also been}} recorded.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is flower-rich wet grassland. Flora include common spotted orchids, <b>cuckooflowers,</b> meadowsweets, marsh-marigolds and ragged-robins. There {{are also}} grass snakes and birds such as blackcaps.|$|R
50|$|This {{traditional}} {{hay meadow}} has over 100 plant species, including lady's bedstraw, green winged orchids and <b>cuckooflowers.</b> It also has {{many species of}} butterfly, such as orange tip and rare black and brown hairstreaks. other wildlife includes brown hares, kestrels and moths.|$|R
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} in spring {{supports}} Wood Anemone, <b>Cuckooflower,</b> Bluebell, Ramsons, Herb-Paris and frequent Toothwort which is parasitic on the mature hazel coppice.|$|E
50|$|The area to {{the south}} of the central {{embankment}} is marshland, damp and water-logged. Rushes are abundant, and plants include Marsh-marigold, <b>Cuckooflower,</b> Meadow-sweet, Ragged-robin, Lesser Spearwort and Common Marsh-bedstraw.|$|E
50|$|Its {{common name}} <b>cuckooflower</b> {{derives from the}} {{formation}} of the plant's flowers at around {{the same time as the}} arrival each spring of the first cuckoos in the British Isles.|$|E
5000|$|Cardamine pratensis (<b>cuckooflower</b> or lady's smock), is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family Brassicaceae, native throughout most of Europe and Western Asia. The specific name pratensis is Latin for [...] "meadow." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{woodland}} of oak and hazel {{is clearly}} old, as {{are some of}} the hedges, and there are plants indicative of ancient woodland, such as wood-sedge. Parts of the grassland are herb rich, with wild flowers such as <b>cuckooflower.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{part of a}} 2002 {{marketing}} campaign, {{the plant}} conservation charity Plantlife chose the <b>cuckooflower</b> as the county flower. Previously, a sheaf of golden wheat was the county emblem, {{a reference to the}} Earl of Chester's arms in use from the 12th century.|$|E
50|$|This {{unimproved}} meadow {{is located}} on heavy alluvial soils {{at the bottom of}} a valley. It has a rich variety of flora, including the herbs cowslip, <b>cuckooflower</b> and ragged robin, together with the largest population in East Anglia of the rare snake's head fritillary.|$|E
50|$|The hedgerow {{supports}} a diverse woodland flora which includes wood anemone, bluebell, ramsons (wood garlic), nettle-leaved bellflower and wood millet. The hedge comprises hawthorn, buckthorn, dogwood, hazel, ash, spindle and traveller's-joy. The fields support grassland flowers such as common fleabane, agrimony, <b>cuckooflower,</b> marjoram and bulbous buttercup.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a diverse}} range of bog and {{marshland}} plants recorded. These include marsh St John's-wort {{which is the only}} known occurrence in Gloucestershire. Species such as marsh violet, slender tufted-sedge, common cotton-grass and marsh pennywort flourish. Other species such as lesser spearwort, <b>cuckooflower</b> and ragged robin are present.|$|E
50|$|Natural England, in {{its report}} of May 2011, reports the {{coverage}} and density of the flowering as being 75% of the whole field and between 40% to 60% cover. Other species recorded in the meadow are lesser celandine, common sorrel, <b>cuckooflower</b> and creeping buttercup. The presence of {{a significant number of}} bumblebees was noted.|$|E
50|$|Great burnet, Sanguisorba officinalis, {{is present}} in abundance, as are herbs such as sneezewort, Achillea ptarmica, <b>cuckooflower,</b> Cardamine pratensis, meadowsweet, Filipendula ulmaria, and common spotted orchid, Dactylorhiza fuchsii. Grasses include sweet vernal-grass, Anthoxanthum odoratum, common bent, Agrostis capillaris, and downy oat-grass, Avenula pubescens. There are also a notable variety of sedges, {{including}} glaucous sedge, Carex flacca, hairy sedge, C. hirta, tawny sedge, C. hostiana, carnation sedge, C. panicea, and flea sedge, C. pulicaris.|$|E
5000|$|Linmer Moss (...) {{is unusual}} within Delamere Forest {{in having a}} fen {{environment}} which is not dominated by Sphagnum species. The vegetation is predominantly tussock sedge and reedmace. Marsh fern and white sedge, which are rare in Cheshire, are found here; other species include <b>cuckooflower,</b> marsh bedstraw, marsh cinquefoil and Sphagnum squarrosum. The site has experienced rapid changes in water levels during its history, and contains the trunks of birch trees which died when the area flooded. It is now being colonised by alder and willow.|$|E
50|$|Freshwater marshes {{exist in}} many places around the shore but {{extensive}} reed-beds stretching out into the lake are rare. The margins of the marshes are mostly sedge dominated by such species as bottle sedge, bladder-sedge, tufted-sedge, common-sedge and occasionally water-sedge, water horsetail, marsh cinquefoil and bur-reeds also occur commonly. Also on the fringes occurs a more varied community characteristic of base-poor areas, with such species as marsh ragwort, lesser spearwort, devils-bit scaboius, marsh bedstraw and hoary willowherb, creeping bent, sweet vernal-grass, Yorkshire fog and purple moor-grass. <b>Cuckooflower</b> occurs commonly and bog violet and greater spearwort {{are to be found}} in places.|$|E
50|$|Great Oakley Meadow is a 1.9 hectare Local Nature Reserve in Great Oakley, on the {{southern}} outskirts of Corby in Northamptonshire. It is managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. The prominent medieval ridge and furrow at {{the southern}} end of the site displays the ancient field system of Great Oakley. The dry ridges have diverse flora including cowslip, knapweed and quaking-grass. The furrows are poorer in species, while the northern end, which borders Harpers Brook, has plants characteristic of wet ground, such as <b>cuckooflower</b> and hairy sedge. The field is bordered by hedges, which provide seeds and insects for birds.|$|E
50|$|The female lays eggs singly on the flowerheads of <b>cuckooflower</b> (Cardamine pratensis) {{and garlic}} mustard (Alliaria petiolata) {{and many other}} species of wild crucifers, all of which contain {{substances}} called glucosinolates. Females are attracted to larger flowers, such as Hesperis matronalis, even though some such species are poor larval hosts. Selection of foodplants is triggered {{by the presence of}} mustard oils and their derivative glucosinolates, which (in Pierinae) are detected by chemosensory hairs on the fore-legs. Reproductive rate of females appears to be limited by difficulties in finding suitable hosts. As a consequence, the species has evolved to use a wide range of crucifers.|$|E
50|$|The {{eggs are}} laid singly {{on a wide}} range of food plants {{including}} hedge mustard (Sisybrium officinale), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), <b>cuckooflower</b> (Cardamine pratense), water-cress (Rorippa nastutium-aquaticum), charlock (Sinapis arvensis), large bitter-cress (Cardamine amara), wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum), and so it is rarely a pest in gardens or field crops. The caterpillar is green and well camouflaged. When full grown it is green above with black warts, from which arise whitish and blackish hairs. There is a darker line along the back and a yellow line low down on the sides. Underneath the colour is whitish-grey. The spiracular line is dusky but not conspicuous, and the spiracles are blackish surrounded with yellow.

40|$|Pieris oleracea, {{formerly}} Pieries napi, {{was once}} a widespread pierid butterfly in New England until {{the introduction of a}} biological control agent, Cotesia glomerata. It has been suggested that C. glomerata is responsible for the range reduction of P. oleracea. There are been several introductions of a second more specialized biological control agent, Cotesia rubecula, to the United States since the 1960 ’s. My first goal was to determine the current distribution and status of P. rapae parasitoids and the effectiveness of C. rubecula as a biological control agent since its release. The findings of a survey I conducted of the parasitoid community of P. rapae indicate that C. rubecula now occurs as far west as North Dakota and has become the dominant parasitoid of P. rapae in the northeastern and north central United States and adjacent parts of southeastern Canada, where it has displaced C. glomerata, the previously dominant parasitoid. Survival of artificially established cohorts of P. rapae larvae was assessed in a collard patch on an organic vegetable farm in western Massachusetts. There was a significant drop in larval survival between the 4 th and 5 th instar due to parasitism by C. rubecula. This was change from survival curves of P. rapae from a 1985 - 1986 study, in which there was a significant drop in survival between the 5 th instar and pupal stage due to C. glomerata. The final goal of my thesis work is to try to understand why P. oleracea was able to survive at the focal study site in Lenox, MA despite parasitoid pressure and range reduction elsewhere in New England. In olfactometer tests, {{there was no difference in}} attractiveness of naïve C. glomerata females to volatiles of either Cardamine pratensis (<b>cuckooflower)</b> foliage, the host plant of P. oleracea or Brassica olercea (collard) foliage (P = 0. 51). In order to determine if overtopping by other vegetation may provide an enemy free space for P. oleracea by affecting detection by C. glomerata, cage experiments were conducted. Overtopping vegetation had a significant effect on parasitism by C. glomerata (F = 12. 8, df = 3, PP. oleracea has been able to thrive at the Lenox, MA site...|$|E
