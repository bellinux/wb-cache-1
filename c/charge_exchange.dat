2500|$|NASA's Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission {{satellite}} was monitoring Comet Lulin as {{it closed}} to 63 Gm of Earth. For the first time, astronomers can see simultaneous UV and X-ray {{images of a}} comet. [...] "The solar wind—a fast-moving stream of particles from the sun—interacts with the comet's broader cloud of atoms. This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that's what Swift's XRT sees", said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called <b>charge</b> <b>exchange,</b> results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth's distance from the Sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense. As a result, the X-ray-emitting region extends far sunward of the comet.|$|E

50|$|In an {{electrodialysis}} stack, the dilute (D) feed stream, brine or concentrate (C) stream, and electrode (E) stream {{are allowed}} to flow through the appropriate cell compartments formed by the ion exchange membranes. Under the influence of an electrical potential difference, the negatively charged ions (e.g., chloride) in the dilute stream migrate toward the positively charged anode. These ions pass through the positively <b>charged</b> anion <b>exchange</b> membrane, but are prevented from further migration toward the anode by the negatively <b>charged</b> cation <b>exchange</b> membrane and therefore stay in the C stream, which becomes concentrated with the anions. The positively charged species (e.g., sodium) in the D stream migrate toward the negatively charged cathode and pass through the negatively <b>charged</b> cation <b>exchange</b> membrane. These cations also stay in the C stream, prevented from further migration toward the cathode by the positively <b>charged</b> anion <b>exchange</b> membrane. As {{a result of the}} anion and cation migration, electric current flows between the cathode and anode. Only an equal number of anion and cation charge equivalents are transferred from the D stream into the C stream and so the charge balance is maintained in each stream. The overall result of the electrodialysis process is an ion concentration increase in the concentrate stream with a depletion of ions in the dilute solution feed stream see video.|$|R
