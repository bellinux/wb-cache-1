40|$|The World-Wide Web {{consists}} of {{a huge number of}} unstructured hypertext documents, but it also contains structured data in the form of HTML tables. Many of these tables contain both relational-style data and a small “schema ” of labeled and typed columns, making each such table a small structured database. The WebTables project is an effort to extract and make use of the huge number of these structured tables on the Web. A <b>clean</b> <b>collection</b> of relational-style tables could be useful for improving web search, schema design, and many other applications. This paper describes the first stage of the WebTables project. First, we give an in-depth study of the Web’s HTML table corpus. For example, we extracted 14. 1 billion HTML tables from a several-billion-page portion of Google’s generalpurpose web crawl, and estimate that 154 million of these tables contain high-quality relational-style data. We also describe the crawl’s distribution of table sizes and data types. Second, we describe a system for performing relation recovery. The Web mixes relational and non-relational tables indiscriminately (often on the same page), so there is no simple way to distinguish the 1. 1 % of good relations from the remainder, nor to recover column label and type information. Our mix of hand-written detectors and statistical classifiers takes a raw Web crawl as input, and generates a collection of databases that is five orders of magnitude larger than any other collection we are aware of. Relation recovery achieves precision and recall that are comparable to other domain-independent information extraction systems. 1...|$|E

This method uses the Corvaris g-tube for DNA fragmentation, {{eliminating the need for}} a HydroShear apparatus, and a Sage Science BluePippin electrophoresis platform to size select the 8 kb fragments, eliminating the need for agarose gel electrophoresis and sample recovery using a Whatman Elutrap device. These two modifications allow the protocol to be completed in significantly less time (eliminate an overnight step) and require significantly less capital investment in laboratory equipment. This modified library preparation protocol has yielded paired end libraries meeting all the quality control benchmarks the original protocol stipulates and has been combined with sequencing on a GS Junior instrument to generate excellent sequencing results. The equipment substitutions presented allow paired end library preparation to be practical for smaller research groups. ### Introduction In large-scale sequencing centers it is commonplace to have a range of DNA sequencing platforms (e. g. 454, Illumina, SOLiD, and PacBio) and also specialized devices for shearing of DNA molecules common in the preparation of paired-end libraries. With the introduction of laboratory-scale devices like the GS Jr and MiSeq there is a shift occurring where DNA sequencing technology is becoming directly accessible within small labs. The ability to perform whole genome sequencing and assembly within a lab is now reasonable to consider for Bacteria using the GS Jr. A crucial type of data for scaffolding of genome assemblies is paired-end data. By generating information from sequencing reads linked across some known or estimated spanning distance, bioinformatic techniques are capable of ordering and orienting contigs produced from shotgun sequencing. In terms of the GS Jr platform the system is inherently capable of sequencing paired-end libraries but there is a challenge for laboratory-scale use as the conventional protocol for library production includes shearing of DNA molecules using a Hydroshear. As a specialized device the Hydroshear represents a significant investment for a laboratory-scale setting and may present a barrier to the use of paired-end sequencing in lab settings. This protocol describes {{an alternative approach}} to performing Roche’s Paired End Rapid Library Preparation Method for 8 kb span libraries. This method uses the Corvaris g-tube for DNA fragmentation, eliminating the need for a HydroShear apparatus, and a Sage Science BluePippin electrophoresis platform to size select the 8 kb fragments, eliminating the need for agarose gel electrophoresis and sample recovery using a Whatman Elutrap device. These two modifications allow the protocol to be completed in significantly less time (by eliminating an overnight step) and simplify sheared fragment purification. This modified library preparation protocol yielded paired-end libraries meeting all the quality control benchmarks of the original protocol and has been combined with shotgun sequencing on a GS Junior to generate excellent assemblies for a range of Bacteria. The equipment substitutions and associated savings in time provide a practical protocol for laboratory-scale paired-end sequencing on the GS Jr. ### Materials Reagents unique to modified protocol: 1.

See attached Supplementary Manual. Modifications by Hill lab (Saskatoon) group: Start with 15 µg of sample genomic DNA in 150 µL Tris-HCl pH 8. 0 (genomic DNA preparation of 100 ng/µL) – same as original protocol Section 3. 1 – DNA Fragmentation (HydroShear) – completely disregard this section. Instead, use Covaris g-tubes. - Save a few µL of original genomic DNA to visualize on an agarose gel later. - Add the 150 µL genomic DNA prep to a g-tube. Follow instructions with tubes – Spin in an Eppendorf MiniSpin plus microcentrifuge at 8, 600 rpm for 1 min, flip tube over, repeat spin, remove sample from tube. - Keep 2 µL of the sheared sample to run on an agarose gel later. Section 3. 2 – Fragment End Repair - For 25 °C steps throughout protocol, set waterbath to maintain this temperature. Room temperature does not always work. - Disregard step 3 (don’t need this agarose gel). - Step 4 m – use the arm on the Labquake to keep the tube from flipping completely over when doing this gentle mixing (just rock the tube back and forth). Section 3. 3 – Circularization Adaptor Ligation - Step 1 – change the 2 x rapid ligase buffer for 10 x rapid ligase buffer (New England Biolabs product) and only add 10 µL (reduces mixture to 100 µL from 190 µL). - Stop at the end of Step 4 and disregard Steps 5 - 11. Instead, take the entire sample and load onto a BluePippin cassette. Save a few µL of the sample pre-loading to run on an agarose gel later. - To load the sample, bring the sample volume to 120 µL with Tris-HCl pH 8. 0 and add 40 µL BluePippin loading dye. Follow cassette instructions to prepare Blue Pippin cassette and load 4 lanes of a cassette by adding 40 µL of sample into each lane. Load the 5 th lane with BluePippin marker. - Run the BluePippin with the range selection from 5, 000 - 11, 000 bp. - When finished, remove the size-selected DNA from the elution well into a microfuge tube and rise the elution chamber with 40 µL 0. 1 % Tween 20 solution (supplied with BluePippin), adding this to the tube with the sample. - Concentrate and wash the size-selected sample by loading all the BluePippin eluted DNA into an Amicon filter column (0. 5 mL, 10 K) and spinning for 10 min at 14, 000 x g. Discard flow-thru and add 250 µL Tris-HCl to the column. Spin for 15 min at 14, 000 x g. Invert column in a <b>clean</b> <b>collection</b> tube and spin for 2 min at 1, 000 x g. - Save a few µL of concentrated sample to run on an agarose gel later. - Run an agarose gel of the original genomic DNA (unsheared), g-tube sheared DNA, sample before BluePipping and sample after BluePippin. - Continue to next section Section 3. 5 – Fill-In Reaction - At Step 3, quantify with Life Technologies’s Qubit BR dsDNA quantification kit. You need to achieve at least 6 ng/µL to continue. Section 3. 6 – Circularization - No changes to protocol Section 3. 7 – Nebulizer Assembly (3. 7. 1) and DNA Nebulization and Collection/Purification of the Fragmented DNA (3. 7. 2) - No changes to protocol Section 3. 8 – Fragment End Repair - No changes to protocol Section 3. 9 – Immobilization Bead Preparation - For Step 1 – prepare 2 x Library Binding Buffer by mixing 5 mL Molecular Biology Grade Water, 4 mL of 5 M NaCl and 1 mL of 10 x TE. Section 3. 10 – Adaptor Ligation - For Step 4 – incubate at 25 °C for 1 hour in a thermocycler. Section 3. 11 – Library Immobilization - No changes to protocol Section 3. 12 – Library Amplification - Prepare the PCR mixture as indicated for the sample and a second mixture to run without sample as a negative control. Save a few µL of the sample PCR after amplification and the negative PCR sample to run on the BioAnalyzer chip at the end. Section 3. 13 – Sizing Mix Preparation - No changes to protocol Section 3. 14 – Final Library Size Selection - No changes to protocol Section 3. 15 – Library Quality Assessment - Step 1 – use BioAnalyzer chip and run the PCR sample and negative control from Section 3. 12, as well as the final sample. Also, quantify final sample using Life Technologies’s Qubit ssDNA quantification kit. ### Timing Sections 3. 1 to 3. 5 can be performed in a day (including the BluePippin run). A good spot to pause overnight is either right after the BluePippin run (end of Section 3. 4) or after the fill-in reaction and quantification (end of Section 3. 5). Sections 3. 5 or 3. 6 to the end of Section 3. 11 is a good second day of work. Finishing Section 3. 12 to 3. 15 on the third morning allows for plenty of time to continue on with sequencing emPCR later in that day. ### Troublshooting Things that we have noted: 1. The AMPure size selection at the end (Section 3. 13 and 3. 14) can be variable, depending on the AMPure lot and day you do it. - We have considered running the BluePippin cassette selecting for the tighter ~ 500 bp range (instead of the larger range in the protocol) to standardize the paired end fragment size and make this selection more precise. However, if the genomic DNA shearing wasn’t precisely around the 8 kb mark, keeping the larger size window gives more DNA to work with and appears to work just fine. ### Anticipated Results Figure 1 shows typical results of shearing with the Covaris g-tubes and the purification of appropriately sized fragments using the Blue Pippin. Table 1 shows sequencing metrics generated on the GS Junior apparatus for three bacteria. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 : Gel electrophoresis of sheared DNA** ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") **Table 1. : Sequencing metrics**.

40|$|Arabic {{is a major}} {{international}} language, spoken in more than 23 countries, and the lingua franca of the Islamic world. The number of Arabic-speaking Internet users has grown over nine-fold in the Middle East between the year 2000 and 2007, yet research in Arabic Information Retrieval (AIR) has not advanced as in other languages such as English. In this thesis, we explore techniques that improve the performance of AIR systems. Stemming {{is considered one of}} the most important factors to improve retrieval effectiveness of AIR systems. Most current stemmers remove affixes without checking whether the removed letters are actually affixes. We propose lexicon-based improvements to light stemming that distinguish core letters from proper Arabic affixes. We devise rules to stem most affixes and show their effects on retrieval effectiveness. Using the TREC 2001 test collection, we show that applying relevance feedback with our rules produces significantly better results than light stemming. Techniques for Arabic information retrieval have been studied in depth on <b>clean</b> <b>collections</b> of newswire dispatches. However, the effectiveness of such techniques is not known on other noisy collections in which text is generated using automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems and queries are generated using machine translations (MT). Using noisy collections, we show that normalisation, stopping and light stemming improve results as in normal text collections but that n-grams and root stemming decrease performance. Most recent AIR research has been undertaken using collections that are far smaller than the collections used for English text retrieval; consequently, the significance of some published results is debatable. Using the LDC Arabic GigaWord collection that contains more than 1 500 000 documents, we create a test collection of~ 90 topics with their relevance judgements. Using this test collection, we show empirically that for a large collection, root stemming is not competitive. Of the approaches we have studied, lexicon-based stemming approaches perform better than light stemming approaches alone. Arabic text commonly includes foreign words transliterated into Arabic characters. Several transliterated forms may be in common use for a single foreign word, but users rarely use more than one variant during search tasks. We test the effectiveness of lexicons, Arabic patterns, and n-grams in distinguishing foreign words from native Arabic words. We introduce rules that help filter foreign words and improve the n-gram approach used in language identification. Our combined n-grams and lexicon approach successfully identifies 80 % of all foreign words with a precision of 93 %. To find variants of a specific foreign word, we apply phonetic and string similarity techniques and introduce novel algorithms to normalise them in Arabic text. We modify phonetic techniques used for English to suit the Arabic language, and compare several techniques to determine their effectiveness in finding foreign word variants. We show that our algorithms significantly improve recall. We also show that expanding queries using variants identified by our Soutex 4 phonetic algorithm results in a significant improvement in precision and recall.

He {{developed}} a team of passionate employees {{to work in the}} mission and started innovative programs like Ashraya (destitute rehabilitation project), Bhavanashree (microhousing), Vidyashree (IT@School units), Balasabha (forum for children), <b>Clean</b> Kerala Campaign (<b>collection</b> and disposal of solid waste), Clean Destination campaign (maintenance of tourist destinations by Kudumbashree workers) and numerous micro enterprises, ranging from computer to coconut oil production and food items to mini-bus service. One major development was the tie up with the state Department of Social Welfare to supply special nutritional supplements to the children in Anganwadis - under the name -Nutrimix- which has enabled thousands of rural women to manufacture and supply the nutritional supplement to their children all across the state. He was given the India vision Man of the Year award in 2007. Kudumbashree received most of the national and international recognition during his tenure.|$|R
40|$|An in situ window {{cleaning}} system by laser blow-off through optical fiber {{has been developed}} {{on the basis of}} a feasibility study previously presented. The beam generated by a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser is launched in a vacuum box into a high damage threshold optical fiber through a lens. The fiber output is focused on the impurities-coated surface of a vacuum window exposed to the plasma of the RFX-mod experiment, and it is remotely controlled with an xy motion system to scan the entire surface. We first investigate the energy density threshold necessary to ablate the deposited impurity substrate on removed dirty windows: above threshold, a single laser pulse recovers ∼ 95 % of the window transmission before its exposure to the plasma, while below it the efficiency of the cleaning process is too poor. The system so conceived was then used to <b>clean</b> the three <b>collection</b> windows of the Main Thomson scattering diagnostic on RFX-mod. We also present results obtained applying the same technique to the SiO-protected Al mirror used for the Zeff diagnostic: an energy threshold for efficient impurity removal without mirror damage is first identified, then ablation tests are executed and analyzed in terms of recovered reflectivity. The SIMS technique is used both with windows and mirror to study the composition of surfaces before and after the ablation...|$|R

In marine environments where the availability of iron limits microbial growth and carbon fixation rates, the ability to access organically bound iron confers a competitive advantage. Thus, the compounds that microbes produced to acquire iron {{play an important role in}} biogeochemical carbon and metal cycling. However, the source, abundance, and identity of these compounds are poorly understood. To investigate these processes, sensitive methodologies were developed to gain a compound-specific window into marine iron speciation by combining trace metal <b>clean</b> sample <b>collection</b> and chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LCICPMS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESIMS). Coupled with isotope pattern assisted search algorithms, these tools provide a means to quantify and isolate specific iron binding ligands from seawater and marine cultures, identify them based on their mass and fragmentation spectra, and investigate their metal binding kinetics. Using these techniques, we investigated the distribution and diversity of marine iron binding ligands. In cultures, LC-ICPMS-ESIMS was used to identify new members of siderophore classes produced by marine cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria, including synechobactins and marinobactins. Applications to natural seawater samples from the Pacific Ocean revealed a wide diversity of both known and novel metal compounds that are linked to specific nutrient regimes. Ferrioxamines B, E, and G were identified in productive coastal waters near California and Peru, in oligotrophic waters of the North and South Pacific Gyre, and in association with zooplankton grazers. Siderophore concentrations were up to five-fold higher in iron-deficient offshore waters (9 pM) and were dominated by amphibactins, amphiphilic siderophores that partition into cell membranes. Furthermore, synechobactins were detected within nepheloid layers along the continental shelf. These siderophores reflect adaptations that impact dissolved iron bioavailability and thus have important consequences for marine ecosystem community structures and primary productivity. The ability to map and characterize these compounds has opened new opportunities to better understand mechanisms that link metals with the microbes that use them. by Rene M. Boiteau. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master {{research}} internship was to examine whether the primates at Stichting AAP, excrete and so have, the pathogenic gastrointestinal protozoa Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. It also was examined if {{it is possible to}} determine how many of these protozoa they have in their feces. In this research the feces was examined for Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, because only these protozoa are known to cause diarrhea in NHP (Non Human Primates) (Levecke, 2010). Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. are both very common in NHP and cause in general not much harm, but can have clinical importance. Entamoeba histolytica can cause more serious symptoms and a sudden outbreak of diarrhea. The presence and clinical impact on primates is still unknown (Levecke et al., 2007). Additionally it was examined whether there was a link between the presence of each of these three species of protozoa and the fecal consistency. For seven weeks feces of the primates was tested for the three species of protozoa. The primates at Stichting AAP were housed both individually and in groups. There were also changes between the individuals and groups. This research included 32 primates. The animals were all housed on deep litter. Diarrhea, mush and normal feces were collected and examined during seven weeks, two to three times a week. The samples were taken randomly out of the enclosures of the primates. Fecal samples were collected when the enclosures of the primates were <b>cleaned.</b> The <b>collection</b> and further processing of the feces samples was done as sterile as possible and, the keepers were instructed how to do this. In this study all three species of examined pathogenic protozoa were found in the feces samples of the primates. These protozoa were found in solid, mush and diarrhea feces samples in {{more or less the same}} percentages. Also after statistical analysis, with this research could not be proven that there was a link between one of the protozoa found and the diarrhea of the primates. By microscopic examination samples were found with Giardia spp., Entamoeba spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. By multiplexPCR only samples with Entamoeba histolytica/dispar and very few samples with Giardia were found. Also other influences like shifts and medication/sedation that can cause the diarrhea are mentioned, but to examine these possible influences further research is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 A {{computer}} model is developed {{to estimate the}} initial investment and annual operating costs of feedlot runoff control systems. Costs are estimated for complete control systems consisting of a retention pond, settling basin, <b>clean</b> water diversion-runoff <b>collection</b> structures, disposal site, and an irrigation system. The model requires design inputs and cost inputs. Design inputs consist of: feedlot area, pumping rate, retention pond volume, disposal site area, and average pumping days per year. Cost inputs consist of market prices for system components and service costs. The model is used to estimate the initial investment and annual operating costs of runoff control systems capable of complying with proposed Federal water pollution regulations for open beef feedlots. Design parameters for these systems are those developed by Wensink and Miner (1977). Runoff control costs are estimated for one, ten, and 100 acre feediots at seven U. S. locations. For the purpose of cost comparison, budgets are estimated for systems using: four different irrigation systems, 5 pumping rates, seven management alternatives, and two disposal policies. The resulting data are analyzed to determine how investment and operating costs were affected by the following seven criteria: pumping rate, feedlot size, geographic location, management alternative, disposal policy, irrigation system, and operator convenience. Estimated runoff control costs are compared to current costs of producing fed beef. The additions to current cost of production {{are estimated to be}} insignificant for larger feedlots (10 - 100 acres). Small feedlots (1 ac) face costs (/head of capacity) ranging from three to ten times as high as those estimated for larger lots. The second part of the analysis deals with the cost of controlling alternative levels of runoff, (lower than specified by federal regulations), at a specific site.

The show starts with a tip regarding the location of a collection of vehicles then proceeds to the guys investigating the collection for the potential of the collection in terms of value and worthiness for a restoration candidate. Once a meeting with the owner takes place, a vehicle is selected for restoration and a deal is struck for the restoration of that vehicle while all the others plus any parts are sold to finance the overall effort. Joe Petralia replaced by Roy Wong [...] "the money" [...] in season 2 is challenged with the task of selling off the excess cars & parts to raise the capital for Rick and Chuck to finish the builds. Some of the vehicles are sold whole as collectibles to other mechanics or restorers, some for parts and the rest for scrap metal in order to raise the money necessary to rebuild and renovate the car hoarders' choice so that the owner may enjoy driving it in the future. The left over money goes toward paying the associated costs of operating a restoration shop. Each show continues by showing the basic design process for the vehicle which is followed by disassembly, modifications and then reassembly of the vehicle. The show wraps up with a presentation to the owner of their restored vehicle and an overview of what it took financially to accomplish all that was done from beginning to end with the hoard.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} six years, more than 10, 000 {{middle school and high}} school {{teachers}} and students have been introduced to the ANDRILL‐related “Antarctica’s Climate Secrets” activity modules and the “Environmental Literacy Framework (ELF) with a focus on climate change” activity modules (funded by grants from NSF and NOAA, respectively). This presentation will provide an overview of the outcomes of these two projects and discuss the lessons learned with respect to different stakeholder groups. The development of the ELF hands‐on activity modules is continuing and all ELF activity modules are currently being submitted to the CLEAN (Climate Literacy and Energy Awareness Network) Pathway for review and adoption into that collection. The hands‐on activity modules developed as part of the “Antarctica’s Climate Secrets” project have already been accepted into the <b>CLEAN</b> Pathway <b>collection.</b> The NSF‐funded “Antarctica Climate Secrets” project (led by Judy Diamond at the Nebraska State Museum of Natural History, and Luanne Dahlman, an ARISE (ANDRILL Research Immersion for Science Educators) Program participant and curriculum developer at TERC, who is currently at the NOAA Climate Project Office), developed resources that were closely related to the ANDRILL (ANtarctic geological DRILLing) Program’s geoscience research activities in Antarctica. These resources were used for teacher professional development and by teachers working with their students to create Flexhibits (FLEXible exHIBITs), where students teach other students and the general public about what they’ve learned about Antarctica and climate change after participating in the hands‐on activities and learning the information in the five themes of “Antarctica’s Climate Secrets,” which relate to Antarctica and climate change. During each year of the three year NOAA‐funded Environmental Literacy grant to UNL, two professional development workshops for teachers/educators have been conducted at each of 4 ‐ 10 sites across the United States to (1) introduce the Environmental Literacy Framework (ELF), (2) provide inquiry‐based activities with a focus on climate change, and (3) collect data for research and evaluation. Following the workshops, teachers interact with other teachers and with scientists as they deepen their knowledge about climate change science and pedagogy. Teachers work with students who conduct their own research and present their project outcomes to new audiences in local Flexhibit events, and at a capstone Climate Change Student Summit, where the students from each state are gathered together and connected to the other C 2 S 2 sites via videoconference, and to interact in person with attending geoscientists. The focus of the NOAA‐funded Environmental Literacy (EL) resources has been to build educators’ background knowledge about climate change science while helping them to integrate ocean, climate, and environmental literacy concepts into existing science courses. Teachers implement hands‐on and inquiry‐based learning activities with their students, and the students develop projects that demonstrate concepts of ocean, climate and environmental literacy. Student activities culminate in a Climate Change Student Summit (C 2 S 2) capstone event, held at museums and other public venues, where students present the outcomes of their own scientific inquiries. More than 800 students have been directly involved in the NOAA‐funded Climate Change Student Summits (C 2 S 2), and more than 200 teachers and 5, 000 students are currently using the ELF modules in their classrooms in 10 U. S. States...|$|R

Missed diagnosis can lead to immediateUndiagnosed infections increase suffering and may lead topossible serious long term health problems. Methodology: 7, 163 systemically unwell children were recruited in primary care. Urine samples were collected and {{a wide range of}} presenting symptoms and signs were recorded to identify which, if any, could predict a urinary tract infection. Findings: Half of laboratory-confirmed UTIs were missed at first contact in primary care. Samples obtained using Newcastle nappy pads were 6 {{times more likely to be}} contaminated. The clinical algorithms discussed here improve clinicians’ ability to determine UTI from other causes of constitutional illness. Conclusions:•Urine samples should be collected using the ‘clean catch’ method whenever possible•Presence/absence of fever is not diagnostic for UTI in this age group in primary care•Symptoms and signs can be used to help decide which children to obtain a urine sample from•Dipstick testing of urine improves the targeting of antibiotic treatmentIt is well recognised that the diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infection’s (UTIs) in young, pre-verbal, children is challenging and may mean some are not actually either suspected or diagnosed. Missed diagnosis can lead to immediate suffering and possible serious long term health problems. The DUTY study was undertaken to help clinicians recognise when to consider attempting to collect a urine sample and when to consider treatment. It also found because of the way the project was run a difference in both UTI positivity Symptoms and Signs and the presence of contamination between nappy pad urine <b>collection</b> and <b>clean</b> catch <b>collection.</b> The study recruited in Primary Care and as such the results are not directly comparable to any earlier studies. Children were eligible if presenting with any acute illness of less than 28 days’ duration, where the illness was associated with: (a) at least one constitutional symptom or sign identified by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as a potential marker for UTI, i. e. : fever, vomiting, lethargy/malaise, irritability, poor feeding and failure to thrive; and/or (b) at least one urinary symptom identified by NICE as a potential marker of UTI, ie :abdominal pain, jaundice (children < 3 months only), haematuria, offensive urine, cloudy urine, loin pain, frequency, apparent pain on passing urine and changes to continence. In the clean catch group the parent-reported index tests associated with a UTI were: pain/crying while passing urine, smelly urine, previous UTI and, notably, absence of severe cough. For pain/crying while passing urine and smelly urine the higher these index items were scored, the more severe the UTI proved to be. Analysis of the dipstick results showed that leukocytes, nitrites and blood were strongly associated with UTI. In the nappy pad group parent-reported smelly urine, darker urine, female gender and the absence of a nappy rash were independently associated with UTI. As with the clean catch group, there was evidence for graded associations in the first two items. On dipstick testing these urines, the presence of leukocytes and nitrites (but not blood) were independently associated with UTI. Contamination was x 6 more likely in this group in comparison to the clean catch group. In conclusion urine samples should be collected using the ‘clean catch’ method whenever possible. Presence/absence of fever is not diagnostic for UTI in this age group in primary care. Symptoms and signs to be considered when deciding whether to collect urine These can be used for deciding which children to urine sample (step 1) and dipstick results to improve specificity for antibiotic treatment (step 2). </p...|$|R
