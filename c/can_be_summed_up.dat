25|$|The {{wellspring of}} the {{principle}} of humanity is in the essence of social morality which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> in a single sentence, Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. This fundamental precept can be found, in almost identical form, in all the great religions, Brahminism, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, Judaism and Taoism. It is also the golden rule of the positivists, who do not commit themselves to any religion but only to the data of experience, in the name of reason alone. It is indeed not at all necessary to resort to affective or transcendental concepts to recognize the advantage for men to work together to improve their lot..|$|E

25|$|Amphibians possess {{two types}} of glands, mucous and {{granular}} (serous). Both of these glands {{are part of the}} integument and thus considered cutaneous. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via keratinocytes and passes through {{to the surface of the}} epidermal or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.|$|E

Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—described what his main issue with Fleming's work was: [...] "his basic {{weakness}} as a storyteller, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> in two words: 'no story.'" [...] In the short story form, however, Boucher finds that Bond's tales [...] "are proportionate" [...] and that Fleming's [...] "prose... is eminently smooth and readable" [...] even if [...] "Bond's triumphs are too simple and lack... intricate suspense".|$|E

He plays God in allowing the villagers to ride the winch (saving them the exertion of walking), and is jolted when the supervising engineer Kumaran arrives. As a subordinate, Kali cannot oppose Kumaran; his frustration threatens to erupt several times before it finally does and he is suspended.

500|$|The {{main source}} for Ljótólfr is the Orkneyinga saga, which was {{compiled}} sometime around 1200 {{by an unknown}} Icelander. The saga {{is thought to have}} been based upon poetry, oral tradition, and other written material. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> as an account of the lives of many of the earls of Orkney between the 9th and 13th centuries. According to research fellow Ian Beuermann, the saga is useful not for the specific events it describes, but rather for what it reveals about [...] "the ideas shaping the texts during the periods of composition or revision". For example, it is possible that even one of the main characters of the saga, Sveinn Ásleifarson, never existed, or at least that the historical Sveinn differed from the saga's portrayal of him. Another source which mentions Ljótólfr is Þormóður Torfason's 17th-century Latin history of Orkney, which follows the Orkneyinga saga.|$|E
500|$|The company's online {{advertising}} program in Spain described the BK XXL line as being made [...] "with two enormous portions of flame-broiled meat {{that will give}} you all the energy you need to take the world by storm." [...] This claim combined with the television advertising were the prime motivators behind the Spanish government's concerns with the XXL sandwich line. The government claimed that campaign violated an agreement with the government to comply with an initiative on curbing obesity by promoting such a large and unhealthy sandwich. In response to the government's claims, Burger King replied in a statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. Our philosophy <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> with the motto 'As you like it,' in which our customers' taste trumps all."

500|$|The {{main source}} {{for the life of}} Ölvir is the Orkneyinga saga, which was {{compiled}} sometime around 1200 by an unknown Icelander. The saga is thought to have been based upon poetry, oral tradition, and other written material. The original version ended with the death of Sveinn Ásleifarson (who is portrayed as an enemy of Ölvir and Frakökk). The saga is considered to become more accurate as events approach the writer's own time. In the late 14th century, the saga was revised and edited and included in the Icelandic Flateyarbók. The saga <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> as an account of the lives of many of the earls of Orkney, from the 9th to 13th centuries. According to research fellow Ian Beuermann, the saga is useful not for the specific events it describes, but rather for the ability to learn of [...] "the ideas shaping the texts during the periods of composition or revision". For example, it is possible that even one of the main characters of the saga, Sveinn Ásleifarson, never existed; or at least {{it is quite possible that}} the historical Sveinn was different from the saga's portrayal of him. Another source which mentions Ölvir is Þormóður Torfason's 17th-century history of Orkney, which follows the Orkneyinga saga.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Taylor was the {{principal}} screenwriter in this, the first screenplay written specially for Astaire and Rogers. Astaire reacted negatively to the first drafts, complaining that [...] "it is patterned too closely after The Gay Divorcee", and [...] "I am cast as ... a sort of objectionable young man without charm or sympathy or humour". [...] Allan Scott, for whom this movie served as his first major project, and who {{would go on to}} serve on six of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, was hired by Sandrich to do the rewrites and never actually worked with Taylor, with Sandrich acting as script editor and advisor throughout. The Hays Office insisted on only minor changes, including probably the most quoted line of dialogue from the film: Beddini's motto: [...] "For the women the kiss, for the men the sword" [...] which originally ran: [...] "For the men the sword, for the women the whip." [...] Of his role in the creation of Top Hat, Taylor recalled that with Sandrich and Berlin he shared [...] "a kind of childlike excitement. The whole style of the picture <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> in the word inconsequentiality. When I left RKO a year later, Mark said to me, 'You will never again see so much of yourself on the screen.'" [...] On the film's release, the script was panned by many critics, who alleged it was merely a rewrite of The Gay Divorcee.|$|E
500|$|For her, {{social justice}} is the {{essential}} element needed to banish fear and bring peace. Justice means freedom from oppression, but it also implies equality for all. [...] "In God's eyes," [...] she writes, [...] "all creatures have value and are subjects of equal care and love; similarly, in a society of justice and peace, all people matter equally." [...] Franklin suggests that in consumer-oriented societies, war and violence are the inevitable result of an acquisitive lifestyle that rejects caring and social justice. She quotes historian Lewis Mumford's observation that during the rise of capitalism, the sins of greed, gluttony, avarice, envy and luxury became cardinal virtues. Mumford goes on {{to argue that the}} [...] "moral change that took place under capitalism <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> in the fact that human purposes, human needs, and human limits no longer exercised a directing and restraining influence upon industry: people worked, not to maintain life, but to increase money and power and to minister to the ego that found satisfaction in vast accumulations of money and power." [...] Franklin extends Mumford's argument by pointing to new global realities such as militarized economies dependent on weapons production and national borders increasingly closed to refugees. [...] "Any modern theology of peace," [...] she writes, [...] "must, I think, take into account the worldwide drift towards 'techno-fascism,' the anti-people, anti-justice form of global management and power sharing that is developing around the world." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the 2006 introduction of the BK XXL product line in Spain, the Spanish Health Ministry publicly claimed {{that the company had}} violated a voluntary agreement between the company and the Spanish Federation of Hoteliers and Restaurateurs, a group to which Burger King belongs, that called on its members to refrain from advertising large portions of food. The Minister of Health, Elena Salgado, claimed that the new promotion and the new sandwiches, averaging over 970 calories each, violated the accord. The head of Spain's food regulatory body, Felix Lobo, stated a legal case could be made against Burger King for [...] "illegally failing to comply with a contract". In a {{response to}} the Government's allegations, the European offices of Burger King released this statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years.
