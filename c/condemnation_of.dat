50|$|The <b>Condemnations</b> <b>of</b> 1210-1277 were enacted at {{the medieval}} University of Paris to {{restrict}} certain teachings as being heretical. These included {{a number of}} medieval theological teachings, but most importantly the physical treatises of Aristotle. The investigations of these teachings were conducted by the Bishops <b>of</b> Paris.

40|$|Carcass and organ condemnations cause big {{economic}} {{losses in the}} beef industry. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the causes <b>of</b> <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> whole and partial carcasses and organs of cattle slaughtered at private abattoirs in Ethiopia. A total of 62, 917 cattle slaughtered at Abergelle, Elfora Bishoftu and Elfora Kombolcha abattoirs from February 2010 to November 2013 were used for the study. The main causes <b>of</b> <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> whole carcasses were poor bleeding (0. 11 %), abscess (0. 06 %), adhesion (0. 04 %), TB (0. 03 %), pneumonia (0. 01 %), Cysticercus bovis (0. 01 %) and bruising (0. 01 %). Prevalence of abscesses, TB and C. bovis were significantly (p< 0. 0001) different between abattoirs. Main causes <b>of</b> partial <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> carcasses were bruising (34. 11 %), poor bleeding (25. 59 %), contamination (12. 58 %) and adhesion (9. 37 %). The prevalence of these problems were significantly (p< 0. 0001) different between years, abattoirs and season. The main causes <b>of</b> <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> liver was faciola (29. 74 %) while lungs were mainly condemned due to H. cyst (23. 01 %) and pneumonia (22. 68). The main causes <b>of</b> <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> kidneys, hearts, tongue and spleens were nephritis (10. 91 %), poor bleeding (20. 83 %), abscess (4. 71 %) and splenitis (2. 74 %), respectively while heads were condemned mainly due to poor bleeding (18. 77 %) and bruising (17. 05 %). The causes <b>of</b> <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> organs were significantly (p< 0. 0001) different between abattoirs or years or both in some cases. From the study it was concluded that the prevalence of disease problems differ from abattoir to abattoir and across years. It is therefore recommended that different strategies should be developed to minimize these problems though the year and between regions based on the dynamic nature of the diseases. Key words: Abattoir, cattle, disease...|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} I {{investigate the}} relation between Peter of Auvergne’s questions on Aristotle’s cosmological work De caelo and the <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> 1277. First I give a short survey of Peter’s life and work and of two sets of quaestiones on De caelo that are ascribed to him: the CEK-questions (very likely composed in 1271 - 1272) and the WP-questions (most probably composed after May 2, 1274). Then I briefly discuss the <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> 1277 and their relation to De caelo (the condemnations included some theories defended in De caelo). Finally, I discuss in detail the shifts in doctrine between the CEK- and the WP-questions. I {{argue that it is}} most likely that the change in doctrine between the CEK- and WP-questions on the eternity and animation of the heavens and on the possibility of an infinite multitude in act is effected by the <b>condemnations</b> <b>of</b> 1277. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The {{chain of}} {{events leading up to}} Bishop Tempier's <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> 1277 is still not entirely clear. The Catholic Encyclopedia records that the theologians of the University of Paris had been very uneasy due to the {{antagonism}} that existed between Christian dogmas and certain Peripatetic doctrines. According to the historian Edward Grant, the theologians desired to condemn Aristotle's teachings on the eternity {{of the world and the}} unicity of the intellect.|$|E

Among them were the literary promoters of Cubism: in addition to Henri Barzun and Fernand Divoire, Tzara cherished the works of Guillaume Apollinaire.

5|$|Bernstein {{states that}} Washington's lynching {{was a unique}} event because it {{occurred}} {{in a city with}} a reputation for progressiveness, but was attended by thousands of people who were excited by the brutal torture. Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller towns with fewer spectators. William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of central Texas had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington's lynching, maintaining that this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated. Hale posits that Washington's death signaled a transition in the practice of lynching, demonstrating its acceptance in modernized, 20th-century cities. She notes that Washington's lynching illustrates how technological innovations, such as telephones and inexpensive photographs, could empower lynch mobs but also increase society's <b>condemnation</b> <b>of</b> their actions.|$|E
