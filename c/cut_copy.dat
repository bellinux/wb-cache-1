The keyboard-to-trackpad feature is also extended to iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, in which users can 3D Touch (force press) {{the keyboard}} to enable the trackpad. Also on the iPad, a shortcut bar has been added for <b>cut,</b> <b>copy,</b> paste, undo and redo functions, and folders display 16 apps per page in a 4-by-4 arrangement, compared to 9 on the iPhone, allowing for an increased total of 240 apps in a single folder.|$|E

The band also clearly influenced 1990s and 2000s Trance music, where lush soundscapes and synth pads are used along with repetitive synth sequences, much like in their 1975 releases Rubycon and Ricochet, {{as well as some}} of their music from the early 1980s. The group have also been sampled countless times, more recently by Recoil on the album SubHuman, by Sasha on Involver, and on several Houzan Suzuki albums.|$|E

25|$|Windows Explorer's task {{panel has}} been removed, {{integrating}} the relevant task options into the toolbar. A Favorites pane {{on the left}} contains commonly accessed folders and prepopulated Search Folders. Seven different views are available to view files and folders, namely, List, Details, Small icons, Medium icons, Large icons, Extra large icons or Tiles. File and folder actions such as <b>Cut,</b> <b>Copy,</b> Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change {{the layout of the}} Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the Navigation Pane. Document Properties are available from the common 'Open' and 'Save' dialog boxes, so it is easier to add metadata (such as author or subject) to a document. The metadata can be viewed and edited in the Details Pane that shows up at the bottom of an Explorer window. The Navigation Pane contains a list of most common folders (the Favorites) for quick navigation. It can also show the folder layout of the entire hard drive or a subset of it. It can contain both real folders as well as virtual ones. By default it contains links to folders such as Documents and the publicly shared folder, as well as virtual folders that search and present the saved virtual folders and that lists the recently changed documents. The Preview Pane can be used to preview the contents of a document, including viewing pictures in a size larger than the thumbnails shown in the folder listing, and sampling contents of a media file, without opening any additional program. Explorer can show a preview for any image format if the necessary codec authored using the Windows Imaging Component is installed. Also, if an application installs Preview handlers (like Office 2007 does), then the documents can be edited in the preview pane itself.|$|E

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008, it was nominated in the category [...] "Best Rock Album", but lost to The Living End's entry, White Noise.

It is a popular venue for touring rock acts, though it also hosts blues, comedy, dance, hip hop, indie, and rap artists. Performers have included Ray Charles, the Dan Reed Network, Bob Dylan, Medeski Martin & Wood, Miles Davis, the Misfits, the Pixies, Bonnie Raitt, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. During the 1990s, Phish performed at the venue four times, including once when it was still called Starry Night.

5000|$|As {{a prelude}} to their second album, the band {{released}} the So Cosmic mix in February 2008, showing the disco/new wave inspiration behind In Ghost Colours. The album debuted on the ARIA Albums Chart at number one. <b>Cut</b> <b>Copy's</b> next single, [...] "Lights & Music" [...] was used in video game FIFA 09. [...] "Far Away", album's third and final single, was played on Nip/Tuck, a United States TV series, on one of its final episodes, in a club scene.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2010, {{radio station}} Triple J {{broadcast}} the teaser track [...] "Where I'm Going", ahead of <b>Cut</b> <b>Copy's</b> third album, Zonoscope, which drew inspirations {{from the early}} 1980s. It was largely recorded in a Melbourne warehouse with only the band and an engineer working on it. The band confirmed they had officially become a four-piece {{with the addition of}} bass guitarist Ben Browning. [...] "Where I'm Going" [...] became the theme song of RIM's BlackBerry PlayBook's sneak-preview video, which was released in September 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Produced by {{frontman}} Dan Whitford, Free Your Mind {{was recorded}} in <b>Cut</b> <b>Copy's</b> hometown of Melbourne and later mixed by Dave Fridmann in Upstate New York. According to its press release, the album {{was inspired by the}} two different Summers of Love (San Francisco's in 1967 and Britain's in 1988 and 1989). [...] "The concept of freedom is one that's universally positive and timeless, and whatever each person's version of that freedom is, it's a good thing to be reminding people or even just ourselves to be 'free'", Whitford stated.|$|R
500|$|In the new millennium, renewed {{interest}} in electronic music and nostalgia for the 1980s led to {{the beginnings of a}} synth-pop revival, with acts including Adult and Fischerspooner. In 2003–04 it began to move into the mainstream with Ladytron, the Postal Service, <b>Cut</b> <b>Copy,</b> the Bravery and the Killers all producing records that incorporated vintage synthesizer sounds and styles that contrasted with the dominant genres of post-grunge and nu metal. In particular, the Killers enjoyed considerable airplay and exposure and their debut album Hot Fuss (2004) reached the top ten of the Billboard 200. The Killers, the Bravery and the Stills all left their synth-pop sound behind after their debut albums and began to explore classic 1970s rock, but the style was picked up by a large number of performers, particularly female solo artists. Following the breakthrough success of Lady Gaga with her single [...] "Just Dance" [...] (2008), the British and other media proclaimed a new era of female synth-pop stars, citing artists such as Roisin Murphy, Little Boots, La Roux, and Ladyhawke. Male acts that emerged in the same period include Calvin Harris, Empire of the Sun, Frankmusik, Hurts, Kaskade, LMFAO, and Owl City, whose single [...] "Fireflies" [...] (2009) topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. [...] In 2009, an underground subgenre with direct stylistic origins to Synth-pop became popular, Chillwave. It sprouted new stars in the independent music scene like Washed Out, Neon Indian, and Toro Y Moi.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Cut</b> <b>Copy</b> {{frontman}} Dan Whitford has {{attributed the}} band's success {{to a change}} in public attitude as much as the band's quality, explaining [...] "It's a case partly of timing and a growing awareness of electronic music in Australia". Pnau's first album, Sambanova, was released in 1999, {{at a time when many}} in Australia considered electronic music to be a dying breed. Nonetheless, the band travelled around the US and Europe, and slowly made a name for themselves, and for a rebirth of electronic music in the country.|$|E

I am sure that this cover will also inspire others as a reference in the future".|$|R
