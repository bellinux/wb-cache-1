5|$|The IOC {{originally}} resisted funding by <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsors.</b> It was {{not until}} the retirement of IOC president Avery Brundage, in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them. Under the leadership of Juan Antonio Samaranch the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.|$|E

Party favors are distributed to attendees, which have historically included large balloons, hats, and other items branded with the event's <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsors.</b> The hours before the drop are preceded by hourly countdowns for the arrival of the new year in other countries, along with live music performances by popular musicians.

5|$|Where ambitious {{construction}} for the 1976 {{games in}} Montreal and 1980 games in Moscow had saddled organisers with expenses greatly {{in excess of}} revenues, Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses by using existing facilities except a swim stadium and a velodrome that were paid for by <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsors.</b> The Olympic Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered the most financially successful modern Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{restructured}} the organization's {{leadership and}} policies. He reduced budgets and boosted fundraising, alleviating {{the concerns of}} <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsors</b> while recruiting new ones. Romney worked {{to ensure the safety}} of the Games following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks by coordinating a $300million security budget. He oversaw a $1.32billion total budget, 700employees, and 26,000volunteers. The federal government provided approximately $400million to $600million of that budget, much of it a result of Romney's having aggressively lobbied Congress and federal agencies. It was a record level of federal funding for the staging of a U.S. Olympics. An additional $1.1billion of indirect federal funding came to the state in the form of highway and transit projects.|$|E

The South Stand has 15 luxury boxes, each with seating for 12 people, and club seating for an additional 100 people in Aspmyra Sportsbar; this is only available for <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsors.</b> Both the sports bar and the boxes have access to dinners before the match. The stand is combined with a commercial and residential building, which is owned by Aspmyra Næringsbygg, which is again controlled by Gunvald Johansen. Bodø/Glimt's offices are located in this section, which along with the public access is rented by Glimt. Of sponsorship reasons, the South Stand is named for Diadora.|$|E
40|$|Globalisation and {{increased}} stakeholder pressure have compelled companies {{to be more}} creative {{in their pursuit of}} legitimacy in contemporary society. Against this background, companies are expected to establish a reputation associated with corporate social responsibility (CSR) and good corporate citizenship. The {{purpose of this article is}} to determine whether there is a relationship between consumer perceptions of, and consumer attitudes toward, a <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsor’s</b> CSR activities and its resultant impact on consumer behaviour. By means of replication, the research focuses on consumer perceptions, attitudes and behaviour by testing the generalisability of an American study’s research instrument in the South African context. Survey data were collected from a target population of adult zoo visitors. Significant findings reveal a correlation between consumer recall of a <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsor’s</b> involvement with a prominent South African zoo (the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa, or NZG) and positive consumer perceptions toward a <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsor’s</b> CSR activities; and regular consumer use of the <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsor’s</b> products and positive perceptions towards the <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsor’s</b> CSR activities. The findings also suggest that managers should be aware of consumer scepticism associated with CSR communication. A good corporate reputation is furthermore necessary to support successful CSR activities. [URL] Managemen...|$|R

5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' {{president}} of basketball operations, {{stated in the}} final Vancouver season {{that the company was}} losing US$40million per season. These numbers were questioned by Richard Peddie, CEO of the Raptors, as the Grizzlies had a salary cap of US$48million. Retrospectively, Heisley stated that he lost US$87million on owning the Grizzlies, although that included a US$30million relocation fee to the NBA. Versace stated that he felt that the team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsors</b> as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E
5|$|On 20 April 2005, the Norwegian Ski Federation's board supported, with 13 against 1 vote, {{to build}} both a normal {{and a large}} hill at Rødkleiva and to close Vikersundbakken. However, the {{following}} day Svarstad Haugland stated that the government supported keeping Vikersundbakken rather than building a new venue in Rødkleiva. Clas Brede Bråthen responded that the federation hoped to build the venue with grants from the private sector, such as naming rights, and used Color Line Stadion in Ålesund {{as an example of}} a venue that had generated significant funding from <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsors.</b> A majority of the county chapters supported Vikersundbakken, with only 4 of 19 chapters supporting Rødkleiva. The Norwegian Ski Federation's national convention voted on 28 May with a large majority to place first a normal hill and then a ski flying hill at Rødkleiva.|$|E
5|$|The Winter Games {{have evolved}} since their inception. Sports and {{disciplines}} {{have been added}} and some of them, such as Alpine skiing, luge, short track speed skating, freestyle skiing, skeleton, and snowboarding, have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic programme. Some others, including curling and bobsleigh, have been discontinued and later reintroduced; others have been permanently discontinued, such as military patrol, though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it. Still others, such as speed skiing, bandy and skijoring, were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports. The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced {{the profile of the}} Games. It generated income via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising, which has become lucrative for the IOC. This allowed outside interests, such as television companies and <b>corporate</b> <b>sponsors,</b> to exert influence. The IOC has had to address several criticisms, internal scandals, the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians, as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympics. Nations have used the Winter Games to proclaim the superiority of their political systems.|$|E
