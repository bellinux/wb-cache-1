50|$|The Beyer Speed Figure is {{a system}} for rating the {{performance}} of Thoroughbred racehorses in North America designed in the early 1970s by Andrew Beyer, the syndicated horse racing columnist for The Washington Post. First published in book form in 1975, Daily Racing Form began incorporating Beyer Speed Figures in a horse's past performances in 1992 and the system now assigns a Beyer number for each horse race. Overall, the number reflects not only the winning time, but {{the time of the}} race and the inherent speed of the track over which it was run. On the Beyer scale, the top stakes horses in the United States and Canada earn numbers in the 100s, while extremely strong performances <b>can</b> <b>rate</b> <b>as</b> high as the 120s. In Europe, Timeform has a similar rating scale that yields a number, but with a different value. The popular rule of thumb for a rough equivalent of the Timeform score is to deduct 12-14 points to achieve the Beyer figure. For American Quarter Horse racing, the Speed index rating system is used.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringMustaque A. HossainThe {{objective}} of this research project {{was to assess the}} condition of general aviation airport pavements in Kansas. The study was also intended to form the basis for a pavement management system (PMS). A total of 137 runways from 107 airports across the state were surveyed. MicroPAVER, a PMS system developed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, was selected as the platform for the PMS. An inventory database was developed for all runways in the network. Information about the construction and maintenance history was entered into the MicroPAVER database. On-site surveys were conducted between the months of May and July of 2008 to assess pavement conditions in terms of the Pavement Condition Index (PCI), following the methodology outlined by ASTM D 5340 - 04 and adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Approximately 68 % of the sections surveyed were in “good” to “satisfactory” condition. Almost one-third of the network <b>can</b> be <b>rated</b> <b>as</b> “good. ” About 21 % of the sections studied were in “fair” condition. Overall, the condition of the network <b>can</b> be <b>rated</b> <b>as</b> “satisfactory. ” A condition prediction curve was developed for each of the two different types of surfaces. From the prediction curves created using MicroPAVER, it was estimated that the number of branches <b>rated</b> <b>as</b> “good” could decrease by 50 % by 2010. As much as 44 % of the network could have a rating of “fair” by 2013 if the sections receive only routine maintenance. Two budget scenario comparison reports developed show that the 108 runways of the 78 general aviation airports eligible for FAA funding in Kansas could be brought to a “satisfactory” rating or above (i. e. average PCI ≥ 70) by spending approximately $ 15 million on average per year for the next five years...|$|R
40|$|In {{previously}} reported setups for differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), the mass spectrometer was usable only for this application. The present publication describes a novel setup which overcomes this limitation using a dual inlet system. One inlet {{is connected to}} a vacuum recipient at which the electrochemical cell is attached when operating in the DEMS mode. The other one consists of a capillary inlet {{which can be used}} for various mass spectrometry applications. Without the necessity of shutting down the vacuum system, it is possible to switch modes by just opening and closing two valves. The present publication describes the connection to a thermogravimetrie analyzer (TGA) via the capillary inlet. Using this setup, it is possible to detect hermal decomposition products as a function of temperature in addition to the determination of the weight loss. Additionally, the characteristic response time of the multipurpose electrochemical mass spectromet~, (MPEMS) operating in the DEMS mode has been substantially improved compared to previous etups (20 to 50 ms in comparison to 200 to 500 ms). Thus, higher scan rates than the typical 10 to 25 mV/s are now practical. Using sputtered electrodes, <b>can</b> <b>rates</b> <b>as</b> high as 1000 mV/s can be applied. As indicated by the features described above, MPEMS is a versatile instrument {{with a wide range of}} applications not only in electrochemistry, but also in general analytical chemistry...|$|R

5000|$|A Superdump is a {{straight}} dump truck {{equipped with a}} trailing axle, a liftable, load-bearing axle <b>rated</b> <b>as</b> high as 13000 lb. Trailing 11 to 13 ft behind the rear tandem, the trailing axle stretches the outer [...] "bridge" [...] measurement—the distance {{between the first and}} last axles—to the maximum overall length allowed. This increases the gross weight allowed under the federal bridge formula, which sets standards for truck size and weight. Depending on the vehicle length and axle configuration, Superdumps <b>can</b> be <b>rated</b> <b>as</b> high as 80000 lb. GVW and carry 26 ST of payload or more. When the truck is empty or ready to offload, the trailing axle toggles up off the road surface on two hydraulic arms to clear the rear of the vehicle. Truck owners call their trailing axle-equipped trucks Superdumps because they far exceed the payload, productivity, and return on investment of a conventional dump truck. The Superdump and trailing axle concept was developed by Strong Industries of Houston, Texas.|$|R
