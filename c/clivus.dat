25|$|Besides this {{important}} work, Frey published {{papers on the}} effects of vegetable poisons on spinal cord degeneration, brain stem topography, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Charcot joints, aneurysms of the plexus of the medulla, cysts of brain ventricles, <b>clivus</b> tumors, frontal lobe tumors and retrosplenial tumors.|$|E
25|$|The care of {{the streets}} and roads within the Roman {{territory}} was committed in the earliest times to the censors. They eventually made contracts for paving the street inside Rome, including the <b>Clivus</b> Capitolinus, with lava, and for laying down the roads outside the city with gravel. Sidewalks were also provided. The aediles, probably {{by virtue of their}} responsibility for the freedom of traffic and policing the streets, co-operated with the censors and the bodies that succeeded them.|$|E
25|$|Juno Regina had two temples (aedes) in Rome. The one {{dedicated}} by Furius Camillus in 392 BC {{stood on}} the Aventine: it lodged the wooden statue of the Juno transvected from Veii. It is mentioned several times by Livy in connexion with sacrifices offered in atonement of prodigia. It was restored by Augustus. Two inscriptions found near the church of S. Sabina indicate the approximate site of the temple, which corresponds with {{its place in the}} lustral procession of 207 BC, near {{the upper end of the}} <b>Clivus</b> Publicius. The day of the dedication and of her festival was September 1.|$|E
25|$|The road {{began in}} the Forum Romanum, passed through the Servian Wall at the porta Capena, went through a cutting in the <b>clivus</b> Martis, and left the city. For this stretch of the road, the {{builders}} used the via Latina. The building of the Aurelian Wall centuries later required the placing of another gate, the Porta Appia. Outside of Rome the new via Appia went through well-to-do suburbs along the via Norba, the ancient track to the Alban hills, where Norba was situated. The road {{at the time was}} a via glarea, a gravel road. The Romans built a high-quality road, with layers of cemented stone over a layer of small stones, cambered, drainage ditches on either side, low retaining walls on sunken portions, and dirt pathways for sidewalks. The via Appia {{is believed to have been}} the first Roman road to feature the use of lime cement. The materials were volcanic rock. The surface was said to have been so smooth that you could not distinguish the joints. The Roman section still exists and is lined with monuments of all periods, although the cement has eroded out of the joints, leaving a very rough surface.|$|E
500|$|The {{brainstem}} {{lies beneath}} the cerebrum {{and consists of}} the midbrain, pons and medulla. It lies in the back part of the skull, resting {{on the part of}} the base known as the <b>clivus,</b> and ends at the foramen magnum, a large [...] in the occipital bone. The brainstem continues below this as the spinal cord, protected by the vertebral column.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006, the zoo {{opened up}} brand-new {{eco-friendly}} restrooms outside the Bronx River Gate. According to <b>Clivus</b> Multrum, which built the composting toilets {{chosen by the}} zoo, these facilities will serve 500,000 people and save [...] of water a year.|$|E
2500|$|Composting toilets {{with a large}} {{composting}} container (of {{the type}} <b>Clivus</b> Multrum and derivations of it) are popular in US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Sweden. They can be bought and installed as commercial products, as designs for self builders or as [...] "design derivatives" [...] which are marketed under various names. It {{has been estimated that}} approximately 10,000 such toilets might be in use worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Each camp-site has between {{eight and}} fifteen camping pads, a toilet, {{untreated}} rainwater tanks, camp benches and, except for Blanket Bay, a shelter. [...] The <b>Clivus</b> Multrum toilets are a self-contained, waterless, odourless continuous composting system. [...] They were sized above their capacity {{taking into account}} climatic factors. [...] Waste material and wood shavings compost in the tanks and the vent pipe to reduce odours. Recycled red gum posts were sought from demolished wharfs at Docklands, which are used as feature posts for the toilets and shelter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{church had}} its {{beginning}} {{as a simple}} oratory added to a family villa suburbana of Pope Gregory I, who converted the villa into a monastery, ca 575-80, before his election as pope (590). [...] Saint Augustine of Canterbury was prior of the monastery before leading the Gregorian mission to the Anglo-Saxons seven years later. The community was dedicated to the Apostle Andrew. It retained its original dedication in early medieval documents, then was normally recorded after 1000 as dedicated to St. Gregory in Clivo Scauri. The term in Clivo Scauri reflected its site along the principal access road, the <b>Clivus</b> Scauri, which ran up the ancient slope (...) that rose from the valley between the Palatine Hill and the Caelian.|$|E
2500|$|The Basilica is {{the first}} part visible from the <b>Clivus</b> Palatinus, the road that connects the Roman Forum to the Palatine Hill. A long portico (Po) runs {{alongside}} the domus on the west and north sides {{at the end of}} which is the main entrance (E) which seems to serve both the public and the private part of the palace. Once inside the visitor enters the Lararium (L) housing a detachment of the Praetorian guard. It is the smallest and most poorly preserved room in the palace. Behind it was once a staircase providing access to the Domus Augustana. Below this room parts of the earlier House of the Griffins have been excavated and from which exquisite decorations have been removed to the Antiquarium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clivus</b> is {{also used}} as an {{abbreviated}} term for the <b>clivus</b> ocularis which is the sloping inner wall of the retina as it dips into the foveola in the macula of the eye. For this reason, and to disambiguate, the <b>clivus</b> is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Blumenbach <b>clivus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>clivus</b> is an {{important}} landmark for checking for anatomical atlanto-occipital alignment; the <b>clivus,</b> when viewed on a lateral C-spine X-ray, forms a line which, if extended, is known as Wackenheim's <b>clivus</b> line. Wackenheim's <b>clivus</b> line should pass through the dens of the axis or be tangential to it.|$|E
50|$|Although Platner {{identified}} the <b>Clivus</b> Argentarius ("Banker Street") with the Lautumiae, Lawrence Richardson distinguishes {{the two in}} A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (1992). Richardson {{identified the}} <b>Clivus</b> Argentarius as the street that connects the Roman Forum and the Campus Martius, running from the Vulcanal and along {{the front of the}} Carcer (Tullianum) over the northeast slope of the Capitoline Hill. Only medieval sources name a <b>Clivus</b> Argentarius, but it probably reflects the ancient financial activity centered on the offices of argentarii, professional deposit bankers.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>clivus</b> (Latin for [...] "slope") is a bony {{part of the}} cranium at {{the skull}} base, a shallow {{depression}} behind the dorsum sellæ that slopes obliquely backward. It forms a gradual sloping process at the anterior most portion of the basilar occipital bone at its junction with the sphenoid bone. On axial planes, it sits just posterior to the sphenoid sinuses. Just lateral to the <b>clivus</b> bilaterally is the foramen lacerum (the internal carotid artery reaches the middle cranial fossa above the foramen lacerum), proximal to its anastomosis with the Circle of Willis. Posterior to the <b>clivus</b> is the basilar artery.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, Abby Rockefeller, in the United States, {{read about}} the idea and {{wanted to buy a}} system, but was told they were not for sale due to lack of {{technical}} support. In 1973, Rockefeller founded <b>Clivus</b> Multrum, Inc. in Massachusetts under license from Lindström to market its composting toilet. The brand of <b>Clivus</b> Multrum composting toilets is marketed globally.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Clivus</b> Lautumiarum was {{the road}} (<b>clivus,</b> [...] "slope" [...] or [...] "street") {{on which they}} were located. Platner {{identified}} the road as the one running between the Curia and the Temple of Concordia which became the <b>Clivus</b> Argentarius in the later Empire, but the Argentarius is also {{thought to have been}} a separate street. In Platner's analysis, it was thus one of six streets leading into the Forum, which it connected to the Porta Fontinalis, from there forming the direct link to the Campus Martius until the street plan was altered by the building of the Imperial fora. Vicus Lautumiarum refers to the area as a neighborhood or quarter (see vicus) [...]|$|E

50|$|The {{transnasal}} {{approach is}} used when the surgeon needs {{to access the}} roof of the nasal cavity, the <b>clivus,</b> or the odontoid. This approach is used to remove chordomas, chondrosarcoma, inflammatory lesions of the <b>clivus,</b> or metastasis in the cervical spine region. The anterior septum or posterior septum is removed so that the surgeon can use both sides of the nose. One side can be used for a microscope and the other side for a surgical instrument, or both sides can be used for surgical instruments.|$|E

5000|$|A multrum {{is a large}} {{composting}} vessel, predominantly {{meant to}} decompose toilet excreta but also other organic residue. It is originally a composite word consisting of [...] "multna" [...] which means moldering or composting in Swedish and [...] "rum" [...] which is the Swedish word for room. A multrum has over several decades become a noun and has come to mean any large composting chamber connected to a toilet. This {{should not be confused}} with <b>Clivus</b> multrum which is a proprietary product. In Scandinavia there are many kinds of composting toilet multrums like Mullis, CompostEra besides <b>Clivus</b> Multrum.|$|E
50|$|Tentorial incisure (also {{known as}} the tentorial notch or incisura tentorii) refers to the {{anterior}} opening between the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli and the <b>clivus</b> for {{the passage of the}} brainstem.|$|E
50|$|Chordomas {{can arise}} from bone in the skull base and {{anywhere}} along the spine. The two most common locations are cranially at the <b>clivus</b> {{and in the}} sacrum {{at the bottom of}} the spine.|$|E

50|$|Behind the dorsum sellae is {{a shallow}} depression, the <b>clivus,</b> which slopes obliquely backward, and is {{continuous}} with the groove on the basilar {{portion of the}} occipital bone; it supports {{the upper part of}} the pons.|$|E
50|$|It {{still stands}} in the Via di S. Vito (the ancient <b>Clivus</b> Suburanus - the sequel, the Via S. Madonna dei Monti, follows {{the course of the}} ancient Argiletum, the main road to the Roman Forum).|$|E
