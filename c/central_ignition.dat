40|$|Recent {{observational}} {{and theoretical}} progress has favored merging and helium-accreting sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs in the double-degenerate and the double-detonation channels, respectively, {{as the most}} promising progenitors of normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Thus the fate of rapidly-accreting Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate channel remains more mysterious then ever. In this paper, we clarify the nature of ignition in Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia by analytically deriving {{the existence of a}} characteristic length scale which establishes a transition from <b>central</b> <b>ignitions</b> to buoyancy-driven ignitions. Using this criterion, combined with data from three-dimensional simulations of convection and ignition, we demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of ignition events within Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate channel are buoyancy-driven, and consequently lack a vigorous deflagration phase. We thus infer that single-degenerate SNe Ia are generally expected to lead to overluminous 1991 T-like SNe Ia events. We establish that the rates predicted from both the population of supersoft X-ray sources and binary population synthesis models of the single-degenerate channel are broadly consistent with the observed rates of overluminous SNe Ia, and suggest that the population of supersoft X-ray sources are the dominant stellar progenitors of SNe 1991 T-like events. We further demonstrate that the single-degenerate channel contribution to the normal and failed 2002 cx-like rates is not likely to exceed 1 % of the total SNe Ia rate. We conclude with a range of observational tests of overluminous SNe Ia which will either support or strongly constrain the single-degenerate scenario.

40|$|An {{explosion}} of flammable mixtures in interconnected compartments is commonly defined as pressure piling. Piling pressure is phenomenon when the peak pressure observed {{is higher than}} the predictable thermodynamic values. The two main mechanisms affecting pressure piling are pre-compression and violence of explosion. Therefore, this paper is aim study on the effect of ignition location on pressure piling using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation. Different points of ignition were studied using this simulation which are central and end point in the interconnected vessel (primary vessel). Besides that the role played by pre-compression and violence of explosion were also studied. In this studied, CFD codes were used as this simulation able to reproduce the explosion phenomenon (propane air) strongly depends on the sub-models used for turbulence and combustion. The proportion of the propane air used was 50 - 50. The model of the interconnected vessel were construct in the Gambit with the height and width of the primary vessel are 0. 75 cm and 0. 305. Meanwhile the height and width of the secondary vessel are 0. 15 cm and 0. 26 cm. Later on, the model was imported to the Fluent to reproduce the explosion. From my research, the peak pressure for ignition location at the end in the primary vessel gives the highest value than the peak pressure of <b>central</b> <b>ignition</b> location. This is due to the end ignition location; the flame has much more time to develop turbulence before it enters the secondary vessel. This method is the best to study about an explosion in interconnected vessel because of low cost involve rather than sacrifice a plant which is something irrational to be done.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{inertial}} fusion energy (IFE) chamber concepts have been proposed and analyzed to various levels of detail [1, 2]. A smaller number of detailed power plant design studies (i. e., studies considering self-consistent integration of targets, drivers and chambers) have also been completed for both direct-drive and indirect-drive, <b>central</b> <b>ignition</b> (CI) targets [3 - 5]. There have not been any comparable studies of fusion chambers or integrated power plants for fast-ignition (FI) based IFE. Some specific aspects (advantages and issues) have been previously describe [6, 7], {{but not to the}} level of detail of the large integrated design studies. In this paper, we review current understanding of chamber design and power plant features for fast-ignition. We approach this topic by asking what chamber and power plant issues and features will be different for fast ignition compared to <b>central</b> <b>ignition.</b> In this article, we consider first wall and final optics design issues for various chamber concepts with direct and indirect drive FI targets, while target manufacture and injection issues are considered in another paper in this special issue [8]. If it is found that the ignitor beams can efficiently penetrate the plasma that is blown off the fuel capsule surface during the compression phase, the FI targets may look much like CI targets. In this case the fusion chamber and final optics issues are likely to be very similar to those for CI targets, except for the final optics of the ignitor beams. It is more likely that the efficiency of transferring ignitor beam energy through the blow-off plasma to the ignition spot fuel will be so low that whatever advantage fast ignition has in reducing required compression driver energy will be more than offset by the size and, therefore, cost of the ignitor lasers themselves. Therefore, it has been proposed to use a cone of high-Z material [9] to shield the ignitor beam line-of-sight from the blow-off plasma and possibly help focus the short pulse ignitor beams onto the dense fuel. Figure 1 illustrates what these cone focus targets might look like for laser direct-drive, laser indirect-drive and heavy ion indirect-drive concepts. The Tabak article in this special issue describes the operation and performance of these targets [10]. The cones must be relatively heavy and thick to avoid breaking up during the implosion of the fuel. In the direct-drive case, the cone must also be long enough that ablated material from the fuel capsule does not go around the end and into the ignitor beam line of sight. It has been suggested that the cone length may have to be up to four times the initial radius of the fuel capsule [7]. For hohlraum targets, the cones need not be as long because the hohlraum wall itself retards the expanding plasma. The presence of the massive high-Z cone in close proximity to the high density fuel will affect the energy partition of the burning capsule output and its x-ray and debris spectra. It can also affect the aerodynamics of the target during injection. Finally, if the capsule fails to ignite, the consequences of the dud may be different for cone targets than for <b>central</b> <b>ignition</b> targets. All these potential differences will be examined in this article. In Section 2, we discuss the power plant benefits of FI cone-focus targets with emphasis on the economic advantages of high target gain at low driver energy. Section 3 shows how the energy partition and spectra of cone focus targets compares with <b>central</b> <b>ignition</b> targets. Section 4 covers possible chamber concepts that are compatible with indirect-drive fast ignition. Section 5 reviews two special issues for FI power plants: Section 5. 1 describes the survival of final optics, especially for the extremely intense ignitor beams, while Section 5. 2 discusses the consequences of duds, which may occur more frequently for FI targets. Section 6 lists recommended near-term future work for FI power plant issues discussed in this article, and Section 7 gives our conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Contrary to the <b>central</b> spark <b>ignition</b> concept, {{the fuel}} of the {{deuterium-tritium}} (DT) capsule in a fast ignition (FI) scheme will be compressed at lower implosion velocities to densities {{of several hundred}} g/cm 3, what reduces problems with high symmetry and hydrodynamic instabilities [1]. To ignite such a precompressed pellet, additional internal energy must be allocated in a local region of its dense core, the so-called hot spot, {{at the moment of}} stagnating implosion. As soon as fusion chain reactions will set in, a burn wave spreads over the whole volume of the target.

40|$|A {{series of}} two {{dimensional}} numerical simulations of explosive nuclear burning is presented for white dwarfs near the Chandraskhar mass. We {{assume that the}} burning begins as a slow deflagration front {{at or near the}} center of the star, and continues until the density in the burning regions has declined to about 10 " 7 g cm"-" 3, where the flame is essentially extinguished. We employ a novel numerical representation of the turbulent flame brush based upon ideas previously developed for modelling laboratory combustion and explore in some detail the sensitivity of the outcome to the manner in which burning is initiated. In particular, we simulate (1) a centrally ignited deflagration, (2) off-center ignition at a single ''point'', and (3) simultaneous off-center ignition at five ''points''. We find that the amount of " 5 " 6 Ni that is produced and other observable properties depend sensitively upon how the fuel is ignited. Because of the immediate onset of buoyant acceleration, the burning region in models ignited off center rises toward the surface more quickly than in the (commonly assumed) case of <b>central</b> <b>ignition.</b> With the exception of the model that ignited off-center at a single point, all models are unbound at the end of the computations and between 0. 59 M_sun (<b>central</b> <b>ignition)</b> and 0. 65 M_sun (ignition at multiple ''points'') of matter are processed into nuclear burning products. These results would guarantee an observable, though weak, type Ia supernova. Our results are expected to change for simulations in three dimensions, especially for the off-center ignitions discussed in this paper, and late detonations driven by pulsations are not unambigously excluded. We can, however, state that the chances for a direct transition to a detonation appear small because, in all our models, the turbulent velocity of the burning front remains very subsonic.

The study completes the previous analysis by Marigo et al. (2001) on the constant-mass evolution of primordial stars.

We show the time evolution of near-infrared brightness fluctuation properties over large age and metallicity ranges, i. e., from 12 Myr to 16 Gyr, and from Z/Z ⊙ = 1 / 50 to Z/Z ⊙ = 2. 5, for single age, single metallicity stellar populations. All the stellar models are followed from the zero age main sequence to the <b>central</b> carbon <b>ignition</b> for massive stars, or {{to the end of}} the thermally pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch phase for low and intermediate mass stars. The new models are compared with observed near-infrared fluctuation absolute magnitudes and colours for a sample of Magellanic Cloud star clusters and Fornax Cluster galaxies. For star clusters younger than ∼ 3 Gyr, the predicted near-infrared fluctuation properties are in a satisfactory agreement with observed ones over a wide range of stellar population metallicities. However, for older star clusters, the agreement between the observed and predicted near-IR brightness fluctuations depends on how the surface brightness absolute magnitudes are estimated. The computed set of models are not able to match the observed near-IR fluctuation absolute magnitudes and colours simultaneously. We argue that the observed discrepancies between the predicted and observed properties of old MC superclusters are more likely due to observational reasons...|$|R
40|$|Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are {{generally}} {{thought to be}} due to the thermonuclear explosions of carbon–oxygen white dwarfs (COWDs) with masses near the Chandrasekhar mass. This scenario, however, has two long-standing problems. First, the explosions do not naturally produce the correct mix of elements, but have to be finely tuned to proceed from subsonic deflagration to supersonic detonation. Second, population models and observations give formation rates of near-Chandrasekhar WDs that are far too small. Here, we suggest that SNe Ia instead result from mergers of roughly equal-mass CO WDs, including those that produce sub-Chandrasekhar mass remnants. Numerical studies of such mergers have shown that the remnants consist of rapidly rotating cores that contain most of the mass and are hottest in the center, surrounded by dense, small disks. We argue that the disks accrete quickly, and that the resulting compressional heating likely leads to <b>central</b> carbon <b>ignition.</b> This ignition occurs at densities for which pure detonations lead to events similar to SNe Ia. With this merger scenario, we can understand the type Ia rates and have plausible reasons for the observed range in luminosity and for the bias of more luminous supernovae toward younger populations. We speculate that explosions of WDs slowly brought to the Chandrasekhar limit—which should also occur—are responsible for some of the “atypical” SNe Ia...|$|R
40|$|The Chandrasekhar {{mass model}} for Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) has {{received}} increasing support from recent comparisons of observations with light curve predictions and modeling of synthetic spectra. It explains SN Ia events via thermonuclear explosions of accreting white dwarfs in binary stellar systems, being caused by <b>central</b> carbon <b>ignition</b> {{when the white}} dwarf approaches the Chandrasekhar mass. As the electron gas in white dwarfs is degenerate, characterized by high Fermi energies for the high density regions in the center, electron capture on intermediate mass and Fe-group nuclei {{plays an important role}} in explosive burning. Electron capture affects the central electron fraction Y_e, which determines the composition of the ejecta from such explosions. Up to the present, astrophysical tabulations based on shell model matrix elements were only available for light nuclei in the sd-shell. Recently new Shell Model Monte Carlo (SMMC) and large-scale shell model diagonalization calculations have also been performed for pf-shell nuclei. These lead in general to a reduction of electron capture rates in comparison with previous, more phenomenological, approaches. Making use of these new shell model based rates, we present the first results for the composition of Fe-group nuclei produced in the central regions of SNe Ia and possible changes in the constraints on model parameters like ignition densities and burning front speeds.
