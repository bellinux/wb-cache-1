50|$|The primary {{structural}} {{advantage of}} concrete blocks {{in comparison to}} smaller clay-based bricks is that a CMU wall can be reinforced by filling the block voids with concrete with or without steel rebar. Generally, certain voids are designated for filling and reinforcement, particularly at corners, wall-ends, and openings while other voids are left empty. This increases wall strength and stability more economically than filling and reinforcing all voids. Typically, structures made of CMUs will have the top <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> in the walls filled with concrete and tied together with steel reinforcement to form a bond beam. Bond beams are often a requirement of modern building codes and controls. Another type of steel reinforcement, referred to as ladder-reinforcement, can also be embedded in horizontal mortar joints of concrete block walls. The introduction of steel reinforcement generally results in a CMU wall having much greater lateral and tensile strength than unreinforced walls.|$|E

40|$|A {{discrete}} model with rigid blocks and elastic-plastic interfaces is adopted {{for studying the}} collapse behavior of in-plane loaded masonry panels with random texture. An existing random {{discrete model}}, originally developed in the elastic field, is here extended {{to the field of}} material nonlinearity by adopting a Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion for restraining actions at joint level. The resulting model turns out to be simple and effective in determining collapse loads and mechanisms of rectangular masonry panels, also accounting for a further perturbation parameter able to vary the height of each <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>blocks</b> into the masonry panel.

Argiotoxin acts as an open channel blocker in a voltage-dependent manner and discriminates between the functionally diverse AMPA receptors.

The Ba 2 + current through the α 1 Cα 2 β and the α 1 Bα 2 β {{channels}} had electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of L- and N-type Ca 2 + channels, respectively. Amlodipine {{had a strong}} blocking action on both the L-type and N-type Ca 2 + channels expressed in the oocyte. The potency <b>of</b> the amlodipine <b>block</b> on the N-type Ca 2 + channel was comparable to that on the L-type Ca 2 + channel. At − 100 [*]mV holding potential, the IC 50 values for amlodipine block on the L-type and N-type Ca 2 + channel were 2. 4 and 5. 8 [*]μM, respectively. The <b>blocking</b> action <b>of</b> amlodipine on the N-type Ca 2 + channel was dependent on holding potential and extracellular pH, as has been observed with amlodipine block on the L-type Ca 2 + channel. A depolarized holding potential and high pH enhanced the <b>blocking</b> action <b>of</b> amlodipine. The time <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>block</b> development by amlodipine was similar for L-type and N-type Ca 2 + channels.

5000|$|Built of limestone, the Hummel House {{is covered}} with a slate roof and {{features}} elements of granite. [...] It was built with an irregular and asymmetrical floor plan, including a prominent porch and a turret. The two-and-a-half-story facade is divided into three bays, with the turret on one of the corners; it dominates the appearance, with the two-story porch being the house's second most prominent feature. Uniformity is absent from the porch: ashlar was used for its first-story pillars, while the flat roof of the second story relies on spindled wooden columns and balustrade. Erected to be the home of George Hummel, the house features variety in its stonework: <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> small <b>blocks</b> alternate with <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> large <b>blocks,</b> while the foundation and water table are built of random stonework in multiple colors. These elements, together with the porch and turret, lend the house an eclectic appearance with influence from multiple styles common during the late Victorian period.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{lidocaine}} on sodium current in cardiac myocytes isolated from cat and guinea pig were investigated using the whole-cell {{variation of the}} patch-damp technique. Lidocaine (43 - 200 (iM) reduced sodium current during repetitive depolarizing pulses in a use-dependent manner. To clarify the nature <b>of</b> the use-dependent <b>block,</b> we characterized the time <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>block</b> development using a two-pulse protocol. Two distinct phases <b>of</b> <b>block</b> development were found: a rapid phase (T = 1 - 6 msec) having a time course concurrent with the time <b>course</b> <b>of</b> channel activation, and a slower phase (T = 100 - 900 msec), which developed after channels inactivated. The amplitude <b>of</b> the <b>block</b> during the rapid phase of development was a steep function of transmembrane voltage over the range of- 70 to + 20 mV.

These results suggest that use-dependent <b>block</b> <b>of</b> sodium channels in cardiac tissue may result from an interaction of lidocaine with sodium channels in the activated as well as the inactivated channel states.

40|$|Aminopyridines {{are known}} to block {{potassium}} (K) currents in excitable membranes in a manner dependent upon membrane potential, such that the block is relieved by depolarization and restored upon repolarization. In the present study, the effects of aminopyridines on voltage-dependent potassium (K) channels were examined in internally perfused, voltage-clamped squid giant axons. The time <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>block</b> restoration after conditioning depolarization {{was found to be}} modulated by membrane electric field, K-channel gating, and external cations. Depolarized holding potentials accelerated block restoration without altering steady-state block levels, suggesting that the voltage dependence <b>of</b> <b>block</b> restoration may be related to K channel gating rather than drug binding per se. In support of this notion, low external calcium concentration, which shifts the voltage dependence of K-channel gating to more negative potentials, also accelerated block restoration. Conversely, the relationship between the rate <b>of</b> <b>block</b> restoration and membrane holding potential was shifted in the depolarizing direction by phloretin, an agent that shifts the dependence of K-channel opening on membrane potential in a similar manner. Modification of K-channel gating also was found to alter the rate <b>of</b> <b>block</b> restoration. Addition <b>of</b> internal zinc or internal treatment with glutaraldehyde slowed the time <b>course</b> <b>of</b> both K-channel activation and aminopyridine block restoration. Aminopyridines also were found to interact in the K channel with external Cs+, NH 4 +, and Rb+, each of which slowed aminopyridine block restoration. Our results suggest that aminopyridines enter and occlude K channels, and that the availability of the binding site may be modulated by channel gating such that access is limited by the probability of the channel reaching an intermediate closed state at the resting potential...|$|R

40|$|Evoked {{release of}} {{transmitter}} at the squid giant synapse was examined under conditions where the calcium ion {{concentration in the}} presynaptic terminal was manipulated by inhibitors of calcium sequestration. Simultaneous intracellular recordings of presynaptic and post-synaptic resting and action potentials were made during bath application {{of one of the}} following metabolic inhibitors: sodium cyanide (NaCN), carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP); ruthenium red (RuR) and sodium-free (lithium) sea water. Cyanide and lithium sea water reversibly depressed the post-synaptic potential (p. s. p.) whilst RuR and FCCP blocked the evoked post-synaptic response irreversibly. The progressive reduction of p. s. p. amplitude was accompanied by a reversible increase in synaptic delay. The time <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>block</b> <b>of</b> the p. s. p. was similar for different agents and dependent on the rate of presynaptic activity (30 - 40 min at 0. 01 Hz). Recovery of the post-synaptic action potential following block by cyanide and lithium sea water was obtained within 40 min and 5 min respectively. Synaptic depression by the metabolic inhibitors does not result from changes in presynaptic resting or action potentials, nor from a change in post-synaptic receptor sensitivity. The post-synaptic response to the local ionophoresis of L-glutamate was unchanged following inhibition of evoked release of transmitter by cyanide. Injections of EGTA into presynaptic terminals poisoned by cyanide produced transient increases in p. s. p. amplitude, suggesting that cyanide is having its effect through raising intracellular calcium rather than lowering ATP. Control experiments injecting EGTA into unpoisoned nerve terminals showed no apparent effect on evoked transmitter release...|$|R
