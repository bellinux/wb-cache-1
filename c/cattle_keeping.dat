5000|$|The Rukwa is sparsely populated, with {{an economy}} {{revolving}} around agriculture, <b>cattle</b> <b>keeping</b> and fishing. An important rice producing area, the main crops are maize and paddy. Garden crops include beans, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes; bananas, mangoes, lemons, pineapples, sesame, and sugar cane are grown as well. There is {{an influx of}} Sukuma cattle. Human cases of anthrax was noted in 1985 to be a [...] "persistent problem" [...] stemming from cattle consumption.|$|E
50|$|Lord Iveagh {{realised}} {{the land}} {{had to be}} made more profitable and manure would be needed and therefore, in 1932 he started to buy in dairy <b>cattle,</b> <b>keeping</b> only those that passed the TB Test. In 1927 there were 120 cows, by 1962 there were 715 plus 816 young stock. Lord and Lady Iveagh took a keen interest in their Dairy Herds and prepared a 'family tree', which was regularly up dated, for every animal in their possession.|$|E

Common jobs held by the Sebei include cattle keepers and crop farmers. The jobs depend on where you live. Because of their fairly laid back culture, the need for major social structure is limited. There are not many criminal offenses that one could do. In Sebei culture, there are two levels of criminal offense. The highest level is for murder and physical assault, the lower level is for property or major civil disputes between people or groups of people.|$|E

50|$|Cuckmere Haven {{is home to}} a large {{variety of}} wildlife, and has a rich ecosystem. Sheep and <b>cattle</b> graze, <b>keeping</b> the fields at a {{constant}} vegetation level. Woodpigeons and rooks pick at the stubble, and aquatic birds such as oystercatchers forage in the water meadows. The result is a fertile area of land providing varied habitats. The beaches are made up of shingle and, right by the sea, rock pools. Chalk is eroded from the cliffs, but not much ends up on the beach. Driftwood and rubbish end up on the beach but do not seem to pollute the environment and do not spoil the view of the beach.|$|R
50|$|Every day {{life was}} {{extremely}} hard since <b>cattle</b> <b>keeping</b> (mostly sheep {{and also some}} goats) was the local profession for ordinary villagers. The typical family lived in a constant move. When {{it was not the}} Ottoman occupant's menace it was the strong winter which obliged shepherds to take their herds to milder weathers and pastures in the Argolid returning to Valtetsi in April. When September arrived, they started the herd's move again, this time to the summer camps in Tegea and Dimitsana. The existence of nearby marshes, worsened the living conditions up to a level that a strong dengue epidemic struck the village even {{at the beginning of the}} Twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|Katuna is also {{famous for}} very fertile lands {{that are used}} for dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>keeping</b> and the growing of Irish potatoes. Because of its {{strategic}} location at the border with Rwanda, Katuna {{has the potential to}} grow into a major border town in Uganda, just like other towns such as Malaba and Busia. Katuna has a distinctive terrain. On one side of the road are very steep and rocky mountains that make the construction of houses very tedious and expensive. On {{the other side of the}} road is a swampy and marshy valley. To construct houses on the swampy side of the road, one has to first fill the place with rocks and a lot of soil. These two aspects of physical landscape make construction in Katuna very expensive. They also make Katuna a very compact place.|$|E
50|$|The {{core unit}} of Ekasala {{consists}} of generally three rooms {{connected to a}} front passage. The central room is used as prayer room and grain store and the two side rooms are used as living rooms. The core unit may be raised to an upper storey with a steep stair located in the front passage. The building may also be extended horizontally on all the four sides adding alindams or side rooms for activities such as cooking, dining, additional sleeping rooms, front hall for receiving guests etc.The Chappamattam Tharavadu at Chirakkadavu is a classical example of extended Ekasala. If needed Ekasala may also be provided with ancillary buildings for <b>cattle</b> <b>keeping,</b> barn, bathing rooms near tanks, outhouse for guests, gate house etc. By such extension the building may become much larger than a Nalukettu in space, {{but it is still}} categorized as Ekasala with reference to its core unit.|$|E
50|$|Pari {{oral history}} says the people {{migrated}} {{from the north}} and west to Lafon County in Equatoria Province, where they lived in six villages at the foot of Lipul Hill (Jebel Lafon).

Pochalla is to the extreme east of the state, located on the border with Ethiopia. Much of the County is sandwiched between two rivers, the Akobo, which forms the national boundary to the east, and the Oboth to the west. The dominant people group are the Anuak who border the Murle to the west and the Nuer to the North, both of whom are <b>cattle</b> <b>keeping</b> tribes, who have a culture of raiding to increase their cattle numbers. To the east in Ethiopia the Anuak have had tensions with the government, so communications are weak.|$|E

Toutswemogala is an elongated flat-topped hill rising about 50 meters above the surrounding flat mopane veld. It is an Iron Age settlement, which has been occupied on two different occasions. The radio-carbon dates for this settlement range from 7th to late 19th century AD indicating occupation {{of more than one}} thousand years. The hill was part of the formation of early states in Southern Africa with <b>cattle</b> <b>keeping</b> as major source of economy. This was supplemented by goats, sheep and foraging as well as hunting of wild animals. The remaining features of Toutswe settlement include house-floors, large heaps of vitrified cow-dog and burials while the outstanding structure is the stone wall. There are large traits of centaurs ciliaris, a type of grass which has come to be associated with cattle-keeping settlements in South, Central Africa.|$|E
50|$|The Freiherr von Erlenbach first {{appears in}} records in 1133. When the Erlenbach family died out, their lands {{probably}} passed through another noble family before ending {{up with the}} Freiherr von Brandis in 1368. Beginning in the 14th century, the Landsgemeinde, the direct democratic assembly, of the surrounding communities met in Erlenbach. In 1393, 1429 and 1445 the villagers bought their obligation to pay taxes and serve in corvée labor away from the Freiherr von Brandis. When the city of Bern acquired the villages from the Freiherr in 1439, they reconfirmed the villages' rights. Beginning in the 16th century they began to raise <b>cattle,</b> <b>keeping</b> them in the valleys for winter before moving them to spring pastures in the mountains. Over the following years, Erlenbach became a major cattle and cheese exporter. A number of local residents became wealthy from exports and built large chalets in the village. In 1765, much of the village was destroyed in a fire, though it was quickly rebuilt. Following the 1798 French invasion, Erlenbach im Simmental {{became part of the}} Helvetic Republic district of Niedersimmental in the Canton of Oberland. In 1803, with the Act of Mediation, it rejoined the Canton of Bern.|$|E

There have been reports of atrocities and many civil victims of the disarmament, as army forces and nomadic warriors clashed.
