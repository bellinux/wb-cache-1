In Buffalo, New York, morning northwest winds had shifted to northeast by noon and were blowing southeast by 5:00p.m., with the fastest gusts, 80mph (130km/h), occurring between 1:00p.m. and 2:00p.m. Just 180miles (290km) to the southwest, in Cleveland, winds remained northwest during the day, shifting to the west by 5:00p.m., and maintaining speeds of more than 50mph (80km/h). The fastest gust in Cleveland, 79mph (127km/h), occurred at 4:40p.m. There was a dramatic drop in barometric pressure at Buffalo, from 29.52inHg (999.7hPa) at 8:00a.m. to 28.77inHg (974.3hPa) at 8:00p.m.|$|E
5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and <b>counterclockwise</b> <b>rotation,</b> forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{tectonics}} of the Chenoua massif suggests block rotations of Neogene nappes {{associated with}} the African–European plate convergence. To estimate the extent of these rotations, a Paleomagnetic study on rhyolites and andesites of Langhian–Serravallian age and sandstones of Burdigalian age was carried out on 23 sites (200 specimens). The sites are distributed in the northwestern, southeastern and southern Chenoua massif. One or two components of magnetization, mainly carried by magnetite, pyrrhotite and/or hematite, were isolated in sandstones and volcanics. The sandstone sites reveal magnetizations in sandstones from the Cap Blanc syncline that are post-folding. However, both polarities are found, {{which is consistent with}} data from Africa during the Upper Miocene. Clockwise and <b>counterclockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> were recorded, dating back to the Neogene times in volcanics and sediments. From the faulted Cap Blanc syncline <b>counterclockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> of 1 [*]±[*] 4 ° to 18 [*]±[*] 28 ° around a vertical axis occurred in sediments since the Miocene with respect to Africa. In fact, remagnetizations occurred at several periods of time and in different sites, providing information on the evolution of post-tectonic rotations. Some volcanics record <b>counterclockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> of about 30 ° since the Miocene, whereas others do not show any significant rotation. This {{can be explained by the}} direction of the principal compressive stress axis σ 1 and by lateral extrusions related to an indentation model, in which we expect both clockwise and <b>counterclockwise</b> <b>rotations...</b>|$|R

25|$|It first flew in 1951, and {{although}} 200 units were planned, only 65 were ever built. The Hispano engine was an upright V12 {{in contrast to}} the inverted V12 Daimler-Benz DB 601 & 605 engines used in the Bf 109. Being of compact design, it fitted the airframe of the Bf 109 well, representing it in the German 1957 film Der Stern von Afrika (The Star of Africa) about Luftwaffe ace Hans-Joachim Marseille. In the original design, an asymmetric vertical fin with an airfoiled profile had been introduced starting with the Bf 109F to produce a slight left movement of the tail, which counteracted the left-side torque reaction from the Daimler-Benz engine's <b>counterclockwise</b> <b>rotation.</b> Since this was left unchanged in the Buchón, and the Hispano V12 powered a clockwise-turning propeller instead, the combination of the airfoiled fin and the clockwise-turning propeller created a hard-to-counteract right swing on takeoff, since the fin and the propeller essentially worked in the same direction.|$|E

These data, together with published results from coeval sediments, demonstrate that this arc is an orocline in its central northern sector. Bending, not well constrained in time, was due to about 15 ° clockwise rotations of the central part of this arc and to <b>counterclockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> farther north. In this latter area, post-Messinian <b>counterclockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> are of the same amplitude as those calculated for some classic Mesozoic paleomagnestic sections in northern Umbria, suggesting a Plio-Pleistocene age for the rotations reported from the older sequences...|$|R

40|$|Paleomagnetic {{analysis}} from lower Pleistocene (Sicilian) mudstones in the Sant’Arcangelo basin (Southern Apennines, Italy) shows no vertical-axis rotations. These results define the upper time constraint on the 238 <b>counterclockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> previously {{measured in the}} underlying lower Pleistocene (Santernian–Emilian) units of the Sant’Arcangelo basin. These rotations occurred before the Jaramillo subchron in a time span of, 0. 5 m. y.

The near-inertial surface currents are dominantly clockwise with amplitudes of 9 - 12 cm s⁻¹. However, they appear asymmetric and elliptical as a result of counterclockwise inertial motions with magnitudes in a range of 2 - 5 cm s⁻¹. The decorrelation time and length scales are computed from the decay slope of the near-inertial peak and the spatial coherence in the near-inertial frequency band, respectively. Decorrelation time scales of clockwise near-inertial motions increase from 2 days nearshore (within 30 km from the coast) to 6 days offshore, and their length scales increase from 30 to 90 km seaward possibly due to coastal inhibition.

40|$|The Carpathian orogen {{formed as}} a result of {{collision}} of the Alcapa and Tisza-Dacia microplates with the European Platform. With the objective of better constraining the regional paloegeographic evolution, we carried out paleomagnetic studies within the Central Western Carpathians, which constitutes a fragment of the Alcapa microplate. This study is a continuation of our earlier works performed in the Tatra Mts where we studied lower Triassic red sandstones from the autochthonous cover of the crystalline basement. This time we investigated rocks of matching age, lithology and tectonic position, from the area of two nearby mountain massifs: Low Tatra and Velka Fatra. Petromagnetic analyses provided similar results for all the studied sites. Red sandstones are rich in hematite and contain only small amounts of low coercivity ferromagnetic minerals. Hematite carrier records one characteristic component characterized by maximum unblocking temperatures of 680 °C. This component displays dominantly normal polarity with shallow to moderate inclinations and north directed declinations (after the tectonic correction). The results obtained in this study are incompatible with previous paleomagnetic studies pointing to large-scale <b>counterclockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> of the Alcapa. On the other hand, our new findings are in good agreement with our previous results from the Tatra Mts. Observed inclinations are similar to that expected from reference paleomagnetic data from the European Platform, whereas declination values indicate only moderate <b>counterclockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> of about 20 °.
