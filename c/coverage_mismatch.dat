40|$|Abstract — Robust {{parameter}} estimation of sparse data is generally {{applied to the}} tasks when data collection is time-consuming or of high cost. We point out a new problem caused by sparse data. We find that there may exists <b>coverage</b> <b>mismatch</b> between data samples and the population when the sample size is less than 20. We call it the distribution mismatch (DM) problem. In this study, we derive a wide-sense joint pdf for coverage, range, the sample of minimum order, and data samples themselves to analyze the DM problem. Based on the formulation, a new algorithm is proposed to compensate the DM problem. Experimental {{results show that the}} mean estimate of the algorithm will converge to the population mean if the standard deviation of population is known.

40|$|Abstract — WiMax {{broadband}} MAN {{based on}} the IEEE 802. 16 d/e standard supports mobile as well as fixed wireless access services. Both types of subscriber data links are characterized by totally different radio conditions such as e. g. propagation, interference rejection capability, terminal antenna gain, pattern and height. This leads to a significant <b>coverage</b> <b>mismatch,</b> different user application throughput and varying system capacity. Especially the mixture of both mobile and fixed subscribers sharing the same radio resources will consequently determine the cellular network structure, frequency planning and radio resource management. In this paper the performance of mobile and fixed WiMax data links in cellular 3. 5 GHz deployments has been thoroughly analyzed depending on cell size, frequency reuse and system load. Detailed link and network level simulations have been provided for an OFDM- 256 system with 3. 5 MHz channels deployed in homogeneous hexagonal tight 1 x 1 and 1 x 3 reuse with cell radius of 300 m, 1000 m, and 2000 m. Simulation results for the user application throughput, modulation and coding scheme utilization, FTP download time, channel load and packet call blocking have been presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the time evolution of an initial step profile separating a bare substrate region {{from the rest}} of the compressively strained adsorbate layer near a commensurate to incommensurate transition. The rate of profile evolution as a function of the <b>mismatch,</b> <b>coverage</b> and the strength of the substrate potential are determined by Brownian molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the results are qualitatively similar to those observed for the Pb/Si(111) system. The anomalously fast time evolution and sharpness of the non-equilibrium profile can be understood through the domain wall creation at the boundary and its subsequent diffusion into the interior of the adsorbate layer.

40|$|We {{have used}} the two IRAS {{redshift}} surveys, 1. 2 -Jy (Fisher et al 1995) and PSCz (Saunders et al 2000), to model the linear velocity fields within a redshift of 8, 000 km/s and have compared them in redshift space. The two velocity fields only differ significantly in their monopole components. The monopole discrepancy cannot be solely ascribed to shot-noise errors and incomplete sky <b>coverage.</b> The <b>mismatch</b> seems to arise from incompleteness of the PSCz catalog at fluxes < 1. 2 Jy. The 1. 2 -Jy and PSCz higher order velocity multipoles, particularly the dipole and quadrupole components, appear to be consistent, suggesting that the dipole residuals found by Davis, Nusser and Willick (1996) when comparing 1. 2 -Jy and MarkIII velocity fields probably originates from the MarkIII velocities calibration procedure rather than from uncertainties in the model velocity field. Our results illustrate {{the efficiency of the}} spherical harmonics decomposition techniques in detecting possible differences between real and model velocity fields. Similar analyses shall prove to be very useful in the future to test the reliability of next generation model velocity fields derived from new redshift catalogs like 2 dFGRS (Colless et al 2001), SDSS (York et al 2000), 6 dF and 2 MRS.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{analytical}} {{model for the}} determination of the stable phases of strained heteroepitaxial systems in (1 + 1) dimensions. In order for this model to be consistent with a subsequent dynamic treatment, all expressions are adjusted to an atomistic Lennard-Jones system. Good agreement is obtained when the total energy is assumed to consist of two contributions: the surface energy and the elastic energy. As a result, we determine the stable phases {{as a function of the}} main ``control parameters'' (binding energies, <b>coverage</b> and lattice <b>mismatch).</b> We find that there exists no set of parameters leading to an array of islands as a stable configuration. We however show that a slight modification of the model can lead to the formation of stable arrays of islands. Comment: 11 pages, 14 figures, submitted to Physical Review...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{matching}} behaviour of MOS transistors is analyzed for {{the realization of}} an intrinsic [...] accuracy 14 bit current [...] steering D/A [...] converter. It {{is well known that}} the area of a MOS transistor is inversely proportional to the mismatch (Pelgrom mismatch model), related through a technology constant. Also the influence of metal <b>coverage</b> on the <b>mismatch</b> of MOS transistors has been reported. In this work these results are verified. A test chip has been processed and measured. It is an actual implementation of a D/A-converter. From the static linearity measurements the mismatch behavior is extracted, including metal coverage and edge effects. The resulting mismatch error behaviour is important information for the design of future high [...] accuracy circuits. This work paved the ground for the design of the first intrinsic 14 bit accuracy D/A-converter in CMOS known to the authors. I.

40|$|The RADseq {{technology}} allows {{researchers to}} efficiently develop thousands of polymorphic loci across multiple individuals {{with little or}} no prior information on the genome. However, many questions remain about the biases inherent to this technology. Notably, sequence misalignments arising from paralogy may affect the development of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and the estimation of genetic diversity. We evaluated the impact of putative paralog loci on genetic diversity estimation during the development of SNPs from a RADseq dataset for the nonmodel tree species Robinia pseudoacacia L. We sequenced nine genotypes and analyzed the frequency of putative paralogous RAD loci as a function of both the depth of <b>coverage</b> and the <b>mismatch</b> threshold allowed between loci. Putative paralogy was detected in a very variable number of loci, from 1 % to more than 20 %, with the depth of coverage having a major influence on the result. Putative paralogy artificially increased the observed degree of polymorphism and resulting estimates of diversity. The choice of the depth of coverage also affected diversity estimation and SNP validation: A low threshold decreased the chances of detecting minor alleles while a high threshold increased allelic dropout. SNP validation was better for the low threshold (4 ×) than for the high threshold (18 ×) we tested. Using the strategy developed here, we were able to validate more than 80 % of the SNPs tested by means of individual genotyping, resulting in a readily usable set of 330 SNPs, suitable for use in population genetics applications.
