Examples include <b>control,</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, handwriting, natural language, speech and facial recognition.

500|$|In 1958, Kistiakowsky {{suggested}} to President Eisenhower that inspection of foreign military facilities {{was not sufficient}} to control their nuclear weapons. He cited the difficulty in monitoring missile submarines, and proposed that the arms control strategy focus on disarmament rather than inspections. In January 1960, as part of arms <b>control</b> <b>planning</b> and negotiation, he suggested the [...] "threshold concept". Under this proposal, all nuclear tests above the level of seismic detection technology would be forbidden. After such an agreement, the US and USSR would work jointly to improve detection technology, revising the permissible test yield downward as techniques improved. This example of the [...] "national means of technical verification", a euphemism for sensitive intelligence collection used in arms control, would provide safeguards, without raising the on-site inspection requirement to a level unacceptable to the Soviets. The US introduced the threshold concept to the Soviets at the Geneva arms control conference in January 1960 and the Soviets, in March, responded favorably, suggesting a threshold of a given seismic magnitude. Talks broke down {{as a result of}} the U-2 Crisis of 1960 in May.|$|E

Methods This study was conducted in two phases.

The second phase involved telephone interviews with the Comprehensive Cancer <b>Control</b> <b>plan</b> coordinators in states with plans that contained genomic components (n = 16). The interview was designed to gather more detailed information about the genomics-related initiatives within the states Comprehensive Cancer <b>Control</b> <b>plan</b> and the successes with and barriers to plan implementation, as defined by each state. Results Eighteen of the 30 Comprehensive Cancer <b>Control</b> <b>plans</b> analyzed contained genomics components. We noted a large variability among these 18 plans in the types of genomics components included. Nine (56 %) of the 16 states interviewed had begun to implement the genomics components in their plan. Most states emphasized educating health care providers and the public about the role of genomics in cancer control. Many states consider awareness of family history to be an important aspect of their Comprehensive Cancer <b>Control</b> <b>plan.</b> Approximately 67 % of states with family history components in their plans had begun to implement these goals. Virtually all states reported they would benefit from additional training in cancer genetics and general public health genomics. Conclusion The number of states incorporating genomics into their Comprehensive Cancer <b>Control</b> <b>plans</b> is increasing.
