The logging response characteristics of lower and middle Napo shales show that the <b>caliper</b> <b>logging</b> exhibits enlargement, the Sp logging shows the base value, and the Gr, resistivity, and acoustic logging values are high.

The instrument {{was used in}} two bedrock wells to evaluate its ability to identify fractures that contribute to ground water flow. The wells are bored through approximately 280 feet of crystalline metamorphic bedrock to a total depth of approximately 310 feet. Prior to deploying the MP Troll 9000, the wells were logged using both conventional and advanced boreholegeophysical methods. These methods included <b>caliper</b> <b>logging,</b> gamma logging, fluid-resistivity logging, fluidtemperature logging, and both optical- and acoustic-televiewer logging. The wells were also logged under ambient and pumping conditions (< 1 gpm) using a heat-pulse flow meter to locate fractures that contribute to flow and estimate associated discharge rates and the direction of vertical flow in the open borehole. The logs were used to corroborate {{the results of the}} vertical water quality profiles obtained using the MP Troll 9000. Water quality profiles within the wells were recorded under both ambient conditions and at pumping rates of 0. 25 - 0. 8 gpm. These rates are comparable to those used during heat-pulse flow meter logging. Preliminary results reveal that the wells exhibited obvious water quality anomalies that can be associated with the fractures contributing to flow as identified by the other borehole logging techniques. As such, the MP Troll 9000 may be a cost effective means to help locate these fractures. Because the MP Troll 9000 measures water quality parameters, it has the additional advantage of being able to potentially detect which fractures are contributing contamination to a well. Further research is currently being conducted to evaluate how water quality parameters change under higher pumping rates, and with slight augmentation, the tool’s use as an effective flow meter. 34...|$|E
40|$|Miravalles {{geothermal}} field {{lies in the}} Guanacaste province of Costa Rica in Central America. At {{the time of the}} study (late 1982), three wells (named PGM- 1, PGM- 2 and PGM- 3), had been drilled and periodically tested in this field during 1980 - 82. During several of these tests scaling of the wellbore appeared to be a serious problem. This paper presents a portion of a study conducted to define the nature and causes of the scaling problem. No new data were gathered during this study; it was based on the analysis of already existing data as of late 1982. The main limitations in the data as regards this study were: (1) no bottomhole pressure measurements had been made; (2) no temperature or pressure profile under flowing condition was available from any well; (3) a wellhead separator was available at only one well (PGM- 1); and (4) although James' lip pressure measurement facilities were available at all wells, in some of the earlier tests (up to May 1981) no measurement of the liquid flow rate was made. The fact that there was scale deposition in the Miravalles wells was indicated by several observations: (1) unusually rapid decline had been experienced in both flow rate and wellhead pressure (p{sub wh}) except when the wells were flowed at a relatively high p{sub wh} level. For example, Figure 1 presents the situation for well PGM- 1 during a test (Test 1). This behavior was not due to reservoir depletion because the wells produced a much larger cumulative mass without a serious drop in flow rate or p{sub wh} when flowed above a certain p{sub wh} level, whereas a much smaller cumulative production was possible if a lower p{sub wh} level was maintained. Only a part of the decline in mass flow rate in some of the tests had been caused by increasing steam fraction in the produced fluid. (2) The decline in flow rate became precipitous towards the end of some of the tests. Yet, there had been no precipitous decline in reservoir pressure. For example, on being shut in after several weeks of wide open discharge in 1981, the water level in well PGM- 1 returned quickly to the original static level. (3) In May 1981, <b>caliper</b> <b>logging</b> indicated that the borehole diameters in PGM- 1 and PGM- 3 were reduced sharply after a few months of flow (Figure 2) ...|$|E

The logs were quality checked with <b>caliper</b> <b>logs</b> for consistency of wellbore diameter. This makes it possible to identify and edit out sections of the logs that were compromised by borehole rugosity. Log headers were checked for depth datum (i.e. whether the quoted depths were relative to Kelly Bushing, subsea or along hole, etc.) and further verified from composite logs and well files. Where necessary, conversions were made from any of the differing depth references to the true vertical depth subsea (TVDSS) format that was uniformly used in the study. Because of the need to work with consistent sand and shale properties, the top and base of main sand and shale units were also delineated from the composite logs and well reports. Considering that the average geothermal gradient of the basin is 25  °C/km, data were taken from well sections that were not expected to be greatly affected by diagenetic mineralogical alterations and late overpressure processes which are mostly active when temperatures tend to exceed 70  °C. Moreover, velocity and density logs of shales were visually examined for consistency of mechanical compaction behaviour (i.e. a general trend of similar density and velocity behaviours with depth).|$|R
30|$|Two deep wells were drilled at Rittershoffen (Alsace, France) {{to produce}} {{high-temperature}} fluids to supply heat to a biorefinery. The GRT- 2 production well was drilled {{to a depth}} of 3196  m MD and was deviated to target a permeable local fault in the granitic basement buried beneath a thick sedimentary cover. The objective {{of this study is to}} better understand the permeability of fractured reservoirs within crystalline rocks, focusing on the production well GRT- 2. Based on a petrographic and mineralogical analysis of cutting samples, several granitic facies associated with hydrothermal alteration were identified on the basis of the amounts of illite, chlorite, anhydrite, secondary geodic quartz, and oxides. These observations were correlated with various geological and geophysical datasets (gamma ray, porosity, density, electrical resistivity, <b>caliper,</b> borehole image <b>logs,</b> temperature, rate of penetration, and mud losses) to localize and identify permeable fracture zones. In sections where acoustic image logs were not available, such as in the deepest part of the well, the geometries of the fracture zones were interpreted from an oriented <b>caliper</b> <b>log.</b> The <b>caliper</b> <b>log</b> interpretation detected one-third of the fractures detected by acoustic image logs. However, two major fracture sets striking N–S and dipping eastward or westward were observed. Furthermore, a synthetic resistivity log that fits the measured resistivity log relatively well was built using the Archie and Waxman and Smits models. This approach is a proxy for estimating the porosity and the mineralogical changes based on the cation exchange capacity, which is controlled by the chlorite/illite ratio, derived from electrical logs in granitic formations. The correlation of all these results allowed the identification of a resistivity signature of a permeable fracture zone that spatially fits with the temperature signature. The major contribution of this study is the identification of a hierarchy of permeable fractures based on petrophysical signatures. The geophysical signature of fracture zones with low residual permeability exhibits a broad depth extent, whereas the geophysical signature of a highly permeable fracture zone is more localized. Past hydrothermal circulation has enlarged the altered and porous zones around open fractures, and in some cases, intense illitization has plugged these fracture zones and reduced their permeabilities.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Borehole {{geophysical}} logging is viable {{method of}} determining the water quality and hydrogeological parameters of aquifers. A recent {{study was conducted to}} delineate the distribution of formation water salinity profile down to 600 meters below land surface of the Kimbiji coastal aquifer located 40 km south of the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam coastal plain in Tanzania. A hydrogeologic seismic cross section was also constructed. The borehole geophysical methods included short and long normal resistivity, natural gamma, spontaneous potential, temperature and <b>caliper.</b> The <b>logs</b> show high permeability and the presence of formation fresh water as indicated by the separation of short/long normal resistivity readings down to 600 m. The potential aquifers were determined based on the natural gamma values less than 23 counts per second to map the sandy intervals. The temperature log shows increasing values with depth from the surface up to 450 meters. This indicates that there is no vertical flow of the water in the borehole along this depth interval and it reflects the normal geothermal gradient. From 460 to 520 and 560 to 612 meters below land surface the log shows a constant or nearby constant temperature with depth which indicates the natural movement of water along the borehole axis (zones of vertical borehole-fluid movement). A clearly curved temperature signature was observed between 540 to 440 meters and this was interpreted as an effect of groundwater flow. A <b>caliper</b> <b>log</b> was used to identify fractures and possible water-producing openings and correct other geophysical logs for changes in borehole diameter. Major fractures and most interesting, occurred at 505 to 515 and 560 to 612 meters below land surface which coincides directly with the change in temperature gradient. These are interpreted as the most important water producing zones as indicated by both temperature <b>log</b> and <b>caliper</b> <b>log.</b> The classification method used in this thesis defines freshwater as having a total dissolved solids concentration of less than 1100 mg/l; waters with a total dissolved solids concentration greater than 1100 mg/l are considered to be saltwater (or saline). For the aquifer formation the pronounced peak values of salinity occur at depth 330. 5 to 331 meters below the land surface with pronounced peak value of 1590 mg/l at 330. 7 meter. The lowest value of salinity along the profile is 526 mg/l. The salinity values show decrease trend with depth with more freshwater from 480 down to 612 meters. The average salinity for the whole potential aquifer was 850 mg/l. The calculated salinity profile in the Kimbiji aquifer is interpreted to be residual in which most parts of the aquifer have been completely flushed out by meteoric water. The depth to the top of Eocene seismic reflector which is the base of Kimbiji aquifer is tectonically controlled as indicated by the seismic cross section. The virtually untapped Kimbiji coastal aquifer system is considered to be an important supplemental source of water for public use in the highly populated coastal area of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania...|$|R

For the data examination and model construction, Petrel and RockDoc software was adopted; it integrates seismic and well log data {{to obtain the}} geological configuration of the study location. The logs were engaged to define the reservoir sands. Qualitative interpretations were carried out using a quick look approach. This enabled us to identify the lithology of the formation and fluid discrimination using gamma ray log and resistivity logs within the study location. The lithology was recognized through the definition of shale baseline. High gamma ray log values depict nonpermeable bed, (shale) and low gamma ray log values identified the permeable beds (sandstone). Comparison of the low gamma ray log value to a high resistivity reading from the resistivity log showed a probable hydrocarbon-bearing sand unit. This quick look examination of the well log signatures revealed numerous reservoir sand units, but only three hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir sands were of interest to us (RS 1, RS 2 and RS 3). From the quantitative interpretation of well logs, the three identified reservoir sands were evaluated in terms of porosity, permeability, hydrocarbon saturation,, shale volume, movable hydrocarbon index and water saturation.|$|R
40|$|The {{orientation}} of the maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax) in the UK Southern North Sea has been determined using data derived from borehole breakout analysis of four-arm <b>caliper</b> <b>logs.</b> The results agree with existing stress models for NW Europe, confirming that horizontal stresses {{in the region have}} an approximately NW–SE {{orientation of}} SHmax. This is interpreted as being a result of plate boundary convergence. Local deviations in the SHmax orientations are observed spatially and also vertically within some wells. Some of these deviations are attributed to rotations of the stress field adjacent to faults or between different fault blocks. The data also suggest detachment of the stress regime in the post-Permian cover rocks, caused by the presence of a thick underlying Permian-aged evaporite sequence and associated halokinesis. Analyses of borehole resistivity image logs have been used to verify the SHmax orientations in some wells. These image logs validate some of the stress indicators whilst highlighting a number of deficiencies in the use of four-arm caliper data to characterise borehole breakouts. From the available data it is difficult to unambiguously define the nature of variations from the mean SHmax orientations observed. Further analyses of image log data over greater depth-ranges are therefore required in order to investigate more fully the effects of stress rotations near faults and apparent stress detachment above salt-cored anticlinal structures...|$|R
