25|$|After World War II ended, the Allies {{discovered}} that Germany was not putting as much serious effort {{into the program}} as had been previously thought.

However, even had the Germans succeeded in getting a reactor operational (as the U.S. did with a graphite reactor in late 1942), they would still have been at least several years away from development of an atomic bomb with maximal effort.

50|$|Fissile nuclei, like Uranium-235, Plutonium-239 and Uranium-233 {{respond well}} to delayed {{neutrons}} and are thus important to keep a <b>critical</b> <b>reactor</b> stable, and this limits the amount of minor actinides that can be destroyed in a <b>critical</b> <b>reactor.</b> As a consequence {{it is important that}} the chosen matrix allows the reactor to keep the ratio of fissile to non-fissile nuclei high, as this enables it to destroy the long-lived actinides safely. In contrast, the power output of a sub-critical reactor is limited by the intensity of the driving particle accelerator, and thus it need not contain any uranium or plutonium at all. In such a system it may be preferable to have an inert matrix that doesn't produce additional long-lived isotopes.|$|E

40|$|Traditional safety {{performance}} requirements for nuclear reactors {{have been developed}} for <b>critical</b> <b>reactors,</b> whose kinetics characteristics differ significantly from sub-critical, accelerator-driven nuclear <b>reactors.</b> In a <b>critical</b> nuclear <b>reactor,</b> relatively small amounts of reactivity (negative or positive) can produce large changes in the fission rate. In sub-critical reactors, the self-multiplication (k) decreases as the sub-criticality (1 -k) increases, and the responsiveness to small reactivity changes decreases. This makes sub-critical nuclear reactors less responsive to positive reactivity insertions than <b>critical</b> <b>reactors.</b> Also, larger negative reactivity insertions are needed in sub-critical reactors to shut down the fission chain if the neutron source remains. This paper presents the results from a computational analysis of the {{safety performance}} of sub-critical, accelerator-driven nuclear reactors. Coupled kinetics and thermal-hydraulics models are used to quantify the effectiveness of traditional protection and control system designs in sub-critical reactors.

40|$|Two {{scenarios}} are typically envisioned for thorium fuel cycles: 'open' cycles based on irradiation of {sup 232 }Th and fission of {sup 233 }U in situ without reprocessing or 'closed' cycles based on irradiation of {sup 232 }Th followed by reprocessing, and recycling of {sup 233 }U either in situ or in critical fission reactors. This study evaluates a third option {{based on the}} possibility of breeding fissile material in a fusion-fission hybrid reactor and burning the same fuel in a <b>critical</b> <b>reactor</b> without any reprocessing or reconditioning. This fuel cycle requires the hybrid and the <b>critical</b> <b>reactor</b> to use the same fuel form. TRISO particles embedded in carbon pebbles were selected as the preferred form of fuel and an inertial laser fusion system featuring a subcritical blanket was combined with critical pebble bed reactors, either gas-cooled or liquid-salt-cooled. The hybrid reactor was modeled based on the earlier, hybrid version of the LLNL Laser Inertial Fusion Energy (LIFE 1) system, whereas the critical reactors were modeled according to the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) and the Pebble Bed Advanced High Temperature Reactor (PB-AHTR) design. An extensive neutronic analysis was carried out for both the hybrid and the fission reactors in order to track the fuel composition at each stage of the fuel cycle and ultimately determine the plant support ratio, which has been defined as the ratio between the thermal power generated in fission reactors and the fusion power required to breed the fissile fuel burnt in these fission reactors. It was found that the maximum attainable plant support ratio for a thorium fuel cycle that employs neither enrichment nor reprocessing is about 2. This requires tuning the neutron energy towards high energy for breeding and towards thermal energy for burning. A high fuel loading in the pebbles allows a faster spectrum in the hybrid blanket; mixing dummy carbon pebbles with fuel pebbles enables a softer spectrum in the critical reactors. This combination consumes about 20 % of the thorium initially loaded in the hybrid reactor ({approx} 200 GWd/tHM), partially during hybrid operation, but mostly during operation in the <b>critical</b> <b>reactor.</b> The plant support ratio is low compared to the one attainable using continuous fuel chemical reprocessing, which can yield a plant support ratio of about 20, but the resulting fuel cycle offers better proliferation resistance as fissile material is never separated from the other fuel components...|$|E
