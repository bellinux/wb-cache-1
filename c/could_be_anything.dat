Although {{the length of the}} syllables was variable (for example, a short syllable <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from 0.07 to 0.65 seconds), the average of the two speakers combined was as follows: short syllables 0.21 seconds, long syllables 0.33 seconds, overlong syllables 0.59 seconds.|$|E

However, Sante Kimes has given {{numerous}} conflicting stories about her origins and numerous other accounts are difficult to confirm, which is why her estranged son, Kent Walker, says that his ancestry <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from Latino to East Indies to Indigenous American to White.|$|E
25|$|Spinoza’s second {{knowledge}} involves reasoning plus emotions. He {{explains that}} this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes {{that have to}} do with anything common to the human mind. An example of this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue.|$|E

25|$|The British Army in the 18th {{century was}} {{commonly}} seen as disciplined, regimented and harsh. Camp life was dirty and cramped {{with the potential}} for a rapid spread of disease, and punishments <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from a flogging to a death sentence. Yet, many men volunteered to join the army, to escape the bleak conditions of life in the cities, for a chance to travel the world and earn a regular wage.|$|E
25|$|Which means: if P and its {{negation}} ¬P {{are both}} {{assumed to be}} true, then P {{is assumed to be}} true, from which it follows {{that at least one of}} the claims P and some other (arbitrary) claim A is true. However, if we know that either P or A is true, and also that P is not true (that ¬P is true) we can conclude that A, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything,</b> is true. Thus if a theory contains a single inconsistency, it is trivial—that is, it has every sentence as a theorem.|$|E
500|$|Oxford {{performed}} well in training, {{and according to}} the rowing correspondent of The Times they [...] "were definitely a much better crew than Cambridge". [...] However, the crew lost three members through illness, [...] including president Gerald Ellison, and were forced to reorganise the boat. [...] Cambridge had difficulty finding a suitable stroke for the race, eventually opting to place N. J. Bradley in that seat, even though The Timess correspondent noted that he [...] "is not, and never <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> <b>anything</b> but a makeshift stroke". [...] By the time of the race, Cambridge were markedly favourite to win, with former Oxford rower E. P. Evans, writing in The Manchester Guardian that the Light Blues would [...] "win with comparative ease".|$|E

500|$|Another actress to {{join the}} show was Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg, {{who had been a}} long-time Star Trek fan. She {{credited}} Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as an inspiration, saying [...] "Well, when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, I looked at it and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mum, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!' I knew right then and there I <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> I wanted to be." [...] To appear on the show, Goldberg contacted the producers initially through LeVar Burton. The producers did not believe her as they felt that a movie star such as Goldberg would not want to appear in Star Trek, and ignored calls from her agent, until Goldberg called them personally. A meeting was arranged between her and Rick Berman, and she agreed to appear in six episodes of season two. Her character, Guinan, was named after Mary [...] "Texas" [...] Guinan, a prohibition-era speakeasy owner.|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} cast in roles which recurred {{throughout}} the seven seasons {{on television and}} into the four feature films. Majel Barrett, referred to as [...] "The First Lady of Star Trek" [...] due to her marriage with Roddenberry, appeared both {{as the voice of}} Starfleet computers and as Lwaxana Troi. The part of Lwaxana was specifically created for her. She had appeared in The Original Series and two Star Trek films as Christine Chapel, and as Number One in the original pilot [...] "". John de Lancie was cast as Q despite missing his first audition as it conflicted with a play he was in at the time. A second audition was arranged, where de Lancie impressed Roddenberry, who told him that [...] "You make my words sound better than they are." [...] Colm Meaney was originally cast as an unnamed Ensign in [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but was subsequently cast as the Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien, appearing in 52 episodes in that role. Whoopi Goldberg approached the producers and asked for a role in the show, resulting in Roddenberry writing her the part of Guinan. She credits Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as inspiring her, saying [...] "when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, I looked at it and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mom, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!'

2500|$|As {{the habit}} is forming, {{it can be}} {{analysed}} in three parts: the cue, the behavior, and the reward. The cue {{is the thing that}} causes the habit to come about, the trigger of the habitual behavior. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> that one's mind associates with that habit and one will automatically let a habit come to the surface. The behavior is the actual habit that one exhibits, and the reward, a positive feeling, therefore continues the [...] "habit loop". A habit may initially be triggered by a goal, but over time that goal becomes less necessary and the habit becomes more automatic.|$|E

[...] The vehicles compare in general terms with American or European ambulances, however compliance with either the KKK 1822 or CEN 1789 standard is not compulsory. [...] In addition, first responders will often proceed to calls in their own vehicles, and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from a private car to a motor scooter.|$|E
2500|$|An entremet or entremets ( [...] ; from Old French, {{literally}} meaning [...] "between servings") is {{in modern}} French cuisine a small dish served between courses {{or simply a}} dessert. Originally it was an elaborate form of entertainment dish common among the nobility and upper middle class in Europe during the later part of the Middle Ages and the early modern period. An entremet {{marked the end of}} a serving of courses and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from a simple frumenty (a type of wheat porridge) that was brightly colored and flavored with exotic and expensive spices to elaborate models of castles complete with wine fountains, musicians, and food modeled into allegorical scenes. By the end of the Middle Ages, it had evolved almost entirely into dinner entertainment in the form of inedible ornaments or acted performances, often packed with symbolism of power and regality. In English it was more commonly known as a subtlety (also sotelty or soteltie) and did not include acted entertainment.|$|E

2500|$|Chrétien {{has been}} termed [...] "the {{inventor}} of the modern novel" [...] and Karl Uitti argues: [...] "With [...] a new era opens {{in the history of}} European story telling… this poem reinvents the genre we call narrative romance; in some important respects it also initiates the vernacular novel." [...] The main quality of the above-mentioned Celtic influences was that of a sort of incompleteness. A [...] "story" [...] <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from a single battle scene, to a prologue, to a minimally cohesive tale with little to no chronological layout. Uitti argues that Yvain is Chrétien's [...] "most carefully contrived romance… It has a beginning, a middle, and an end: we are in no doubt that Yvain's story is over". This very method of having three definite parts including the build in the middle leading to the climax of the story is in large part why Chrétien is seen to be a writer of novels five centuries before novels, as we know them, existed.|$|E
2500|$|U2 {{began work}} on Pop in mid-1995, collaborating with Nellee Hooper in London, France, and Ireland. In September, the band moved the {{recording}} sessions to Hanover Quay in Dublin to a studio the band had just converted from a warehouse. The studio {{was designed to be}} more of a rehearsal space more than an actual studio. Flood, Howie B, Steve Osborne, and Marius de Vries joined Hooper and the band there, each of them incorporating their influences and experiences in electronic dance music. Flood described Howie's influence thus: [...] "Howie would be playing all kinds of records to inspire the band and for them to improvise to. That <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from a jazz trumpet solo to a super groove funk thing, with no holds barred. We also programmed drum loops, or took things from sample CDs; anything to get the ball rolling. U2 arrive in the studio with very little finished material." [...] These sessions lasted until December 1995, and around 30–40 pieces of music emerged during this period.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} many {{benefits}} from feeling connected to nature {{at the state}} level. Simply walking in nature for fifteen minutes (in comparison to walking in an urban environment) increases an individual's subjective connectedness to nature, positive affect, attentional capacity (as measured {{by the number of}} errors they made in a cognitive task) and their ability to reflect on a life problem. A life problem <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> from finding enough time to study to resolving a fight participants had with close friends, significant others, or family members. These relationships were [...] by state nature connectedness (not attentional capacity or self-awareness as previously suggested). State nature connectedness has also been found to relate to vitality. Vitality is defined as having both physical and mental energy and it increases positive affect. In five studies, researchers found that nature exposure relates to vitality at a state level. Nature exposure is also related to other indicators of positive functioning such as aspirations and goals. Nature exposure increases intrinsic aspirations (personal growth, intimacy, and community) and decreases extrinsic aspirations (money, image, fame) at a state level. The achievement of intrinsic goals relates to well-being whereas, the achievement of extrinsic aspirations relates to ill-being. Nature connectedness and autonomy were found to mediate the relation between nature exposure and intrinsic/extrinsic aspirations. Nature exposure also increased participants' generosity as measured by the amount of money they chose to donate to another student. As participants' immersion increased in the nature slides, their intrinsic aspirations and generosity did as well. However, as participants' immersion increased in the non-nature (or built) slides, their extrinsic aspirations increased while their generosity decreased.|$|E
