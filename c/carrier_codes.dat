50|$|To dial {{a long-distance}} number within Brazil, {{one needs to}} use a <b>carrier</b> {{selection}} <b>code,</b> in order to choose which long-distance carrier will be used. The <b>carrier</b> selection <b>code</b> is specified before the area code; so, to actually place a call, one should dial 0-xx-aa-nnnn-nnnn, where xx is the two-digit <b>carrier</b> selection <b>code.</b> Because of that, sometimes long-distance phone numbers are written down as (0xxaa) nnnn-nnnn, with two actual letters x as placeholders, which the caller will replace by a <b>carrier</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Feature Group D: The current standard, {{requires}} the local switch support equal access by competing carriers at the trunk level; highest quality connection, and allows pre-selection of the interexchange carrier by the end-user. This feature group permits {{two types of}} calls. If a user dials 1 + area code + seven-digit number, the long distance call is handled by a default carrier chosen by the user. Alternatively, a user dials 101 + four-digit carrier code + area code + seven-digit number, and the call is handled by the carrier specified by the carrier code. The original batch of <b>carrier</b> <b>codes</b> began with 0, so this type of [...] "dial around" [...] service was typically marketed as dial-around 101-xxxx service. NANPA maintains separate lists of <b>carrier</b> <b>codes</b> for feature groups 'B' and 'D' as not all long distance providers support both standards.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} format for writing down — {{but not for}} calling — a long-distance phone number in Brazil is (aa) nnnn-nnnn, where aa is the area code and nnnn-nnnn is the local phone number. Due to persistence of old habits from the time when <b>carrier</b> <b>codes</b> were not used (see below), the format (0aa) nnnn-nnnn is still commonly seen, but this usage is discouraged, since it may confuse customers when actually calling. Area codes are distributed geographically. See the list of Brazilian area codes for a full list.|$|E
5000|$|Feature Group B: Associated with 950-XXXX calling; {{instead of}} a local {{telephone}} number the user enters 950 and 4 additional digits which identify the long distance carrier. Operation {{is similar to the}} local access numbers (feature group A) except that the 950-XXXX access number is the same in every community, NANP-wide. Some exchanges send the caller's number automatically; where this service is not provided or not desired (calling card applications), the 950-XXXX number must be followed by a calling card number and the long-distance destination number. If ANI is provided, calls from the one subscribed line may be made as 950-XXXX and the long-distance destination. Largely deprecated by feature group D, but the 950 prefix and a list of <b>carrier</b> <b>codes</b> remain reserved in all North American area codes, even in Canada where most providers went from feature group A directly to 1+ default carrier dialling and feature group D (101xxxx + destination) calling without ever using 950-XXXX as a primary means to access alternate long distance carriers from home land lines.|$|E
5000|$|The human-readable {{license plate}} will have either a two-character or a three-digit IATA <b>carrier</b> <b>code.</b> For example, {{it may be}} either [...] "BA728359" [...] or [...] "0125728359."

50|$|For long-distance collect calls, 90 is {{used instead}} of 0 as the trunk <b>code,</b> and a <b>carrier</b> {{selection}} <b>code</b> must still be used.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} propose a {{solution}} for the indoor positioning question, several tests with the repealite-based (similar to Pseudolites and repeaters) system have been carried out. This system uses a single Global Navigation Satellite System signal transmitted by all the indoor antennas. These signals may interfere with the satellite ones outdoors. Hence, the noise level at the outdoor receiver will be higher and the error range larger. To avoid these effects, new codes called Indoor-Modified Binary Offset <b>Carrier</b> <b>codes</b> {{that are capable of}} reducing interference with outdoor signals are generated. To analyse the performance of these codes, we carry out a theoretical expression of cross-correlation functions. Then the deployment of the repealite based system in a typical building is simulated. The goal of this step is to compare the interference performance of the new code with the one already used (Gold codes for GPS band and maximal sequence for Glonass one). A specific interest is given to the spectral interference when adding the new signal's spectrum in the considered frequency ban...|$|E
