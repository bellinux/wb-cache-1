40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the feasibility of <b>co-digestion</b> of municipal primary sludge and whey by anaerobic CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor), as well as the factors that affect the performance of the <b>co-digestion</b> reactors. Before studying the <b>co-digestion</b> process, a semi-continuous whey digestion experiment was conducted to analyze the feasibility of anaerobic digestion of whey along with pH control. The results obtained from the study indicated that supplement of nutrients, trace elements as well as heavy metals was necessary to maintain the anaerobic whey digestion system. To investigate the <b>co-digestion</b> of primary sludge and whey process, the effects of pH, OLR (Organic Loading Rate), HRT (Hydraulic retention time) as well as the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) loading ratio of primary sludge to whey on the performance of the reactors were studied. The results of the <b>co-digestion</b> experiments demonstrated that it was feasible to co-digest primary sludge and whey without nutrient, trace element and heavy metal supplement. The TCOD (Total Chemical Oxygen Demand) removal efficiency and the biogas production of the <b>co-digestion</b> system increased with the increase of OLR. At same OLR, digestion of the mixture of primary sludge and whey with higher whey content achieved higher biogas production and TCOD removal efficiency. The anaerobic <b>co-digestion</b> of primary sludge and whey process performed successfully at OLR of 5. 8 ± 0. 1 g COD/l. d without pH control when the COD loading ratio of primary sludge to whey was approximately 70 : 30, {{due to the fact that}} the primary sludge may serve as buffering reagent.

40|$|Summary: Solids and liquids from {{digestion}} {{of manure}} at 17 farms were analyzed for bacterial concentration, physical properties and/or metal concentrations. Four of these farms digested manure only {{and the rest}} accepted some type of food or food processing waste as <b>co-digestion</b> material. As expected, bacterial concentrations were variable and no clear trends were discovered for higher populations in solids that were digested with food and food processing waste versus those that came from manure only. In addition, no single type of waste yielded higher bacterial concentration than any other. Season played a much larger part in bacterial concentration than did <b>co-digestion.</b> Physical properties (% moisture and % of fine particles) of the solids {{were not significantly different}} whether digested with a <b>co-digestion</b> material or not. Organic matter, which may lead to increased bacterial growth in the bedding, but could be helpful for conditioning of the soil, was significantly lower in solids that were digested with manure only versus <b>co-digestion.</b> There were differences in the chemical properties of the solids that were co-digested versus those that were not. However, <b>co-digestion</b> should not affect the fertilizer value of the solids in normal farm operations as the difference favors them as fertilizer. The only one that may be of concern is increased phosphorus in runoff. Bacterial concentration in liquid digestate was similar to that of solids. Rather than <b>co-digestion,</b> differences in bacterial concentration were based on season, with summer having the highest bacterial load. Concentration of metals in all liquid digestate was well-below regulatory limits set for sewage sludge. Liquid digestate from <b>co-digestion</b> with food and food processing waste had higher concentrations of copper and zinc than liquid from digestion of manure only, but were still 5 and 10 times lower, respectively, than the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation sludge and sludge product maximum (NYSDEC 360 Rules). There was no difference in fertilizer value (N, P, K) of liquid digestate from digestion with or without <b>co-digestion</b> materials. The concentration of boron, a micronutrient, was significantly lower in digestate from <b>co-digestion</b> of all wastes studied versus manure alone and the concentration of Zn was significantly higher from <b>co-digestion</b> with grocery store waste than any other liquid digestate. However, neither of these would result in deficiency or toxicity. Many of the other micronutrients found in the liquid digestate, regardless of <b>co-digestion,</b> were above limits set by EPA for use as irrigation water. The objective {{of this study was to}} see if the addition of food and food processing wastes to agricultural digesters has an adverse or positive effect on the end products.

The HSAD of sorghum stem possessing high energy potential and high C/N ratio was easy to become acidified, even with addition of urea, leading to generation of plenty of hydrogen during the first 3 days of digestion. When the C/N ratio was adjusted to 25 with urea, the biogas yield was 413 mL/g VS, 26 % {{higher than that of}} raw sorghum stem. With the C/N ratio of 25, the <b>co-digestion</b> of sorghum stem and cow manure generated the highest biogas yield of 478 mL/ g VS. <b>Co-digestion</b> enabled stable pH value and high digestion efficiency and avoided extreme acidification. On one hand, the improvement on biogas production by <b>co-digestion</b> was partially attributed to the adjusted C/N ratio.

In lab-scale semi-continuous experiments, varying digester feedstock composition from 85 %/ 15 % to 40 %/ 60 % PM/FW (volatile solids basis) did not significantly affect digestate biosafety or dewaterability. Decreasing hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 41 to 21 days did not significantly increase the concentrations of the pathogenic indicator microorganisms in digestate.

Research has demonstrated the abundant treatment and economic opportunities presented by <b>co-digestion</b> of high strength wastewater, but these wastes {{also have the}} potential to cause digester failure. Indeed, based on what is known about the disruption of digesters, if a municipality is considering <b>co-digestion,</b> it needs to know the characteristics of high strength wastewaters that have a predictable potential for disruption. The Metropolitan Council-Environmental Services (MCES) is one such municipality interested in pursuing <b>co-digestion.</b> MCES is interested in expanding current digester use to include <b>co-digestion</b> of high strength waste streams to reduce their energy and sludge disposal costs. The objective of this research was to develop a protocol for MCES to be used in evaluating the feasibility of co-digesting municipal wastewater sludge with other high strength wastes. The protocol involves anaerobic biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays inoculated by source anaerobic digesters and amended with PBS, sludge (TPS/TWAS mixture), waste, or waste combined with sludge. <b>Co-digestion</b> experiments examined well-characterized synthetic wastes (starch, gelatin, tween 80, and cysteine) and wastes of interest to MCES with unknown impacts (dimethylformamide, dairy processing waste, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, thickened primary sludge, thickened waste activated sludge, and scum collected from the primary clarifier at an MCES wastewater treatment facility). These wastes were characterized as degradable, non-degradable, toxic or degradable after an adaptation period. Gelatin, tween 80, dairy processing waste, ethylene glycol, and propylene glycol were degradable, while dimethylformamide was non-degradable. Cysteine, a sulfur-rich waste, was found to be toxic at concentrations greater than 200 mg/L. Scum, ethylene glycol, and propylene glycol required an adaptation period before being degraded. Additionally, the microbial analysis via qPCR indicated that the abundance of Bacteria and methanogens in the <b>co-digestion</b> experiments were not statistically different from the sludge-only experiments, even when different types of wastes were tested (i. e., degradable, non-degradable, toxic, etc.). The developed method and subsequent guidelines will be useful for MCES and other wastewater treatment facilities when making informed decisions about whether or not to accept potential high strength wastes for <b>co-digestion</b> with sludge...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Producing {{energy from}} fossil fuels has created unliveable conditions. Climate change for instance, {{is one of}} the most {{environmental}} issue of our time. Renewable energy, clean source of energy, is considered as an essential part of the remedy. In this study, we investigated the production of biomethane via anaerobic monodigestion of food waste (FW) and <b>co-digestion</b> of FW with cow dung. The digestion took place under thermophilic conditions at 45 ˚C. A comparative analysis was done on the biogas yield of both mono and <b>co-digestion.</b> FW, FW and cow dung of the ratios, 2 : 1 and 1 : 2 were used as the substrates in the digestion. The anaerobic monodigestion of FW displayed the highest biomethane yield produced, of 405. 1 Nml. Two main parameters helped in achieving that, volatile solids content (VS) and total solids content (TS). In addition to the two parameters, the pH and the C/N ratio helped in enhancing the biomethane production of both mono and <b>co-digestion.</b> As the objective is the optimization of the biomethane yield by <b>co-digestion,</b> co-digesting FW with cow dung resulted in decreasing considerably the biomethane yield by 32. 16 to 33. 99 %...|$|E
40|$|<b>Co-digestion</b> has {{attracted}} increased attention in The Netherlands {{as a result}} of a subsidy for electricity that is produced environmentally safe (MEP and SDE subsidy). Production of bio-energy by means of <b>co-digestion</b> turned financially profitable due to this financial support. <b>Co-digestion</b> is the simultaneous digestion of manure and a co-substrate and its conversion into biogas. We report on a methodology to assess the sustainability of bio-energy from <b>co-digestion</b> with emphasis on energy and green house gases (GHG) (Zwart et al., 2006). We have analyzed three cases, i. e. animal manure only or maize only and a mixture of 50 % manure and 50 % maize. On the basis of the gross ‘green gas’ and electricity production we calculated efficiencies according to the suggestions cf. Commission Cramer (Anon., 2007). We report that digestion of manure only is most efficient in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Digestion of maize without manure produces most energy. In terms of efficiency cf. Commission Cramer a mixture of manure and maize is most efficient. This is more efficient than digestion of maize alone as here emissions of greenhouse gases during crop production limits the efficiency cf. Commission Cramer...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic <b>co-digestion</b> of {{residues}} {{from the}} cold pressing and trans-esterification of oilseed rape (OSR) with other farm wastes was considered {{as a means of}} enhancing the sustainability of on-farm biodiesel production. The study verified the process energy yields using biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests and semi-continuous digestion trials. The results indicated that high proportions of OSR cake in the feedstock led to a decrease in volatile solids destruction and instability of the digestion process. <b>Co-digestion</b> with cattle slurry or with vegetable waste led to acceptable specific and volumetric methane productions, and a digestate low in potentially toxic elements (PTE). The results were used to evaluate energy balances and greenhouse gas emissions of the integrated process compared with biodiesel production alone. <b>Co-digestion</b> was shown to provide energy self-sufficiency and security of supply to farms, with sufficient surplus for export as fuel and electricit...|$|E
40|$|The {{uncontrolled}} {{discharge of}} {{large amounts of}} food waste (FW) causes severe environmental pollution in many countries. Within different possible treatment routes, anaerobic digestion (AD) of FW into biogas, is a proven and effective solution for FW treatment and valorization. The present paper reviews the characteristics of FW, the principles of AD, the process parameters, and two approaches (pretreatment and <b>co-digestion)</b> for enhancing AD of food waste. Among the successive digestion reactions, hydrolysis {{is considered to be}} the rate-limiting step. To enhance the performance of AD, several physical, thermo-chemical, biological or combined pretreatments are reviewed. Moreover, a promising way for improving the performance of AD is the <b>co-digestion</b> of FW with other organic substrates, as confirmed by numerous studies, where a higher buffer capacity and an optimum nutrient balance enhance the biogas/methane yields of the <b>co-digestion</b> system...|$|E

The process of biogas production from N-methylmorpholine oxide (NMMO) pretreated forest residues used in a <b>co-digestion</b> process was economically evaluated. The <b>co-digestion</b> occurs together with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). The process simulated the milling of the lignocelluloses, NMMO pretreatment unit, washing and filtration of the feedstock, followed by an anaerobic <b>co-digestion,</b> upgrading of the biogas and de-watering of the digestate. The process also took into consideration the utilization of 100, 000 DW (dried weight) tons of forest residues and 200, 000 DW tons of OFMSW per year. It resulted in an internal rate of return (IRR) of 24. 14 % prior to taxes, which might be attractive economically. The cost of the chemical NMMO treatment was regarded as the most challenging operating cost, followed by the evaporation of the washing water. Sensitivity analysis was performed on different plant size capacities, treating and digesting between 25, 000 and 400, 000 DW tons forest residues per year. It shows that the minimum plant capacity of 50, 000 DW tons forest residues per year is financially viable. Moreover, different <b>co-digestion</b> scenarios were evaluated. The <b>co-digestion</b> of forest residues together with sewage sludge instead of OFMSW, and the digestion of forest residues only were shown to be non-feasible solutions with too low IRR. Furthermore, biogas production from forest residues was compared with the energy produced during combustion...|$|E
40|$|Mexico {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of organic residues. Twenty milliard tons of fruit and vegetable wastes (FVW) are produced yearly. On the other hand, the cheese processing industry produces crude cheese whey (CCW) with an annual production of 1 million metric tons. These types of residues are well characterized, and both constitute a potential feedstock for biohydrogen production, individually or as a mixture. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing CCW and FVW in a <b>co-digestion</b> process to produce biohydrogen. The possibility to design an effective process in a two stage configuration was evaluated based {{in our previous studies}} of the by-products and description of microbial ecology evolution of the <b>co-digestion</b> process. An initial assimilation of easily degradable carbohydrates and protein allowed cell growth and acetate and lactate as main byproducts. The <b>co-digestion</b> and two-stage processes increased several times the biohydrogen yield compared with those obtained from single substrate and in a <b>co-digestion</b> single stage process. Higher biohydrogen productivity was a result of reaction stability in comparison to single-substrate digestion and one-stage processes. The effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) on the volumetric hydrogen production rate (VHPR) and yield (Y) was evaluated in a two-staged <b>co-digestion</b> process of FVW and CCW. The system consisted of hydrolytic and hydrogenic bioreactors operated in batch mode and continuous regime (89 days), respectively. Eight conditions of HRTs and respective OLRs were evaluated. As HRT decreased, the VHPR increased proportionally, reaching the highest average values around 7 LLd at an HRT between 15 and 17. 5 h. The highest Y (813. 3 mLHgCOD) was determined at 17. 5 h (OLR, 80. 02 gCODLd). Based on the distribution of the final products, the processes occur sequentially and reach a steady state set by the OLR. Biohydrogen production is a result of a syntrophic microbial activity. In general, the two stages of the <b>co-digestion</b> process provided higher stability, reliability, and efficiency...|$|E
