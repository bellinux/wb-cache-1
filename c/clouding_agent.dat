50|$|The 2011 Taiwan food scandal was a {{food safety}} scandal in Taiwan {{over the use}} of the {{plasticizer}} DEHP to replace palm oil in food and drinks as a <b>clouding</b> <b>agent.</b> The chemical agent has been linked to developmental problems with children as it affects hormones.|$|E
50|$|In May 2011, {{a scandal}} {{broke out in}} Taiwan when many drinks were found to contain DEHP, a {{plasticiser}} which was added as a <b>clouding</b> <b>agent</b> {{in order to improve}} the appearance of the drinks. Ingestion of DEHP is known to cause heart problems and to affect male genital development. When the news spread to Hong Kong, this led to sharply-decreased sales for Taiwan-style drink shops; one Gong Cha branch in Causeway Bay reported a decrease in revenue of thirty percent. Gong Cha took a variety of actions to restore consumer confidence in the products, such as conducting tests on ingredients imported from Taiwan in order to prove their safety and in June 2011 discontinued certain kinds of juices in its Hong Kong branches before the test reports released. In the end the products were proved containing no DEHP.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhile {{conducting}} an inspection project on counterfeit drugs in 2011, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (FDA) discovered a probiotic product that was contaminated with the plasticizer di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). After a thorough investigation, it was {{confirmed that the}} plasticizer had been deliberately added to the <b>clouding</b> <b>agent</b> as a substitute for an emulsifier. The illegal use of DEHP contaminated a broad range of foods and nutraceutical products. Subsequent investigation revealed that another plasticizer, di-isononyl phthalate (DINP), was also used. Some contaminated food and beverages had already been exported abroad. This caused panic in the public in Taiwan and drew international attention. The government thus initiated emergency response actions for this food safety incident. Actions were undertaken to perform food source control, to strengthen monitoring and surveillance of the production and marketing chain, to adopt a proactive approach in communicating with the public, and to trade in a highly transparent manner. The Act Governing Food Sanitation was also revised to impose harsher penalties on unscrupulous companies and thereby ensure food safety with more consolidated and stricter regulation. The effort has regained the consumer confidence in Taiwanese products...|$|E

40|$|In May 2011, {{the illegal}} {{use of the}} {{phthalate}} plasticizer di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate in clouding agents for use in foods and beverages was reported in Taiwan. This food scandal has caused shock and panic among the majority of Taiwanese people and has attracted international attention. Phthalate exposure is assessed by ambient monitoring or human biomonitoring. Ambient monitoring relies on measuring chemicals in environmental media, foodstuff and consumer products. Human biomonitoring determines body burden by measuring the chemicals, their metabolites or specific reaction products in human specimens. In mammalian development, the fetus is set to develop into a female. Because the female phenotype is the default, impairment of testosterone production or action before the late phase may lead to feminizing characteristics. Phthalates disrupt the development of androgen-dependent structures by inhibiting fetal testicular testosterone biosynthesis. The spectrum of effects obtained following perinatal exposure of male rats to phthalates has remarkable similarities with the human testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Epidemiological studies have suggested associations between phthalate exposure and shorter gestational age, shorter anogenital distance, shorter penis, incomplete testicular descent, sex hormone alteration, precocious puberty, pubertal gynecomastia, premature thelarche, rhinitis, eczema, asthma, low birth weight, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, low intelligence quotient, thyroid hormone alteration, and hypospadias in infants and children. Furthermore, many studies have suggested associations between phthalate exposure and increased sperm DNA damage, decreased proportion of sperm with normal morphology, decreased sperm concentration, decreased sperm morphology, sex hormone alteration, decreased pulmonary function, endometriosis, uterine leiomyomas, breast cancer, obesity, hyperprolactinemia, and thyroid hormone alteration in adults. Finally, the number of phthalate-related scientific publications from Taiwan has increased greatly over the past 5 years, which may reflect the health effects from the illegal addition of phthalate plasticizer to <b>clouding</b> <b>agent</b> in foodstuff {{over the past two}} decades...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the cloud provider and the cloud consumer must be described with a Service Level Agreement (SLA). To establish SLA for utilizing a cloud service, there are two issues which are the following: 1) Determining when to use the service (time slot); 2) Determining {{the price of the}} service.

40|$|Agent-based cloud {{computing}} {{is concerned with}} the design and development of software <b>agents</b> for bolstering <b>cloud</b> service discovery, service negotiation, and service composition. The significance of this work is introducing an agent-based paradigm for constructing software tools and testbeds for cloud resource management. The novel contributions of this work include: 1) developing Cloudle: an agent-based search engine for cloud service discovery, 2) showing that agent-based negotiation mechanisms can be effectively adopted for bolstering cloud service negotiation and cloud commerce, and 3) showing that agent-based cooperative problemsolving techniques can be effectively adopted for automating cloud service composition. Cloudle consists of 1) a service discovery agent that consults a cloud ontology for determining the similarities between providers’ service specifications and consumers’ service requirements, and 2) multiple cloud crawlers for building its database of services. Cloudle supports three types of reasoning: similarity reasoning, compatibility reasoning, and numerical reasoning. To support cloud commerce, this work devised a complex cloud negotiation mechanism that supports parallel negotiation activities in interrelated markets: a cloud service market between consumer agents and broker <b>agents,</b> and multiple <b>cloud</b> resource markets between broker agents and provider agents. Empirical results show that using the complex <b>cloud</b> negotiation mechanism, <b>agents</b> achieved high utilities and high success rates in negotiating for cloud resources. To automate <b>cloud</b> service composition, <b>agents</b> in this work adopt a focused selection contract net protocol (FSCNP) for dynamically selecting cloud services and use service capability tables (SCTs) to record the list of <b>cloud</b> <b>agents</b> and their services.

The proposed concept of logical identity proxy (IC-Agent) ensures the segregation of user’s PII while disseminating user’s credentials across multiple SPs. Moreover, IC-Agents acquire user consent before disclosing their sensitive identity information mandatory for the verification process thus offering support to Privacy feature. Moreover, IC-Agents are capable of monitoring and logging all the operations of user (for instance authorizations and other service accesses), which may help {{to carry out the}} auditing processes as per SP’s requirement, thus offering support to Auditing and Logging principle. Furthermore, IC-Agents provide interfaces called dashboards for user Authentication and are capable of functioning as a personal IdP to provide SSO facility that eliminates the need of repeated user logins for each independent resource access. IC-Agents is a User-Centric identity management concept where users are provided with full control over their identity information stored at IC-Agent host (Software and Hardware) by offering support to self-service mechanism. Proposed concept of IC-Agent is based on the distributed storage architecture for personal data storage where some data is stored by the IC-Agent, while other information is retrieved from multiple distinct IC-Agent sources thus follows the Identity Federation principle. IC-Agent applies the user defined data disclosure policies while forwarding user credentials to the SPs for secure authentication and Authorization.|$|R
