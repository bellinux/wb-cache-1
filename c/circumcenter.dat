5|$|The {{concept of}} a dual {{tessellation}} can also be applied to partitions of the plane into finitely many regions. It {{is closely related to}} but not quite the same as planar graph duality in this case. For instance, the Voronoi diagram of a finite set of point sites is a partition of the plane into polygons within which one site is closer than any other. The sites on the convex hull of the input give rise to unbounded Voronoi polygons, two of whose sides are infinite rays rather than finite line segments. The dual of this diagram is the Delaunay triangulation of the input, a planar graph that connects two sites by an edge whenever there exists a circle that contains those two sites and no other sites. The edges of the convex hull of the input are also edges of the Delaunay triangulation, but they correspond to rays rather than line segments of the Voronoi diagram. This duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations can be turned into a duality between finite graphs in either of two ways: by adding an artificial vertex at infinity to the Voronoi diagram, to serve as the other endpoint for all of its rays, or by treating the bounded part of the Voronoi diagram as the weak dual of the Delaunay triangulation. Although the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation are dual, their embedding in the plane may have additional crossings beyond the crossings of dual pairs of edges. Each vertex of the Delaunay triangle is positioned within its corresponding face of the Voronoi diagram. Each vertex of the Voronoi diagram is positioned at the <b>circumcenter</b> of the corresponding triangle of the Delaunay triangulation, but this point may lie outside its triangle.|$|E

25|$|A {{perpendicular}} bisector of {{a side of}} a triangle is a straight line passing through {{the midpoint of the}} side and being perpendicular to it, i.e. forming a right angle with it. The three {{perpendicular bisector}}s meet in a single point, the triangle's <b>circumcenter,</b> usually denoted by O; this point is the center of the circumcircle, the circle passing through all three vertices. The diameter of this circle, called the circumdiameter, can be found from the law of sines stated above. The circumcircle's radius is called the circumradius.|$|E
25|$|A {{line segment}} joining a vertex of a {{tetrahedron}} with the centroid {{of the opposite}} face is called a median and a line segment joining the midpoints of two opposite edges is called a bimedian of the tetrahedron. Hence there are four medians and three bimedians in a tetrahedron. These seven line segments are all concurrent at a point called the centroid of the tetrahedron. In addition the four medians are divided in a 3:1 ratio by the centroid (see Commandino's theorem). The centroid of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its Monge point and <b>circumcenter.</b> These points define the Euler line of the tetrahedron that {{is analogous to the}} Euler line of a triangle.|$|E
25|$|The center T of the {{twelve-point}} sphere also {{lies on the}} Euler line. Unlike its triangular counterpart, {{this center}} lies {{one third of the}} way from the Monge point M towards the <b>circumcenter.</b> Also, an orthogonal line through T to a chosen face is coplanar with two other orthogonal lines to the same face. The first is an orthogonal line passing through the corresponding Euler point to the chosen face. The second is an orthogonal line passing through the centroid of the chosen face. This orthogonal line through the twelve-point center lies midway between the Euler point orthogonal line and the centroidal orthogonal line. Furthermore, for any face, the twelve-point center lies at the midpoint of the corresponding Euler point and the orthocenter for that face.|$|E
