5|$|Players can gamble. They <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> {{by visiting}} casinos, buying chips {{with the three}} major {{currencies}} in the games, and playing either blackjack, slots, or roulette within them. Players can also play a card game called Caravan, which was specifically designed for the game and has its own rules, and can be played with certain people outside of the casinos.|$|E
5|$|California {{sea lions}} {{are used in}} {{military}} applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals {{have been trained to}} swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say that the sea lions <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission is complete.|$|E

5|$|Zones. The {{object of}} this mode is to capture various control {{points on the}} map. Each control point has 3 levels for each team, and a neutral level. A player <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in other game modes (except deathmatch) to earn points for yourself, but in Zones, their team gains points {{for the number of}} zones the player has, and how many levels each one has. The player will only be able to capture levels if the area around it is clear, or {{captured}} by their team. The game ends when the time runs out, score limit is reached, or if the player is able to capture all control points.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E

25|$|A {{common problem}} in {{computer}} graphics is {{to generate a}} non-zero vector in R3 that is orthogonal to a given non-zero one. There is no single continuous function that <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> for all non-zero vector inputs. This is a corollary of the hairy ball theorem. To see this, consider the given vector as the radius of a sphere and note that finding a non-zero vector orthogonal to the given one is equivalent to finding a non-zero vector that is tangent {{to the surface of}} that sphere where it touches the radius. However, the hairy ball theorem says there exists no continuous function that <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> for every point on the sphere (i.e. every given vector).|$|E

25|$|The arms {{enter the}} water with the thumbs first at {{shoulder}} width. A wider entry loses movement in the next pull phase, and a smaller entry, where the hands touch, wastes energy. The cycle repeats with the pull phase. However, some people prefer to touch in front, because it helps them catch water, {{as long as they}} <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> efficiently, they are not losing anything.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for some polyhedra to change their overall shape, while keeping the shapes of their faces the same, by varying the angles of their edges. A polyhedron that <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> is called a flexible polyhedron. By Cauchy's rigidity theorem, flexible polyhedra must be non-convex. The volume of a flexible polyhedron must remain constant as it flexes; this result {{is known as the}} bellows theorem.|$|E

25|$|A servo {{amplifier}} indicates an integrated feedback loop to actively control the output at some desired level. A DC servo indicates use at frequencies down to DC levels, where the rapid fluctuations of an audio or RF signal do not occur.

25|$|Asset {{liability}} mismatch/Maturity transformation – banks borrow more {{on demand}} debt and short term debt, but provide more long term loans. In other words, they borrow short and lend long. With a stronger credit quality {{than most other}} borrowers, banks <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> by aggregating issues (e.g. accepting deposits and issuing banknotes) and redemptions (e.g. withdrawals and redemption of banknotes), maintaining reserves of cash, investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed, and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources (e.g. wholesale cash markets and securities markets).|$|E
25|$|Some {{animals are}} {{specialized}} for moving on non-horizontal surfaces. One common habitat for such climbing animals is in trees, {{for example the}} gibbon is specialized for arboreal movement, traveling rapidly by brachiation. Another case is animals like the snow leopard living on steep rock faces such as are found in mountains. Some light animals are able to climb up smooth sheer surfaces or hang upside down by adhesion. Many insects <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> though much larger animals such as geckos can also perform similar feats.|$|E
25|$|The ABS {{controller}} {{knows that}} such a rapid deceleration is impossible, so it reduces the pressure to that brake until it sees an acceleration, then it increases the pressure until it sees the deceleration again. It <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> very quickly, before the tire can actually significantly change speed. The {{result is that the}} tire slows down {{at the same rate as}} the car, with the brakes keeping the tires very near the point at which they will start to lock up. This gives the system maximum braking power.|$|E
