50|$|After {{the fire}} at Our Lady of the Angel, state {{regulations}} required {{that there had}} to be fire alarm street boxes no more than one hundred feet {{from the front of the}} building. The General Assembly of Illinois also passed life safety codes in response to the fire at Our Lady of the Angel. Things such as more control over waste disposal, proper storage of combustible supplies, more frequent fire drills and inspections were put in place. Other reforms from the fire include the city of Chicago modifying the Municipal Building Code of Chicago, affecting fire safety of schools as well as other buildings with two or more stories. To prevent fires and deaths caused by fires, schools must have an evacuation plan in place, and make sure that all the proper fire alarms and warnings work. Teachers must take charge of the situation and be a leader. Teachers should also consider the amount of students that they have. They need enough space and time to get all of the students out quickly, and safely. Teachers should also be the ones that are looking out for <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fires,</b> in order to try and stop it from happening.|$|E

There are 81 fire stations across Hong Kong's 3 operational commands. In 2004, they responded to 35,092 fire calls and 20,059 special service calls. Careless handling or disposal of cigarette ends, matches and candles remained the major <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fires,</b> followed by incidents involving the preparation of food and electrical faults. Fires claimed nine lives and 451 injuries in 2004. Of the injured, 46 were Fire Services personnel. Special service calls cover {{a wide range of}} incidents, including traffic and industrial accidents, gas leakages, landslides, flooding, house collapses, attempts by people to jump from a height and malfunctioning lifts. In 2004, 717 people died and 1,995 others were injured in such incidents. One of the dead and 16 of the injured were Fire Services personnel. The department has 835 operational appliances and vehicles fitted with up-to-date fire-fighting and rescue equipment. The first-line appliances, basically comprising major pumps, hydraulic platforms, light rescue units and turntable ladders/snorkels, are supported where necessary by other special appliances/equipment.

40|$|ABSTRACT The fire is {{the most}} unmanageable and the biggest danger to the cotton ginning {{industry}} (ginneries). There-fore, it is a central issue {{to the safety of}} the ginneries. Fires in the ginneries of Khandesh region have been no-toriously destructive and caused heavy financial damages. In most these fires, actual cause is never known and difficult to trace even. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate different <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> in the ginneries of Khandesh region. This paper discusses not only commonly understood causes but also examine the subtle and unknown causes because their role in causing fires are not fully understood. The work methodology included the fire safety investigations in the selected ginneries by an expert team followed by a questionnaire survey. The study resulted in the identification and classification of various <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> namely electrical, mechani-cal, vehicular, anthropogenic, spontaneous ignition and other causes that are discussed with detail in the paper. The ginnery owners are suggested to understand all the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> identified and follow the recommendations advanced in the study...|$|E

The study considered markets with high commercial activities and they were selected from three major cities, namely Lagos, Port Harcourt and Onitsha. Sixty questions on the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> market <b>fire</b> were designed and distributed to 1074 shop owner/traders (respondents). The factor analysis method was adopted to streamline the questions into six categories and they were ranked. Results showed that the most common <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> market <b>fire</b> in Nigerian is “general storing” and this category attained a commonality ratio of 0. 09284. Other <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> in markets included electrical installation which ranked second with a commonality ratio of 0. 08071. The third to the sixth in that order are, disposal and knowledge of market locations, market exit points, regulations regarding markets and awareness and fire emergency plan. A design plan for an ideal market is provided taking cognizance of the following: ventilation, fire wall and roofs, building in clusters, electrical wiring in conduits, firefighting tools in place, general storage facilities, and dedicated parking area and that for smoking, etc. It is recommended that Government should institute fire professionals to handle design and operation of markets...|$|R
