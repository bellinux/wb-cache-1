40|$|In recent years, Fiji 2 ̆ 7 s {{approach}} of combining traditional systems of community-based coastal management and modern management systems {{has become a}} successful blueprint for marine conservation, particularly the Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA) network model. As {{a result of this}} success, conservation practitioners have imported the Fiji LMMA model to the Solomon Islands and in Vanuatu in hope of replicating the purported success attained in Fiji. This paper argues that because tenure systems and associated political systems in Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu are substantially different, one cannot simply extrapolate the more centralized tenurial and political Fiji model to the decentralized tenurial and politically eclectic Solomons and Vanuatu. This paper provides an analysis of some of the various approaches used in these countries to make a case for why socio-political diversity and historical particulars matter to resource management and conservation-in-practice (and for any development interventions). By examining examples of various nested and polycentric governance approaches—family, community, tribal, confederations, local community-based organizations (CBOs), and Church—it elucidates not only some of the differences between Fiji and Solomon Islands/Vanuatu, but also between Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. This provides <b>critical</b> <b>insights</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> of the myriad of factors impinging on conservation aspirations in these countries and may offer some alternative ways forward not currently considered by conservation practitioners. Finally, the paper provides some guidelines to how to increase the long-term success of marine conservation programs for fisheries management and community-based management initiatives in the region...|$|E

40|$|Rather limited {{experimental}} evidence is available of triaxial shear-induced response of unsaturated soils at suction states far beyond residual suction. In this work, a fully automated, relative-humidity (Auto-RH) control unit {{is adapted to}} a newly implemented double-walled triaxial cell to test compacted silty sand specimens under consider-ably high total suction states via the vapor-pressure technique. The work is intended to gain <b>critical</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> of the most essential hydro-mechanical features of densely compacted intermediate geomaterials, such as post-peak softening and strain-induced dilatancy, under suction-controlled monotonic shearing. In general, peak strength is followed by large strain-induced softening until critical state is apparently reached. Strain-softening is observed to be-come considerably more pronounced with increasing total suction. The slope of critical state lines, however, remains virtually constant, regardless of induced total suction, in agreement with critical state-based constitutive frameworks previously postulated for unsaturated soils...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{findings}} from a longitudinal study of 20 {{young people who have}} spent significant periods of time categorised as NEET (not in education, employment or training). Drawing on 3 years of ethnographic research conducted across two local authorities in the north of England, it focuses on the lived experience of a set of young people as they move between various sites of exclusion and participation in the labour market. Central to the paper are the experiences of three individuals and their attempts to begin work in the retail, care and catering industries. The paper illustrates a range of tensions between the aspirations of young people and the opportunities open to them. It provides a <b>critical</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> of the conditions which characterise work on the fringes of the labour market and the interplay between these and the attitudes, values and dispositions of the young people taking part in the research. The paper's findings challenge popular discourses about young people on the margins of participation and pose questions about the articulation between education, work and training for those seeking to enter the labour market...|$|R

40|$|Using DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} multiple genes (often {{from more than}} one genome compartment) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships has become routine. Augmenting this approach with genomic structural characters (e. g., intron gain and loss, changes in gene order) as these data become available from comparative studies already has provided <b>critical</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> long-standing questions about the evolution of land plants. Here we report on the presence of a group II intron located in the mitochondrial atp 1 gene of leptosporangiate and marattioid ferns. Primary sequence data for the atp 1 gene are newly reported for 27 taxa, and results are presented from maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian inference for 34 land plants in three data sets: (1) single-gene mitochondrial atp 1 (exon + intron sequences); (2) Wve combined genes (mitochondrial atp 1 [exon only]; plastid rbcL, atpB, rps 4; nuclear SSU rDNA); and (3) same Wve combined genes plus morphology. All our phylogenetic analyses corroborate results from previous fern studies that used plastid and nuclear sequence data: the monophyly of euphyllophytes, as well as of monil-ophytes; whisk ferns (Psilotidae) sister to ophioglossoid ferns (Ophioglossidae); horsetails (Equisetopsida) sister to marattioid ferns (Marattiidae), which together are sister to the monophyletic leptosporangiate ferns. In contrast to the results from the primary sequence data, the genomic structural data (atp 1 intron distribution pattern) would seem to suggest that leptosporangiate and marat-tioid ferns are monophyletic, and together they are the sister group to horsetails—a topology that is rarely reconstructed using primary sequence data...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{social relations}} {{in a small}} deindustrializing city to analyze the socio-spatial specificity of class, ???race relations,??? and small city ???cityness??? within the United States. I base my arguments on research conducted over five years (2005 - 2010) in Mansfield, Ohio???a multiracial, class stratified city of about 50, 000 residents. The central aim of this dissertation is to demonstrate that small cities???and how they cope with race, class, and space???offer anthropologists and cultural theorists a rich and necessary perspective on sociocultural processes within the United States. I {{make the case that}} comprehensively acknowledging urban variation strengthens our analyses and understandings of social phenomena that occur in urban settings and elsewhere. This research project is indebted to, and engages with, anthropological studies of class, race, and the city. My arguments are grounded in an ???ordinary cities approach??? (Robinson 2006), which refuses to hold conventionally named ???global??? and ???world??? cities as the unmarked category against which all other forms of urbanity are measured and, instead, broadens understandings of cityness to embrace a multitude of difference. I utilize discourse analysis to do fine-grain analyses of informants' speech while simultaneously situating, in relation to one another, national processes of middle class white privilege, the lived practices of race, class, gender, and space under global capitalism, and Mansfielders??? subjective interpretations of middle class whiteness. I use ethnography, history and Census analyses to nuance dominant narratives of deindustrialization and to highlight the socio-spatial particularities of global and neoliberal capitalism. I conclude that Mansfield's small size and industrial history has made it particularly susceptible to the destabilizing effects of current economic restructuring processes, but that new opportunities for select residents have arisen also from the city's specific socio-spatial histories of space, race, and class. My research in Mansfield contributes to studies of whiteness and U. S. race relations by examining from multiple angles, the ways whiteness hierarchically structures social relationships among neighbors. In analyzing how whiteness, especially middle class white dominance, responds to pressures that seek to undermine its privileges, my dissertation offered a small city-specific view of U. S. race relations. While my dissertation captures ordinary, idiosyncratic particularities of the fieldsite, it also recounts consequences of global neoliberal capitalism and white racial privilege that are common throughout the United States. Two themes dominated my research findings: neighborly relations and notions of trust (which shape encounters between neighbors) appear frequently in the text because these discourses were central to the ways residents created and understood interpersonal interactions. Moreover, these twin frames???neighborliness and trust???conditioned the ways residents interpreted, navigated, and, at times, reproduced larger structural processes like class inequalities, racial hierarchies, and the spatialization of difference. By ethnographically analyzing small city neighborly relations and notions of trust, this dissertation complicates and expands dominant representations and theorizations of ???the city,??? capitalism, and U. S. racial formations. By examining how Mansfield's socio-spatial dialectics of cityness, class, and whiteness simultaneously produce projects that reinforce social disparities and moments that resist hierarchies of privilege, my dissertation argues that small cities provide <b>critical</b> <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> of the most pressing concerns in American society: whiteness and racial hierarchies, class stratification under neoliberal capitalism, issues of neighborliness and trust, and how these processes become spatialized...|$|R
