This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of case management in community aged care on client and carer outcomes. Methods We searched Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL (EBSCO) and PsycINFO (CSA) from inception to 2011 July. Inclusion criteria were: no restriction on date, English language, community-dwelling older people and/or carers, case management in community aged care, published in refereed journals, randomized control trials (RCTs) or <b>comparative</b> <b>observational</b> <b>studies,</b> examining client or carer outcomes. Quality of studies was assessed by using such indicators as quality control, randomization, comparability, follow-up rate, dropout, blinding assessors, and intention-to-treat analysis. Two reviewers independently screened potentially relevant studies, extracted information and assessed study quality. A narrative summary of findings were presented. Results Ten RCTs and five <b>comparative</b> <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> were identified. One RCT was rated high quality. Client outcomes included mortality (7 studies), physical or cognitive functioning (6 studies), medical conditions (2 studies), behavioral problems (2 studies), unmet service needs (3 studies), psychological health or well-being (7 studies), and satisfaction with care (4 studies), while carer outcomes included stress or burden (6 studies), satisfaction with care (2 studies), psychological health or well-being (5 studies), and social consequences (such as social support and relationships with clients) (2 studies). Five of the seven studies reported that case management in community aged care interventions significantly improved psychological health or well-being in the intervention group, while all the three studies consistently reported fewer unmet service needs among the intervention participants. In contrast, available studies reported mixed results regarding client physical or cognitive functioning and carer stress or burden. There was also limited evidence indicating significant effects of the interventions on the other client and carer outcomes as described above. Conclusions Available evidence showed that case management in community aged care can improve client psychological health or well-being and unmet service needs. Future studies should investigate what specific components of case management are crucial in improving clients and their carers’ outcomes. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of da Vinci Robotic Surgery {{to the field}} of Gynecology has resulted in large changes in surgical management. The robotic platform allows less experienced laparoscopic surgeons to perform more complex procedures. In general gynecology and reproductive gynecology, the robot is being increasingly used for procedures such as hysterectomies, myomectomies, adnexal surgery, and tubal anastomosis. Among urogynecology the robot is being utilized for sacrocolopexies. In the field of gynecologic oncology, the robot is being increasingly used for hysterectomies and lymphadenectomies in oncologic diseases. Despite the rapid and widespread adoption of robotic surgery in gynecology, there are no randomized trials comparing its efficacy and safety to other traditional surgical approaches.

Methods: This was a prospective <b>comparative</b> <b>observational</b> <b>study</b> of all ED attendances (visits; n = 11 383) made to a regional teaching hospital in Queensland, Australia, during a 9 -week period (November 24, 2008 -January 4, 2009). A 3 -week period of ward closure was compared with equal time periods before and after. Hospital health information systems data were linked manually to describe and compare outcomes: median ED length of stay, access block, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality. Results: Ward closure reduced hospital bed capacity by 5. 9 %. During ward closure there was a higher proportion of access block (38 % vs 33 % in both pre- and posttimes), longer wait time to see a doctor, and longer overall ED length of stay, compared with pre-ward closure time period. Conclusion: Temporarily closing a medical ward had a negative effect on some ED and hospital outcomes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{externally}} validate EPICON, {{a computerized}} system for grouping diagnoses from EMRs in general practice into episodes of care. These episodes {{can be used}} for estimating morbidity rates. DESIGN: <b>Comparative</b> <b>observational</b> <b>study.</b> MEASUREMENTS: Morbidity rates from an independent dataset, based on episode-oriented EMRs, were used as the gold standard. The EMRs in this dataset contained diagnoses which were manually grouped by GPs. The authors ungrouped these diagnoses and regrouped them automatically into episodes using EPICON. The authors then used these episodes to estimate morbidity rates that were compared to the gold standard. The differences between the two sets of morbidity rates were calculated and the authors analyzed large as well as structural differences to establish possible causes. RESULTS: In general, the morbidity rates based on EPICON deviate only slightly from the gold standard. Out of 675 diagnoses, 36 (5 %) were considered to be deviating diagnoses. The deviating diagnoses showed differences for two main reasons: "differences in rules between the two methods of episode construction" and "inadequate performance of EPICON. " CONCLUSION: The EPICON system performs well for the large majority of the morbidity rates. We can therefore conclude that EPICON is useful for grouping episodes to estimate morbidity rates using EMRs from general practices.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Patients {{discovered}} {{to have a}} patent foramen ovale {{in the setting of}} a cryptogenic stroke may be treated with percutaneous closure, antiplatelet therapy, or anticoagulants. A recent randomized trial (CLOSURE I) did not detect any benefit of closure over medical treatment alone; the optimal medical therapy is also unknown. We synthesized the available evidence on secondary stroke prevention in patients with patent foramen ovale and cryptogenic stroke. Methods—A MEDLINE search was performed for finding longitudinal studies investigating medical treatment or closure, meta-analysis of incidence rates (IR), and IR ratios of recurrent cerebrovascular events. Results—Fifty-two single-arm studies and 7 comparative nonrandomized studies and the CLOSURE I trial were reviewed. The summary IR of recurrent stroke was 0. 36 events (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 24 – 0. 56) per 100 person-years with closure versus 2. 53 events (95 % CI, 1. 91 – 3. 35) per 100 person-years with medical therapy.

40|$|ObjectiveThis goal of {{this study}} was to {{systematically}} review the literature to determine if surgical intervention (open or endovascular) is superior to compression alone with respect to ulcer healing, ulcer recurrence, and time to ulcer healing in patients with lower extremity venous ulcer disease. MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and <b>comparative</b> <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> from 1990 to December 2013. The interventions of interest were any open or endovascular surgical interventions on the venous system in the lower extremity compared with compression alone. ResultsWe included 11 studies (seven RCTs and four <b>observational</b> <b>studies)</b> with moderate to increased risk of bias. The meta-analysis of all studies demonstrated increased healing rate (pooled risk ratio [RR], 1. 06; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 00 - 1. 13; I 2  = 10 %) and lower risk of recurrence (RR, 0. 54; 95 % CI, 0. 34 - 0. 85; I 2  = 27 %) with open surgical procedures compared with compression. However, the meta-analysis of only RCTs showed no difference, possibly due to imprecision. The meta-analysis of three RCTs showed no difference in time to ulcer healing, − 0. 41 (95 % CI, − 0. 89 to  0. 07). Two studies of endovascular surgical procedures compared with compression showed no significant difference in ulcer healing (RR, 1. 65; 95 % CI, 0. 43 - 6. 32). One study of open surgical venous ligation and stripping compared with endovenous laser also showed no significant difference in ulcer recurrence (RR, 0. 83; 95 % CI, 0. 21 - 3. 27). ConclusionsOpen surgical interventions may improve lower extremity venous ulcer healing. The quality of this evidence is low because the analysis was dominated by the results of <b>observational</b> <b>studies.</b> The current evidence does not definitively support the superiority of endovascular surgical interventions compared with compression alone...|$|R
40|$|Background: Acute viral {{encephalitis}} is a world-wide {{health problem}} with severe morbidity, significant mortality {{and a high}} incidence of residual sequelae in survivors. Objective: To identify the association of clinical features of acute viral encephalitis with mortality and neurodevelopment outcomes. Methodology: It is a hospital based <b>comparative</b> <b>observational</b> prospective <b>study</b> done in Dhaka Shishu Hospital during the period of October 2005 to March 2006. Children with 1 month to 12 years of both sex presenting with specific clinical features and laboratory evidences suggestive of acute viral encephalitis (seizures, altered consciousness, features of raised intracranial pressure, cerebrospinal fluid evidences of viral encephalitis) were included. 44 children were enrolled according to inclusion criteria. Data were collected on clinical and socio demographic status. SPSS 16 version program was used fo...|$|R
40|$|Cataract is a {{cause of}} avoidable {{blindness}} and its prevalence increases with age. Cataract surgery is the only possible therapeutic modality for improving visual function in cataract patients. The rising numbers of cataract patients require a type of cataract surgery with minimal side effects and without hospitalization. In this connection the day care cataract surgery has been introduced, with excellent results. Therefore {{the aim of the}} present study was to compare the visual acuity of day-care patients and inpatients after extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). A <b>comparative</b> <b>observational</b> <b>study</b> was carried out on 30 mature senile cataract patients with regard to type of care after ECCE surgery. The study subjects were allocated to two groups of 15 subjects each, i. e. the day-care group and the in-patient group. The patients were observed postoperatively on the first day, first week, fourth week, and eighth week. They subsequently were corrected for best visual acuity. Hypothesis testing was done using independent t-test and the Mann-Whitney test. The study results indicated that the visual acuity of the subjects after the eighth postoperative week did not differ significantly between both groups (p> 0. 05). There was no significant difference in outcome or risk of postoperative complications between day care and in-patient cataract surgery. This study therefore presents evidence that both post-ECCE day-care as well as post-ECCE inpatients had similar visual acuity levels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{study was}} part of a {{nationwide}} evaluation of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in Swiss primary care. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare patient-physician relationships and the respective patient-reported relief of symptoms between CAM and conventional primary care (COM). Methods A <b>comparative</b> <b>observational</b> <b>study</b> in Swiss primary care with written survey completed by patients who visited a GP one month earlier. 6133 patients older than 16 years of 170 certified CAM physicians, of 77 non-certified CAM physicians and of 71 conventional physicians were included. Patients completed a questionnaire aimed at symptom relief, patient satisfaction, fulfilment of expectations, and quality of patient-physician interaction (EUROPEP questionnaire). Results CAM physicians treated significantly more patients with chronic conditions than COM physicians. CAM Patients had significant higher healing expectations than COM patients. General patient satisfaction was significantly higher in CAM patients, although patient-reported symptom relief was significantly poorer. The quality of patient-physician communication was rated significantly better in CAM patients. Conclusions The study shows better patient-reported outcomes of CAM in comparison to COM in Swiss primary care, which is related to higher patient satisfaction due to better patient-physician communication of CAM physicians. More effective communication patterns of these physicians may play an important role in allowing patients to maintain more positive outcome expectations. The findings should promote formative efforts in conventional primary care to improve communication skills in order to reach the same levels of favourable patient outcomes. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nurse {{practitioners}} (NPs) in the Emergency Department (ED) {{have been}} trained to assess a range of clinical problems and minor complaints such as acute ankle injury. This study compared assessment of suspected ankle and foot injuries using the Ottawa Ankle Rules (OAR) by NPs and ED medical doctors (ED-Drs). METHODS: A prospective, <b>comparative,</b> <b>observational</b> <b>study</b> was undertaken in an Australian acute adult and paediatric urban district ED. NPs and ED-Drs recorded information for patients with acute ankle and/or mid-foot injuries on demographic characteristics, OAR features, use of X-ray and patient management. Outcome measures included X-ray rates and identification of fracture. RESULTS: 174 patients were included in this study: 51 received NP and 123 received ED-Dr care. Assessed as requiring X-ray assessment (NP: 78. 4 %, ED-Dr: 88. 6 %; p= 0. 081), and detection of significant fracture (NP: 17. 6 %, ED-Dr: 22. 8 %; p= 0. 453) were similar. ED-based medical registrars were more likely to miss a fracture compared with NP (NP: 0 %, ED-based Registrar: 28. 6 %, p= 0. 013). There {{were no significant differences in}} rates of OAR features for patients seen by NPs or ED-Drs. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that NPs are less likely to miss significant fractures of the ankle and/or foot compared with ED-based medical registrars. Future research should focus on actual use of the OAR and accuracy of X-ray assessment by NPs...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the current}} {{advances}} in functional biodiversity research is the move away from short-lived test systems towards the exploration of diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in structurally more complex ecosystems. In forests, assumptions about the functional significance of tree species diversity have only recently produced {{a new generation of}} research on ecosystem processes and services. Novel experimental designs have now replaced traditional forestry trials, but these comparatively young experimental plots suffer from specific difficulties that are mainly related to the tree size and longevity. Tree species diversity experiments therefore need to be complemented with <b>comparative</b> <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> in existing forests. Here we present the design and implementation of a new network of forest plots along tree species diversity gradients in six major European forest types: the FunDivEUROPE Exploratory Platform. Based on a review of the deficiencies of existing observational approaches and of unresolved research questions and hypotheses, we discuss the fundamental criteria that shaped the design of our platform. Key features include the extent of the species diversity gradient with mixtures up to five species, strict avoidance of a dilution gradient, special attention to community evenness and minimal covariation with other environmental factors. The new European research platform permits the most comprehensive assessment of tree species diversity effects on forest ecosystem functioning to date since it offers a common set of research plots to groups of researchers from very different disciplines and uses the same methodological approach in contrasting forest types along an extensive environmental gradient...|$|R
