In 1830 some 113 manufacturers were based in Calais and the St Pierre suburbs, the majority of which were English. There are still two major lace factories in Calais with around 700 looms and 3000 employees. The town exports in the early 20th century were lace, chemicals, paper, wines, especially champagne, spirits, hay, straw, wool, potatoes, woven goods, fruit, glass-ware, lace and metal-ware. Principal imports in the early 20th century included cotton and silk goods, coal, iron and steel, petroleum, timber, raw wool, <b>cotton</b> <b>yarn</b> and cork. During the five years 1901–1905 the average annual value of exports was £8,388,000 (£6,363,000 in the years 1896–1900), of imports £4,145,000 (£3,759,000 in 1896–1900).|$|E

The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many nationalities (Arabs, Persians, Guzerates, Khorassanians) settled in Calicut, drawn by the thriving trade business. Ship building prospered and keeled ships of 1000–1200 bahares (burden) were built without decks by sewing the entire hull with ropes rather than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the Red Sea ports of Aden and Mecca with Vijayanagara goods sold {{as far away as}} Venice. The empire's principal exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, myrobalan, tamarind timber, anafistula, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth and porcelain. <b>Cotton</b> <b>yarn</b> was shipped to Burma and indigo to Persia. Chief imports from Palestine were copper, quicksilver (mercury), vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose water, knives, coloured camlets, gold and silver.

25|$|Before the 1770s, textile {{production}} was {{a cottage industry}} using flax and wool. Weaving was a family activity. The children and women would card the fibre — break up and clean the disorganized fluff into long bundles. The women would then spin these rough rovings into yarn wound on a spindle. The male weaver would use a frame loom to weave this into cloth. This was then tentered in the sun to bleach it. The invention by John Kay of the flying shuttle made the loom twice as productive, causing the demand for <b>cotton</b> <b>yarn</b> to vastly exceed what traditional spinners could supply.|$|E

40|$|Two plant proteins, soyprotein {{and wheat}} gluten, and chicken {{feathers}} used to size cotton substrates provided sizing performance similar to starch and were also easily degraded in activated sludge. Sizing {{is an essential}} process to impart protection to warp yarns and increase weaving efficiency. <b>Cotton</b> <b>yarns</b> have traditionally been sized with starch, modified starch derivatives, CMC, poly vinyl alcohol (PVA), or a combination thereof along with quite a few other fiber binding ingredients. Although starch and starch derivatives are extensively used for sizing, there can be several limitations including less-than-satisfactory sizing performance and difficulties in desizing starch based size. Plant proteins such as wheat gluten, soyproteins and poultry feathers are available in large quantities at low cost and have limited industrial applications. However, these proteins {{are known to have}} excellent film-forming properties, a primary requirement for a warp size, and have also been used as adhesives. Using proteins as warp sizing agents on <b>cotton</b> <b>yarns</b> potentially could provide acceptable sizing performance and be cost-effective, as well. In this research, soyproteins, wheat gluten, and chicken feathers were studied for exploring their feasibility for sizing, desizing, biodegradability, and ability to replace starch and PVA for sizing <b>cotton</b> <b>yarns.</b> It was found that all three proteins provided similar cohesion to fibers and abrasion resistance compared to starch.
