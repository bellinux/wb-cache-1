50|$|Each step {{produces}} a deliverable, either a document, code, or a test report. When the software passes {{all of its}} tests (or enough to be sold safely), these are bound into a <b>certification</b> <b>report,</b> that can literally have thousands of pages. The designated engineering representative, who has been striving for completion, then decides if the result is acceptable. If it is, he signs it, and the avionic software is certified.|$|E
40|$|<b>Certification</b> of {{financial}} <b>reports</b> is tightly regulated {{with the intent}} to ensure the quality of this service. In order to place this market within a larger perspective, Part I of this paper presents archival data on certification activity in the economy. �e finding of widespread availability of a diverse set of certifiers for most goods and services points to the competitive conditions that accounting firms may encounter as they attempt to expand their range of services. In Part II we examine an instance of audit firms unsuccessfully competing with non-traditional assurance providers of e-commerce privacy certification. �eir failure appears to be attributable, at least in part, to the high cost of certification, inferior standards, and poor compliance by their clients. In Part III we document the types of <b>certification</b> <b>reports</b> issued by government agencies and private certification services. Private certification agencies issue more detailed and informative <b>certification</b> <b>reports</b> compared to government agencies. We discuss the implications of these findings for the market for audit services...|$|R

5000|$|On 23 December 2008, {{the wheel}} stopped and trapped 173 {{passengers}} {{for about six}} hours. The breakdown {{was caused by a}} short circuit and fire in the Flyer's wheel control room, which cut off the air-conditioning in the wheel. Eleven passengers were evacuated via a sling-like device from a few of the capsules, and those stranded were given food and drink. The wheel restarted nearly seven hours after it had stopped and two people were hospitalized. The Flyer was closed indefinitely and an investigation into the cause of the malfunction was launched. [...] The wheel re-opened on 26 January 2009 after the Singapore Police received the final safety <b>certification</b> <b>report</b> from the Conformity Assessment Board. Following this breakdown, additional back-up systems costing about $3 million were installed. These included a generator, winches, three anti-fire and smoke systems, and heat detection devices.|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{entrepreneurship}} {{encourages a}} focus on innovation, efficiency and environmentally-friendly actions. Certification enables firms to accumulate legitimacy that enables stakeholders to know of, and understand, a firm’s activities: it is a mechanism to buffer against the liabilities of newness and smallness. Building on insights from the resource-based view of the firm, institutional theory and signalling theory, this article conceptualises environmental certification as an observable high-quality resource investment signal. This resource fosters innovation and encourages certified firms to accumulate and mobilise legitimacy. Regression analysis detected that very young and micro firms who cited the compounded signal of <b>certification</b> <b>reported</b> {{significantly higher levels of}} effectiveness. Micro firms that cited the compounded signal of <b>certification</b> <b>reported</b> weakly significantly higher levels profitability. Certification enables very young, rather than young firms, to address the liabilities of newness, and enables micro, rather than small firms, to address the liabilities of smallness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Many {{countries}} are using certification procedures {{to guarantee the}} full compliance of e-voting mechanisms with democratic standards, but the data generated by these analysis is normally handled almost secretly.
