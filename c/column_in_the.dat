5|$|In February 2013 Higginbotham {{began to}} write his own <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Sentinel, a local {{newspaper}} in the North Staffordshire and South Cheshire area. Higginbotham also has a regular sports <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Independent. He released his autobiography in April 2015, entitled: Rise of the Underdog. He has appeared on several television and radio stations, including Talksport, BBC Radio 5 Live, BT Sport and Sky Sports.|$|E

He {{is also the}} chief executive of the Aimita Corporation, an organisation that provides performance management consulting. Westley has also gained a Master of Arts degree in company direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{occupies the}} north-eastern {{corner of the}} Elizabeth and Bourke Street intersection. The overall design expresses classical architecture due to its use of Doric <b>columns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first level, Ionic <b>columns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second and Corinthian <b>columns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>columns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central nave, <b>in</b> African marble, had Corinthian capitals and friezes with deeds {{from the}} history of Republican Rome. <b>The</b> <b>columns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second row were in cipolline marble and, finally, the {{external}} ones had Ionic capitals.|$|R

5|$|A bronze <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{shape of}} {{intertwined}} snakes (the Serpent column) was created from melted-down Persian weapons, {{acquired in the}} plunder of the Persian camp, and was erected at Delphi. It commemorated all the Greek city-states that {{had participated in the}} battle, listing them on the column, and thus confirming some of Herodotus' claims. Most of it still survives in the Hippodrome of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), where it was carried by Constantine the Great during the founding of his city on the Greek colony of Byzantium.|$|E
5|$|In 1845 Staunton began a chess {{column for}} The Illustrated London News, {{which became the}} most {{influential}} chess <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world and which he continued {{for the rest of}} his life. Although his articles mostly focused on over-the-board play, a significant number featured correspondence chess. Some followed with enthusiasm the progress of promising youngsters, including Paul Morphy. Staunton produced over 1,400 weekly articles for The Illustrated London News.|$|E
5|$|Later, Hill {{attacked}} both Fielding and Smart, 13 August 1752, in {{the only}} issue of The Impertinent to be produced. Although the work was published anonymously, it was commonly known that it was produced by Hill, and he soon followed up the pamphlet with his 25 August 1752 The Inspector <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> London Daily Advertiser. With the column, he harshly criticized Smart's Poems on Several Occasions. Fielding eventually left the dispute after the sixth issue of The Covent-Garden Journal was published.|$|E
50|$|The {{facade of}} the {{residence}} is composed of two lintels of arch-stone separated by a pointed horseshoe arch and a wooden pergola over the door.

5|$|Prabhu further {{asserts that}} Tipu's hatred of Christians was {{compounded}} by fears that as they shared the same faith as their European co-religionists, the Christians were viewed as a potential fifth <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of a British attack. To this, he adds that Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from the Christians within his domain. Therefore, according to Prabhu, through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics, Tipu fabricated evidence of a large-scale Christian conspiracy against him, {{even though he knew}} it wasn't true.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are a group (<b>column)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{periodic}} table {{consisting of the}} chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of the periodic table of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide {{the best example of}} group trends in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The tourist {{information}} centre {{is situated in}} the Shrewsbury Museum & Art Gallery {{in what used to}} be the old Music Hall theatre in the town square. The three main museums are Shrewsbury Museum & Art Gallery, Shrewsbury Castle (which houses the Shropshire Regimental Museum) and the Coleham Pumping Station. Also, there is the Gateway arts and drama centre and there are also various private galleries and art shops around the town. Another notable feature of the town is Lord Hill's Column, the largest free-standing Doric <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E

5|$|This article {{turned into}} a regular <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sentinel — and {{syndicated}} in newspapers serving the LGBT community nationwide — describing his experiences. On January 10, 1982, Campbell was interviewed by Alfred for The Gay Life program on KSAN-FM, with doctors Marcus Conant and Paul Volberding; the interview has been archived by the GLBT Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E
5|$|Barton is {{a patron}} of the Tamsin Gulvin Fund, a charity set up to support people who have {{addiction}} problems and no financial support. Tony Adams, who had been impressed with Barton's attitude during {{his involvement in the}} Sporting Chance clinic, appointed him to this role. He {{is a part of the}} 'Get Hooked on Fishing' campaign, designed to keep children out of trouble by encouraging them to take up fishing. He has also taken part in a celebrity cricket match for charity to help fund a new children's rehabilitation unit at a hospital in Manchester. In 2011, he began writing a regular <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Big Issue, a street newspaper sold by the homeless and vulnerably housed.|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter. He was a very poor one, unable to get {{statements}} from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever he wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tribune proper.|$|E
5|$|Bostwick {{returned}} to Millwall, {{but failed to}} make any first-team appearances. In late January 2007, {{he was allowed to}} leave the club on a free transfer to sign for Rushden & Diamonds on an 18-month contract. Rushden were managed by Graham Westley, who had previously written about Bostwick's credentials in his weekly <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Non-League Paper when Westley was out of work. Bostwick made his Rushden debut in the club's 2–1 away win at league leaders Dagenham & Redbridge, and came off the bench in the following match against St Albans City. He was sent-off {{for the first time in}} his career in Rushden's 2–2 draw with Aldershot Town, receiving a red card for two bookable offences. Bostwick played eight matches for Rushden, but fell out of favour at the club in March 2007 after Westley was fired. As a result, Bostwick did not play for Rushden again, and was released by the club at the end of the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|Deighton {{authored}} two television scripts, {{the first}} of which was Long Past Glory in 1963; he also wrote a film script, Oh! What a Lovely War (1969). His long-held interest in cooking—his mother had been a professional chef and instilled a love for cuisine in her son—led to an illustrated cookery <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sunday newspaper, The Observer, for two years. The work was collected into two later books, Len Deighton's Action Cookbook and Où est le garlic (both 1965); he subsequently wrote several other cookery books. Deighton has produced several other works of non-fiction, including a study of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, a history of the airship, Second World War military history and a short e-book about James Bond.|$|E

5|$|Hearing {{the shots}} from the {{northern}} side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson. However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open. The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover. Five Company soldiers were injured. The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{reviewed}} {{television for}} the Manchester Guardian {{and wrote a}} weekly political <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Spectator noted for its irreverence and influence on modern parliamentary sketches. During the 1960s he wrote five columns {{a week for the}} Daily Mail on any subject that he chose. After a disagreement with the proprietor of the paper over attempted censorship of his column in 1970, Levin moved to The Times where, with one break of just over a year in 1981–82, he remained as resident columnist until his retirement, covering a wide range of topics, both serious and comic.|$|E
5|$|Min was {{influential}} in creating {{an interest in}} celebrity pregnancies in popular culture through her work at Us Weekly. Shortly after she left, Min got a deal with St. James Press to write a book, How to Look Hot in a Minivan: A Real Woman's Guide to Losing Weight, Looking Great, and Dressing Chic in the Age of the Celebrity Mom. In August 2012, she wrote a <b>column</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> New York Times complaining about unrealistic weight and beauty expectations for new moms, set by celebrities. She was criticized in blogs and social media for criticizing an aspect of popular culture she helped establish. Min said the magazine was responding to reader interests, not creating them.|$|E
