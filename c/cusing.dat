Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is {{a popular}} and {{promising}} Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique as it can produce parts with complex internal features with part density close to 100 %.

Also, the tensile test experiments of raw untreated SLM parts carried out at room temperature and at high temperature (200 oC) show superior result compared with heat treated casted parts.

40|$|The {{reflection}} of internal gravity waves at sloping boundaries leads to focusing or defo- <b>cusing.</b> In closed domains, focusing dominates and projects the wave energy onto ’wave attractors’. Previous theoretical and experimental work on 2 D steady state wave attrac- tors {{has demonstrated that}} geometric focusing by wave reflection can be balanced either by viscous dissipation at high wave numbers (Hazewinkel et al., 2008), or by nonlinear wave-wave interactions (Scolan et al., 2013). The present study considers a weakly nonlinear 3 D internal wave beam under steady state conditions in a semi-infinite domain between two vertical walls. We analyze {{the effect of the}} Stokes boundary layers at these two vertical side walls on the interior velocity field. With a perturbation approach, we find that the two lateral Stokes boundary layers generate a fully three-dimensional interior velocity field component, proportional to ν 1 / 2, with ν the dynamical viscosity. This velocity field dampens the wave beam at high wave numbers, thereby providing a new mechanism to establish an energetic balance for steady state wave attractors.
