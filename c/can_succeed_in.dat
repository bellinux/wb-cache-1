Unfortunately, his plans never seem to work out and he ends up disappointing the people around him.|$|E
25|$|The Pharaoh Hound is independent-minded, highly intelligent, and {{occasionally}} stubborn, yet very trainable when positive methods are used. It {{is a very}} sensitive breed and responds poorly to compulsory training methods and to being physically punished. Pharaohs <b>can</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> competition obedience, {{but they do not}} take to it naturally as many breeds that were bred to work alongside people. Pharaohs were bred to hunt and think for themselves, and they have retained this trait. They tire/bore easily with repetitive commands, therefore it is the trainer's job to ensure that their training remains interesting and positive in nature.|$|E

It is difficult to see how NATO <b>can</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> stabilizing Afghanistan unless it is willing to commit more troops and give commanders more flexibility." [...] The controversy surrounding the differences in contributions to Afghanistan indeed remained after the summit. For instance, during March 2007 British commanders accused the NATO members that refused to fight in the conflict-ridden south (in non-emergency situations) as causing [...] "huge resentment" [...] and a sense of betrayal, and undermined the credibility of the alliance. They added that despite the earlier pleas for reinforcements or to have [...] "operational caveats" [...] removed, some countries, notably France and Germany, were still not heeding their requests.|$|E

With the Australian cricket coach Bobby Simpson as his manager he soon became a wealthy man, endorsing a whole range or products, until he and Simpson fell out. He later set up cricket coaching clinics with Steve Waugh and Brad McNamara in 1991–92. However, the distraction of having agents and pushing products unsettled his career, and he was [...] "not so good that he <b>can</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> high company with giving his game everything he has".

2500|$|The Making of an American (1901), an autobiography, follows Riis's {{early life}} in Denmark and his struggles as an {{immigrant}} in the United States. The book also describes how Riis became {{a reporter and}} how his work in immigrant enclaves kindled his desire for social reforms. Riis organized his autobiography chronologically, but each chapter illustrates a broader theme that America is a land of opportunity {{for those who are}} bold enough to take chances on their future. The autobiography is mostly straightforward, but Riis is not sure if his past should be told as a [...] "love story", [...] "if I am to tell the truth [...] [...] [...] I don’t see how it can be helped." [...] Although much of it is biographical, Riis also lays out his opinions about how immigrants like himself <b>can</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> the United States. Chapter 7 is distinct because Riis's wife, Elizabeth, describes her life in Denmark before she married Riis.|$|E

2500|$|In {{concurrence}} {{with the}} majority opinion Justice Clarence Thomas restated his view, in agreement with Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessy, that the Constitution is [...] "color-blind." [...] For Thomas, this means that no {{discrimination on the basis}} of race is permitted by the Constitution, even for a so-called [...] "benign" [...] purpose (Thomas rejected the notion that there could be a purely benign purpose in his concurrence in Adarand because the benignity or malignity of race-based discrimination turns on [...] "whose ox is being gored" [...] or is [...] "in the eye of the beholder"). [...] Justice Thomas also rejected the view advanced by the dissent that these school districts were in danger of resegregation. [...] He contended that whatever trends toward classroom racial imbalance have obtained, they were not the result of state-sanctioned segregation as in the pre-Brown era. Justice Thomas goes on to call out the dissent for adopting segregationist reasoning advanced in Brown, particularly its insistence that the Court should defer to local school board knowledge, expertise, and judgment. [...] He also wrote about the unsettled debate concerning whether racial balance or diversity has a positive effect on educational outcomes. [...] Justice Thomas recoils at the suggestion that black students can only learn if they are sitting next to white students. [...] Some of the concurrence consists of social science citations and statistics showing that black students <b>can</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> majority black schools such as HBCUs. [...] Justice Thomas concludes noting [...] "If our history has taught us anything it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories." [...] In a footnote the Justice added a personal mention of Justice Breyer: [...] "Justice Breyer's good intentions, which I do not doubt, have the shelf life of Justice Breyer's tenure." [...] He goes on to explain that he is skeptical that school boards will always have such good intentions in their race-based decisionmaking, for, as Madison said, [...] "if men were angels, no government would be necessary." ...|$|E
