25|$|However, durum {{is a hard}} {{grain and}} was {{difficult}} to grind with the early hand-held grindstones. The flour also had to be sifted repeatedly to obtain fine flour (such as the solet required in the Temple offerings). Thus, durum was primarily used for porridges, or parboiled and dried, or roasted and boiled, and barley flour continued {{to be used for}} making bread, until another hybrid of emmer, common or “bread” wheat (triticum aestivum) replaced barley as the primary grain after the Greek conquest of the land of Israel and, together with durum wheat, became widespread during the Greco-Roman period, constituting the bulk of the grain crop {{by the end of the}} Second Temple period. The introduction of <b>common</b> <b>wheat,</b> which contained more starch and had a higher level of gluten, spread the use of wheat for bread-making and led to the production of loaves that were more lightly textured than barley and durum wheat breads.|$|E

40|$|Within the HEALTHGRAIN {{diversity}} screening program, {{the variation}} {{in the content of}} dietary fiber and components thereof in different types of wheat was studied. The wheat types were winter (131 varieties) and spring (20 varieties) wheats (both Triticum aestivum L., also referred to as <b>common</b> <b>wheats),</b> durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf., 10 varieties), spelt wheat (Triticum spelta L., 5 varieties), einkorn wheat (T. monococcum L., 5 varieties), and emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum Schubler, 5 varieties). <b>Common</b> <b>wheats</b> contained, on average, the highest level of dietary fiber [11. 5 - 18. 3 % of dry matter (dm) ], whereas einkorn and emmer wheats contained the lowest level (7. 2 - 12. 8 % of dm). Intermediate levels were measured in durum and spelt wheats (10. 7 - 15. 5 % of dm). Also, {{on the basis of the}} arabinoxylan levels in bran, the different wheat types could be divided this way, with ranges of 12. 7 - 22. 1 % of dm for <b>common</b> <b>wheats,</b> 6. 1 - 14. 4 % of dm for einkorn and emmer wheats, and 10. 9 - 13. 9 % of dm for durum and spelt wheats. On average, bran arabinoxylan made up ca. 29 % of the total dietary fiber content of wheat. In contrast to what was the case for bran, the arabinoxylan levels in flour were comparable between the different types of wheat. For wheat, in general, they varied between 1. 35 and 2. 75 % of dm. Einkorn, emmer, and durum wheats contained about half the level of mixed-linkage beta-glucan (0. 25 - 0. 45 % of dm) present in winter, spring, and spelt wheats (0. 50 - 0. 95 % of dm). All wheat types had Klason lignin, the levels of which varied from 1. 40 to 3. 25 % of dm. The arabinoxylan contents in bran and the dietary fiber contents in wholemeal were inversely and positively related with bran yield, respectively. Aqueous wholemeal extract viscosity, a measure for the level of soluble dietary fiber, was determined to large extent by the level of water-extractable arabinoxylan. In conclusion, the present study revealed substantial variation in the contents of dietary fiber and constituents thereof between different wheat types and varieties. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Grain {{hardness}} is {{an important}} trait·used in the classification of wheat and in determining its end use. Two major components of a protein group associated with the surface of starch granules, puroindoline a (PINA) and puroindoline b (p 1 NB), have been to shown to significantly influence grain hardness. <b>Common</b> <b>wheats</b> that have both puroindolines present in their wild form are soft textured, while the various hard kernel phenotypes have mutation or deletion in either PINs. The extremely hard durum wheat lacks these proteins. The primary role for these lipid binding proteins is most likely antimicrobial, as demonstrated in previous in-vitro and in-vivo studies (Bhave and Moms, 2008). Several reports on transcripts and protein level comparison as well as transgenic work, {{have shown that the}} lipid binding properties of PINs require some co-operation or interdependence (Capparelli et ai, 2003; Amoroso et al, 2004; Hogg et aI, 2004; Swan et aI, 2006). An understanding of the interaetions between these proteins would help elucidate their biological function in grain texture and possible antimicrobial applications. In this study, the yeast two hybrid system was used to study physical interactions between PINA and PINB from two soft <b>common</b> <b>wheats</b> and a Pinh-D 1 b wheat type...|$|R
2500|$|In Italy, whole emmer grains can {{be easily}} found in most {{supermarkets}} and groceries, emmer bread (pane di farro) {{can be found in}} bakeries in some areas, and emmer has traditionally been consumed in Tuscany as whole grain in soup. [...] Higher in fiber than <b>common</b> <b>wheat,</b> emmer's use for making pasta is a recent response to the health food market; some consumers, however, judge that emmer pasta has an unattractive texture. Emmer has also been used in beer production.|$|E
2500|$|The four {{wild species}} of wheat, {{along with the}} domesticated {{varieties}} einkorn, emmer and spelt, have hulls. This more primitive morphology (in evolutionary terms) consists of toughened glumes that tightly enclose the grains, and (in domesticated wheats) a semi-brittle rachis that breaks easily on threshing. The result is that when threshed, the wheat ear breaks up into spikelets. To obtain the grain, further processing, such as milling or pounding, is needed to remove the hulls or husks. In contrast, in free-threshing (or naked) forms such as durum wheat and <b>common</b> <b>wheat,</b> the glumes are fragile and the rachis tough. On threshing, the chaff breaks up, releasing the grains. Hulled wheats are often stored as spikelets because the toughened glumes give good protection against pests of stored grain.|$|E
2500|$|In the Near East, in {{southern}} Mesopotamia in particular, cultivation of emmer wheat {{began to decline}} in the Early Bronze Age, from about 3000 BC, and barley became the standard cereal crop. This has been related to increased salinization of irrigated alluvial soils, of which barley is more tolerant, although this study has been challenged. Emmer had {{a special place in}} ancient Egypt, where it was the main wheat cultivated in Pharaonic times, although cultivated einkorn wheat was grown in great abundance during the Third Dynasty, and large quantities of it were found preserved, along with cultivated emmer wheat and barleys, in the subterranean chambers beneath the Step Pyramid at Saqqara. Neighbouring countries also cultivated einkorn, durum and <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> In the absence of any obvious functional explanation, the greater prevalence of emmer wheat in the diet of ancient Egypt may simply reflect a marked culinary or cultural preference, or may reflect growing conditions having changed after the Third Dynasty. Emmer and barley were the primary ingredients in ancient Egyptian bread and beer. Emmer recovered from the Phoenician [...] settlement at Volubilis (in present-day Morocco) has been dated {{to the middle of the}} first millennium BC.|$|E

No. 44 (Cmp), T. spelta var. duhamelianum (Splt), and T. macha var. subletschchumicum (Mch), were placed into the cytoplasms of seven tetraploid Aegilops species, i. e., Ae. biuncialis (C^uC^uM^bM^b), Ae. columnaris (C^uC^uM^cM^c), Ae. ovata (C^uC^uM^oM^o), Ae. triaristata (C^uC^uM^tM^t), Ae. kotschyi (C^uC^uS^vS^v), Ae. variabilis (C^uC^uS^vS^v) and Ae. ventricosa (DDM^vM^v) by repeated backcrosses. Using these nucleus-cytoplasm (NC) hybrids, the genetic {{differences between the}} cytoplasms of these species were investigated. The cytoplasms of Ae. biuncialis, Ae. columnaris and Ae. triaristata delayed heading, reduced plant growth, and induced variegation in almost all <b>common</b> <b>wheats.</b> JF had some restorer gene(s) against growth retardation caused by these cytoplasms. Seven <b>common</b> <b>wheats,</b> Tve, N 26, Slm, Sk, Sphr, Splt and Mch with these cytoplasms showed complete or almost complete sterility, while five other wheats restored some male fertility. These cytoplasms also caused formation of germless grains in Tve, Slm and Mch, and production of haploids and twin seedlings in Slm and Mch. The cytoplasm of Ae. columnaris, however, slightly differed from those of Ae. biuncialis and Ae. triaristata, because the former cytoplasm induced anther malformation with abnormal tetrads. Although Ae. ovata has the same basic genome constitution as the above-mentioned species, genetic characteristics of the ovata cytoplasm considerably differed {{from those of the}} latter three cytoplasms. This cytoplasm delayed heading, gave almost normal growth vigor, and caused complete male sterility, except P 168 and CS which restored fertility. No variegation, nor formation of germless grains and haploids was observed, but anther was partially malformed. The cytoplasms of Ae. kotschyi and Ae. variabilis did not affect heading date and any other characters relating to plant growth except a few characters. Male sterility was caused by these cytoplasms only in Slm, Splt and Mch. These cytoplasms induced germless grains in Tve and Slm, and haploids and twin seedlings in Slm. The cytoplasm of Ae. ventricosa gave no particular effects on all characters of all <b>common</b> <b>wheats</b> tested. 4 倍性Aegilops(2 n= 28) 属 7 種の細胞質の比較分析を行なうため, Ae. biuncialis (ゲノム式:C^uC^uM^bM^b), Ae. columnaris (C^uC^uM^cM^c), Ae. ovata (C^uC^uM^oM^o), Ae. triaristata (C^uC^uM^tM^t), Ae. kotschyi (C^uC^uS^vS^v), Ae. variabilis (C^uC^uS^vS^v), Ae. ventricosa (DDM^vM^v) の細胞質を連続もどし交雑法によって,パンコムギ (2 n= 42,ゲノム式:AABBDD) 12 系統, Tve, P 168, CS, N 26, Slm, JF, Sk, S 615, Sphr, Cmp, Splt, Mch に導入した。その結果得られた核細胞質雑種の遺伝的特性を調べた。Ae. biuncialis, Ae. columnaris, Ae. triaristata の細胞質は,ほとんどのパンコムギ系統の出穂を遅らし,生育を阻害し,冬期に斑入りをおこした。しかし,JFはこれら 3 種細胞質による生育阻害や斑入りを示さないことから,生育阻害を回復させ,斑入りを抑制する遺伝子をもつことがわかった。 3 種細胞質をもつTve, N 26, Slm, Sk, Sphr, Splt, Mch, のパンコムギ 7 系統では,雄性不稔を示したが,他の 5 系統では稔性を回復した。また, Ae. biuncialis, Ae. columnaris, Ae. triaristata の細胞質は, Tve,Slm, Mch, の 3 系統において無胚種子を, SlmとMchにおいて半数体や双子を出現させた。以上より 3 種細胞質はほぼ同じ遺伝的特性をもつが, Ae. columnaris 細胞質は葯の奇形と 4 分子の配列異常をひきおこすことで　Ae. biuncialis とAe. columnaris の細胞質とは若干分化していた。Ae. ovataは, 上記の 3 種と同じ基本ゲノムをもつが,その細胞質の遺伝的特性は 3 種細胞質のそれと非常に異なっていた。Ae. ovata 細胞質をもつパンコムギは出穂が非常に遅れたが, 生育はほぼ正常であった。P 168 とCSを除くすべての系統に対して完全な雄性不稔をひきおこした。また, この細胞質をもつパンコムギでは, 斑入り,無胚種子,半数体は全く観察されなかったが, 時々葯の奇形がみられた。Ae. kotschyi とAe. variabilis の両細胞質の遺伝的特性はほぼ同じであった。これらの細胞質は,パンコムギの出穂や生育に関する形質に対しては影響を及ぼさなかった。しかし, Slm, Splt, Mch の 3 系統において,雄性不稔をひきおこした。また, Tve とSlm に対しては無胚種子を, Slmに対しては半数体や双子を出現させた。Ae. ventricosa細胞質は, すべてのパンコムギに対して何らの遺伝的影響を与えなかった...|$|R

In {{order to determine}} chromosome arm carrying the fertility-restoring gene, telosomic analysis has been carried out. Ditelosomic 1 BL of CS became completely sterile by the cytoplasm of Ae. uniaristata, while ditelosomic 1 BS became male fertile. Thus, {{the location of the}} fertility-restoring gene that was designated as Rfun 1 has been determined to be on the short arm having a nucleolar organizer of chromosome 1 B of CS. In the alloplasmic heterozygote, 1 B/ 1 B- 1 R or 1 B/ 1 BL (hemizygous as to the Rfun 1 gene), the normal 1 B chromosome was preferentially transmitted to diploid offspring through the female gamete. The relationships between the Rfun 1 gene, a nucleolus-organizing region and preferential transmission of chromosome 1 B were discussed. Aegilops uniaristata (2 n= 14,ゲノム式M^uM^u) の細胞質をもつパンコムギの核細胞質雑種を用いて,雄性不稔-稔性回復の関係を調べた。この細胞質は,Slm, Ar, Spltのパンコムギ 3 系統に対して雄性不稔を引きおこした。一方,Tve, P 168, CS, N 26, JF, Sk, S 615, Sphr, Cmpの 9 系統に対しては稔性を正常に回復させた。Ae. uniaristata細胞質に対する稔性回復遺伝子の座乗染色体腕を決定するために,テロソミック分析を行った。Ae. uniaristata細胞質を持つCSのダイテロソミック 1 BLは完全雄性不稔になったのに対して,同じダイテロソミック 1 BSは稔性を回復した。よって,稔性回復遺伝子は,CSの 1 B染色体の仁形成体部位をもつ短腕上に存在することが決定され,Rfun 1 と命名された。この細胞質をもつ正常 1 B染色体と 1 B- 1 R転座染色体あるいは 1 BL染色体とのヘテロ接合体(Rfun 1 遺伝子に関してはヘミ接合体) では, 1 B染色体が卵を通して選択的に伝達された。Rfun 1 遺伝子,仁形成体部位, 1 B染色体の選択的伝達の 3 者の関係について考察を行った...|$|R
