40|$|International audienceAbstract— our {{aim is to}} {{estimate}} the potential of LGT resonators to built oscillators of good stability {{in the short term}} domain. This objective needs two conditions: 1) The manufacturing of high Q-factor resonators with a process similar to that used for high stability quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators.</b> 2) The realization of a scheme of an oven controlled oscillator specifically designed for these resonators. A batch of langatate (LGT) <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators</b> has been manufactured in our laboratory. A satisfying machining and polishing process is now ready. These resonators are optimized in terms of curvature radius and electrode diameter. They are available in an electrode-deposited version {{as well as in the}} electrodeless version, the so-called BVA structure. The energy trapping should still be optimized but here and now good quality factors, closed to 1. 4 106, are achieved for 10 MHz, 5 th overtone resonators. Presently, their motional parameters are quite different from those of quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators.</b> Classic topologies of quartz crystal oscillators are not well suited for LGT <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators.</b> Further, the high thermal sensitivity of LGT <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators</b> (parabolic f-T curve) requires a particular attention on the oven thermal stability. As a consequence, a specific oscillator topology has been designed for an appropriate use of these LGT <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators.</b> Resulting frequency stabilities are described in terms of Allan variance or power spectral density of frequency fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In recent years, {{demand for}} quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators</b> {{continues}} to grow for the mobile phone market. To meet the stringent long-term frequency stability requirement, crystal makers usually use Au as the electrode baseplating material. Using layered electrodes with different metallic materials {{was reported in the}} past for different reasons. In this paper we report our own study of using a sputtered Cr/Ag/Au layered structure for the electrodes of AT-cut quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators</b> with the sole intention of reducing the usage of Au for cost reason. We studied the physical parameter, electrical sheet resistance, of the layers along with thermal processes. The electrical characteristics of finished <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators</b> were compared with those made with the Cr/Au baseplated electrodes and the reliability performance of the crystals with new electrodes also be examined. Preliminary results show that AT-cut quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators</b> with electrodes based on the Cr/Ag/Au layered structure meet the long-term frequency stability requirement for mobile phone application. The electrical characteristics are compatible to the Cr/Au baseplated <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators.</b> The physical characteristics study shows that the Cr/Ag/Au layered structure is stable under related thermal process environments...|$|R

With quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators,</b> {{surface acoustic wave}} devices, and lead zirconate titanate actuators, proteins, cells, and endoscope optics were manipulated. Chapters two through five detail accelerated protein and cell release from planar substrates with quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators</b> and surface acoustic wave devices.

Results demonstrate acoustic wave dissipation into the fluid resting upon the oscillating surface accelerated nonspecific binding removal, while minimally removing bound antigen from antibodies, a common immunoassay challenge. An optimal difference in specific vs. nonspecific protein release rates was found at 100 mW using 5 MHz quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators.</b> Because surface acoustic wave devices produce higher peak fluid velocities, approximately 10 -fold relative to quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators,</b> nonspecific protein and cell release experiments were extended to surface acoustic wave devices.

40|$|International audienceLangasite {{material}} family, {{and more}} particularly the langatate crystal, {{is a very}} good candidate to be an alternative of the quartz crystal in term of material properties for time and frequency applications [1, 2, 3 and 4]. Then, it is interesting to improve ultra-stable oscillators equipped with high-Q langatate <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators</b> and to compare their stability results with those obtained with quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators.</b> Today we do not really know the depth of capabilities in term of noise in the short time domain for oscillators made around langatate <b>crystal</b> <b>resonators.</b> Until now only one LGT oscillator prototype was measured and has achieved an Allan variance stability of σy(τ = 1 s) = 8. 10 ^- 12.

They are used to study thickness-shear vibrations of a rotated Y-cut quartz plate with initial fields resulting from the mechanical, electric, and magnetic fields in the surface films. Frequency shifts caused by the initial fields are calculated and examined.

50|$|Quartz {{crystals}} {{are widely}} used in electronic oscillators to precisely control the frequency produced. The frequency at which a quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonator</b> vibrates depends on its physical dimensions. A change in temperature causes the quartz to expand or contract due to thermal expansion, changing {{the frequency of the}} signal produced by the oscillator. Although quartz has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion, temperature changes are still the major cause of frequency variation in crystal oscillators.|$|E

Cady was president of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1932.|$|E
5000|$|Linear or {{harmonic}} oscillators {{generate a}} sinusoidal waveform. Harmonic oscillators in electronics usually {{consist of a}} resonator with an amplifier that replaces the resonator losses (to prevent the amplitude from decaying) and isolates the resonator from the output (so the load {{does not affect the}} resonator). Some examples of harmonic oscillators are LC-tank oscillators and crystal oscillators. In a voltage-controlled oscillator, a voltage input controls the resonant frequency. A varactor diode's capacitance is controlled by the voltage across the diode. Consequently, a varactor can be used to change the capacitance (and hence the frequency) of an LC tank. A varactor can also change ("pull") the resonant frequency of a <b>crystal</b> <b>resonator.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{oscillator}} crystal has two electrically conductive plates, with a slice or tuning fork of quartz crystal sandwiched between them. During startup, the controlling circuit places the crystal into an unstable equilibrium, {{and due to}} the positive feedback in the system, any tiny fraction of noise is amplified, ramping up the oscillation. The <b>crystal</b> <b>resonator</b> {{can also be seen}} as a highly frequency-selective filter in this system: it only passes a very narrow subband of frequencies around the resonant one, attenuating everything else. Eventually, only the resonant frequency is active. As the oscillator amplifies the signals coming out of the crystal, the signals in the crystal's frequency band becomes stronger, eventually dominating the output of the oscillator. The narrow resonance band of the quartz crystal filters out all the unwanted frequencies.|$|E
50|$|Non-contact atomic force {{microscopy}} (nc-AFM), {{also known}} as dynamic force microscopy (DFM), is a mode of {{atomic force microscopy}}, which itself {{is a type of}} scanning probe microscopy. In nc-AFM a sharp probe is moved close (order of Angstroms) to the surface under study, the probe is then raster scanned across the surface, the image is then constructed from the force interactions during the scan. The probe is connected to a resonator, usually a silicon cantilever or a quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonator.</b> During measurements the sensor is driven so that it oscillates. The force interactions are measured either by measuring the change in amplitude of the oscillation at a constant frequency just off resonance (amplitude modulation) or by measuring the change in resonant frequency directly using a feedback circuit (usually a phase-locked loop) to always drive the sensor on resonance (frequency modulation).|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the quartz watch in 1969 was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at 5 beats per second, it used a quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonator</b> which vibrated at 8,192 Hz, driven by a battery-powered oscillator circuit. In place of a wheel train to add up the beats into seconds, minutes, and hours, it used digital counters. The higher Q factor of the resonator, along with quartz's low temperature coefficient, resulted in better accuracy than the best mechanical watches, while {{the elimination of all}} moving parts made the watch more shock-resistant and eliminated the need for periodic cleaning. The first digital electronic watch with an LED display was developed in 1970 by Pulsar. In 1974 the Omega Marine Chronometer was introduced, the first wrist watch to hold Marine Chronometer certification, and accurate to 12 seconds per year.|$|E

50|$|In modern quartz clocks, {{the quartz}} <b>crystal</b> <b>resonator</b> or {{oscillator}} {{is in the}} shape of a small tuning fork, laser-trimmed or precision lapped to vibrate at 32,768 Hz. This frequency is equal to 215 cycles per second. A power of 2 is chosen so a simple chain of digital divide-by-2 stages can derive the 1 Hz signal needed to drive the watch's second hand. In most clocks, the resonator is in a small can or flat package, about 4 mm long. The reason the 32,768 Hz resonator has become so common is due to a compromise between the large physical size of low frequency crystals for watches and the large current drain of high frequency crystals, which reduces the life of the watch battery. During the 1970s, the introduction of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuits allowed a 12-month battery life from a single coin cell when driving either a mechanical Lavet type stepping motor or a liquid crystal display (in an LCD digital watch). Light-emitting diode (LED) displays for watches have become rare due to their comparatively high battery consumption.|$|E
5000|$|Today, microweighing is one {{of several}} uses of the QCM.Measurements of {{viscosity}} and more general, viscoelastic properties, are of much importance as well. The “non-gravimetric” QCM is by no means an alternative to the conventional QCM. Many researchers, who use quartz resonators for purposes other than gravimetry, have continued to call the quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonator</b> “QCM”. Actually, the term [...] "balance" [...] makes sense even for non-gravimetric applications if it is understood {{in the sense of a}} force balance. At resonance, the force exerted upon the crystal by the sample is balanced by a force originating from the shear gradient inside the crystal. This is the essence of the small-load approximation. Crystalline α-quartz is by far the most important material for thickness-shear resonators. Langasite (La3Ga5SiO14, “LGS”) and gallium-orthophosphate (GaPO4) are investigated as alternatives to quartz, mainly (but not only) for use at high temperatures. [...] Such devices are also called “QCM”, even though they are not made out of quartz (and may or may not be used for gravimetry).|$|E
50|$|A {{quartz crystal}} {{microbalance}} (QCM) measures a mass variation {{per unit area}} by measuring the change in frequency of a quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>resonator.</b> The resonance is disturbed by the addition or removal of a small mass due to oxide growth/decay or film deposition at {{the surface of the}} acoustic resonator. The QCM can be used under vacuum, in gas phase ("gas sensor", first use described by King) and more recently in liquid environments. It is useful for monitoring the rate of deposition in thin film deposition systems under vacuum. In liquid, it is highly effective at determining the affinity of molecules (proteins, in particular) to surfaces functionalized with recognition sites. Larger entities such as viruses or polymers are investigated, as well. QCM has also been used to investigate interactions between biomolecules. Frequency measurements are easily made to high precision (discussed below); hence, it is easy to measure mass densities down to a level of below 1 μg/cm2. In addition to measuring the frequency, the dissipation factor (equivalent to the resonance bandwidth) is often measured to help analysis. The dissipation factor is the inverse quality factor of the resonance, Q−1 = w/fr (see below); it quantifies the damping in the system and is related to the sample's viscoelastic properties.|$|E
