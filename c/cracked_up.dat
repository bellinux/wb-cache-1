5|$|Saidor {{was soon}} in {{use by the}} Fifth Air Force. Its base at Nadzab was {{surrounded}} by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, {{but there was no}} such problem at Saidor. During March, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia. A raid on Hollandia on 16 April 1944 encountered a weather front that closed Nadzab and the other fields in the Markham Valley. More than 30 aircraft made their way to Saidor. An F-5 Lightning and a B-25 Mitchell collided on the runway, and two aircraft <b>cracked</b> <b>up</b> on landing, but the other aircraft that made it to Saidor eventually returned to their bases.|$|E

25|$|Promoted to {{lieutenant}} colonel on 1 March 1942, Carmichael {{was director of}} bombing at Allied Air Forces, Southwest Pacific Area from 26 March 1942 until 7 July 1942, when he became commander of the 19th Bombardment Group. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for another raid on Rabaul on 7 August 1942. This time {{the commander of the}} Allied Air Forces, Major General George Kenney, wanted a maximum effort to support the landing on Guadalcanal. He was hoping for twenty aircraft, but only 16 were operational. One bomber <b>cracked</b> <b>up</b> on takeoff from Port Moresby at 07:30, and two more had to abort with electrical or mechanical problems. The remaining thirteen bombed the target. They were then jumped by fifteen Japanese fighters. Both Carmichael's side gunners were killed, and his airplane was heavily damaged by hostile fire. The oxygen system was knocked out, forcing him to descend to low level. One bomber, flown by Captain Harl Pease was shot down. Kenney nominated Pease, who was later executed by the Japanese, for the Medal of Honor. Kenney was pleased with the results of the raid; he believed, and wrote in this post-war account, that as many as 120 Japanese aircraft might have been destroyed. In fact, damage to the target airfield was superficial, not a single Japanese plane was lost on the ground, and not one fighter was shot down, although a dozen were damaged.|$|E

On November 30, 1928, in Cleveland, Beiderbecke suffered what Lion terms [...] "a severe nervous crisis" [...] and Sudhalter and Evans suggest [...] "was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens", presumably triggered by Beiderbecke's attempt to curb his alcohol intake.

500|$|The {{title track}} is noted {{as having an}} autobiographical aspect, as the {{character}} of Larry (as performed by Zappa himself) sings that the band plays the same song repeatedly because [...] "it sounded good to me". In real life, Zappa said he wrote and played music for himself, his sole intended audience. The song also takes lyrical inspiration from bands playing in bars like The Mothers of Invention once had, and shady record deals Zappa had experienced in the past. In [...] "Joe's Garage", Joe finds that the music industry is [...] "not everything it is <b>cracked</b> <b>up</b> to be".

500|$|As public {{attention}} focused on Maulbetsch as [...] "the greatest line-plunger of a decade," [...] the press could not get enough of Maulbetsch, even interviewing his family. [...] His sister revealed that Maulbetsch had a fondness for home cooking and received permission from the team trainer to eat at his family's Ann Arbor home. [...] "Now, Johnny's sister explains that each day his mother baked two pies for the athlete's supper, and that in addition he had everything else his appetite craved, including coffee." [...] Confronted by reporters about the revelation, Maulbetsch replied: [...] "The story was slightly exaggerated. [...] I rarely ate more than one and one half pies for dinner." [...] Joking references to Maulbetsch's diet continued when it was reported in 1915 that {{he was suffering from}} [...] "acute indigestion." [...] One reporter quipped, [...] "Those much advertised pies of his maw's evidently aren’t as great training dope as they were <b>cracked</b> <b>up</b> to be." [...] It turned out that the indigestion was appendicitis, and Maulbetsch was hospitalized at St. Joseph's Sanitarium in Ann Arbor in April 1915, where he underwent an operation.|$|E

Campbell did, however, write highly of Ellie Kemper, saying that [...] "she's played [...] funnily and warmly as anyone else". Several reviewers argued that the episode functioned as a filler episode. Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review called it the [...] "epitome of filler". ScreenCrush reviewer Damon Houx wrote that [...] "if everyone {{were in the same}} location this would be a bottle episode". Furthermore, Darryl's subplot was mostly criticized. Tedder wrote that while [...] "it's fine to have a story line where someone pursues something and then realizes it wasn't what it was <b>cracked</b> <b>up</b> to be" [...] he wished that the show had actually developed Val as a character. White wrote that she did not enjoy seeing [...] "this manipulative version of Darryl" [...] because it contrasted with his earlier characterization in episodes like [...] "The Deposition".

500|$|Although jams {{had always}} been an {{integral}} aspect of song creation for the Chili Peppers, Blood Sugar Sex Magik saw songs being created with more structure. One specific jam {{would lead to the}} breakout song on the album: Frusciante, Flea and Smith were all playing together—with Kiedis at another part of the room watching—when [...] "...Flea started playing this insane bass line, and Chad <b>cracked</b> <b>up</b> and played along... I always had fragments of song ideas or even specific isolated phrases in my mind. I (Kiedis) took the mic and belted out 'Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now." [...] The philosophy behind the lyrics originated from a conversation Kiedis had with Nina Hagen, regarding selflessness and how insignificant material possessions were in his life. It, thus, gave birth to the song [...] "Give It Away." [...] He'd also been reminiscing about late Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak, composing [...] "My Lovely Man" [...] in his tribute. Kiedis wrote [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy" [...] to be an over-zealous and overly exaggerated version of himself; a figure that could get any woman, and do anything he pleased to them. [...] "The Power of Equality" [...] confronted topics concerning racial equality, prejudice and sexism. Kiedis wrote [...] "I Could Have Lied" [...] to document the brief relationship he had with Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor.|$|E

[...] However, he {{found it difficult to}} entirely reject thousands of alleged tracks, [...] "scattered over 125,000 square miles" [...] (325,000km²) or to dismiss all [...] "the many hundreds" [...] of eyewitness accounts. Napier concluded, [...] "I am convinced that Sasquatch exists, but whether it is all it is <b>cracked</b> <b>up</b> to be is another matter altogether.

2500|$|By his own admission, {{some years}} after the event, Chadwick took the split of The House of Love very badly and succumbed to {{depression}} – [...] "It {{was very hard to}} get out of bed.

[...] Ironically, Chadwick's battles with depression enabled him to better understand why Terry Bickers had left the band, and would eventually lead to a reconciliation between the two. Despite his difficulties, he would make several further attempts at a musical career, going on to form The Madonnas in 1994 (splitting the band in 1995) and subsequently the similarly short-lived, Belgium-based Eyedreams in 1996. Neither bands would release any records. He resurfaced as a solo artist in 1997, releasing one album, 1998's Lazy Soft and Slow.|$|E
