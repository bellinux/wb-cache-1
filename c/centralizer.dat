25|$|The idea is {{that these}} groups have a <b>centralizer</b> of an {{involution}} with a component that is a smaller quasisimple group, which can be assumed to be already known by induction. So to classify these groups one takes every central extension of every known finite simple group, and finds all simple groups with a <b>centralizer</b> of involution with this as a component. This gives a rather large number of different cases to check: there are not only 26 sporadic groups and 16 families of groups of Lie type and the alternating groups, but also many of the groups of small rank or over small fields behave differently from the general case {{and have to be}} treated separately, and the groups of Lie type of even and odd characteristic are also quite different.|$|E

500|$|Paraguay {{was one of}} {{the most}} loosely {{controlled}} parts of the Spanish Empire by the Crown, with a strong independent streak in its leadership. [...] This partially stemmed from a quirk of history in 1537. [...] Shortly after the first settlements on the Rio de la Plata were made, Governor Pedro de Mendoza died. [...] The crown subsequently issued a Royal Decree (...) , which stated that if Mendoza had named a successor, that successor was confirmed as governor. [...] However, if Mendoza had not named a successor - or the successor was dead - a replacement should be [...] "peaceably elected." [...] An election was a unique privilege in Spain's American colonies; historian Adalberto López calls it [...] "strange" [...] as King Charles V was a ruthless <b>centralizer</b> who spent much of his reign curtailing the autonomy of Spain's various holdings, especially since Paraguay was still thought to hold precious metals at the time. [...] A further oddity is that the decree did not limit the use of election to a one-time exigency. [...] The citizens of Paraguay used the decree to elect a governor, and would use it many more times to not merely elect replacement governors, but also to depose disliked appointed governors. [...] The decree of 1537 was used again in 1544 to justify a coup against Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, who had reigned as governor for only two years. [...] Cabeza de Vaca had attempted to control the settlers' abuse of the native Indians, earning him the dislike of many of the colonists. [...] He was arrested, a replacement governor was proclaimed, and he was sent back to Spain in chains with a number of likely false crimes accused of him. [...] Some Paraguayan historians would later attempt to tie this 1544 coup to the Revolt of the Comuneros in Castile from 1520–1521 and call this the [...] "First Revolt of the Comuneros of Paraguay." [...] While Cabeza de Vaca had been part of the royalist forces in that earlier struggle and had helped defeat the Castilian comuneros, it is unlikely that contemporary Paraguayans identified themselves with the Castilian comuneros, according to López. [...] As the plotters hoped to attain legitimacy for their choice of governor in the eyes of the king, identifying themselves with despised rebels would have been counterproductive. [...] Rather, the main contemporary references to the Paraguayans calling themselves comuneros come from sources friendly to Cabeza de Vaca seeking to discredit the coup in the eyes of the king.|$|E
