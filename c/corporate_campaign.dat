25|$|The <b>corporate</b> <b>campaign</b> was {{developed}} to augment, and sometimes supplant, the community campaign. The <b>corporate</b> <b>campaign</b> identified and influenced members of a company's board of directors, or the company lenders, customers and/or suppliers. The goal was to uncover conflicts of interest, inefficiency, waste, fraud, or mismanagement and use this information, either publicly or privately, to win economic leverage over an employer and achieve the union's goals.|$|E

25|$|Again, {{employer}} adaptations {{undercut the}} effectiveness of the <b>corporate</b> <b>campaign.</b> Additionally, labor unions found it less expensive to build community coalitions, and relied more heavily on staff-driven corporate campaigns. Many union activists also argued that the publicity generated by a rowdy shareholder meeting, for example, or an embarrassing report about conflict of interest on a board of directors, supplanted the community campaign by building the necessary community pressure. These arguments proved incorrect. But declining union fortunes (literally) made it difficult to employ the staff and resources necessary to build full-fledged community campaigns. More and more unions came to rely on the <b>corporate</b> <b>campaign</b> even as it became less and less effective.|$|E

25|$|In 2005 and 2006, a major <b>corporate</b> <b>campaign</b> donor to Harris, Mitchell Wade (founder {{of defense}} {{contractor}} MZM), was implicated in several bribery scandals. Wade had bundled together and donated to Harris's campaign $32,000 in contributions from his employees at MZM, Inc., then reimbursed those employees for the contributions. Regarding this issue, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Wainstein said that Harris {{did not appear}} to know the donations were obtained illegally. Harris has maintained she had no personal knowledge that her campaign was given illegal contributions. Wade acknowledged that the donations to the Harris campaign were illegal and were part of an attempt to influence Harris to MZM's benefit.|$|E

25|$|That same year, a <b>corporate</b> <b>campaign</b> {{run by the}} Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC), AFL-CIO, ended {{a six-year}} strike and boycott and won the union its first contract. In 1978, 2,000 FLOC members walked off their jobs in the Midwest. While some growers were willing to negotiate, big canners such as the Campbell Soup Company were unwilling to pay the higher prices which would {{accompany}} a unionized workforce. FLOC initiated a boycott of Campbell's. Six years later, not much had changed. In 1984, FLOC asked Ray Rogers (who had left ACWA and founded a consulting firm that helped unions run comprehensive campaigns) for help. Rogers developed a comprehensive campaign strategy which included a well-publicized demonstration at a Campbell Soup shareholder meeting and targeted three members of Campbell's board of directors for economic pressure. In February 1986, Campbell and its growers recognized FLOC as the workers' representative and signed a collective bargaining agreement which provided for wage increases, grievance resolution, insurance, and committees to study pesticide safety, housing, health care, and day care issues. Shortly thereafter, FLOC reached deals with Vlasic, Heinz, Green Bay Foods (now part of Dean Foods), Aunt Jane's (now part of Dean Foods) and Dean Foods.|$|E
500|$|In {{common with}} Woodrow Wilson, Owen was a {{supporter}} of lowering tariffs. [...] He made an exception for the oil industry, where he argued that protection was needed for small independent producers, {{such as those in}} his state, against the ability of Standard Oil to import large volumes of cheap Mexican oil. Standard Oil was one of several trusts that Owen opposed during the course of his public career. He sought unsuccessfully to strengthen the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. [...] In 1916, he attacked what he described as the [...] "Lumber Trust," [...] which he said had bribed members of the Illinois legislature to elect William Lorimer to the Senate in 1909 (Lorimer's election had been overturned in 1912 due to evidence of [...] "corrupt methods" [...] including vote-buying), and had, Owen said, subsequently retaliated against Owen himself for his role in exposing the Lorimer scandal by funding efforts to defeat his own re-election. [...] Owen made several unsuccessful efforts to mandate effective disclosure of <b>corporate</b> <b>campaign</b> contributions in the interests of open government. [...] He was {{a supporter of}} the Sixteenth Amendment, passed by the Congress in 1909, which allowed the Congress to levy an income tax without apportioning it among the states or basing it on census results; a federal income tax was required inter alia {{to make up for the}} revenues lost to the federal government by reductions in tariff rates.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a methodological and {{epistemological}} {{reflection on the}} power of numbers to contribute to the debate over the potential and limitations of market politics as a regulatory force in the global economy. Informal regulatory networks, including transnational <b>corporate</b> <b>campaigns,</b> form a new sphere of politics which leap-frogs the state and targets corporations directly concerning their social and environmental impacts. I describe my statistical analysis of <b>corporate</b> <b>campaigns</b> targeting US multinationals to argue in favor of analytical generosity when evaluating these new political forms. I argue that a reflexive and critical quantification can provide new insights into stakeholder power and contemporary political processes. ...|$|R

[...] The company's public image began to suffer. FLOC then targeted three members of Campbell's board of directors for economic pressure.

2500|$|But {{other studies}} find that <b>corporate</b> <b>campaigns</b> are too staff-intensive and {{discourage}} member activism. One early {{analysis showed that}} comprehensive campaigns tend to be used only against companies that produce brand-name consumer products or that are service-oriented. These campaigns focus heavily on public pressure to force the employer to recognize the union, and fail to engage rank-and-file workers {{in the development and}} analysis of research, strategizing, campaign implementation and the [...] "ground war." ...|$|R
2500|$|In February 2002, BP's then-chief executive, Lord Browne of Madingley, renounced the {{practice}} of <b>corporate</b> <b>campaign</b> contributions, saying: [...] "That's why we've decided, as a global policy, that from now on we will make no political contributions from corporate funds anywhere in the world." [...] When the Washington Post reported in June 2010 that BP North America [...] "donated at least $4.8 million in corporate contributions {{in the past seven}} years to political groups, partisan organizations and campaigns engaged in federal and state elections", mostly to oppose ballot measures in two states aiming to raise taxes on the oil industry, the company said that the commitment had only applied to contributions to individual candidates.|$|E
2500|$|A third legal {{argument}} is that comprehensive campaigns run afoul {{of federal and state}} RICO statutes, which prohibit racketeering. [...] "Perhaps the most interesting and significant of the predicate acts likely to be present in a <b>corporate</b> <b>campaign</b> is state law blackmail, which is a species of extortion. Indeed, applying RICO to corporate campaigns comes down, in large measure, to understanding the crime of blackmail under state law, and recognizing that—legally speaking—corporate campaigns are, at bottom, a pattern of blackmail." [...] In the Steelworkers' comprehensive campaign against Bayou Steel, the employer filed a federal RICO action which, although settled before a judge had ruled, [...] "forced the union to devote extensive staff and financial resources to defend themselves, distracting attention and energy from the [...] campaign itself." [...] In October 2007, Smithfield Foods filed a RICO suit against UFCW over that union's campaign to organize 4,600 workers, and Wackenhut sued SEIU over a campaign to organize that company's security guards.|$|E
