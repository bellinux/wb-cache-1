Medium-chain free fatty acid (FFA) with carbon chain lengths of C9 to C14. <b>Capric</b> <b>acid</b> (C10:0), undecanoic acid (C11:0) and lauric acid (C12:0) are the most potent described endogeneous agonists of GPR84. Not activated by short-chain and long-chain saturated and unsaturated FFAs induced in monocytes/macrophages by LPS. In addition, the activation of GPR84 in monocytes/macrophages amplifies LPS stimulated IL-12 p40 production in a concentration dependent manner. IL-12 {{plays an important role}} in promoting cell mediated immunity to eradicate pathogens by inducing and maintaining T helper 1 responses and inhibiting T helper 2 responses. Medium chain FFAs inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP production and stimulated 35SGTPgammaS binding in a GPR84-dependent manner. The EC50 values for medium-chain FFAs <b>capric</b> <b>acid,</b> undecanoic acid, and lauric acid at GPR84 (4, 8, and 9 mM, respectively, in the cAMP assay). These results suggest that GPR84 activation by medium-chain FFAs is coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o pathway. Besides medium-chain FFAs diindolylmethane was also described as GPR84 agonist. However, the target selectivity of this molecule is also questionable because diindolylmethane is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulator, too. Interestingly, the patent literature mentions that besides medium chain FFAs other substances as 2,5-Dihydroxy-3-undecyl(1,4)benzoquinon, Icosa-5,8,11,14-tetraynoic acid and 5S,6R-Dihydroxy-icosa-7,9,11,14-tetraenoic acid (5S,6RdiHETE) are also ligands of GPR84. These two latest molecules say against the statement that long chain FFAs are not ligands of GPR84. Based on these results it is probable that besides medium chain FFAs some long chain FFAs can also be endogeneous ligands of GPR84. Further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|Ablating {{lysosomal}} acid lipase (Lal-/-) in mice led to aberrant {{expansion of}} myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) (>40% in the blood, and >70% {{in the bone}} marrow) that arise from dysregulated production of myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Ly6G + MDSCs in Lal-/- mice show strong immunosuppression on T cells, which contributes to impaired T cell proliferation and function in vivo. GPR84 was 9.1 fold upregulated in the MDSCs of Lal-/- mice. GPR84 is normally expressed at low levels in myeloid cells and can be induced in vitro by stimulating macrophage or microglial cells with LPS, TNFα, or PMA. Elevated expression of GPR84 was also observed during the demyelination phase of the reversible Cuprizone-Induced Demyelinating Disease mouse model. Finally, it has also shown that GPR84 expression is increased in both the normal appearing white matter and plaque in brains from human Multiple Sclerosis patients. Expression of GPR84 increases in mouse whole brain samples from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis {{before the onset of}} clinical disease. In cultured microglia in response to simulated blast overpressure the expression of GPR84 was increased 2.9 fold. In ageing TgSwe mice were subjected to traumatic brain injury GPR84 was upregulated by 6.3 fold. GPR84 expression was increased by 49.9 times in M1 type macrophages isolated from aortic atherosclerotic lesions of LDLR-/- mice were fed a western diet. GPR84 is important in regulating the expression of cytokines: CD4+ T cells from GPR84-/- mice show increase IL-4 secretion in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies; GPR84 potentiates LPS-induced IL12p40 secretion in RAW264.7 cells.Recent work by Nagasaki et al. explored 3T3-L1 adipocytes cocultured with RAW264.7 cells to examine this potential interaction. RAW264.7 coculture increases GPR84 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and incubation with <b>capric</b> <b>acid</b> can inhibit TNFα-induced adiponectin release. Adiponectin regulates many metabolic processes associated with glucose and fatty acids, including insulin sensitivity and lipid breakdown. Furthermore, a high-fat diet can increase GPR84 expression. The authors suggest that GPR84 may explain the relationship between diabetes and obesity. As adipocytes release fatty acids in the presence of macrophages, the loop of increased GPR84 expression and its stimulation prevent the release of regulating hormones. The work on GPR84 is still very early and needs to be expanded in the context of pathophysiology and immune regulation. Some people presume the role of GPR84 in food intake too. GPR84 is expressed in the gastric corpus mucosa and this receptor can be an important luminal sensors of food intake and are most likely expressed on entero-endocrine cells, where it stimulates the release of peptide hormones including incretins glucagon-like peptide (GLP) 1 and 2.|$|E

40|$|Cell {{differentiation}} is {{an orderly}} process {{that begins with}} modifications in gene expression. This process is regulated by the acetylation state of histones. Removal of the acetyl groups of histones by specific enzymes (histone deacetylases, HDAC) usually downregulates expression of genes that can cause cells to differentiate, and pharmacological inhibitors of these enzymes {{have been shown to}} induce differentiation in several colon cancer cell lines. Butyrate at high (mM) concentration is both a precursor for acetyl-CoA and a known HDAC inhibitor that induces cell differentiation in colon cells. The dual role of butyrate raises the question whether its effects on HT 29 cell differentiation are due to butyrate metabolism or to its HDAC inhibitor activity. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used a tracer-based metabolomics approach to compare the metabolic changes induced by two different types of HDAC inhibitors (butyrate and the non-metabolic agent trichostatin A) and those induced by other acetyl-CoA precursors that do not inhibit HDAC (caprylic and <b>capric</b> <b>acids).</b> [1, 2 - 13 C 2]-d-glucose was used as a tracer and its redistribution among metabolic intermediates was measured to estimate the contribution of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the Krebs cycle to the metabolic profile of HT 29 cells under the different treatments. The results demonstrate that both HDAC inhibitors (trichostatin A and butyrate) induce a common metabolic profile that is associated with histone deacetylase inhibition and differentiation of HT 29 cells whereas the metabolic effects of acetyl-CoA precursors are different from those of butyrate. The experimental findings support the concept of crosstalk between metabolic and cell signalling events, and provide an experimental approach for the rational design of new combined therapies that exploit the potential synergism between metabolic adaptation and cell differentiation processes through modification of HDAC activity...|$|R

This bacterium affects the digestive system of poultry, reducing {{the growth rate of}} the chickens thereby requiring more time to reach maturity. Antibiotics are often added to poultry feed to help prevent infection and maintain healthy growth. EU legislation banned use of antibiotics for growth promotion on January 1, 2006. Therefore, the industry is looking for viable alternatives.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of saturated and unsaturated fatty <b>acids</b> namely; <b>capric</b> and oleic <b>acid,</b> on the release behavior ofdiclofenac sodium from their binary mixtures, in varying ratios, have been investigated. The possibility ofinteraction {{between the two}} components was explored by serial dilution method, fourier transform-infraredspectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Serial dilution method did not show any change in thespectral pattern, whereas FT-IR study revealed {{significant changes in the}} binary mixtures of diclofenac and fattyacids. Thermal experiments, by DSC provided a better probe into interaction between the two components. Suitable mechanism has been proposed for the changes in the release pattern supported by FT-IR and DSCstudies...|$|R
