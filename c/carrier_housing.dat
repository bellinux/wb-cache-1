5000|$|For the '87+ model, the {{swingarm}} {{design was}} changed to a more [...] "beefy" [...] design after cracking / breaking issues with the 85-86 swingarm design. Clearly, the Suzuki engineers underestimated how hard their customers could ride their product. However, the '87+ swingarm will mount to the 85-86 frame with some other minor equipment swap (i.e. rear shock, link). The '87+ rear axle carrier includes forward-reverse slide chain tensioning rather than the 85-86's rotary tensioning method. The '87+ <b>carrier</b> <b>housing</b> slides forward and reverse and then is {{held in place by}} four vertical bolts and two rear horizontal bolts whereas the 85-86 carrier was held with a clamp or pinch design.|$|E
40|$|In {{casting steel}} for {{offshore}} construction, integral casted structures {{are superior to}} welded structures in terms of preventing fatigue cracks in the stress raisers. In this study, mold design and casting analysis were conducted for integral <b>carrier</b> <b>housing.</b> Casting simulation was used for predicting molten metal flow and solidification during <b>carrier</b> <b>housing</b> casting, {{as well as the}} hot spots and porosity of the designed runner, risers, riser laggings, and the chiller. These predictions were used for deriving the final <b>carrier</b> <b>housing</b> casting plan, and a prototype was fabricated accordingly. A chemical composition analysis was conducted using a specimen sampled from a section of the prototype; the analytically obtained chemical composition agreed with the chemical composition of the existing <b>carrier</b> <b>housing.</b> Tensile and Charpy impact tests were conducted for determining the mechanical material properties. <b>Carrier</b> <b>housing</b> product after normalizing (920 °C/ 4. 5 h, air-cooling) has 371 MPa of yield strength, 582 MPa of tensile strength, 33. 4 % of elongation as well as 64 J (0 °C) of impact energy...|$|E

40|$|A lumped node {{thermal model}} was {{developed}} representing the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump turbine end bearings {{operating in a}} cryogenically cooled bearing tester. Bearing elements, shaft, <b>carrier,</b> <b>housing,</b> cryogen flow characteristics, friction heat, and fluid viscous energy {{are included in the}} model. Heat transfer characteristics for the regimes of forced convection boiling are modeled for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid nitrogen (LN 2). Large temperature differences between the cryogenic fluid and baring contact surfaces require detailed nodal representation in these areas. Internal loads and friction heat are affected by temperature dependent operating clearances requiring iterations between bearing thermal and mechanical models. Analyses indicate a thermal-mechanical coupling resulting in reduced operating clearances, increased loading and heating which can contribute to premature bearing failure. Contact surfaces operate at temperatures above local saturation resulting in vapor rather than liquid in the contacts, precluding possible liquid film lubrication. Elevated temperatures can reduce lubrication, increase friction, and reduce surface hardness supporting a surface failure mode rather than subsurface fatigue...|$|E
40|$|This {{computational}} work investigates {{planetary gear}} load sharing of three-mount suspension wind turbine gearboxes. A three dimensional multibody dynamic model is established, including gravity, bending moments, fluctuating mesh stiffness, nonlinear tooth contact, and bearing clearance. A flexible main shaft, planetary <b>carrier,</b> <b>housing,</b> and gear shafts are modeled using reduced degrees-of-freedom through modal compensation. This drivetrain model is validated against the experimental data of Gearbox Reliability Collaborative for gearbox internal loads. Planet load sharing is a combined effect of gravity, bending moment, bearing clearance, and input torque. Influences {{of each of}} these parameters and their combined effects on the resulting planet load sharing are investigated. Bending moments and gravity induce fundamental excitations in the rotating carrier frame, which can increase gearbox internal loads and disturb load sharing. Clearance in carrier bearings reduces the bearing load carrying capacity and thus the bending moment from the rotor can be transmitted into gear meshes. With bearing clearance, the bending moment can cause tooth micropitting and can induce planet bearing fatigue, leading to reduced gearbox life. Planet bearings are susceptible to skidding at low input torque...|$|E

500|$|Officially, the {{recorded}} death toll {{of the first}} week of January 1923 was eight people (six black and two white). Historians disagree about this number.

Minnie Lee Langley, who was in the <b>Carrier</b> <b>house</b> siege, recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house. [...] Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave filled with black people; one remembers a plow brought from Cedar Key that covered 26 bodies.
