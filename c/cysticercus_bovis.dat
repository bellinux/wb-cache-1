It {{was believed to be}} a different organism from the adult tapeworm (Taenia solium), but still closely related to tapeworms for their similarly-looking scolex. Hence, it was given a proper scientific name Taenia cellulosae in 1800 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin. At the same time another German Johann Zeder had created a new genus Cysticercosis for a dog tapeworm. This genus was accepted for all bladder worms of Taenia. It became a tradition to refer to the larva of Taenia solium as Cysticercus cellulosae, that of beef tapeworm (T. sanginata) as <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>bovis,</b> that of sheep tapeworm (T. ovis) as Cysticercus ovis, that of ruminant tapeworm (T. krabbei) as Cysticercus tarandi, and that of the dog tapeworm (T. crassiceps) as Cysticercus longicollis. Even though, this system of naming is now scientifically unacceptable, it is still widely used, particularly for description of the infections by the different species.|$|E
50|$|Cattle {{acquire the}} embryonated eggs, the oncospheres, when they eat {{contaminated}} food. Oncospheres enter the duodenum, the anterior {{portion of the}} small intestine, and hatch there {{under the influence of}} gastric juices. The embryonic membranes are removed, liberating free hexacanth ("six-hooked") larvae. With their hooks, they attach to the intestinal wall and penetrate the intestinal mucosa into the blood vessels. The larvae can move to all parts of the body by the general circulatory system, and finally settle in skeletal muscles within 70 days. Inside the tissue, they cast off their hooks and instead develop a protective cuticular shell, called the cyst. Thus, they become fluid-filled cysticerci. Cysterci can also form in lungs and liver. The inner membrane of the cysticercus soon develops numerous protoscolices (small scolices) that are invertedly attached to the inner surface. The cysticercus of T. saginata is specifically named <b>cysticercus</b> <b>bovis</b> to differentiate from that of T. solium, cysticercus cellulosae.|$|E

Material and Methods: A cross sectional active abattoir survey, which involves both ante mortem and post mortem examinations, was conducted on 745 cattle from October 2012 to April 2013, and two years (September 2010 - September 2012) retrospective data on meat inspection records was also collected. Results: During ante mortem examination, in 114 (15. 3 %) cattle various types of abnormalities were detected include; lacrimation (3. 49 %), pale mucus membrane (3. 09 %), nasal discharge (1. 88 %), hernia (1. 48 %), actinomycosis (1. 34 %), salivation (1. 74 %), lameness (0. 54 %), emaciation (0. 41 %), depression (0. 41 %), blindness (0. 41 %), local swelling (0. 27 %) and rough hair coat (0. 27 %). Postmortem examination revealed that 131 (17. 58 %) liver, 61 (8. 19 %) lungs, 9 (1. 21 %) kidneys and 2 (0. 27 %) hearts were condemned due to various causes. Fasciolosis (9. 26 %) was the main cause of liver condemnation followed by hydatid cyst (3. 62 %) and <b>cysticercus</b> <b>bovis</b> (2. 55 %), respectively. The major causes of lung condemnation were hydatid cyst, emphysema and pneumonia accounting for 5. 1, 1. 61 and 1. 07 %, respectively.

This method of diagnosis {{is based on a}} visual examination, leading to a significant underestimation of the prevalence and also of consequences on human health as well. The present study tries to identify risks in cattle keeping systems and environmental conditions and tries also to find out factors which minimize the risk of the occurrence of <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>bovis.</b> For that a questionnaire was developed. 38 ecologically run cattle farms were visited and data collected. In 11 of these farms Taenia saginata had occurred before. The farms under examination were dairy farms, mother cow farms and also mixed farms. The collected operation data were statistically examined using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23 program statistically (determination of frequencies, crosstabs, Chi-squared tests, Odds ratios, resume of selected variables and logistic regression). With the method of Cluster analysis (Spearmans rank correlation coefficient, distance measure, merger algorithm by using the Ward procedure and Scree-Plot) farm structures were identified and served as a base for identifying farms of similar structure and categorizing them. Veterinary farm service was identified as a risk-minimizing factor for the occurrence of <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>bovis</b> (p value: 0, 031). After that an investigation was carried out into possible correlations between other factors or structures and the veterinary farm service. The use of hygiene rules and cleaning of stables (well-swept) turned out to be significant factors correlating with veterinary farm service. A prophylactic use of antiparasitic agents {{did not seem to be}} significant, but in mathematical term, farms with veterinary farm service applied antiparasitic agents significantly more frequently. The cluster analysis showed similar farm structures and environmental conditions in some farms. These clusters were investigated for cysticerci: In cluster 1 14, 3 % cysticerci, in cluster 2 50 % cysticerci, in cluster 3 30 % cysticerci and in cluster 4 0 % cysticerci were found. Main characteristics of cluster 2 were inter alia a higher risk in the areas of tourism and water reservoirs, main characteristics of cluster 4 were a lower risk in terms of flooded areas and storage of dung. A general analysis of similiar farms including work practices, structures of hygiene and determination of medical data (cysticerci found in cattle holding farms, taeniosis in humans) could serve as a base for determining farms which are in principle at risk and as a base for expanding the traditional post mortem examination. This base could be used to work together with the human medicine in order to use existing data in a new way, to combine data in veterinary and human medicine, to create a new data interconnected system or to come to a data exchange system. New outbreaks of cysticercosis and taeniosis could be recorded immediately and farms exposed to higher risks could be identified and be treated preventively under cooperation with the respective veterinarian. In cooperation with veterinary farm service a risk based identification of farms at risk could serve as a supplement to the visual meat inspection as traditionally practised today...|$|E

At the same time, 16 steers aged 8 to 16 months (8 Bos indicus and 8 Bos taurus), were closed in and given one of each type of water to drink (4 to each water source) for seven fifteen day periods. On day zero all the animals were treated with ivermectin (at a dosage of 200 mg/Kg) and were randomly separated in two groups (one for each water source). The experimental cattle came from farms supposedly free of cysticercosis and underwent clinical and laboratorial testing to detect the presence of this parasite before the beginning and at regular intervals during the experiment. After the seven fifteen day period, the 16 steers were slaughtered and were inspected by the “Serviço de Inspeção Federal – SIF” (Federal Inspection Service). Blood and tissue samples were taken from all animals for laboratorial testing. a) the bacteriological tests revealed that the water from the well, classified as drinking water, had fecal coliform levels compatible to the classification as “drinking water” (CONAMA 20), but the water from the brook “Cerradinho” was classified as polluted in all samples; b) the samples taken during the 15 weeks all showed the presence of eggs of Cestode (Taenia and Hymenolepis) and Nematode (Ascaris, Trichuris, Capillaria and Ancylostomidae) helminthes; c) while one of eight steers given drinking water from the well was infected with <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>bovis,</b> four of the eight that drank water from the Cerradinho brook were infected; d) although the parasitological tests showed the presence of helminth eggs of Taenia genus, the finding of one animal with positive serum and another with the parasite embedded in its muscle, both from the group that drank the well water, suggest that theses animals were infected at the farm before the beginning of the experiment; e) the serological tests were negative for Leptospira spp, Brucella spp, Neospora canimum and Toxoplasma gondii, indicating that these pathogens were not transmitted to the animals. Laboratorial tests with mice, to verify the presence of Toxoplasma gondii, confirmed the serological tests; f) the results obtained by the serology tests and those of the Federal Inspection Service showed only 6. 25 % of agreement...|$|E
40|$|From a {{total of}} 32 717 cattle slaughtered, 183 whole carcass condemnations were {{attributable}} to 9 diseases and conditions, namely, tuberculosis (TB), cysticercosis, emaciation, generalised lymphadenitis, jaundice, abscesses, moribund, sarcosporidiosis and odour. Bovine TB {{was the most important}} cause of condemnations (152 / 183, 83. 1 %). Bovine cysticercosis and sarcosporidiosis accounted for 5 / 183 (2. 7 %) and 8 / 183 (4. 4 %), respectively, while each of the remaining conditions contributed less. Among the many conditions responsible for offal / organ condemnations were fascioliasis, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, hydatidosis and TB. In terms of number and weight, Fasciola gigantica infections made livers and lungs the most condemned offals (20. 1 % and 0. 7 %, respectively). Hydatidosis was the cause of 0. 9 %lung and 0. 1 %liver losses. <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>bovis</b> contributed to only 0. 05 %of all inspected tongues, hearts, and heads. TB was very rare in heads (0. 01 %). The financial impact of whole carcasses and offals condemned during the study period was enormous and deprived livestock farmers of the much needed revenue and consumers of protein sources. Much or all of the condemned material that could have been useful was wasted by not being retrieved for conversion to processed meat, bone meal or pet food.

Of the cysts obtained, 58. 35 % (416 / 713) were dead and 41. 65 % (297 / 713) were alive. The differences among anatomical sites and cysts status were significant (p< 0. 05). Of the 416 dead cysts 253, characterized by nodular firm whitish lesions, containing yellowish material, some times in calcareous aspect were examined for histopathology. The histological exams of these cysts yielded granulomatous lesions, whose centers were characterized by caseous and/or calcareous material, multinucleate giant cells, histiocytes in palisade and infiltrate composed predominantly by lymphoid cells, wrapped up by fibrosis. Some times the lesions peripheries had granulation tissue and mineralized areas, like linear blade. The parasite debris were like a hyaline, non cellular material with spherical and ovoid, basophilic, eosinophilic and colorless corpuscles. These corpuscles were seen rarely, some times, among inflammatory reaction. Fibrous nodules, rich in lymphoid or mixed infiltrates, were frequently seen.

Those that have been studied in any detail have been those of importance to veterinary and human medicine. The application of biotechnology {{to the study of}} taeniids has been gaining momentum in recent years. Research has been done to improve the diagnosis of larval taeniid infections, especially cysticercosis. There have been improvements in serologic testing using refined and purified antigens readily available from one species to detect antibodies of another. (Taenia hydatigena antigens are used to detect <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>bovis</b> and Cysticercus cellulosae). The use of Western blots of tapeworm antigens (T. solium, T. crassiceps, Echinococcus granulosus) {{has been shown to be}} effective in neurocysticercosis and hydatid diseases. Studies with monoclonal antibodies have also been found to be of interest. Anti-oncospheral monoclonal antibodies have been developed to distinguish eggs of E. granulosis from other taeniid eggs. In another study, monoclonal antibodies from oncospheres of T. saginata conferred protection against oral infections with T. saginata eggs in calves. Other investigators reported vaccines against Cysticercus fasciolaris by a T. taeniaeformis antigen expressed in Escherichia coli. Studies on DNA have been gaining momentum. DNA-based techniques have been used to detect inter- and intraspecific variations in Echinococcus and to characterize isolates of E. granulosus. DNA probes in Southern blot analysis have been used to discriminate taeniid species. Taenia saginata in the Far East has become an enigma. Although the parasite is morphologically T. saginata, the definitive host for the parasite is not clear. Studies have shown the pig to be a possible intermediate host with larval development similar to T. solium, but in pig liver rather than muscle. In recent comparative studies with T. saginata- worms from Taiwan and classical T. saginata, differences have been detected in DNA hybridization patterns. </p...|$|E

This study aimed to identify prevention and control measures for bovine cysticercosis indicated by experts {{in the fields of}} public and animal health. The study was conducted through three rounds of the Delphi method and had the participation of 44 experts from 13 Brazilian states in 30 educational institutions, research institutions, and sanitary inspection services. The first round comprised an open question, the answers to which formed the basis for structuring the second and third questionnaire. To reach a consensus {{in the second and third}} rounds, experts were asked to express their agreement or disagreement of each proposition on the questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed at the end of each round. Twenty-three specialists (52. 27 %) participated in all three rounds. The first round resulted in 28 proposals categorized into six areas: health education, methods of diagnosis and treatment, sanitation measures, epidemiological studies, legislation and sanitary supervision, and intersectorality.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the causes of condemnations of whole and partial carcasses and organs of cattle slaughtered at private abattoirs in Ethiopia. A total of 62, 917 cattle slaughtered at Abergelle, Elfora Bishoftu and Elfora Kombolcha abattoirs from February 2010 to November 2013 were used for the study. The main causes of condemnations of whole carcasses were poor bleeding (0. 11 %), abscess (0. 06 %), adhesion (0. 04 %), TB (0. 03 %), pneumonia (0. 01 %), <b>Cysticercus</b> <b>bovis</b> (0. 01 %) and bruising (0. 01 %). Prevalence of abscesses, TB and C. bovis were significantly (p< 0. 0001) different between abattoirs. Main causes of partial condemnations of carcasses were bruising (34. 11 %), poor bleeding (25. 59 %), contamination (12. 58 %) and adhesion (9. 37 %). The prevalence of these problems were significantly (p< 0. 0001) different between years, abattoirs and season. The main causes of condemnations of liver was faciola (29. 74 %) while lungs were mainly condemned due to H. cyst (23. 01 %) and pneumonia (22. 68). The main causes of condemnations of kidneys, hearts, tongue and spleens were nephritis (10. 91 %), poor bleeding (20. 83 %), abscess (4. 71 %) and splenitis (2. 74 %), respectively while heads were condemned mainly due to poor bleeding (18. 77 %) and bruising (17. 05 %).

The disease is endemic in many African and Mediterranean countries including the Sudan. The objective {{of the present study}} was to develop and evaluate a real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for simple and rapid detection of CE in humans and domestic live stock in Sudan. A set of six LAMP primers, designed from the mitochondrial NADH- 1 gene of EG cattle strain of genotype 5 (G 5), was used as a target for LAMP assay. The assay was performed at a constant temperature (63 °C), with a real-time follow-up using a LightCycler and fluorochrome dye. Following amplification cycles in a simple water bath, LAMP products were observed for color change by naked eye and were visualized under UV light source using agarose gel electrophoresis. The real-time LAMP assay identified a variety of hydatid cysts strains recovered in the Sudan, including Echinococcus canadenses (G 6) and Echinococcus ortleppi (G 5). Real-time LAMP positive results were detected by the presence of an amplification curve, whereas negative results were indicated by absence of fluorescence detection. Positive LAMP results appeared as a bluish-colored reaction as observed by naked eye, whereas negative LAMP results were observed as purple-colored reaction. The sensitivity studies indicated that the LAMP assay detected as little as a 10 fg of parasite DNA. There was 100 % agreement between results of the LAMP assay and our previously described nested PCR when testing 10 -fold serial dilution of DNA extracted from EG-complex hydatid cyst. However, there was no cross-reactivity with other parasites including <b>cysticercus</b> <b>bovis,</b> Fasciola gigantica, and Schistosoma bovis and nucleic acid free samples. The developed LAMP assay would be expected to prove highly significant in epidemiological surveys of CE in developing countries or areas of resource-poor settings for both ease of use and cos...|$|E

Data was collected from Abergelle, Adama, Elfora Bishoftu, Elfora Kombolcha, Elfora Melgawendo, Hawassa, and Mekelle local and export abattoirs {{which include a}} total of 88, 299 cattle. The study indicated that management practices at the abattoirs contribute to the poor quality of carcasses. The average carcass weight at the local abattoirs was 135. 90 + 0. 69 kg. Carcass weight was significantly (p< 0. 001) different between abattoirs, season, conformation grades, fat grades and categories of cattle. Superior conformation and fat grades were lower for cows and castrated bulls compared to other categories of cattle. The average live weight, carcass weight and dressing percentage at the export abattoirs were 241. 41 + 0. 37 kg, 106. 93 + 0. 21 kg and 44. 21 + 0. 05 %, respectively. Live weight, carcass weight and dressing percentage were significantly (p< 0. 001) differ between abattoirs, season and breeds. Average meat yield and yield percentage were 61. 56 + 0. 94 kg and 67. 81 + 0. 33 %, respectively. Meat yield and weight of primal meat cuts were significantly (p< 0. 001) different between breeds of cattle. Only 31. 13 % of total carcasses sampled had an acceptable ultimate pH of 5. 4 - 5. 7. 170 whole carcasses, 52, 437 partial carcasses {{and a number of}} organs were condemned {{out of a total of}} 62, 917 cattle slaughtered. The main causes of condemnations of carcasses and organs were poor bleeding, bruising, contamination, abscess, hydatid cyst, pneumonia, nephritis, pericarditis and <b>cysticercus</b> <b>bovis.</b> The financial loss due to condemnation of carcasses and organs at one of the abattoirs was about 771, 666. 9 ETB (38, 953. 40 USD). From this study it was concluded that main factors that affected carcass quality of cattle in Ethiopia were poor management practices at the abattoirs, very low level of carcass fat, low proportion of carcass with desired pH for acceptable conversion of muscle to meat and higher level of condemnations of carcasses and organs. It is therefore recommended that developing law governing abattoirs operation, implementing good management program at abattoirs, proper feeding of cattle before slaughter and proper handling of cattle during transport will improve the quality of carcasses in Ethiopia.
