40|$|There are {{important}} differences between reasoning with <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> and reasoning with moral fundamental rights.

In his book A Theory of <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Rights,</b> Robert Alexy develops a comprehensive conception of <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights,</b> his central thesis being that they are optimization requirements and, as such, necessarily open to balancing.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the {{protective}} function of <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> {{as compared to the}} traditional defensive function. Whereas the defensive function of <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> requires that the state does not interfere with and respect the <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> of the individual, the protective function requires the state to act to promote and protect <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights.</b> The problematic is examined primarily through the case-law of three foreign supreme jurisdictions, i. e. the Supreme Court of the United States of America, the Federal Constitutional Court of the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Court of Human Rights. In the broader perspective the thesis aims to assess the approach taken by the Czech Constitutional Court in relation to this problematic. The protective function of <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> is explored through the perspective of the individual and through the perspective of the system. The thesis is divided into four chapters. In the first chapter, the author clarifies fundamental theoretical concepts used in the thesis. The positive and negative concept of <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> is closely connected to the two concepts of freedom as developed by I. Berlin in his famous essay Two Concepts of Freedom.

5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} civil partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the <b>constitutional</b> <b>right</b> to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a civil partnership or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex civil partnership aspect of the Act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.|$|E
5|$|The Convention met from February 3 – December 6, 1861, {{and elected}} John Janney its {{presiding}} officer. The majority at first voted {{to remain in}} the Union, but stayed in session awaiting events. At first, the speeches were mixed between Secessionists advocating leaving the Union, Conditional Unionists holding onto the patriotism of earlier times, and Unconditional Unionists insisting that secession was bad policy and unlawful. On March 4, Abraham Lincoln’s inauguration day, Jefferson Davis called up 100,000 militia to serve a year and sent besieging troops to surround Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Fort Pickens in Florida. That same day Waitman T. Willey from trans-Alleghany Monongalia County answered secessionists with a Unionist speech.

5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his <b>constitutional</b> <b>right</b> to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This Article {{evaluates the}} widely held view that American <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> {{jurisprudence}} is exceptional.  Its thesis {{is that while}} the conventional wisdom is largely correct about the content of a few specific <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights,</b> it is largely wrong about the more general structure of <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights.</b>  The perceived exceptionalism of this structure is threefold.   First, the United States has a more categorical conception of <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> than other countries.  Second, the reach of <b>constitutional</b> <b>rights</b> into the sphere of private conduct is less than elsewhere.   Third, the United States rejects the types of positive constitutional rights―including social and economic rights―recognized by many other modern constitutions.   Once labels and assumptions are set aside, I aim to show that on each of these structural issues, far from occupying a comparatively extreme and lone position as is generally thought, the U. S. approach is actually well within the contemporary constitutional mainstream. Finally, I explain why debunking the myth of American structural exceptionalism matters. comparative law; fundamental/human rights; German Constitutional Court...|$|R

5|$|The Macedonian {{hereditary}} monarchy existed {{since at}} least the time of Archaic Greece, perhaps evolving from a tribal system, and with roots in Mycenaean Greece in view of its seemingly Homeric aristocratic attributes. Thucydides wrote that in previous ages Macedonia was divided into small tribal regions each having their own petty king, the tribes of Lower Macedonia eventually coalescing under one great king who exercised power as an overlord over the lesser kings of Upper Macedonia. The Argead dynasty lasted from the reign of Perdiccas I of Macedon until that of Alexander IV of Macedon, supplanted by the Antigonid dynasty during the Hellenistic period. The direct line of father-to-son succession was broken after the assassination of Orestes of Macedon in 396 BC (allegedly by his regent and successor Aeropus II of Macedon), clouding the issue of whether primogeniture was the established custom or if there was a <b>constitutional</b> <b>right</b> for an assembly of the army or of the people to choose another king. It is also unclear whether certain male offspring were considered more legitimate than others, since Archelaus I of Macedon was the son of Perdiccas II of Macedon and a slave woman, although Archelaus succeeded the throne after murdering his father's designated heir apparent and son from another mother.|$|E
