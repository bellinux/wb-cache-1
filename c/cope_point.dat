40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{study of}} stress and <b>coping</b> <b>points</b> to two {{concepts}} central {{to an understanding of}} the response to trauma: approach and avoidance. This pair of concepts refers to two basic modes of coping with stress. Approach and avoidance are simply metaphors for cognitive and emotional activity that is oriented either toward or away from threat. An approach-avoidance model of coping is presented in the context of contemporary theoretical ap-proaches to coping. The research literature on coping ef-fectiveness, including evidence from our laboratory, is dis-cussed, and speculations are made about he implications for future research. The study {{of stress and}} coping has become quite popular in recent years, particularly in regard to traumatic life events. Although the area is broad and the coping proces...|$|R

The species name means [...] "fate" [...] or [...] "destiny", but it is thought Leidy intended it to mean [...] "fatal". In an 1880 article about extinct American cats, American paleontologist Edward Drinker <b>Cope</b> <b>pointed</b> out that the F.fatalis molar was identical to that of Smilodon, and he proposed the new combination S.fatalis.

Using a phenomenological approach, data for the qualitative analysis were provided by three children-centered focus group discussions, consisting of 17 children, with an age range of 8 to 18 years, and two adult-centered focus group discussions, consisting of 11 adults. A Zoomerang© web-based survey of 422 children provided data for the quantitative analysis. ^ Structural equation modeling {{was used to assess}} the impact of deployment on children of National Guard and Reserves and the mediating role of support systems on the psychosocial adjustment of the children. Support systems were found as strong mediating mechanisms between deployment stressors, child coping and child psychosocial adjustment. The absence of a support system was found to increase child internal and external psychosocial adjustment. Poor coping skills were also found to lead to increased psychosocial adjustment. ^ Results from the qualitative analysis revealed that family members were the most immediate and effective support system available to them. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed that OMK was an important support system in coping and adjusting to deployment stressors. Children qualitatively recognized the role of the OMK Program in helping to alleviate their stress. The study also showed that in addition to social support programs that address children 2 ̆ 7 s needs, “suddenly military children” are in need of interventions that specifically address the development of effective coping skills. Their use of books, going to the mall, and listening to music were <b>coping</b> <b>points</b> that children mentioned in the qualitative result for which programs planned to address children 2 ̆ 7 s coping skills should incorporate. ^ Results also showed that the OMK Program continued to provide the expected services to “suddenly military children” and the general public in Indiana in the areas that were considered the primary focus of the program. While the Hero Pack and the Speak Out for Military Kids were considered as very useful by the children in creating community awareness of their changed circumstances, the Mobile Technology Lab was singled out as the most successful in connecting the children with their loved ones deployed overseas.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Behavioral {{interaction}} during {{social situations}} is {{a continuum of}} action, response, and reaction. The temporal nature of social interaction creates a series of stressful situations, such as aggression, displace-ment from resources, and the variable psychological challenge of adapting to dynamic social hierarchies. The {{ebb and flow of}} neurochemical and endocrine secretions during social stress provide a unique tool for understanding individualized responses to stress. Each social station is an adaptive response to a stressful social condition, resulting in unique neuroendocrine and behavioral responses. By examining the temporal changes of limbic monoamines and plasma glucocorticoids, aspects of mechanisms for adaptation emerge. The similarity of temporal patterns induced by social stress among fish, reptiles and primates are remark-able. Even different specific <b>coping</b> mechanisms <b>point</b> out the similarity of vertebrate stress responses. The lizard Anolis carolinensis exhibits a unique sign stimulus generated during social stress by the sympathetic nervous system that serves as a temporal landmark to distinguish neuroendocrine patterns. During social interaction dominant males have a shorter latency to eyespot darkening than opponents, inhibiting aggressive display. Eyespot coloration can be delayed using a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, causing dominant social status in many animals to be lost. Reversal of social status via serotonergic activation appears to mimic chronic serotonergic activity. The pattern of eyespot darkening, faster in dominant males, is coincident wit...|$|R

5000|$|During the 1830s, Danish naturalist Peter Wilhelm Lund and {{his assistants}} {{collected}} fossils in the calcareous caves near {{the small town}} of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Among the thousands of fossils found, he recognized a few isolated cheek teeth as belonging to a hyena, which he named Hyaena neogaea in 1839. After more material was found (including canine teeth and foot bones), Lund concluded the fossils instead belonged to a distinct genus of felid, though transitional to the hyenas. He stated it would have matched the largest modern predators in size, and was more robust than any modern cat. Lund originally wanted to name the new genus Hyaenodon, but realizing this had recently become preoccupied by another prehistoric predator, he instead named it Smilodon populator in 1842. He explained the Ancient Greek meaning of Smilodon as [...] (smilē), a scalpel or two-edged knife, and [...] (odoús), tooth. This has also been translated as [...] "tooth shaped like double-edged knife". He explained the species name populator as [...] "the destroyer", which has also been translated as [...] "he who brings devastation". By 1846, Lund had acquired nearly every part of the skeleton (from different individuals), and more specimens were found in neighboring countries by other collectors in the following years. Though some later authors used Lund's original species name neogaea instead of populator, it is now considered an invalid nomen nudum ("naked name"), as it was not accompanied with a proper description and no type specimens were designated. Some South American specimens have been referred to other genera, subgenera, species, and subspecies, such as Smilodontidion riggii, Smilodon (Prosmilodon) ensenadensis, and S. bonaeriensis, but these are now thought to be junior synonyms of S. populator.Fossils of Smilodon were discovered in North America from {{the second half of the}} 19th century onwards.

The diagnosis and presence of a chronic disease may be considered a difficult and stressful situation in life, {{a situation in which}} coping mechanisms are psychological processes developed at a conscious level to manage these situations. This study aimed to explore the possible relationship between the dominance of one of the four major coping styles and adherence to diabetes-related self-care activities (DRSCAs) in the population of patients with type 2 DM (T 2 DM). In a cross-sectional consecutive-case population-based study design, 126 patients previously diagnosed with T 2 DM were enrolled. Coping mechanisms were evaluated using the Cope scale inventory, which identifies the dominant coping mechanism: problem-, emotion-, social support-, or avoidance-focused. The quality of DRSCA was evaluated using the summary of diabetes self-care activities questionnaire, in which a higher score was associated with improved adherence. In the study cohort, 45 patients (35. 7 %) had problem-focused coping, 37 (29. 4 %) had emotion-focused coping, 32 (25. 4 %) social support-focused coping, and 12 (9. 5 %) had avoidance-focused coping. Patients with emotion-focused coping had the highest level (P= 0. 02) of DRSCA (median 44 points), followed by patients with social support-focused <b>coping</b> (median 40 <b>points)</b> and problem-focused <b>coping</b> (median 36 <b>points),</b> while patients with avoidance-focused coping had the lowest SDSCA total score (33 points).

Although most associations were weak and only a minority of the multiple possible associations tested was supported in each study, all studies (but one) reported at least one significant association between attachment and emotion regulation or <b>coping.</b> The evidence <b>pointed</b> to the regulatory and coping problems of toddlers showing signs of ambivalent attachment or the benefits of secure (relative to insecure) attachment for toddlers, children, and adolescents.

This study is concerned with the latter: in a system of a million cores, it is unrealistic to expect 100 % functionality on power-up; equally, operational availability degrades with time. Monitoring and maintaining the health of such a system using traditional techniques is costly, and most rely on the concept of some sort of central overseer or monitor to make a final judgement about system availability, giving a single point of failure. Large systems of the future will consist of hardware and software that work synergistically to <b>cope</b> with isolated <b>points</b> of failure, allowing the gross behaviour of the system to degrade gracefully and in a meaningful way in the face of faults.

Towards the end of the season, Mayfield left to drive for Michael Kranefuss, whose previous driver John Andretti moved to the 98, finishing fifth at Martinsville Speedway. Andretti won the pole at Talladega again in 1997, and at the Pepsi 400, he led 113 laps and won Yarborough's only race as a car owner.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} and validation of a coupled two- and one-dimensional finite-element model for the Scheldt tributaries, river, estuary and region of fresh water influence (ROFI). The hydrodynamic equations are solved on a single, unstructured, multi-scale mesh stretching from the shelf break to the Scheldt tributaries. The tide is forced on the shelf break and propagates upstream in the riverine network. Upstream boundaries lie on sluices or outside of the region of tidal dominance where daily averaged discharges are imposed. Two-dimensional, depth-averaged shallow water equations are solved {{by means of the}} discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method over the marine and estuarine parts of the computational domain. In the rivers, however, one-dimensional equations are dealt with using the DG method {{with the addition of a}} technique to <b>cope</b> with confluence <b>points.</b> Model parameters are carefully calibrated, leading to the simulation of wind- and tide-forced flows that are in excellent agreement with available data. The diffusivity in the transport equation is calibrated using time series of salinity at various locations in the estuary. Finally, the Lagrangian residual transport in the estuary and the adjacent coastal zone is investigated. This work is a major step towards an integrated model for studying the dynamics of waterborne contaminants and the water renewal timescales in the Scheldt land-sea continuum. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

500|$|The various {{alternatives}} to Darwinian evolution {{by natural selection}} were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope {{is a case in}} <b>point.</b> <b>Cope,</b> a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in embryology and palaeontology. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, [...] "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop {{at the expense of the}} rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism. Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.|$|R
40|$|Background : Despite {{national}} and international policies to develop social capital in disaster-affected communities, empiric evidence on the association between social capital and disaster mental health is limited and ambiguous. Objective : The study explores the relationship between social capital and disaster mental health outcomes (PTSD, anxiety, and depression) in combination with individual factors (appraisal, coping behavior, and social support). Design : This is a community-based cross-sectional study in a flood-affected town in northern England. The study {{is part of the}} MICRODIS multi-country research project that examines the impact of natural disasters. It included 232 flood-affected respondents. Results : The findings showed that a considerable part of the association between cognitive and structural social capital and mental health is exerted through individual appraisal processes (i. e. property loss, primary and secondary appraisal), social support, and coping behavior. These individual factors were contingent on social capital. After the inclusion of individual characteristics, cognitive social capital was negatively related to lower mental health problems and structural social capital was positively associated to experiencing anxiety but not to PTSD or depression. Depression and anxiety showed a different pattern of association with both components of social capital. Conclusions : Individual oriented stress reducing interventions that use appraisal processes, social support, and <b>coping</b> as starting <b>points</b> could be more effective by taking into account the subjective experience of the social context in terms of trust and feelings of mutual support and reciprocity in a community. Findings indicate that affected people may especially benefit from a combination of individual stress reducing interventions and psychosocial interventions that foster cognitive social capital...|$|R
40|$|COPE {{is one of}} the {{state-based}} public {{parent education}} programs carried on in Sweden with an aim to prevent the behavioral problems of young children. This study is a qualitative research to examine {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} <b>COPE</b> from the <b>point</b> of view of parents and educators. The study has an intercultural perspective and intends to assess if the cognitive-behavioral education can lead to the empowerment of parents. Semi-structured interviews are used to gather information. Empowerment and Cognitive-behavioral theories are used to analyze the findings of this study. According to the findings, meeting other parents with the same problems and learning the behavioral means to create the desired behavior and extinguish the undesired ones are the first strong points of the program according to parents and educators. They also mentioned that gaining self confidence, self control and anger control, as well as learning to behave rationally and according to the correct models are the results of this education. The most important barrier for the application of COPE is a cultural aspect. The Swedish society is not comfortable with the usage of material means of encouragement and punishment according to my informants. Low participation of parents both in the sessions and discussions is another problem. Individual empowerment both for parents and educators are achieved in COPE according to the interviews. Parents reported being more secure and in control in relation to children after taking part in COPE. Despite my earlier experiences of family education programs in Iran, reports about social empowerment is lacking in the Swedish context. Meanwhile, parents and educators had some suggestions to improve the program most importantly about social empowerment of parents...|$|R
