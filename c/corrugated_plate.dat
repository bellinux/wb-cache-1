50|$|To achieve {{improvement}} in PHE's, two important factors namely {{amount of heat}} transfer and pressure drop {{have to be considered}} such that amount of heat transfer needs to be increased and pressure drops need to be decreased. In plate heat exchangers due to presence of <b>corrugated</b> <b>plate,</b> there is a significant resistance to flow with high friction loss. Thus to design plate heat exchangers, one should consider both factors. For various range of Reynolds numbers, many correlations and chevron angles for plate heat exchangers exist. The plate geometry {{is one of the most}} important factor in heat transfer and pressure drop in plate heat exchangers, however such a feature is not accurately prescribed. In the <b>corrugated</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchangers, because of narrow path between the plates, there is a large pressure capacity and the flow becomes turbulent along the path. Therefore, it requires more pumping power than the other types of heat exchangers. Therefore, higher heat transfer and less pressure drop are targeted. The shape of plate heat exchanger is very important for industrial applications that are affected by pressure drop.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{shifting}} {{the fundamental frequency}} of plate structures by corrugation. Creating corrugations significantly improves the flexural rigidities of plate and hence increases its natural frequencies. Two types of corrugations are investigated: sinusoidal and trapezoidal corrugations. The finite element method (FEM) is used to model the <b>corrugated</b> <b>plates</b> and extract the natural frequencies and mode shapes. The effects of corrugation geometrical parameters on simply supported plate fundamental frequency are studied. To reduce the computation time, the <b>corrugated</b> <b>plates</b> are modeled as orthotropic flat plates with equivalent rigidities. To demonstrate the validity of modeling the <b>corrugated</b> <b>plates</b> as orthotropic flat plates in studying the free vibration characteristics, a comparison between the results of finite element model and equivalent orthotropic models is made.

In the past four decades, steel shear walls are utilized in huge constructions in some seismic countries such as Japan, United States, and Canada to lessen the risk of destructive forces. The steel shear walls are divided into two types: unstiffened and stiffened. In the former, a series of plates (sinusoidal and trapezoidal corrugated) with light thickness are used that have the postbuckling field property under overall buckling. In the latter, steel profile belt series are employed as stiffeners with different arrangement: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal in one side or both sides of wall. In the unstiffened walls, increasing the thickness causes {{an increase in the}} wall capacity under large forces in tall structures.

The reactor is a small size <b>corrugated</b> <b>plates</b> {{heat exchanger}} having a low distance between the plates of 1. 5 - 2 mm. Asurprising behavior has been observed according towhich the conversion to biodiesel increases by increasing the overall flow rates. This can be explained by examining the fluid dynamic behavior of the systemwith a step test, at different flowrates,made on single-phase liquid fluid. The observed experimental data for the higher flow rates can roughly be approximated to a plug flow behavior despite the very low Reynolds numbers.
