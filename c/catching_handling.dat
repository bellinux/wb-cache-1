40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} present methods for {{improving}} the {{occupational health and safety}} of Spanish fishermen, and for redesigning the workplace onboard small fishing vessels. To achieve its objective, the research project was designed in four steps: First, the equipment and procedures for <b>catching,</b> <b>handling,</b> and storing fish was studied. Second, the work postures of all the fishermen were simulated and assessed by using an ergonomic digital human modeling system (ManneQuin Pro). Third, the work environment design on board vessels was modified on the basis of acceptable simulated work postures to prevent repetitive movements and lower back biomechanical stresses. In the fourth and final step, ergonomic design parameters were provided to vessel designers. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} Trengganu has been chosen because {{more than half}} of the {{population}} are involved in some way or another in the fishing industry. The processing of marine products has been an occupation among fishermen in the state since fishing activities started. There has also been little development from the traditional methods of <b>catching,</b> <b>handling,</b> storing, processing nad marketing of fish. This is reflected in the presence of the number of small boats and the distribution of many cottageqevel fish processing indus-tries. The total fish caught in the state exceeds 50 000 tons per year with a value not less than M $ 95 millionl/. The people in the state eat only one third of the total catch whereas two thirds, or 33 000 tons, are taken fresh or processed for export t o the other states of Malaysia or other countries; this brings in more than M $ 64 million to the state. Processed fish includes smoked tuna (katsuobushi), canned tuna, salted fish, squid, prawns, traditional products like keropok (fishlshrimp chips or crackers), belachan (shrimp paste), budu (fish sauce), and fish meal...|$|E
40|$|Predatory {{behaviour}} of Nandus nandus was {{studied by}} offering Cyprinus carpio as prey. The {{study was conducted}} with six N. namdus (8. 2 ± 0. 2 cm and 7. 60 ± 0. 3 g) represented as P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4, P 5 and P 6. Three size categories of prey (C. carpio) such as small (2. 0 ± 0. 1 cm and 0. 23 ± 0. 01 g), large (3. 6 ± 0. 1 cm and 0. 57 ±O. O. lg) and mixed group consisting of both small and large prey were used for 14 days of trial. Predatory behavior was classified as targeting, driving, <b>catching,</b> <b>handling,</b> resting and next attempt of catching prey. After introduction of prey into the aquarium predators followed the movement of preys by eye movements and tried to target smaller one first. The predator grasped the head of the prey by its jaws by a drive and engulfed it wholly into the mouth. The average handling time (time taken to manipulate and swallow prey from capture to ceasation of pharyngeal movement) was 42 ± 2 sec and 47 ± 2 sec for small and large prey respectively. N. nandus were ingested more small prey than large prey though the size classes were equally available in case of mixed prey used. Although the prey consumption was higher in number when small prey were ingested but in weight the consumption was higher when ingested large size of prey. The study indicated that N. nandus, ingested more small prey and grasped the headfirst...|$|E

40|$|Translocations of {{threatened}} species play {{an increasingly important}} role in conservation management. However, {{few studies have examined}} what effects, if any, the translocation process itself (i. e. <b>catching,</b> <b>handling,</b> confining, transferring and releasing an animal into an unfamiliar environment) has on subsequent breeding success. Takahe Porphyrio hochstetteri living on offshore ‘‘predator-free’ ’ islands in New Zealand are a model system for examining such effects because pre-breeding birds have been frequently translocated between established island populations before they pair up and breed at 2 – 3 years of age. We postulated that ‘‘translocated’ ’ breeders (i. e. breeders that had been raised on another island) would delay first breeding attempts and/or have lower reproductive success compared with ‘‘resident’ ’ birds (i. e. bred on the same island that they were raised). The results indicated that translocated birds did not delay breeding and had similar mean hatching and fledging success as resident pairs in their first breeding season and subsequent seasons combined. The results suggest that at least for large or long-lived birds such as Takahe, the effects of any stress from the translocation itself, or the release into an unfamiliar environment, might be either short-lived or not significant enough to hinder subsequent breeding success. We recommend that further research be carried out on other species to determine the baseline effects, if any, of translocations, {{so that they can be}} taken into account when considering other determinants of translocation success such as habitat suitability, number of individuals and timing of releases...|$|E

40|$|The C++ {{exceptions}} mechanism enables modularized {{programs to}} separate the reporting of exceptional conditions from the handling of those exceptional condi-tions into the locations where those actions can best be performed. It {{is often the case}} in such modular applications that the module capable of detecting an excep-tional situation cannot know how it should be handled, and so C++ exceptions allow the module that invoked the operation to react to the condition. Libraries developed separately from the applications using them are a perfect example of modularized code, and thus a perfect candidate for using C++ exceptions, how-ever many of the application framework library paradigms that have become commonplace do not provide adequate exception support to allow for good pro-gramming style with regard to <b>catching</b> and <b>handling</b> exceptions. In these librar-ies, there often exist multiple callback-style entry points that invoke application-specific operations, all of which require exactly identical exception handling, yet {{there is no way to}} collect this code together.

40|$|During an {{outbreak}} of avian influenza in the Netherlands in spring 2003, the disease was controlled by destroying all the poultry on the infected farms and on all the farms within a radius of 3 km. In total, 30 million birds were killed on 1242 farms and in more than 8000 hobby flocks, by using mobile containers filled with carbon dioxide, mobile electrocution lines and by gassing whole poultry houses with carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. Observations of these methods were used to compare their effectiveness and capacity, and their effects on the welfare of the birds. Gassing whole poultry houses had a much greater capacity than mobile equipment, and catching live birds to bring them to a mobile killing device caused extra stress and could cause pain due to injuries inflicted when <b>catching</b> and <b>handling</b> them. Gassing whole poultry houses with carbon monoxide requires strict safety regulations and, therefore, gassing with carbon dioxide was considered preferable. However, this method is not suited to all types of housing, and in these circumstances mobile killing devices were a useful alternativ...|$|R

40|$|Yellowfin tuna has a {{high level}} of free {{histidine}} in their muscle, which can lead to histamine formation by microorganisms if temperature abuse occurs during handling and further processing. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure levels of histamine in damaged and undamaged thawed muscle to determine the effect of physical damage on the microbial count and histamine formation during the initial steps of canning processing and to isolate and identify the main histamine-forming microorganisms present in the flesh of yellowfin tuna. Total mesophilic and psicrophilic microorganisms were determined using the standard plate method. The presence of histamine-forming microorganisms was determined in a modified Niven's agar. Strains were further identified using the API 20 E kit for enterobacteriaceae and Gram-negative bacilli. Physically damaged tuna did not show higher microbiological contamination than that of undamaged muscle tuna. The most active histamine-forming microorganism present in tuna flesh was Morganella morganii. Other decarboxylating microorganisms present were Enterobacter agglomerans and Enterobacter cloacae. Physical damage of tune during <b>catching</b> and <b>handling</b> did not increase the level of histamine or the amount of microorganisms present in tuna meat during frozen transportation, but they showed a higher risk of histamine-forming microorganism growth during processing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceException {{handling}} is {{a practical}} and important way to improve the availability and reliability of a component-based system. The classical code-level exception handling approach is usually applied {{to the inside of}} a component, while some exceptions can only or properly be handled outside of the components. In this paper, we propose a middleware-enabled approach for exception handling at architecture level. Developers specify what exceptions should be handled and how to handle them with the support of middleware in an exception handling model, which is complementary to software architecture of the target system. This model will be interpreted at runtime by a middleware-enabled exception handling framework, which is responsible for <b>catching</b> and <b>handling</b> the specified exceptions mainly based on the common mechanisms provided by the middleware. Though the approach is general enough for almost all middleware-enabled systems, the framework is specific to the concrete middleware. Consequently, we demonstrate the approach in JEE (Java Platform Enterprise Edition) application servers and experiment on JEE benchmark system. We believe that this architecture-level exception handling approach, together with the classical code-level approach, can handle exceptions in component-based systems in a sufficient, efficient and flexible manner...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} {{in the scientific community}} that animals suffer from both physical and emotional stress. Emotional stress has been linked to an increase in core body temperature and decrease in surface area temperature of at least 0. 5 degrees Celsius in a wide number of species, a phenomenon known as Stress-Induced hyperthermia (SIH) (Edgar et al, 2013). Catching and handling are relevant events in an animals life. Wild prey animal’s experience <b>catching</b> and <b>handling</b> by predators while animals raised for productivity experience <b>catching</b> and <b>handling</b> by Humans. Handling has been linked to the onset of stress-induced hyperthermia in many species, and Edgar et al (2013) provided evidence that handling causes a significant decrease in Head, Eye and Comb temperatures in Hens. The aim of this current research was to replicate that of Edgar et al (2013). This research aims to use infrared thermography to measure changes in Chooks Head, Eye and Comb prior to, during and after capture and handling. It is the hope that this research will provide further evidence that handling causes stress-induced hyperthermia in Hens. Infrared thermal imaging is a non-invasive measure of surface temperatures. It is the hope that this research will provide evidence that infrared thermography is an effective non-invasive measure useful in animal welfare research. 13 Hens and 6 Roosters Head, Eye and Comb temperatures were measured using infrared thermal imaging during 20 minute pre measurement, handling (capture by a researcher and held for 5 seconds) and 20 minute post measurement periods. Average surface area temperatures for each of the 19 subjects were obtained every minute during pre-measurement, handling and post-measurement. Average temperatures were plotted and analysed to investigate any patterns of change. Subjects Head, Eye and Comb temperatures experienced a significant decrease (more than 2 degrees celsius) from pre-measurement to handling. For Hens the Comb saw the most significant temperature drop during handling which is consistent with previous research. The Head saw the most significant decrease in temperature during handling for Roosters. Roosters Head Eye and Comb temperatures in post measurement went on to exceed those obtained in pre measurement while for Female subjects Head, Eye and Comb temperatures never returned to pre-measurement levels during the 20 minute post measurement. Infrared thermography proved a useful and accurate measure of Chooks surface area temperature. A surface area temperature decrease of more than 2 degrees celsius was observed in all subjects. All subjects met the requirements for stress-induced hyperthermia after handling. Stress-induced hyperthermia had a significant and lengthy impact on Chooks, in particular Hen...|$|R
40|$|Spiny lobster {{farming is}} a {{feasible}} strategy to address increasing export demand currently not {{met by the}} capture fishery. However, farming currently relies on natural lobster seed availability, {{which in turn is}} limited by the fishers' lack of skill in <b>catching</b> and <b>handling</b> pueruli as well as applying suitable grow-out practises. In Indonesia, particularly on Lombok, a viable puerulus fishery has been established supporting a local grow-out industry. Anecdotal evidence suggests water depth may be an important factor for the effectiveness of collecting equipment. This paper reports on an experiment that examined the effect of depth and trap type on the effectiveness of puerulus collectors {{at the end of the}} wet season, when pueruli abundance is greatest. Four trap types were deployed at 5 depths: i) 1 m below surface; ii) 2 m below surface; iii) middle of the water column; iv) 1 m above the sea floor; and v) touching the sea floor, with 6 replicates of each. The data were analysed to identify the effect of depth and trap type using a two-way ANOVA. Significant differences for depth and trap type were found for the primary species caught, Panulirus homarus and Panulirus ornatus. The greatest catch of P. homarus was on the sea floor using a cement paper trap. For P. ornatus catch rate was less strongly correlated with a specific depth or trap type, although catch was highest at or near the sea floor in cement paper traps...|$|R

Plasma corticosterone, albumin, glucose, cholesterol, lactate, triglycerides and total protein were measured in order to assess the stress-induced changes to these biochemical indices following handling in the first few minutes of capture. Results Pre-sampling handling in a rough manner resulted in considerably higher plasma concentrations of all biochemical indices monitored when compared with gentle handling.
