The time-dependent properties of viscoelastic materials in nanoscale are evaluated by using a harmonic nanoindentation test which is performed by a nanoindenter assembled on an atomic force microscope with a three sided pyramidal Berkovich probe tip.

40|$|A small punch test {{is one of}} the {{innovative}} methods {{that can be used to}} evaluate the properties of a material without destructive harm to the in-service component. Conventionally identifying material properties by a uniaxial test is widely applied to engineering. How the properties obtained from a small punch test can be applied with the same utility has been a goal. In 2006, European Code of Practice (CoP) of small punch tests was first released, in which the correlation factor, ksp, was introduced to bridge the gap between the above methods.

40|$|Many {{components}} in conventional {{and nuclear power}} plant, aero-engines, chemical plant etc., operate at temperatures which are high enough for creep to occur. These include plain pipes, pipe bends, branched pipes etc., the manufacture of such components may also require welds to be inserted in them. In most cases, only nominal operating conditions (i. e., pressure, temperatures, system load, etc.) are known and hence precise life predictions are not possible. Also, the proportion of life consumed will vary from position to position within a component and the plant. Hence, nondestructive techniques are adopted to assist in making decisions on whether to repair, continue operating or scrap certain components.

The new results, obtained by using the modified constitutive model, show a significant improvement with respect to those obtained by a state of the art creep damage constitutive model (the Liu and Murakami constitutive model) both in terms of minimum load-line displacement rate and time to rupture.

Typically the <b>creep</b> <b>test</b> is conducted {{to characterize the}} deformation features; however, the conventional uniaxial power-law <b>creep</b> <b>test</b> may be impractical for small scale materials. Accordingly, instrumented indentation techniques are frequently employed. This study concerns the employment of instrumented indentation to characterize the power-law creep response of metallic materials. Indentation derived creep response using constant load-hold and constant indentation strain rate methods were investigated through systematic numerical finite element analysis of conical indentation. The model system of pure tin (Sn) and Sn-based alloy with known uniaxial power-law creep parameters is used for direct comparison between constant indentation strain rate and constant load-hold methods. It was found that each method accurately yielded the corresponding creep stress exponent (n); thus, leading to parallel lines of strain rate versus creep stress on the logarithmic scale.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to develop a}} {{practical}} method for constitutive modelling of polyethylene, based on a phenomenological approach, which can be applied for structural analysis. Polyethylene (PE) is increasingly used as a structural material, for example in pipes installed by trenchless methods where relatively low stiffness of PE reduces the required installation forces, chemical inertness makes it applicable for corrosive environments, and adequate strength allows to use it for sewer, gas and water lines. Polyethylene exhibits time-dependent constitutive behaviour, which is also dependent on the applied stress level resulting in nonlinear stress-strain relationships. Nonlinear viscoelastic theory has been well established and a variety of modelling approaches have been derived from it. In {{order to be able to}} realistically utilize the nonlinear modelling approaches in design, a simple method is needed for finding the constitutive formulation for a specific polyethylene type. In this study, time-dependent constitutive relationships for polymers are investigated for polyethylene materials. <b>Creep</b> <b>tests</b> on seven polyethylene materials were conducted and the experimental results indicate strong nonlinear viscoelasticity in the material responses. <b>Creep</b> <b>tests</b> on seven materials were conducted for 24 hours for modelling purposes.
