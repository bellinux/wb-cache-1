40|$|Synthetic {{biology is}} founded {{on the idea that}} cells are living {{machines}} that execute genetically encoded programs, and that we as engineers can reprogram them to perform new functions. Unlike man-made machines that are designed from the ground up, cells have been shaped and molded by evolution, and this makes them much more difficult to engineer. As synthetic biology has grown and matured, the field has shifted from focusing primarily on simpler bacterial <b>chassis</b> to <b>engineering</b> more complex and more powerful eukaryotic hosts, especially the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we present technologies and strategies for efficiently engineering yeast, with an emphasis on metabolic engineering. First, we describe a practical framework for designing and constructing DNA for expression in yeast. This framework standardizes [...] and as a consequence, accelerates [...] the process of building new strains, enabling more rapid iteration and experimentation. We then develop a strategy for optimizing metabolic pathways by assembling combinatorial libraries that simultaneously titrate the expression of many genes. We identify strains with improved pathway flux for violacein biosynthesis and xylose utilization using mathematical modeling and selection, respectively. Finally, we attempt to alter the specificity of a native hexose transporter to exclusively import xylose without inhibition by glucose. In summary, this work is a combination of developing fundamental tools for engineering yeast and the application of those tools for lignocellulosic biomass fermentation...|$|R

40|$|Bacteria {{from several}} taxa, {{including}} Kurthia zopfii, Myxococcus xanthus, and Bacillus mycoides, {{have been reported}} to align growth of their colonies to small features on the surface of solid media, including anisotropies created by compression. While the function of this phenomenon is unclear, it may help organisms navigate on solid phases, such as soil. The origin of this behavior is also unknown: it may be biological (that is, dependent on components that sense the environment and regulate growth accordingly) or merely physical. Here we show that B. subtilis, an organism that typically does not respond to media compression, can be induced to do so with two simple and synergistic perturbations: a mutation that maintains cells in the swarming (chained) state, and the addition of EDTA to the growth media, which further increases chain length. EDTA apparently increases chain length by inducing defects in cell separation, as the treatment has only marginal effects on the length of individual cells. These results lead us to three conclusions. First, the wealth of genetic tools available to B. subtilis will provide a new, tractable <b>chassis</b> for <b>engineering</b> compression sensitive organisms. Second, the sensitivity of colony morphology to media compression in Bacillus can be modulated by altering a simple physical property of rod-shaped cells. And third, colony morphology under compression holds promise as a rapid, simple, and low-cost way to screen for changes in the length of rod-shaped cells or chains thereof...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{biology is}} an {{evolving}} field that emphasizes synthesis more than observation {{which has been}} and is the scientific method for traditional biology. With powerful synthetic tools, synthetic biologists seek to reproduce natural behaviors (and eventually to create artificial life) from unnatural molecules or try to construct unnatural systems from interchangeable parts. Accompanied with this recent movement, metabolic engineers started to utilize these interchangeable parts (enzymes in this case) to create novel pathways. In addition, engineering biological parts including enzymes, promoters, and protein-protein interaction domains has led to productivity improvement. However, understanding behaviors of a synthetic pathway in an engineered chassis is still a daunting task, requiring global optimization. As {{the first step to}} understand pathway design rules and behaviors of synthetic pathways, a synthetic pathway for the production of D-glucaric acid has been designed and constructed in E. coli. To this end, three disparate enzymes were recruited from three different organisms, and the system perturbed by this introduction of heterologous genes was analyzed. Limiting flux through the pathway is the second recombinant step, catalyzed by myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX), whose activity is strongly influenced by the concentration of the myo-inositol substrate. To increase the effective concentration of myo-inositol, synthetic scaffold devices were built from protein-protein interaction domains to co-recruit all three pathway enzymes in a designable complex. (cont.) This colocalization led to enhancement of MIOX activity with concomitant productivity improvement, achieving 2. 7 g/L of D-glucaric acid production from 10 g/L of D-glucose input. Secondly, retrobiosynthetic approach, a product-targeted design of biological pathways, has been proposed as an alternative strategy to exploit the diversity of enzymecatalyzed reactions. The first step in a glucaric acid pathway designed retrosynthetically involves oxidation of the C- 6 hydroxyl group on glucose, but no glucose oxidase in nature has been found to act on this hydroxyl group on glucose. To create glucose 6 - oxidase, a computational design and experimental selection was combined with the help of DNA synthesis technology. To this end, the sequence space of candidate mutations was computationally searched, the selected sequences were combinatorially assembled, and the created library was experimentally screened and characterized. Furthermore, the structure-activity relationship of the newly created glucose oxidases was elucidated, and the kinetic model mechanism for these mutants was proposed and analyzed. Collectively, parts, devices, and <b>chassis</b> <b>engineering</b> were applied to a synthetic pathway for the production of D-glucaric acid, and this synthetic biology approach was proven to be effective for new pathway design and improvement. by Tae Seok Moon.

40|$|The {{development}} of shape in multicellular organisms has intrigued human minds for millenia. Empowered by modern genetic techniques, molecular biologists are now striving {{to not only}} dissect developmental processes, but to exploit their modularity {{for the design of}} custom living systems used in bioproduction, remediation, and regenerative medicine. Currently, our capacity to harness this potential is fundamentally limited by a lack of spatiotemporal control over gene expression in multicellular systems. While several synthetic genetic circuits for control of multicellular patterning have been reported, hierarchical induction of gene expression domains has received little attention from synthetic biologists, despite its fundamental role in biological self-organization. In this thesis, I introduce the first synthetic genetic system implementing population-based AND logic for programmed hierarchical patterning of bacterial populations of Escherichia coli, and address fundamental prerequisites for implementation of an analogous genetic circuit into the emergent multicellular plant model Marchantia polymorpha. In both model systems, I explore the use of bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase as a gene expression engine to control synthetic patterning across populations of cells. In E. coli, I developed a ratiometric assay of bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase activity, which I used to systematically characterize different intact and split enzyme variants. I utilized the best-performing variant to build a three-color patterning system responsive to two different homoserine lactones. I validated the AND gate-like behavior of this system both in cell suspension and in surface culture. Then, I used the synthetic circuit in a membrane-based spatial assay to demonstrate programmed hierarchical patterning of gene expression across bacterial populations. To prepare the adaption of bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase-driven synthetic patterning from the prokaryote E. coli to the eukaryote M. polymorpha, I developed a toolbox of genetic elements for spatial gene expression control in the liverwort: I analyzed codon usage across the transcriptome of M. polymorpha, and used insights gained to design codon-optimized fluorescent reporters successfully expressed from its nuclear and chloroplast genomes. For targeting of bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase to these cellular compartments, I functionally validated nuclear localization signals and chloroplast transit peptides. For spatiotemporal control of bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase in M. polymorpha, I characterized spatially restricted and inducible promoters. For facilitated posttranscriptional processing of target transcripts, I functionally validated viral enhancer sequences in M. polymorpha. Taking advantage of this genetic toolbox, I introduced inducible nuclear-targeted bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase into M. polymorpha. I showed implementation of the bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase/PT 7 expression system accompanied by hypermethylation of its target nuclear transgene. My observations suggest operation of efficient epigenetic gene silencing in M. polymorpha, and guide future efforts in <b>chassis</b> <b>engineering</b> of this multicellular plant model. Furthermore, my results encourage utilization of spatiotemporally controlled bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase as a targeted silencing system for functional genomic studies and morphogenetic engineering in the liverwort. Taken together, the work presented enhances our capacity for spatiotemporal gene expression control in bacterial populations and plants, facilitating future efforts in synthetic morphogenesis for applications in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.

The scope of the digital model is to plan and analyze the factory by using different software packages. Thus the model doesnt exist in only one application.
