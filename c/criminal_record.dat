5|$|In {{the week}} {{where the first}} series of Red or Black? aired, ITV gained a much larger {{audience}} share than {{it had in the}} week directly previous, where it had been beaten by BBC One on six out of seven nights. Despite this, reviews of the first series were universally negative, and additional criticism was leveled at the show when it was discovered that Nathan Hageman, the first winner of the £1m prize, had a <b>criminal</b> <b>record.</b> The Sun began a campaign calling for Hageman to return the money, but he was eventually allowed to keep it. It did, however, lead to ITV dropping three other contestants from the show, with at least one withdrawn because of their <b>criminal</b> <b>record.</b> This was also {{a major factor in the}} pre-recording of series 2.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson {{was indicted}} on {{one count of}} knowingly {{receiving}} through the mails sexually explicit material depicting a minor in September. At trial in federal court, his attorney, George H.

He raised the entrapment defense.|$|E

40|$|This project report {{deals with}} <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> {{and how these}} {{can be seen as}} a barrier between the ex-prisoners and labor. Focus in this regard, {{especially}} in firms' use of <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> and the legal frameworks that exist in this area. The project report were obtained from three theoretical understandings which compliment each other in our work with ex-prisoners. More specifically, we use theorists Michel Foucault, Emile Durkheim and criminologist Howard Becker. The current use of <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> is discussed based on empirical data collected and held interviews with knowledgeable expert persons. We have concluded that there is an increasing use of <b>criminal</b> <b>records,</b> but that it varies across industries. Furthermore, there is a legal gray area, what Ango legislation related to the use of <b>criminal</b> <b>records.</b> Because this can be argued that the <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> serve as double jeopardy. According to counteract this, and create better conditions for the reintegration of ex-prisoners in the Danish labor market, it is worthwhile to discuss a reconsideration of the law...|$|R
5|$|Journalist Chantal Hébert {{pointed out}} Couillard {{never had any}} <b>{{criminal}}</b> <b>record</b> and was not charged with criminal activity, and that investigative journalists could not find links between Couillard and the bikers since 1999. Political commentators called the affair a {{threat to national security}} due to Bernier's carelessness and to Couillard's background with motorcycle biker gangs.|$|E
5|$|According to CP+B {{employee}} Tom Zukoszki, {{the fictional}} background {{information for the}} band was that they signed with Burger King instead of a major record label. As part of the promotion, a four-song LP record was recorded, two music videos produced, and a national (US) tour planned. The tour had to be cancelled because the actor playing the lead singer, a Canadian citizen, was unable to enter the United States {{because he had a}} <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> in his home country.|$|E
5|$|Cascioferro {{never went}} to any school. When still young, Cascioferro married a teacher from Bisacquino, Brigida Giaccone, who {{instructed}} him {{how to read and}} write. He was inducted into the Mafia in the 1880s. He worked as a revenue collector as a young adult, using the position as a cover to carry out his protection racket. His <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> began with an assault in 1884 and progressed through extortion, arson, and menacing, and eventually to the kidnapping of the 19-year-old Baroness Clorinda Peritelli di Valpetrosa in June 1898, for which he received a three-year sentence.|$|E
50|$|Sweden {{is one of}} the {{countries}} with the largest databases of <b>criminal</b> <b>records,</b> containing some of the oldest population statistics in the world. In the past, individuals were prohibited from retrieving information about themselves to prevent being forced by employers or landlords to hand over the information. Yet there have been two notable changes in Swedish regulation of <b>criminal</b> <b>records.</b> In 1989, access was given to employers with the implementation of the ‘subject access’ paragraph in Swedish <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> legislation. In 2001, it became mandatory for employers to check <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> of teachers and childcare workers before they were hired, given the seriousness of sex offences against children. Individuals’ <b>criminal</b> history <b>records</b> are today more available to the public than ever before.|$|R

5|$|Following the Velvet Revolution, an {{amendment}} act No. 49/1990 Coll. was adopted. Under the new law, any person older than 18, with clean <b>criminal</b> <b>record,</b> {{physically and mentally}} sound that did not pose threat of misuse of the firearm could have license issued. License may have been issued for purpose of hunting, sport shooting, exercise of profession and in special cases also for protection. Newly, denial of license could be challenged in court.|$|E
5|$|King County police, finally {{armed with}} a {{detailed}} description of their suspect as well as his car, posted fliers throughout the Seattle area. A composite sketch was printed in regional newspapers and broadcast on local television stations. Elizabeth Kloepfer, Ann Rule, a DES employee, and a UW psychology professor all recognized the profile, the sketch, and the car, and reported Bundy as a possible suspect; but detectives—who were receiving up to 200 tips per day—thought it unlikely that a clean-cut law student with no adult <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> could be the perpetrator.|$|E
5|$|A {{gun in the}} Czech Republic is {{available}} to anybody subject to acquiring a shall issue firearms license first. Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean <b>criminal</b> <b>record.</b> Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 240,000 out of some 300,000 legal gun owners have concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech gun owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.|$|E

[...] CRJ's work helped put the “Ban the Box” provision into place, which prevents employers from asking about <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> on initial job applications, but their subsequent study showed that while this has allowed more former convicts to get job interviews, it has seldom translated into jobs.|$|R
5|$|Federal DUI law {{differs from}} New Jersey law {{in that there}} are no {{mandatory}} minimum jail sentences, irrespective of the number of previous DUI convictions, and plea bargaining is allowed. A federal DUI conviction will result in unexpungeable <b>criminal</b> <b>record.</b> Federal courts cannot suspend a driver's license, but may notify the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission of a DUI conviction. In federal enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of other federal departments (e.g. Fish and Wildlife Service), it is unclear if drunk driving could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is inapplicable, and there is no federal law defining DUI on those properties.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Raël {{appeared}} on Ciel mon Mardi, a French talk show hosted by journalist Christophe Dechavanne. Toward {{the end of}} the show, Raël's liberal views on sex were critiqued by a priest, a social worker, and a psychologist. A former Raëlian named Jean Parraga believed that his wife and children were being held as prisoners and that Raël attempted to break up his family. He thought they were being treated like criminals in activities such as orgies and sacrifice involving children at the Sensual Meditation camp. Parraga also had a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> as a drug dealer and car thief, and in August 1992, he attempted to shoot Raël.|$|E

In April {{of the same}} year Hope should have appeared on saxophonist Gene Ammons' The Happy Blues, but he left the record company's building before the session began and did not return. Hope claimed that he had gone to visit an aunt in hospital, but his absence was attributed by others to his heroin addiction. This had existed on and off for several years, and had led to at least one spell in prison. His drug problem and associated <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> led to the withdrawal of Hope's New York City Cabaret Card around 1956, so he was no longer permitted to play in clubs in the city.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2017, Chelsea Manning {{was denied}} entry to Canada from the United States {{because of her}} <b>criminal</b> <b>record.</b> According to a letter from Canadian {{immigration}} officials, posted online by Manning, she is inadmissible due to being convicted of offenses equivalent to treason in Canada. Manning told Reuters that she had planned to vacation in Montreal and Vancouver, but was stopped at a Quebec border crossing by the Canada Border Services Agency {{on the evening of}} September 21 and detained overnight. She said she would retain a Canadian lawyer to challenge the inadmissibility finding before a Canadian tribunal.|$|E
5|$|The only clue {{found at}} the scene is a Lucky Boy {{employee}} button.

Scully suspects Spinks after it is discovered he has a <b>criminal</b> <b>record.</b> Mulder, however, believes that the victim's brain was removed by a proboscis, and suspects another employee, Rob Roberts, of committing the murder. Rob, who is actually a mutant human who wears a disguise to hide his true physical body, subsists on brains in order to survive. When Rob's landlady, Sylvia Jassey, is trailed by a private investigator (Steve Kiziak), Rob kills him and eats in order to placate his hunger, which begins to get more and more uncontrollable.|$|E

Intended to counterbalance the relatively new ease with which individuals can move between States, it is a mechanism of ensuring that individuals are not able to escape their <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> by merely travelling across a border. The underlying rationale is that technological advancements in transport services which have given individuals the ability to easily move between European States should not amount to an ability to expunge their own <b>criminal</b> <b>records.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the Act {{is to provide a}} means of <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> {{suspension}}. According to the Act, a record suspension is evidence {{of the fact that the}} applicant was of good conduct, and that the conviction should no longer reflect adversely on the applicant's character. Following a successful application, the records in question are kept separate and apart from other <b>criminal</b> <b>records,</b> are removed from the automated <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> retrieval system maintained by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and are not disclosed to any person without the prior approval of the Minister.|$|R
5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 {{hours of community service}} and one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from a <b>criminal</b> <b>record.</b> Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's notice of the court date following Bertuzzi's plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|His mother {{raised the}} family, {{including}} Coleman's brother (Lillashawn) and sister, in the Humboldt Park community area, then the West Side and finally Oak Park. Coleman describes his stepfather as a long-time gang member with an extensive <b>criminal</b> <b>record.</b> After enduring formative years with gunfights outside elementary school, home loss {{due to an}} apartment fire, and expulsion hearings, his stepfather, Mose Oliver, introduced him to wrestling {{to keep him out}} of trouble. Federal records confirm that Oliver is an alleged 1990s gang enforcer who served time from 2004 to 2011 for participation in Operation Day Trader. The wrestling started in about 2001. By sixth grade both his father and stepfather were incarcerated and his father figure was his wrestling coach, Mike Powell. Coleman attended Ella Flagg Young elementary school. Barral raised her family with little assistance away from the gang influences of the West Side. She applied for section 8 assistance. Coleman, who was nearly expelled as a sophomore, graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park, IL in 2009. He has studied at Northern Michigan University.|$|E
