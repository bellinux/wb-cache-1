40|$|Bulletin 811 {{provides}} {{crop yields}} and productivity indices under an optimum level of management {{used by the}} top 16 % of farmers in Illinois in the 1990 s. Prime agricultural land classes (Class A, Class B, and <b>Class</b> <b>C)</b> previously provided in Circular 1156 (Soil Productivity in Illinois) {{were not included in}} Bulletin 811. The prime agricultural <b>class</b> of any <b>soil</b> type can be determined by using the optimum productivity index (PI) shown in Table S 2 of Bulletin 811 and the following author recommended prime agricultural <b>class</b> scale. <b>Soil</b> types with optimum PI's from 133 - 147 are in Class A, from 117 - 132 are in Class B, and from 100 - 116 are in <b>Class</b> <b>C.</b> <b>Soil</b> types in Bulletin 811 with optimum PI's equal to or below 99 are in the other agricultural land class and not considered prime agricultural land. If the soil type is in a soil map unit which is not on A slope or not slightly eroded, the user will need to determine if the soil type has a favorable or unfavorable subsoil for rooting (3 rd column in Table S 2 of B 811) and make an erosion and/or slope adjustment using either Figure S 1 (B 811) or Table S 3 (B 811) prior to utilizing the scale and prime agricultural land class limits provided above. published or submitted for publicationnot peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Legacy soil maps {{typically}} {{consist of}} a tessellation of polygon soil map unit delineations where the map units {{consist of a}} defined assemblage of <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> assumed to exist in more-or-less fixed proportions. There are several limitations {{in this kind of}} mapping approach that relate to the original intent of the soil survey, the effect of mapping scale, and the nature of soil polygon boundaries. Yet perhaps a more fundamental limitation is {{the fact that most of}} the time, the <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> that comprise the soil map units are not mapped individually: in effect their spatial distributions are unknown beyond the qualitative indications given in the accompanying soil map unit report. Spatial disaggregation of soil map units attempts to map the spatial distribution of the individual <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> that comprise a legacy soil map. We developed an approach called "Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees" (DSMART). DSMART samples the polygons of a legacy soil map and uses classification trees to generate a number of realisations of the potential <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> distribution. The realisations are then used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the individual <b>soil</b> <b>classes.</b> These estimates are mapped as raster grids, which can overcome some of the limitations of mapping scale and polygon boundaries inherent in the original legacy soil map. We demonstrate the DSMART approach on a legacy soil map from the former Dalrymple Shire in central Queensland, Australia. We mapped the estimated probability of occurrence of the 71 <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> in the legacy soil map, as well as the most probable <b>soil</b> <b>class,</b> second-most-probable <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> and the degree of confusion between them as determined by a confusion index. Validation on 285 observed soil profiles indicated that for 48. 4 % of the validation profiles, the observed <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> was identified in the top three most probable <b>soil</b> <b>classes.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2013 Elsevier B.

2500|$|The X {{class was}} a {{development}} of the earlier <b>C</b> <b>class</b> 2-8-0 goods locomotive, designed to be gauge convertible from [...] to [...] {{in the event of}} the Victorian Railways network being converted to standard gauge. The <b>C</b> <b>class,</b> with a narrow firebox between the frames, could not be easily converted.

50|$|The <b>C</b> <b>class</b> {{were placed}} into service {{initially}} in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch although some locomotives did spend {{short periods of}} time in Dunedin following overhaul at Hillside Workshops or as a short-term allocation following their completion. It was found that while the <b>C</b> <b>class</b> were extremely capable, the locomotives were insufficiently heavy enough to move some of the larger trains being shunted. This led to the conversion of the BB class 4-8-0s to shunting and branchline service in order to replace the <b>C</b> <b>class</b> on these heavier duties.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, Sea Cliff Yacht Club, (the {{owners of the}} {{physical}} trophy and official stewards of the event) lost interest in collaborating with the <b>C</b> <b>Class,</b> which appeared to be dying, and chose to change {{the format of the}} event known as the Little America's Cup. Thus the 'Little America's Cup' and the actual <b>C</b> <b>Class</b> Catamaran Association parted ways. After negotiations with America's Cup Properties Ltd (owners of the America's Cup trademark) Sea Cliff kept the right to host an event known as the Little America's Cup, which they chose to be sailed in a one design F-18HT Beach Catamaran fleet. The <b>C</b> <b>Class,</b> opting instead to develop a new event, now competes in the International <b>C</b> <b>Class</b> Catamaran Championship.
