The models reported in the literature and used in the simulators like PROCESS and BATCHFRAC, etc., are too complex to use for obtaining optimal design because of high computational time and large memory requirement. In this work we are presenting a short-cut method for design of multicomponent batch distillation columns, operating under variable reflux and constant reflux conditions. The method is essentially a modification of the short-cut method widely used in the design of continuous multicomponent columns. The technque has been tested for both binary and multicomponent systems, and the results compare favorably with the rigorous methods of design. The method is very efficient and can be used for preliminary design and analysis of batch columns. The model used in this method has a number of tuning parameters {{that can be used for}} model adaptation. The main features of the short-cut method include lower computational time (which is independent of the number of plates in the <b>column),</b> <b>lower</b> memory requirements, and its adaptability to design...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} enantioselective analytical methods by separation of the enantiomers of four drugs (citalopram, zopiclone, tramadol and methylphenidate) and their metabolites. The analyses were performed with HPLC-UV with columns whose stationary phases were based on macrocyclic glycopeptides (Chirobiotic V, V 2 and T) and polysaccharides (Lux Cellulose- 1, Cellulose- 2 and Amylose- 2). The Chirobiotic V column showed high selectivity for citalopram and its metabolites. High resolution was obtained using a mobile phase consisting of methanol, acetic acid and ammonia. High selectivity for the enantiomers of zopiclone and its metabolites were obtained on the Cellulose- 2 column using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and ammonium acetate buffer. The enantiomers of tramadol were separated with the Amylose- 2 column. However, changes in the pressure arose, probably caused by the additive NH 4 HCO 3. When the analysis was repeated at a later occasion, reproducible results were not obtained. With the Cellulose- 1 <b>column,</b> <b>lower</b> selectivity was obtained, resulting in unacceptably long analysis time. Only a few analyses of methylphenidate were performed and the results indicated that the glycopeptide columns had higher selectivity for this compound than the polysaccharides...|$|E

The flux in the ROSAT (0. 1 – 2. 4 keV) band is strikingly different from the simultaneous BATSE (25 – 50 keV) flux which was obtained by integrating the best fit power law (Fig. 1). Motivated by the different intensity evolution in the soft and hard X-ray band we have selected BATSE monitoring data collected simultaneously to ROSAT data and performed joint spectral fitting with XSPEC. As a result, we never got an acceptable fit (see Fig. 2) : The BATSE power law (upper dotted line) is too steep to match the ROSAT band, and even allowing for an increased absorbing <b>column</b> (<b>lower</b> dotted line) does not solve the problem. Alternatively, neither a thermal bremsstrahlung fit (solid line) nor a power law fit (lower dash-dot line) to the ROSAT data match the BATSE flux. The upper dash-dot line is a – 2. 5 powerlaw which would match the BATSE data while giving too much 1 – 2 keV 1993 emission. A similar, but 1994 less stringent result 1995 is obtained when folding the best fit BATSE power law models with the HRI detector response to compare the expected count rate with the observed one.

Compared with separations obtained without additives, shorter retention times and sharper peaks are obtained. The reason for the improvement appears to be a stronger solution-phase interaction between analyte and discrete additive molecules. The effect of additives is akin to gradient elution. Solvent strength and selectivity can be varied by controlling the type and concentration of the additive. Binding constants between solute and surfactant additives were calculated by relating capacity factor to surfactant concentration;An even greater reduction in k 2 ̆ 7 resulted from the use of binary additive systems, particularly those containing a cationic and an anionic surfactant.

Preface Steel Reinforced Concrete (SRC) structure has the advantages of both concrete structure and steel structure. At present, this structure has been more widely used in civil engineering. A large number of SRC joints will be emerged with the development of industrial and civil buildings. For SRC joints, past researches were mostly aimed at the structure of the regular joints [1 - 4], the researches of the SRC abnormal exterior joints which upper and lower column sections changed were quite less [5]. Therefore, ABAQUS was used in this paper to do nonlinear finite element analysis of the abnormal exterior joints consist of Steel Reinforced Concrete column and Reinforced Concrete beam. The paper briefly analyzed some factors which affect the loading capacity of joints, such as the eccentricity of column section, the ratio of steel in the joint’s core, stirrup ratio, the strength of concrete, the ratio of axial compression and so on.

40|$|Dry soil mixing (DSM) {{is a form}} {{of ground}} {{improvement}} in which dry cementitious and/or pozzolanic binders are mixed in situ with a soft soil. The binders react with the soil 2 ̆ 7 s natural moisture to initiate hydration reactions, thus leading to improved strength and stiffness characteristics. The deep dry soil mixing method (DDSM) is one form of DSM in which stabilised soil columns are created in soft soil profiles. Although site-specific binder trials can help estimate achievable column strengths, variations in the soil profile, moisture content, organic content, curing temperature and mixing conditions may mean that in situ field strengths can differ from those obtained under laboratory conditions, thus requiring the need for in situ strength verification. Two field methods used to estimate the strength of a stabilised soil column are the Push-In Resistance Test (PIRT), where a winged penetrometer is pushed down through the stabilised column, and the Pull-Out Resistance Test (PORT), where a winged penetrometer is pulled up through the stabilised column from beneath its base. Using a semi-empirical equation, whose origins lie with the Iskymeter penetrometer, the probing force is related to undrained shear strength of the stabilised column using a bearing factor, N. While N values between 10 and 15 are quoted in the literature (empirical and Scandinavian experience), few field tests and no laboratory investigations have attempted to investigate the relationship and the factors upon which N depends, thus limiting international confidence in the method. In this thesis, the results from a unique series of one-quarter-scale laboratory tests are presented and discussed. Reduced-scale PORT and PIRT penetrometers were manufactured and stabilised column construction procedures, along with penetrometer testing methods, were developed after some preliminary trials. Stabilised columns were constructed by stabilising a soft organic silt with cement and allowed to cure for various durations before penetrometer testing. Once tested, the columns were exhumed and samples taken for unconfined compression strength (UCS) testing, with UCS values up to 800 kPa observed. Exhumed columns showed evidence of cracking caused during the penetrometer test, believed to be due to the increased brittleness of the stabilised material over the parent material, and this is an important feature when interpreting the test results. The following considerations were also pertinent when interpreting the results: (i) 	The effect of curing temperature was investigated through a comparison of separate mould samples cured at constant and ambient laboratory temperatures. In addition, thermistors within a specific column (and its test basin) were used to investigate temperature variations during curing. Temperature was found to have a significant effect and was accounted for using a framework in which the curing time was adjusted for temperature {{in the same manner as}} is applied for concrete. The framework also includes for the different binder contents and variations in the soil 2 ̆ 7 s moisture content. (ii) 	Based on best-fit relationships, corrections were applied to the column samples strength to account for any strength gain that occurred between the column penetrometer test and the UCS testing of the column samples. (iii) 	A supplementary series of column tests were carried out to establish the contribution of friction to both the PORT and PIRT column tests. Using the probing force profile, corrected for friction, and the corrected column strength, the actual bearing factor N, was calculated. The results show N to compare reasonably well with the guideline value of 10 for both PORT and PIRT however, the strength of the stabilised soil column has an influence on the N value. In the upper portion of the <b>column,</b> <b>lower</b> PORT and PIRT N values were observed due to lack of confinement around the top of the column, allowing it to crack open ahead of the penetrometer. Where a surcharge was applied to the top of the basin, increased N values were noted. In the middle and lower sections of the column, PIRT N values are seen to show a constant value with depth, while PORT N values tend to increase with depth due to frictional forces experienced by the PORT penetrometer and its wire. This is the first laboratory-scale study of its kind to be conducted and provides in-depth guidance on how the factors which influence the N value may be assessed in the laboratory. Furthermore, the work has international implications for increased confidence in the interpretation of the strength of dry soil mixed columns...|$|E

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disorders}} {{are the leading}} cause of death in the United States. Members of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) class of lipid-lowering drugs are used worldwide for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disorders. Cardiovascular {{disorders are}} the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus and obesity as well as renal and liver transplantation. The rising global burden of these chronic disorders has resulted in long-term use of statins to prevent and treat cardiovascular disorders in diverse patient populations. Several statins are commercially available; however, atorvastatin calcium (Lipitor®, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, NY) is the world’s top selling medication of all time; whereas, rosuvastatin calcium (Crestor®, AstraZeneca, DE) is the most efficacious member of statin family. Although, statins are well-tolerated, approximately 7 % of patients on statin therapy experience myotoxicity, which is ranging from a mild condition called myalgia to a rare but potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis requiring hospitalization. A meta analysis study reported by the United States FDA indicated three times higher incidence of rhabdomyolysis in patients with diabetes mellitus. Previously published in vitro and clinical studies identified the role of lactone metabolites in myopathy. Our group found significantly elevated plasma concentrations of atorvastatin lactone metabolites in the stable kidney transplant recipients with diabetes mellitus. Our study indicated that reduced clearance of lactone could be attributed to decreased activity of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A 4, which is the main drug metabolizing enzyme. Prior studies assessed the effect of genetic polymorphism in drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters on pharmacokinetics and toxicological properties of parent drug and lactone metabolite in healthy Finish and Korean populations. Currently, limited information is available on the effect of concurrent diseases and genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters on pharmacokinetics of acid and lactone forms of atorvastatin. Altered pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin acid or lactone in concomitant diseases possibly influences the clinical outcome, resulting in unfavorable benefit/risk ratio. In this study, we have assessed the impact of inherent demographic characteristics in conjunction with coexisting diseases and genetic polymorphisms using a population pharmacokinetic analysis utilizing a nonlinear mixed effect model to identify potential covariates that explain the variability in pharmacokinetic properties of acid and lactone forms of atorvastatin. A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling approach was used for the prediction of pharmacokinetics of orally administered atorvastatin acid and rosuvastatin acid along with their major metabolites from in vitro data allowing mechanistic characterization of the observed concentration-time profile. A mechanistic modeling is needed to provide insights into the interplay of various phenomena involved in oral absorption and metabolism of drugs. Additionally, simulations through virtual patients using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling will allow to design a population pharmacokinetic study and to determine significant covariates. Manuscript I of this dissertation provides detailed information of pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin acid. Moreover, it describes the effect of various factors such as age, gender, race, food, liver and kidney diseases, time of drug administration, and genetic polymorphism of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters on the pharmacokinetic properties of both statins. Atorvastatin acid is significantly metabolized by CYP 3 A 4, and it is more likely to cause clinically important drug-drug interaction. Previously reported drug-drug interactions of atorvastatin are discussed in this manuscript. This manuscript will be submitted for publication to “Clinical Pharmacokinetics” as a review article. Due to lack of simple and sensitive methods for simultaneous quantification of atorvastatin and its five metabolites in human plasma, a liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) bioanalytical method was developed. Manuscript II explains in detail about the development and validation of a sensitive, selective and simple LC-MS/MS assay for simultaneous quantitative determination of parent drug and its five metabolites (published in Anal Bioanal Chem. 2011 Apr; 400 (2) : 423 - 33). Esterase activity is a key reason of instability of ester-containing drugs in biological matrices. The effect of several anticoagulants on lactone to acid interconversion was investigated by comparing different types of plasma (sodium heparin, K 2 EDTA and sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate) and serum. No, statistically significant difference was found between serum and plasma with various anticoagulants; however, sodium fluoride (esterase inhibitor) plasma was preferred to ensure stability of lactone upon long-term storage of clinical study samples. Comprehensive stability studies were conducted prior to the method validation to establish stability conditions for unstable lactone analytes during the extraction steps as well as storage duration of clinical samples. The method was validated according to recent FDA guidelines. The post-column infusion test was performed to assess matrix effect. Ortho- and para-hydroxy analytes have similar precursor ion-product ion transitions. Additionally, the acid form could possibly undergo in-source fragmentation and, following the loss of water, the resulting product would interfere with their respective lactone forms. For these combined reasons, chromatographic conditions that would assure baseline chromatographic separation of the respective analytes were determined. This goal was achieved using a narrow-bore Zorbax-SB phenyl column. Because this column provided excellent peak focusing a high S/N was obtained that enabled us to use a simple protein precipitation extraction procedure without performing pre-concentration steps for sample clean up. The extraction method contained a simple protein precipitation step requiring only 50 μL of plasma and achieved a lower limit of quantification of 50 pg/mL for all six analytes. To the best of our knowledge, no published bioanalytical method has described a fully validated LC-MS/MS assay for the quantification of rosuvastatin lactone metabolite in human plasma. A sensitive and simple LC-MS/MS assay was developed for the simultaneous quantification of parent drug and its two metabolites in human plasma. Manuscript III describes the development and validation of an LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of rosuvastatin acid and its two metabolites; N-desmethyl rosuvastatin and rosuvastatin lactone (published in Anal Bioanal Chem. 2012 Jan; 402 (3) : 1217 - 27). Like atorvastatin lactone, rosuvastatin lactone is also very unstable. Stability of all the three analytes was tested in various conditions such as non-buffered human plasma and buffered human plasma (human plasma diluted 1 : 1 with 0. 1 M, pH 4. 0 sodium acetate buffer). For the proposed assay, plasma was diluted 1 : 1 with 0. 1 M, pH 4. 0 sodium acetate buffer due to prevent the loss of lactone form (25 %) that occurred in non-buffered plasma after 1 month storage at - 80 °C. Furthermore, to ensure stability of rosuvastatin lactone metabolite during extraction of samples, 0. 1 % v/v glacial acetic acid in methanol was used as precipitating agent to minimize the interconversion of lactone to acid and vice versa. With the use of narrow-bore Zorbax-SB Phenyl <b>column,</b> <b>lower</b> limit of quantification of 0. 1 ng/mL for acid and lactone forms of rosuvastatin, and 0. 5 ng/mL for N-desmethyl rosuvastatin acid were achieved using 50 μL of buffered human plasma. The impact of concurrent chronic disorders and polymorphisms in genes coding for drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters involved in the parent drug and the major metabolite elimination were investigated through a population pharmacokinetic modeling approach using NONMEM software (Manuscript IV). The plasma concentrations of parent drug and metabolite of one hundred and thirty two, male (n= 77) or female (n= 55) non-transplant (diabetic, n= 46; non-diabetic, n= 53) or the stable kidney transplant (diabetic, n= 22; non-diabetic, n= 11) recipients receiving a single oral dose or multiple oral doses of Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium) were included in the study. The study samples were analyzed using an LC-MS/MS method described in Manuscript II. A complex parent-metabolite combined population pharmacokinetic model was developed by analyzing a total of 639 concentrations including both acid (n= 322) and lactone (n= 317) forms of atorvastatin through a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach to identify and interpret the genetic, demographic, physiological and pathological factors that significantly affect the pharmacokinetic properties of atorvastatin acid and its major metabolite. Concentration-time profiles of atorvastatin acid and lactone metabolite were adequately described respectively, using a two-compartment model with first-order oral absorption and a one-compartment model with linear elimination, with some degree of interconversion between the two forms. Covariate model building was conducted to investigate and determine sources of variability (covariates) that elucidate differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between patients, through univariate analysis followed by stepwise forward addition and backward elimination. Covariate analysis identified the kidney transplantation status and lactate dehydrogenase (liver enzyme) as significant covariates affecting the apparent clearance of atorvastatin lactone metabolite. Renal transplant recipients had 50 % lower metabolite clearance than non-transplant patients. However, polymorphisms in genes coding for enzymes and transporters as well as biomarkers of diabetes such as HbA 1 c and serum glucose levels did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either parent drug or metabolite. The final model was validated using a visual predictive check method and nonparametric bootstrap analysis, which guaranteed robustness of the present population pharmacokinetic model. The finding of the study indicated the need of careful monitoring while prescribing atorvastatin treatment to the kidney transplant population. This manuscript will be submitted for publication to “Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics” as a research article. Manuscript V (to be submitted to “Molecular Pharmaceutics”) presents a whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin acid with their respective metabolites allowing a mechanistic characterization of observed plasma concentration-time profiles of parent drug and its metabolites. Plasma samples obtained from the stable kidney transplant recipients with diabetes mellitus were analyzed using LC-MS/MS methods described in Manuscripts II and III. The GastroPlus (Simulations Plus, Inc., USA) advanced compartmental absorption and transit (ACAT) model, generic PBPK module and population estimates for age-related physiology feature were used to predict systemic exposure of both statins following an oral administration in stable kidney transplant recipients with diabetes mellitus. The required number of input parameters was obtained experimentally, in silico and from the literature. Atorvastatin acid undergoes extensive gut and hepatic metabolism mainly by CYP 3 A 4. In vitro Km and Vmax values of metabolic clearance of atorvastatin acid previously determined in our laboratory using diabetic human liver microsomal fractions were implemented in the model. The model used a built-in utility for conversion of in vitro Km and Vmax values to in vivo values. To predict observed large volume of distribution of both statins, the Berezhkovskiy algorithm was utilized to determine tissue distribution of perfusion-limited tissues. The observed mean plasma concentration-time curves for both statins and their metabolites were adequately described by the proposed PBPK model. A parameter sensitivity analysis identified that systemic exposure of both statins is significantly affected by changes in intestinal transit time. Part of the validation process included virtual trial simulations, which allowed incorporation of inter-subject variability. The virtual trial simulation results showed that the observed mean plasma concentration-time curves of both statins lay between 90 % confidence interval of simulated concentrations of ten virtual patients. The present whole-body PBPK model demonstrated that in vitro metabolic clearance data generated from a specific disease tissue were superior for adequate prediction of systemic exposure of an extensively metabolized drug that might have modified due to altered activity of drug metabolizing enzyme in a specific disease state. In summary, the work presented in this dissertation evaluate the effect of preexisting disease states including diabetes mellitus and renal transplant as well as genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters that predominantly contribute to overall disposition of atorvastatin acid and its lactone metabolite. The study indicated that the clearance of lactone, a myotoxic metabolite of atorvastatin acid, is significantly decreased by 50 % in the stable kidney transplant recipients. However, the unbalanced sample size in this study restricts to delineate the individual influence of renal transplant and diabetes mellitus on clearance of parent drug and its metabolite. In addition, for the first time the disposition of atorvastatin acid and rosuvastatin acid as well as their respective metabolites was characterized using a mechanistic modeling approach, to predict observed plasma concentration-time profiles in the kidney transplant recipients with diabetes mellitus. The PBPK model that integrated in vitro kinetic parameters for metabolic clearance of atorvastatin acid measured in human liver microsomal fractions of diabetic livers were superior for the prediction of observed plasma concentration-time curve of atorvastatin acid. Overall, this study demonstrated a significant reduction of clearance of atorvastatin lactone metabolite in patients with the kidney transplant and thus they might be at higher risk of developing myotoxicity. This finding indicated the need of careful monitoring of atorvastatin acid therapy in the kidney transplant recipients who are on multiple medications and also have lifetime co-morbidities. Moreover, mechanistic modeling suggested that the systemic exposure of both statins is very sensitive to change in intestinal transit time. It would be beneficial to study the activity of intestinal drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters in diabetes mellitus and its impact on pharmacokinetics of statins...|$|E
