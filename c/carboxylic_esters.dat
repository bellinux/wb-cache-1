5000|$|Higher eukaryotes {{have many}} {{distinct}} esterases. The different types include those that act on <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters</b> (...) [...] Carboxyl-esterases have been classified {{into three categories}} (A, B and C) {{on the basis of}} differential patterns of inhibition by organophosphates. The sequence of a number of type-B carboxylesterases indicates that the majority are evolutionarily related. As is the case for lipases and serine proteases, the catalytic apparatus of esterases involves three residues (catalytic triad): a serine, a glutamate or aspartate and a histidine. This family belongs to the superfamily of proteins with the Alpha/beta hydrolase fold.|$|E
40|$|The kinetic {{resolution}} of chiral beta-borylated <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters</b> via lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis and transesterification reactions was studied. The enantioselective hydrolysis catalyzed by CAL-B furnished the beta-borylated carboxylic acid with reasonable enantiomeric excess (62 % ee), while both methyl and ethyl beta-borylated <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters</b> were recovered with excellent ee (> 99 %). Meanwhile, the transesterification reaction of beta-borylated <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters</b> and several alcohols, catalyzed by CAL-B, only indicated a high selectivity when ethanol and methyl-(beta-pinacolylboronate) -butanoate {{were used as}} substrates, which gave ethyl-(beta-pinacolylboronate) -butanoate with > 99 % ee.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters</b> to aldehydes {{is one of}} the most useful synthetic transformation in organic synthe-sis. Therefore, many useful reduction methods have been reported for such conversions. 1 However, common reducing agents such as aluminum hydride usually reduce <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters</b> to alcohols. 2, 3 Very recently, we reported that the oxi-dation of alkoxyaluminum intermediates, which are formed by {{reduction of}} primary alcohols 4 or <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters</b> 5 with aluminum hydride, by pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) or pyridinium dichromate (PDC) gives almost quantitative yields of the corresponding aldehydes (Eq. 1). These results indi-cate that both alkoxyaluminum intermediates (1 and 2) are structurally same: the intermediates are composed of primary alkoxy group bonded to aluminum atom. Therefore, we can assume that any primary alkoxy moiety attached to alumi-num atom may undergo the oxidation to affor...|$|E

40|$|Several sytheses of a-acetolactate analogues (2 -hydroxy- 3 -oxo <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters)</b> {{and related}} {{compounds}} were developed. The {{action of the}} enzyme acetolactate decarboxylase upon these compounds was studied. A synthesis of 3 -bromo- 2 -oxo carboxylic acids, esters and amides was developed. Inhibition studies using methyl 3 -bromo- 3 -methyl- 2 -oxo butanoate with pig liver esterase indicated that the esters were not suitable mechanism-based inhibitors of the enzyme. A synthesis of 3 -hydroxy- 2 -oxo <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters</b> was developed. These compounds were found to isomerise, via alkyl group migration, to the corresponding 2 -hydroxy- 3 -oxo <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters</b> upon treatment with catalytic quantities of dibutyl tin oxide. Cyclic substrates gave access to 6, 7 and 8 -membered ring-expanded products. A one-step synthesis of 2 -hydroxy- 3 -oxo <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters,</b> in high yield, from the corresponding c 43 -unsaturated esters was developed. This involved the use of acidic manganate (VII) in aqueous acetone and {{was found to be}} superior to any synthesis of acyclic 2 - hydroxy- 3 -oxo <b>carboxylic</b> <b>esters</b> published to date. The enzyme acetolactate decarboxylase (ADC) was found to decarboxylate the (S) -isomers of CY-acetolactate and its analogues to give the corresponding (R) -(-hydroxyketones in high optical purity. The (R) -substrates were decarboxylated to (R) -ß. 1 '-hydroxyketones via prior isomerisation to (S) -(-acetolactate analogues by a tertiary ketol rearrangement involving carboxylate group migration. As a result (-acetolactate analogues with non-identical substituents at the 2 - and 3 -positions gave structurally different OF-hydroxyketone products upon decarboxylation with ADC.

The same reaction was observed for saturated, unsaturated, branched and cyclic esters.
