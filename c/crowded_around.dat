5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet slowly {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The casks brought from Cuba were leaking and the expedition was now running dangerously low on fresh water; {{the hunt for}} more became an overriding priority as the expedition advanced, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the day of Saint Lazarus, another city was spotted and named San Lázaro by the Spanish – it is now known by its original Maya name, Campeche. A large contingent put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats to fill their water casks in a freshwater pool. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. They were led amongst large buildings until they stood before a blood-caked altar, {{where many of the}} city's inhabitants <b>crowded</b> <b>around.</b> The Indians piled reeds before the visitors; this act was followed by a procession of armed Maya warriors in full war paint, followed by ten Maya priests. The Maya set fire to the reeds and indicated that the Spanish would be killed if they were not gone by the time the reeds had been consumed. The Spanish party withdrew in defensive formation to the shore and rapidly boarded their boats to retreat to the safety of the ships.|$|E

25|$|The {{final day}} of filming the pilot was Friday, November 22, 1963, {{the day of the}} {{assassination}} of President John F. Kennedy. The cast and crew found out about the assassination late that morning, Hawaii time. Between the filming of scenes, they <b>crowded</b> <b>around</b> a radio, listening to news bulletins.

25|$|Geoff Pullar (56) and David Sheppard (53) added 114 for {{the first}}-wicket in 147 minutes, {{the first century}} opening stand for England in Australia since 1946-47. But they batted slowly and the left-handed Lancastrian never settled down properly. He edged a {{boundary}} through the slips, nearly chopped McKenzie onto his stumps and was dropped by Jarman. In the end Alan Davidson (3/43) slowed down his pace and had him caught and bowled after lunch. This brought Ted Dexter striding to the crease {{and he began to}} thump the ball off the boundary fence to take England to 182/2 by tea. Colin Cowdrey (9) was caught-and-bowled by Benaud (1/71) after the break, but Dexter and Ken Barrington hit 66 runs in 86 minutes to keep the game going. They were both out on 257, Dexter yorked by McKenzie (2/61) after a magnificent 99 - few doubted that he deserved a century - and Barrington caught off Davidson for 23. This ended any chance of England winning the game - they now needed 121 runs in 40 minutes - and the Australian fielders <b>crowded</b> <b>around</b> the wicket, but there was no miracle in store for them either. Peter Parfitt was caught by Jarman off McKenzie, but Fred Titmus and Barry Knight batted out the last half hour and they finished on 278/6.|$|E

500|$|The {{book has}} also been adapted as a play by Christopher Sergel. It debuted in 1990 in Monroeville, a town that labels itself [...] "The Literary Capital of Alabama". The play runs every May on the county {{courthouse}} grounds and townspeople make up the cast. White male audience members are chosen at the intermission {{to make up the}} jury. During the courtroom scene the production moves into the Monroe County Courthouse and the audience is racially segregated. Author Albert Murray said of the relationship of the town to the novel (and the annual performance): [...] "It becomes part of the town ritual, like the religious underpinning of Mardi Gras. With the whole town <b>crowded</b> <b>around</b> the actual courthouse, it's part of a central, civic education—what Monroeville aspires to be." ...|$|E

Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar get dressed and [...] "put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport." [...] High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar ride back to Valhalla and sit down to drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from Grímnismál.|$|E

500|$|There {{was also}} a real Dayton out there, a charming Ohio city, famous as {{the birthplace of the}} Wright brothers. Its {{citizens}} energized us from the outset. Unlike the population of, say, New York City, Geneva or Washington, which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history. Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the [...] "temporary center of international peace". The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people <b>crowded</b> <b>around,</b> saying that they were praying for us. Warren Christopher was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the air base placed [...] "candles of peace" [...] in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a [...] "peace chain", although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.|$|E

500|$|The conference {{started on}} the morning of 26 August as planned. The six Rhodesian delegates took their places first, then around 40 nationalists entered and <b>crowded</b> <b>around</b> Muzorewa on the {{opposite}} side of the cramped railway carriage. Vorster and Kaunda arrived and sat on the Rhodesian side, where there was more space, and each spoke in turn, giving their blessing to the negotiations. Muzorewa then opened the proceedings at Smith's invitation. Speaking assertively, the bishop gave three concessions which would have to be given by the Rhodesian side for talks to begin: first, one man, one vote was established by Muzorewa to be [...] "a basic necessity"; second, an amnesty would have to be given for all guerrilla fighters, including those convicted of murder by the High Court in Salisbury; and finally, all of the nationalists would have to be given permission to return to Rhodesia as soon as possible to begin political campaigning. Smith replied calmly that Kaunda, Nyerere and Vorster had all assured him that the UANC had agreed not to demand preconditions for talks, and that Kaunda and Vorster had in fact confirmed this to him that same morning; his delegation was therefore surprised by Muzorewa's confrontational opening speech.|$|E
500|$|Banksia violacea grows as a shrub up to 1.5m (5ft) tall, {{with narrow}} leaves 1–2cm (0.4–0.8in) long and about 0.15cm (0.06in) wide. New growth occurs in summer, and {{flowering}} ranges from November to April with a peak in February, {{but can be}} irregular in timing. Flowers arise from typical Banksia [...] "flower spikes", and the inflorescences {{are made up of}} hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis. Roughly spherical with a diameter of 2–3cm (0.8–1.2in), the flower spikes arise from lateral stems lie partly within the foliage. Unusually for Banksia species, the inflorescences are often violet in colour, ranging anywhere from a dark violet-black through various combinations of violet and greenish-yellow in less pigmented blooms. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth made up of four fused tepals, and one long wiry style. The styles are hooked rather than straight, and are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at anthesis. The old flowers gradually fade to brown. The fruiting structure or follicle is a stout woody [...] "cone", with a hairy appearance caused by the persistence of old withered flower parts. These follicles are <b>crowded</b> <b>around</b> the globular spike (called an infructescence at this point) and are oval to rhomboid, although the crowding makes some irregularly shaped. They measure 1–2.5cm (0.4–1in) long, 0.6cm (0.2in) high and 0.8–2.2cm (0.3–0.9in) wide. They are quite flattened and lack a ridge along the valve line. When young, the follicles are greenish in colour and slightly sticky, and covered in fine white hairs, fading to tan or grey with age. They open with fire, releasing a winged wedge-shaped (cuneate) seed 2–2.5cm (0.8–1in) long. The mottled dark grey seed body is falcate (crescent-shaped) and measures 1.2–1.8cm (0.5–0.7in) long and 0.2–0.25cm (0.1in) wide, with a flattened dark brown wing 1.1–1.7cm (0.4–0.5in) wide. The woody separator has the same dimensions as the seed.|$|E
