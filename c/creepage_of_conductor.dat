Many {{researchers}} applied creepage to calculating creep force, and {{relation between}} creepage and creep force are very complex {{and it has}} been a major problem for solving rolling contact theory. The paper established the finite element model of wheel-rail rolling contact based on ALE method (Arbitrary Lagrange-Euler method) in ABAQUS, and research impact of lateral motion <b>of</b> wheelset on <b>creepage</b> <b>of</b> wheel-rail contact. Results show in the lateral movement value difference between their longitudinal creepage is small, and maximum error is less than 20 %, there is more distinct change trend about lateral creepage in left contact area than one in right contact area, and spin <b>creepage</b> <b>of</b> left wheel drop down in 4 mm lateral displacement...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{numerical}} models of railway wheel noise occurring in narrow curves. Curve squeal {{is presumed to}} issue from a lateral <b>creepage</b> <b>of</b> the wheels on the rail head. The frequency range is from around 400 to almost 8000 Hz, with noise levels up to 120 dB close to the wheel. Lateral friction forces are induced on the wheel–rail contact area (typically stick-slip forces). Due to nonlinearities of friction forces, a transient analysis <b>of</b> the lateral <b>creepage</b> <b>of</b> the wheel is performed by using an axi-harmonic model. Results give a reduced number of excited modes. It is shown that squealing modes have 3, 4 and 5 nodal diameters. These results agree with experimental investigations of squeal noise measurements. An extension of the transient model is finally discussed. It consists to study the efficiency of a noise attenuation system made of a metallic ring inserted into grooves machined into the wheel...|$|R

25|$|Just as the {{resistance}} <b>of</b> a <b>conductor</b> depends upon temperature, {{the resistance}} <b>of</b> a <b>conductor</b> depends upon strain. By placing a conductor under tension (a form of stress {{that leads to}} strain {{in the form of}} stretching <b>of</b> the <b>conductor),</b> the length <b>of</b> the section <b>of</b> <b>conductor</b> under tension increases and its cross-sectional area decreases. Both these effects contribute to increasing the resistance of the strained section <b>of</b> <b>conductor.</b> Under compression (strain in the opposite direction), the resistance of the strained section <b>of</b> <b>conductor</b> decreases.

40|$|Abstract. For {{conductors}} {{commonly used}} in the high and ultra-high voltage transmission projects, research was conducted on how ice shape, ice thickness, wind speed and angle of attack affect the static aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> ice-coated <b>conductor.</b> The ice shape and the shape <b>of</b> ice-coated <b>conductor</b> are both important factors that determine the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>conductor.</b> Sudden increase <b>of</b> lift coefficient may happen at low angle of attack. Wind speed shows less effect on aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> ice-coated <b>conductor</b> with streamlined shape than that <b>of</b> <b>conductor</b> with blunt shape.
