5|$|Tourism {{to the bay}} is {{encouraged}} by the area's climate, fishing and birding opportunities as well as sites in <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> including <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> beach, Texas State Aquarium, USS Lexington Museum, the bayfront marina, and the <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> Museum of Science and History. The bay was also {{the site of the}} 2008 U.S. Wind and Water Open, as well as the Texas International Boat Show in 2008, 2009 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|For {{transportation}} on the bay, steamboats were commonplace between <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> and Ingleside {{during the}} 1930s. Native Americans used a route {{made up of}} a series of shallow oyster beds, dubbed Reef Road. The passage, which was about 18 to 24inches in depth, could be navigated on foot or horseback during low tides to travel across the opening of Nueces Bay into <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> Bay. White settlers discovered the road in the 1860s, and it became a common way to pass from Portland to <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> via buggy, although its jagged course had to be marked with posts and horses would sometimes fall off the beds and drown. A wooden causeway connecting Portland and <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> was first constructed in 1915, but was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed by several storms. A permanent concrete bridge was erected in the 1950s, and a double lane was added in 1988. The approximately mile long structure is today known as the Nueces Bay Causeway.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, it was {{announced}} that a two-day annual event called Fiesta de la Flor would be held in <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> for Selena by the <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> Visitors Bureau. Musical acts for the first annual event included Kumbia All-Starz, Chris Pérez, Los Lobos, Jay Perez, Little Joe y la Familia, Los Palominos, Stefani Montiel of Las 3 Divas, Girl in a Coma's Nina Diaz, Las Fenix, and The Voice competitor Clarissa Serna. The event raised $13 million with an attendance of 52,000 people with 72% of whom lived outside of <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi.</b> The event sparked interest from people in 35 states and five different countries including Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador.|$|E
5|$|The first {{trading post}} on <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> Bay was {{established}} by Henry Kinney in 1838 in present-day <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi.</b> By the 1840s, the area developed into a settlement named after the bay, and a deepwater port {{was established in the}} 1870s. A bayfront that included a 32-foot overlooking statue of Jesus Christ was designed by Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum in 1928, but was turned down by the city in 1930. Later efforts to build a statue on the shore were also rejected. The bayside port would later grow into a major city, and had a population of 277,454 people during the 2000 U.S. census. In addition to <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi,</b> Kinney also found Nuecestown (known to settlers as The Motts) in 1852, near the confluence of the Nueces River and Nueces Bay. The town was attacked by Mexican robbers in 1875, and underwent a steep decline. It is now a ghost town located in the <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> city limits. The city of Ingleside was founded on the northern shore of the bay in 1854, and grew slowly. It had a population of 9,388 in the 2000 census. Likewise, the city of Portland located on the northeastern bluff between the Nueces and <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> Bays, did not grow as rapidly as <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi,</b> following its 1891 founding. During the 2000 census, it had 14,827 residents.|$|E
5|$|<b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> Bay has a {{rich history}} of human {{settlement}} along its shores {{that dates back}} millennia and {{is responsible for the}} growth of <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi,</b> and the smaller ports of Ingleside and Portland. It is an important natural estuary that supports a diverse collection of wildlife, and attracts many tourists. The bay's abundance of petroleum and natural gas has attracted industry, and its strategic location on the Texas coast is ideal for military establishment.|$|E

5|$|The bay {{has been}} {{strategically}} {{important for the}} military. General Zachary Taylor stationed his men on Rincon Point during the Mexican-American War, and a Union invasion was halted by Confederates on the same point in 1862, during the American Civil War. The Port of <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> {{was used by the}} Confederates to bring in supplies during the war effort until the Union bombarded <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> and occupied the bay and port from 1863 to 1870. In 1940, the Naval Air Station <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> was established on the bay, and by 1944 had transformed into a major base with one main air station and six additional stations. Notably, during a March 1960 practice run from the base, future Senator John McCain lost track of his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider crashed into <b>Corpus</b> <b>Christi</b> Bay and sank to the bottom. He squeezed out of the cockpit, swam ten feet to the surface, and was carried to safety by a rescue helicopter, therefore escaping without major injuries.|$|E

US 77 (future I-69E) merges with I-37 as a freeway from the south; the two continue to the north and split after crossing the Nueces River. The Interstate continues to the northwest as US 77 (future I-69E) continues to the northeast.|$|E

5|$|At landfall, Fern had {{weakened}} to {{a strong}} tropical storm as it moved further inland. Because the center of Fern was elongated, it {{was still able to}} receive moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and as a result, weakening was slow.
