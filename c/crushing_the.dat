5|$|The Union {{army had}} {{occupied}} strong defensive positions, and Meade handled his forces well, resulting in heavy losses {{for both sides}} but leaving the disposition of forces on both sides essentially unchanged.

5|$|The {{adoptive family}} of Sejanus counted two consuls among their ranks: Quintus Aelius Tubero (consul in 11 BC) and Sextus Aelius Catus (consul in AD 4), {{who was the}} father of Aelia Paetina, the second wife of the future Emperor Claudius. Sejanus' uncle, Junius Blaesus, {{distinguished}} himself as a military commander; he became proconsul of Africa in AD 21 and earned triumphal honors by <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> rebellion of Tacfarinas.|$|E
5|$|Bloody Fun Days {{theme was}} {{inspired}} by the short story Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez. The story centres on a monster called It, who spends his life in the confines of a single room, waiting in front of a chute that kittens slide down. He crushes the kittens with a hammer. One day It decides to leave the room, and encounters a world full of 'cute' animals. It responds by <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> creatures, the only thing he is capable of doing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Crush</b> <b>the</b> Castle is {{a physics}} Flash game {{developed}} by Armor Games. The Flash version {{was released on}} April 28, 2009, and versions for the iPhone and iPod Touch were released on January 19, 2010. Notable for its [...] "flinging" [...] game mechanic, which influenced the popular mobile game Angry Birds, the goal of <b>the</b> <b>Crush</b> <b>the</b> Castle is to kill all inhabitants of various castles by using a trebuchet to fling large rocks or bombs. A sequel, <b>Crush</b> <b>the</b> Castle 2, has similar gameplay, but features new maps and power-ups.|$|R

5|$|By {{complexity}} of technology: In situ technologies are usually classified either as true in situ processes or modified in situ processes. True in situ processes {{do not involve}} mining or <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> oil shale. Modified in situ processes involve drilling and fracturing the target oil shale deposit to create voids in the deposit. The voids enable a better flow of gases and fluids through the deposit, thereby increasing the volume {{and quality of the}} shale oil produced.|$|E
5|$|Castor and Pollux– An elderly {{conjoined}} twin, they usurped the Oracle of Delphi {{and decided}} who could see her. When Kratos attempted {{to see the}} Oracle without any offerings, the twin made themselves younger by using the Amulet of Uroborus and then fought Kratos. They attempted to kill the Oracle so that Kratos could not see her. After <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> Oracle under rocks, Kratos then killed the twin and took the amulet. Castor and Pollux were voiced by David W. Collins and Brad Grusnick, respectively, in Ascension.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} year, however, he allowed his pro-American {{minister}} of defense, General Lon Nol, {{to crack down}} on leftist activities, <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> Pracheachon by accusing its members of subversion and subservience to Hanoi. Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost the support of Cambodia's conservatives {{as a result of his}} failure to come to grips with the deteriorating economic situation (exacerbated by the loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/Viet Cong) and with the growing communist military presence.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the British intervened {{directly}} in 1883, the Mahdi had set about conquering much of Sudan, at the time controlled by Egypt, and had won several critical victories that provided him great wealth and modern weaponry. Colonel William Hicks, British officer appointed commander of eight-thousand Egyptian soldiers and an extensive supply train, was given the simple objective of <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> insurrection. Colonel Hicks and nearly every man in his army was killed by an overwhelming Mahdist force at the Battle of El Obeid. After this defeat, and facing immense financial difficulties in Egypt, the British government decided not to pursue further offensive action and instead selected General Charles George Gordon to lead the evacuation effort, as thousands of civilians and pounds of equipment were to be withdrawn from outposts throughout Sudan.|$|E
5|$|Commercially viable natural {{deposits}} of graphite occur {{in many parts}} of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller {{deposits of}} graphite are obtained by <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's trip {{came after}} two years of American {{attempts}} to schedule a state visit. In 1955, Washington made two attempts to organise a trip while Diệm was still prime minister, but he was too busy quelling opposition groups and his grip on power was tenuous. Diệm took care of this by <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate in the Battle for Saigon in May 1955, and then deposed Bảo Đại and proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam after his brother Ngô Đình Nhu rigged a referendum that made him head of state. Diệm was credited with 98.2% of the votes and 133% in the capital Saigon. The South Vietnamese leader's visit was organized after he indicated interest in February 1957 to US Ambassador to South Vietnam Frederick Reinhardt.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, a mulatto trader from Gorée, Pierre Baudin, moved to Itou and began {{planting}} rice and producing lime by <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> shells of mangrove oysters and cooking them in lime kilns. The French administration treated Baudin as their representative {{on the island}} and did not send others because few of the French wanted to live on the island. Being wet and marshy, Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation. The local economy was based mainly on weedy rice, which was sold in Ziguinchor or to the British in The Gambia. The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and, despite the declaration of its official abolition in the French colonial empire in 1848, slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Production {{methods for}} the {{elements}} less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or chemical reduction, or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> parent rock and floating the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide Al2O3 in molten cryolite Na3AlF6 {{and then by}} high temperature electrolytic reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with soda ash to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium. Polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Svetigrad {{began on}} May 14, 1448 when an Ottoman army, led by Sultan Murad II, besieged the {{fortress}} of Svetigrad (now Kodžadžik). After the many failed Ottoman expeditions into Albania against the League of Lezhë, a confederation of Albanian Principalities created in 1444 and headed by Skanderbeg, Murad II decided to march an army into Skanderbeg's dominions {{in order to}} capture the key Albanian fortress of Svetigrad. The fortress lay on an important route between Macedonia and Albania, and thus its occupation would give the Ottomans easy access into Albania. The force prepared by Murad was the largest force with which the Ottomans had ever attacked Skanderbeg. Murad planned to take the fortress, march into the Albanian interior, and capture the main citadel of Krujë, thus <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> Albanian League.|$|E

5|$|The {{pressure}} from the ice caused Endurance to start to take on water. To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a cofferdam, caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked. He could not prevent the {{pressure from}} the ice <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> ship though and was experienced enough {{to know when to}} stop trying. Once the ship had been destroyed he was put in charge of rescuing the stores from what had been The Ritz. With McNish in charge it took only a couple of hours to open the deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions.|$|E
5|$|At the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew {{is confronted}} by Barbossa {{and his men}} and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish {{suddenly}} arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the Queen Anne's Revenge and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena {{goes back to the}} dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.|$|E
5|$|At {{the behest}} of Empress Catherine, Şahin allowed Russians to settle in the peninsula, further infuriating Crimeans. A group of these {{settlers}} {{had been sent to}} Yeni-Kale, which remained under Russian control following the installation of Şahin as Khan. Local residents banded together to prevent the Russian settlement, rebelling against Şahin. He sent the new conscript army he had created to quash the rebellion, only to see his forces defect to the rebels. Revolt spread across the peninsula, and rebel forces advanced on Şahin's palace in Bakhchisaray. Amidst this rebellion, exiled Crimeans in Constantinople pressed the Ottoman government to act. Bowing to pressure, the government sent a fleet to Crimea, ostensibly to preserve the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. Russia, however, was quicker to act. Russian forces arrived at Yeni-Kale in February 1778, <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> revolt before the Ottoman fleet arrived. When the fleet arrived in March, it found that there were no rebels left to support. It fought a brief skirmish with the Russian navy off Akitar (modern Sevastopol), but was forced to flee. Şahin was reinstated as Khan. Minor skirmishes between the Ottoman and Russian navies continued until October 1778, when the Ottoman fleet returned defeated to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|Berry was {{the only}} member of the family thought to be able to beget children. His wife gave birth to a posthumous son in September, Henry, Duke of Bordeaux, nicknamed Dieudonné (God-given) by the Bourbons because he was thought to have secured the future of the dynasty. However the Bourbon {{succession}} was still in doubt. The Chamber of Deputies proposed amending Salic law to allow the Duchess of Angoulême to accede to the throne. On 12 June 1820, the Chambers ratified legislation that increased the number of deputies from 258 to 430. The extra deputies were to be elected by the wealthiest quarter of the population in each département. These individuals now effectively had two votes. Around the same time as the “law of the two votes”, Louis XVIII began to receive visits every Wednesday from a lady named Zoé Talon, and ordered that nobody should disturb him while he was with her. It was rumoured that he inhaled snuff from her breasts, which earned her the nickname of tabatière (snuffbox). In 1823, France embarked on a military intervention in Spain, where a revolt had occurred against the King Ferdinand VII. France succeeded in <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> rebellion, an effort headed by the Duke of Angoulême.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, {{the newly}} {{appointed}} Ottoman pasha ("governor") of the sanjak ("district") of Jerusalem, Kamil Pasha, attempted to subdue the rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil Pasha marched towards Hebron with his army in July 1855, and after <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> opposition, {{he ordered the}} local shaykhs to summon to his camp. Several of the shaykhs, including {{the leader of the}} 'Amr clan and Muslih al-'Azza, did not obey the summons. Kamil Pasha then requested that the British consul in Jerusalem, James Finn, serve as an envoy and arrange a meeting with Muslih. Finn sent his vice-consul to assure Muslih of his safety in Hebron and convinced him to meet with Kamil Pasha. Muslih was well received in Hebron and returned to Bayt Jibrin escorted by twenty of the governor's men. Soon after, the Kamil Pasha paid a visit to Bayt Jibrin to settle affairs and collect the town's overdue taxes. Kamil Pasha took an oath of loyalty from all the local shaykhs in the Hebron region, including those under the rule of Muslih al-'Azza.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was swept by a wave of reforms meant to {{centralise}} and Europeanise the government of the state. Bosnian Muslim feudal lords rejected the reforms and repeatedly revolted against the Sultan. The Ottoman military intervened in the Eyalet of Bosnia in 1831 and 1850, <b>crushing</b> <b>the</b> local feudal lords, and the set of modernising reforms known as the Tanzimat began to be implemented in the province. The Christians were underprivileged in the Ottoman Empire, and this was even more so in Bosnia than in the rest of the empire. An improvement in this respect occurred in 1862, when the Bosnian Christians (Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats) were granted more rights, including those to open new churches and to run their own schools. This came after several uprisings by the Christians, especially Serbs, who had the strongest national movement in the province. Ivan Franjo Jukić and other Bosnian Franciscans requested the right to establish a printing house in 1847, 1850, 1853, and 1857, but each time their requests were denied by the Ottoman government.|$|E
