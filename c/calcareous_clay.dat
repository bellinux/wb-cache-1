25|$|To the east, the Adriatic Sea {{provides}} a moderating Mediterranean climate for the vineyards that run along a west-east orientation in <b>calcareous</b> <b>clay</b> river valleys that {{flow from the}} mountains to the seas. In the northern region of Abruzzo, along the Marche border, the microclimates, vineyard soils and altitude of many vineyards are similar to other central Italian wine regions in Tuscany, Umbria and Marche, while the warmer, flatter, more humid and fertile vineyard sites in the southern Chieti have microclimates more similar to southern Italian wine regions like Calabria and Apulia.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} a wine region will largely dictate whether Chenin blanc is {{produced}} in a predominately sweet or dry manner, while the vineyard soil type will generally influence the overall style of the wine. Heavy clay based soils, paired with the right climate, is favorable {{to the development of}} weighty, botrytized dessert wines that need time to age and mature. Well-drained and less organic, predominately sandy soils tend to produce lighter styles of wine that mature more quickly. Chenin blanc planted in soils with a high silex content will produce wines with distinctive minerally notes, while limestone based soils will encourage wines with sharp acidity. In Vouvray the soil is predominately argilo-calcaire or <b>calcareous</b> <b>clay,</b> which produces rounded wines with both acidity and weight. In areas where schist is plentiful in the soil, Chenin blanc grapes will generally ripen earlier than in vineyards with predominately clay based soils.|$|E

40|$|The Barzaman Formation {{exposed in}} the United Arab Emirates was {{deposited}} {{as a series}} of ﬂuvial sediment sequences lying along the western margin of the Hajar Mountains, part of the Oman–UAE ophiolite. This formation consists of a sequence of rocks dominated by variably cemented and altered conglomerates comprising calcareous siltstones and <b>calcareous</b> <b>clays</b> deposited during the Miocene to Pliocene undera humid climate. The conglomerates are composed largelyof ultramafic and lesser-mafic clasts. The present study was undertaken {{in order to understand the}} occurrence and genesis of palygorskite and sepiolite in relation to the environmental changes including evaporitic and sabkha environments. Sediments were collected from two trenches and a drill hole of ∼ 22 m depth. Samples were analysed by optical petrograpy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Pedogenesis occurred at the deeper level in well cemented conglomerate which constitutes the hard crust. Post-depositional erosion started in marine phreatic or vadose zones as shown by the neoformation of serpentine from the weathering of olivine as well as of calcite and dolomite. Neoformation of palygorskite, sepiolite, dolomite and halite occurred under evaporitic conditions on <b>calcareous</b> silty <b>clay</b> facies. Relatively hot, vadose and oxidizing environmental conditions affected the calcareous siltstone facies leading to the genesisof dolomite andpalygorskite by directprecipitation fromsolution rich inCa, Mg, Al,Feand Si ions.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the type of weathering suffered by bricks belonging to a number of historic buildings in Toledo, Spain. These bricks had been exposed to either aerial or burial environments, came from different places in the selected buildings, were of different mineralogical composition, and had been fired at different temperatures. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and the analysis of their physical properties showed the best conserved to be those that had been buried. Buried Roman bricks made from non-calcareous materials fired at> 900 ºC and with a vitrified matrix showed few signs of weathering.
