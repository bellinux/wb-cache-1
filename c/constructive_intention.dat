6000|$|Now this class-war idea is one {{diametrically}} {{opposed to that}} religious-spirited Socialism which supplies the form of my general activities. This class-war idea would exacerbate the antagonism {{of the interests of}} the many individuals against the few individuals, and I would oppose the conceiving of the Whole to the self-seeking of the Individual. The spirit and <b>constructive</b> <b>intention</b> of the many to-day are no better than those of the few, poor and rich alike are over-individualized, self-seeking and non-creative; to organize the confused jostling competitions, over-reachings, envies and hatreds of to-day into two great class-hatreds and antagonisms will advance the reign of love at most only a very little, only so far as it will simplify and make plain certain issues. It may very possibly not advance the reign of love at all, but rather shatter the order we have. Socialism, as I conceive it, and as I have presented it in my book, [...] "New Worlds for Old," [...] seeks to change economic arrangements only by the way, as an aspect and outcome of a great change, a change in the spirit and method of human intercourse.|$|E
6000|$|None {{the less}} it remains true that under {{existing}} political {{conditions it is}} to the Labour Party that the Socialist must look for the mass and emotion and driving force of political Socialism. Among the wage workers of the modern civilized community Socialists are to be counted now by the hundred thousand, and in those classes alone does an intelligent self-interest march clearly and continuously in the direction of constructive civilization. In the other classes the Socialists are dispersed and miscellaneous in training and spirit, hampered by personal and social associations, presenting an enormous variety of aspects and incapable, it would seem, of co-operation except in relation to the main Socialist body, the Labour mass. Through that, and in relation and service to that, they must, it would seem, spend their political activities (I am writing now only of political activities) if they are not to be spent very largely to waste. The two other traditional parties in British politics are no doubt undergoing remarkable changes and internal disruptions, and the constructive spirit of the time is at work within them; but it does not seem that either is likely to develop anything nearly so definitely a Socialist programme as the Labour Party. The old Conservative Party, in spite of its fine aristocratic traditions, tends more and more to become the party of the adventurous Plutocracy, of the aggressive nouveau riche, inclines more and more towards the inviting financial possibilities of modern [...] "Imperialism" [...] and [...] "Tariff Reform." [...] The old Liberal Party strains between these two antagonists and its own warring and conflicting traditions of Whiggery and Radicalism. There can be no denying the great quantity of [...] "Good Will" [...] and <b>constructive</b> <b>intention</b> that finds a place in its very miscellaneous ranks, but the strong strain of obstinate and irreconcilable individualism is equally indisputable.|$|E

40|$|Repeated {{comments}} are made {{as to the}} similarity between the common <b>intention</b> <b>constructive</b> trust and proprietary estoppel, but there remains considerable confusion over the precise nature of this interrelationship. The constituent elements of each doctrine bear close comparison and, although their respective modes of operation remain distinct, they may lead to similar results. The recent redefinition of the Pallant v Morgan equity provides an opportunity to probe once more the interrelationship between these doctrines. The Pallant v Morgan equity explores {{the operation of the}} Rochefoucauld v Boustead doctrine {{in the context of the}} joint acquisition of land and demonstrates the enforceability of express oral intention based upon a wider range of unconscionablity than the detriment based conduct which dominates both the common <b>intention</b> <b>constructive</b> trust and estoppel...|$|R
60|$|In any case, it {{does not}} seem to me {{probable}} that there can be any national revolutionary movement or any complete arrest in the development of an aristocratic phase in American history. The area of the country is too great and the means of communication between the workers in different parts inadequate for a concerted rising or even for effective political action in mass. In the worst event--and it is only in the worst event that a great insurrectionary movement becomes probable--the newspapers, magazines, telephones and telegraphs, all the apparatus of discussion and popular appeal, the railways, arsenals, guns, flying machines, and all the material of warfare, will be in the hands of the property owners, and the average of betrayal among the leaders of a class, not racially homogeneous, embittered, suspicious united only by their discomforts and not by any <b>constructive</b> <b>intentions,</b> will necessarily be high. So that, though the intensifying trouble between labour and capital may mean immense social disorganisation and lawlessness, though it may even supply the popular support in new attempts at secession, I do not see in it the possibility and force for that new start which the revolutionary Socialists anticipate; I see it merely as one of several forces making, on the whole and particularly in view of the possible mediatory action of the universities, for construction and reconciliation.|$|R

40|$|Faced {{with the}} burden of {{apartheid}} history and political changes in a democratic South Africa, the male characters in Die olifantjagters (Piet van Rooyen) and Groot vyf (Johann Botha) take recourse to the apparently uncomplicated, primordial hunting field. The narrator in Van Rooyen's novel starts an ecological and developmental hunting project with the Namibian Bushmen. When he ventures into Angola on a hunting expedition he is stripped of his <b>constructive</b> <b>intentions</b> towards the African Other as he slides back into the stereotypical behaviour of the exploitative colonial hunter. The male characters in Groot vyf (Johann Botha) experience {{the dissolution of the}} bond between power and white male identity as the equivalent of the possible extinction of the Afrikaner man as an "endangered species". While shooting a film in the Kruger National Park during the 1994 elections Coen Buys is apparently bitten by a (highly symbolic) black mamba.

40|$|The Doha Round of {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} (MTNs) {{has proved to be}} egregiously problem-prone. Due to deep dissension among WTO members it had to be suspended, and efforts to revive it have so far not succeeded. Although the mercantilist mindset of the participants has been frequently blamed for the consistently tardy progress of negotiations, there is more to the situation than just a mindset. This article methodically analyzes the various steps taken since the launch of the Doha Round and dwells on the challenges faced during the MTNs. Time and again negotiating members and country groups publicized their <b>constructive</b> <b>intentions,</b> and a series of official pronouncements provided a surfeit of evidence of commitment to the objectives of the Doha Development Agenda. Ironically, {{with the passage of time}} it became obvious that those expressions of positive and virtuous intentions were completely misleading. There was a large distance between what was being said and what was being achieved in terms of tangible agreements and core modalities. It is imperative that the Doha Round be resuscitated and that the key players show flexibility and take decisive steps forward. The round is vital; the community of trading economies must not be allowed to collapse. Virtually the entire global community of traders will share in and gain from the successful outcome of the Doha Round. A failure will force them to share the shortfalls. Revival is a possible and credible objective. This article proposes a two-stage revival process. Doha, failure, multilateral negotiations, progress, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{identify}} those areas where the resulting trust may still {{have an important role}} to play in determining beneficial ownership of the family home. Although the modern judicial trend is for the courts to apply constructive trust or proprietary estoppel mechanisms in the family context, the resulting trust remains the appropriate tool for claims where the parties have purchased the property as an investment or are not in a familial or close relationship.

40|$|Discusses, with {{case law}} illustration, the {{determination}} of the equitable ownership of the family home where the property is held in the sole name of one party or joint names in the case of cohabitants. Considers the two stage approach stemming from the Lloyds Bank Plc v Rosset case: (1) finding evidence to establish a common intention to share; and (2) assessing the extent of that share. Explains how the Privy Council decision in Abbott v Abbott has suggested a more flexible way to establish a common <b>intention</b> <b>constructive</b> trust, moving from a two stage test to one composite enquiry into all the dealings of the parties in relation to the property...|$|R
40|$|Explores {{the issue}} of the share of {{beneficial}} entitlement to the family home where the legal title is jointly owned, but where there has not been an express declaration of a beneficial joint tenancy. Discusses the House of Lords judgment in Stack v Dowden which addressed this point. Explains how the judges moved the focus away from the court imposing its own sense of fairness on the parties or imputing an intention based on the circumstances to one where the concentration will be on the parties' relevant conduct. Outlines three other points of interest referred to in the judgment: (1) whether an indirect financial contribution could support a constructive trust; (2) whether proprietary estoppel and common <b>intention</b> <b>constructive</b> trusts should be assimilated; and (3) whether a mortgage liability is equivalent to a financial contribution...|$|R
25|$|Express trust: An {{express trust}} arises where a settlor {{deliberately}} and consciously decides {{to create a}} trust, over their assets, either now, or upon his or her later death. In these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument, which will either be a will or a trust deed. Almost all trusts {{dealt with in the}} trust industry are of this type. They contrast with resulting and <b>constructive</b> trusts. The <b>intention</b> of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct. For an express trust to exist, there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property. In the USA Statute of Frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value, or is real estate.|$|R
40|$|To what extent, {{following}} the decisions in Stack v Dowden and Abbott v Abbott, may a claimant acquire beneficial {{ownership in the}} family home under a constructive trust relying purely on domestic contributions as homemaker? The writers examine this question {{against the background of}} single and joint ownership cases and suggest that, in the light of recent judicial pronouncements, the criteria for establishing a common <b>intention</b> <b>constructive</b> trust enunciated by Lord Bridge in Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset may have been eroded so as to allow for a much broader inquiry of the claimant's contributions to support a constructive trust. In particular, it is submitted that this may allow the English courts to consider the same factors for both establishing and quantifying the claimant's interest in the property which, in turn, may pave the way for a closer assimilation between single and joint ownership cases in this field...|$|R
40|$|This {{commentary}} critiques the Court of Appeal {{decision of}} Southwell v Blackburn that involved a successful proprietary estoppel claim {{by a former}} cohabitant. It will argue that although the decision appears in some respects inconsistent with previous authority, it does suggest that proprietary estoppel could have a greater {{role to play in}} cohabitation disputes. Nevertheless Southwell {{is by no means a}} landmark ruling and nor is proprietary estoppel the panacea for cohabitants as it suffers many of the limitations levelled against the more commonly used common <b>intention</b> <b>constructive</b> trust. If the courts were to prioritise or develop proprietary estoppel further in this context, it would need to modify the traditional requirements of estoppel namely a representation, inducing detrimental reliance. With that process in mind, this commentary questions whether proprietary estoppel should be remodelled in the domestic consumer context to enable the doctrine to have greater application by cohabitants upon relationship breakdown...|$|R
40|$|This is the {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from}} Wiley via [URL] paper considers {{the influence of the}} Supreme Court decision in Jones v Kernott on subsequent cases. It focuses on situations with which Jones was not directly concerned, namely where there is only one legal owner of a home and a non-legal-owning cohabitant seeks to establish that he has an equitable interest in it under a common <b>intention</b> <b>constructive</b> trust. The paper argues that while judges have mostly accepted that Jones is relevant to such sole-owner cases, they have had few opportunities (and taken fewer) to move beyond the restrictive approach of Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset and allow novel outcomes in the light of Jones as yet. It is contended that this state of affairs could ultimately produce a conservative approach that is undesirable for cohabitants who make indirect or non-financial contributions to shared lives, and remain without comprehensive statutory property and financial provision on relationship breakdown...|$|R
40|$|In our thesis, we {{examined}} the motivation and travel intention potential Swedish tourists to a new beach destination in China. Two models were developed in this study: one named TBE {{that was based on}} the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and past travel experience to explore whether a modified model could predict tourists’ intention of visitation to a new beach destination; another alternative model named PPA was proposed to test whether tourists’ motivation applied in push and pull framework could be taken used as influencing factors toward attitude construction of the TPB model. The survey data were collected from 232 samples by a self-administrated questionnaire through a web survey. Frequency descriptive, t-test, bivariate correlation and multiple regression analysis were employed to test the research models and hypotheses. A tourism development project located in Hainan Island, China that was dedicating to attract Swedish tourists was used as a background in this case study. The results indicated that push and pull motivations did have a positive influence toward travel attitude, while travel attitude together with subjective norm, past travel experience and perceived behavioral control all had significant influence toward behavioral <b>intention.</b> <b>Constructive</b> recommendations were offered to enable the destination site attracting more potential Swedish tourists.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the current state of}} the law in relation to the use of common <b>intention</b> <b>constructive</b> trusts to determine disputes arising from the breakdown of relationships between cohabiting, non-married couples. It is clear that there is a need to protect vulnerable parties to a relationship and to maintain certainty with regard to property ownership, but this is a difficult balance to strike.   This examination has been conducted by analysing the key cases that have been heard in the senior courts in relation to this matter since the landmark ruling of the House of Lords in Stack v Dowden almost ten years ago.   This has identified three key issues with {{the current state of the}} law: (1) judicial confusion over whether the existence of beneficial shares in property should be imputed or implied by the courts; (2) the creation of unrealistic expectations as to the reliance that the court will place on non-financial contributions to a relationship; and (3) practical and evidential difficulties caused by its implementation.   Further analysis of the Cohabitation Rights Bill suggests that it is unlikely to overcome any of these issues because it seeks to increase, rather than reduce the role of the courts.   This article concludes that the law should be simplified such that couples are allocated the same portion of the beneficial interest in the property as their legal interest unless they expressly declare otherwise. </p...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} recent {{cases such as}} Stack v Dowden and Jones v Kernott in England and Wales where the courts have restated {{the principles of the}} common <b>intention</b> <b>constructive</b> trust over property used as the family home. Both cases deal with disputes between cohabiting unmarried couples over the family home after termination of their relationships. The courts held in those cases that the presumption is that equity follows the law. Where, for instance, the legal title is held by the cohabiting couple in joint names, they are presumed to be legal and equitable joint tenants sharing equally unless one party rebuts that presumption by establishing that either their common intention was to hold the property in different shares or the original intention of equal sharing had changed over time, leading to an ambulation of the trust (the ambulatory trust). A rebuttal of the presumption will thus focus on the context of the couple’s relationship over the period of cohabitation (time), which arguably provides a more nuanced approach. It enables the parties’ relationship to be assessed from the time of acquisition of the property to the point of separation in order to ascertain their actual intentions. The focus of the article is on the way in which time and context of home-sharing by unmarried cohabitants are being construed by the English courts and, particularly, the assumptions being made about certain types of conduct. The article seeks to argue that the cases reveal how the law remains imbued with certain ideologies and therefore reinforces a particular type cohabiting relationship, i. e., one that mimics marriage. Women continue to be portrayed as ‘wife/mother/innocent’ who require the law’s protection against men. The sociology of unmarried cohabitation may require more in-depth examination in order to determine whether these assumptions are, or remain, apposite to cohabitants...|$|R
40|$|Paul Ekblom edited this {{thematic}} {{issue of}} the journal, 'European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research' The issue was called, ‘New Thinking on Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design'. In addition Ekblom wrote the introduction chapter. Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is a familiar field of practice, particularly in English-speaking and Northern European nations, but now emerging too {{in countries such as}} Italy and France which have traditionally followed more community‐ and offender-oriented paths in crime prevention; and in Eastern Europe, Turkey and the Middle East. Although worthy of support, CPTED does have some serious limitations, which may limit its theoretical and empirical sharpness, practical relevance and its lasting adoption; and may even introduce harmful side-effects. So ‘old hands’ and ‘new hands’ alike need to proceed with some caution. The idea behind this thematic issue of EJCPR, containing articles from UK and Australia, is to support the concept of CPTED, and to respect the practical experience that has built up over the years, but to subject the language, the methodology, the theory, the detailed evidence and the working practice to <b>constructive</b> criticism. The <b>intention,</b> too, is to indicate directions in which CPTED should update and evolve as a practical but rigorous and evidence-based discipline. (Evidence of impact on crime of CPTED programmes is not covered here although equally important {{to the future of the}} approach.) In this introduction I will very briefly define and describe the basic principles of CPTED, as they are now; identify some of the main problems and limitations of CPTED; suggest some strategic ways in which CPTED and its component concepts could evolve and improve; look ahead to the papers in this issue which take things forward in quite diverse ways; and finish with a proposed redefinition of CPTED. Ideally the debate will not stop with this issue but continue elsewhere, contributing to a much-needed reinvigoration of the field...|$|R
40|$|Bernard, John C. Organic {{food has}} {{witnessed}} rapid growth {{for more than}} two decades, while local food has gained popularity in recent years. This thesis was dedicated to investigate the motivations behind the intention and purchasing behavior of organic and local foods consumers employing an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model. Additionally, a Food Fashion Involvement (FFI) scale was developed to assist in explaining intention and WTP for trendy food. Eleven experimental sessions were conducted in Newark, Delaware using a sample of 128 subjects recruited from the surrounding region. Each session included several rounds of experimental auctions and questionnaires. Sweet corn and strawberry jams were chosen as experimental products respectively representing fresh and processed categories. Generally, participants exhibited the highest WTP for organic, followed by local food. For the analysis, two methods were adapted, factor analysis and tobit regression. Factor analysis was conducted on outcome beliefs and evaluation items. Latent factors were identified for consumers’ perception of organic and local. Tobit regression models were constructed using intention and WTP as the dependent variables and social demographics, the FFI scale and the TPB items as independent variables. Results of the tobit regression suggested FFI scale to be a <b>constructive</b> predictor of <b>intention</b> and WTP, especially for fresh produce. Variables of the TPB demonstrated different significance across eight models, and General Attitude and Perceived Availability were found to have the most explanation power. In order to add more dimension to the study, models were compared from three angles, including intention versus WTP, organic versus local and fresh versus processed. Results implied that a high intention did not necessarily lead to a high WTP, vice versa. Additionally, the TPB model could predict organic purchasing intentions better than the local version. Models for fresh products also demonstrated more significance than the processed ones. University of Delaware, Department of Agricultural and Resource EconomicsM. S...|$|R
