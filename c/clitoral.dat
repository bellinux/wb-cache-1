5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect <b>clitoral</b> priapism. The drug {{trazodone}} {{is known to}} cause male priapism as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused <b>clitoral</b> priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused <b>clitoral</b> engorgement, as distinct from <b>clitoral</b> priapism, in one case, and <b>clitoral</b> priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and <b>clitoral</b> orgasms are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the <b>clitoral</b> structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual response cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both <b>clitoral</b> and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve <b>clitoral</b> orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that <b>clitoral</b> stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{a complex}} structure, containing external and internal components. It consists of the glans (including the frenulum of clitoris, which is a frenulum on the under-surface of the glans and is created by the two medial parts of the labia minora), the <b>clitoral</b> body (which is composed of two erectile bodies known as the corpora cavernosa), two <b>clitoral</b> crura, the <b>clitoral</b> hood (formed by the labia minora) and the vestibular or <b>clitoral</b> bulbs. The <b>clitoral</b> body is {{commonly referred to as}} the shaft (or internal shaft), while the length of the clitoris between the glans and the body may also be referred to as the shaft (or external shaft) because, like the shaft as a whole, it supports the glans, and its shape can be seen and felt through the <b>clitoral</b> hood.|$|E
5|$|Type II (excision) is the {{complete}} or partial {{removal of the}} inner labia, with or without removal of the <b>clitoral</b> glans and outer labia. Type IIa is removal of the inner labia; Type IIb, removal of the <b>clitoral</b> glans and inner labia; and Type IIc, removal of the <b>clitoral</b> glans, inner and outer labia. Excision in French can refer to any form of FGM.|$|E
5|$|Direct <b>clitoral</b> {{stimulation}} involves physical stimulation to {{the external}} anatomy of the clitoris– glans, hood and the external shaft. Stimulation of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, may {{have the same effect}} as direct <b>clitoral</b> stimulation. Though these areas may also receive indirect physical stimulation during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), indirect <b>clitoral</b> stimulation is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E
5|$|Motivations for <b>clitoral</b> {{modification}} and mutilation vary. Those taking hormones {{or other}} medications {{as part of}} female-to-male transition usually experience dramatic <b>clitoral</b> growth; individual desires and the difficulties of phalloplasty (construction of a penis) often result in the retention of the original genitalia with the enlarged clitoris as a penis analogue (metoidioplasty). However, the clitoris cannot reach {{the size of the}} penis through hormones. A surgery to add function to the clitoris, such as metoidioplasty, is an alternative to phalloplasty that permits retention of sexual sensation in the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of nerve endings in the clitoris, {{the majority of}} which exist specifically for sexual enjoyment, make it the human female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. Sexual stimulation of the clitoris can produce female sexual arousal and orgasm, and may be achieved by masturbation or with a sexual partner. The most effective sexual stimulation of the organ is usually through manual or oral stimulation (cunnilingus), {{often referred to as}} direct <b>clitoral</b> stimulation; in cases involving sexual penetration, these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted <b>clitoral</b> stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{carried out}} by a {{traditional}} circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut {{before the age of}} five. Procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group. They include removal of the <b>clitoral</b> hood and <b>clitoral</b> glans; removal of the inner labia; and removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva. In this last procedure, known as infibulation, a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{anatomical}} study, {{the penis}} {{can be described}} as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the urethra. With regard to nerve endings, the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 or more (for its glans or <b>clitoral</b> body as a whole) is commonly cited as being twice as many as the nerve endings found in the human penis (for its glans or body as a whole), and as more than any other part of the human body. These reports sometimes conflict with other sources on <b>clitoral</b> anatomy or those concerning the nerve endings in the human penis. For example, while some sources estimate that the human penis has 4,000 nerve endings, other sources state that the glans or the entire penile structure have the same amount of nerve endings as the <b>clitoral</b> glans, or discuss whether the uncircumcised penis has thousands more than the circumcised penis or is generally more sensitive.|$|E
5|$|Because PGAD is {{relatively}} rare and, {{as its own}} concept apart from <b>clitoral</b> priapism, has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder. In some recorded cases, PGAD was caused by, or caused, a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with arterial branches to the clitoris; surgical treatment was effective in these cases.|$|E
5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct <b>clitoral</b> stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect <b>clitoral</b> stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|Highly innervated, the glans {{exists at}} the tip of the <b>clitoral</b> body as a fibro-vascular cap, and is usually the size and shape of a pea, {{although}} it is sometimes much larger or smaller. While whether or not the glans is composed of erectile or non-erectile tissue is subject to debate (see above), it, or the entire clitoris, is estimated to have 8,000 or more sensory nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} in {{contrast}} to the glans penis, the <b>clitoral</b> glans lacks smooth muscle within its fibrovascular cap and is thus differentiated from the erectile tissues of the clitoris and bulbs; additionally, bulb size varies and may be dependent on age and estrogenization. Though the bulbs are considered the equivalent of the male spongiosum, they do not completely encircle the urethra.|$|E
5|$|The <b>clitoral</b> glans doubles in {{diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the <b>clitoral</b> hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80mm (2 to 3in) inside the vagina, on the front wall. For some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than <b>clitoral</b> stimulation. The G-spot area {{has been described as}} needing direct stimulation, such as two fingers pressed deeply into it. Attempting to stimulate the area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult because of the particular angle of penetration required.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} the series, whose name was never released, was an {{intersex}} person with a male build and stature, but who may have self-identified as female and/or been assigned female at birth. The subject had a small, probably hypospadic, penis, rudimentary scrotum, and male pubic hair pattern. The subject also had a retracted or rudimentary <b>clitoral</b> hood and vaginal opening. In most photographs the subject's face and chest are covered.|$|E
5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood. This is what leads to <b>clitoral</b> erection.|$|E
5|$|Persistent genital arousal {{disorder}} (PGAD) {{results in}} a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable genital arousal in women, with or without orgasm, unrelated to any feelings of sexual desire. <b>Clitoral</b> priapism, also known as clitorism, is a rare, potentially painful medical condition and is sometimes described as an aspect of PGAD, in which the erect clitoris does not return to its relaxed state for an unusually {{extended period of time}} (ranging from minutes to days), despite the absence of both physical and psychological stimulation; PGAD can also be associated with morphometric and vascular modifications of the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} time it {{typically}} takes a piercing to heal varies widely according to the placement of the piercing. Genital piercings can be among the quicker to heal, with piercings of the <b>clitoral</b> hood and Prince Albert piercings healing in as little as a month, though some may take longer. Navel piercings can be the slowest to heal, with one source reporting a range of six months to two full years. The prolonged healing of navel piercings may be connected to clothing friction.|$|E
5|$|The <b>clitoral</b> hood {{projects}} {{at the front}} of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft. There is considerable variation in how much of the glans protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E
25|$|Labial {{reduction}} occasionally {{includes the}} resection of the <b>clitoral</b> prepuce (<b>clitoral</b> hood) when {{the thickness of}} its skin interferes with the woman’s sexual response or is aesthetically displeasing.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{explanations}} for the G-spot were examined by Masters and Johnson, who were the first researchers to determine that the <b>clitoral</b> structures surround and extend along and within the labia. In addition to observing {{that the majority of}} their female subjects could only have <b>clitoral</b> orgasms, they found that both <b>clitoral</b> and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response. On this basis, they argued that <b>clitoral</b> stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood; their notion that this provides the clitoris with sufficient sexual stimulation has been criticized by researchers such as Elisabeth Lloyd.|$|E
25|$|A {{clinical}} trial {{published in the}} October 1962 American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported fetal masculinization of external genitalia of 14 of 59 female infants (24%) born to mothers who began high-dose (10–40mg/day) norethisterone treatment to prevent miscarriage in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (11 infants had slight <b>clitoral</b> enlargement, 1 had marked <b>clitoral</b> enlargement, 2 infants had marked <b>clitoral</b> enlargement and partial fusion of the labioscrotal folds); fetal masculinization of external genitalia of 1 of 23 female infants born to mothers who began high-dose (10–40mg/day) norethisterone treatment to prevent miscarriage after the 12th week of pregnancy (1 infant with slight <b>clitoral</b> enlargement was born to a mother who began norethisterone treatment in week 13).|$|E
25|$|Some {{degree of}} fusion of the labioscrotal folds and {{urogenital}} folds and <b>clitoral</b> enlargement can occur if exposure occurs from the 8th through the 12th week of gestation, but only <b>clitoral</b> enlargement can occur if exposure occurs after the 12th week.|$|E
25|$|General {{statistics}} {{indicate that}} 70–80% of women require direct <b>clitoral</b> stimulation to achieve orgasm. The vaginal walls contain significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris and anus, and therefore intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, from vaginal sexual stimulation {{is less likely}} to occur than from direct <b>clitoral</b> stimulation in the majority of women. Achieving orgasm solely by anal stimulation, however, is rare among women.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{research}} suggesting that greater resting {{heart rate variability}} is associated with orgasms through penile-vaginal intercourse without additional simultaneous <b>clitoral</b> stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Women's orgasms are {{preceded by}} {{erection}} of the clitoris and moistening {{of the opening}} of the vagina. Some women exhibit a sex flush, a reddening of the skin over much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. As a woman nears orgasm, the <b>clitoral</b> glans retracts under the <b>clitoral</b> hood, and the labia minora (inner lips) become darker. As orgasm becomes imminent, the outer third of the vagina tightens and narrows, while overall the vagina lengthens and dilates and also becomes congested from engorged soft tissue.|$|E
25|$|Female-specific: masculinization, {{irreversible}} voice deepening, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth), menstrual disturbances (e.g., anovulation, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea), <b>clitoral</b> enlargement, breast atrophy, uterine atrophy, teratogenicity (in female fetuses).|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s {{research}} in both {{animals and humans}} began to provide evidence that sex hormones {{play an important role}} in early life in promoting or constraining adult sex-dimorphic sexual behavior and even gender identity. Examples of apparent androgen determination of gender identity in XY people with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency in the Dominican Republic had been published, along with reports of masculinized behavior in girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and unsatisfactory sexual outcomes in adult women with CAH. Many endocrinologists were becoming skeptical that reassignment of genetic males to females was just a matter of learning and appearance, or that the newer <b>clitoral</b> reductions would be more successful than <b>clitoral</b> recessions.|$|E
25|$|Affected females mature {{normally}} {{with normal}} fertility, {{there is almost}} total regression of the genital anomaly in cases of simple <b>clitoral</b> enlargement, and {{in even the most}} severe cases, surgical correction of labioscrotal fusion is relatively simple.|$|E
25|$|Just as with erectile {{dysfunction}} in men, lack of sexual function in {{women may be}} treated with hormonal patches or tablets to correct hormonal imbalances, <b>clitoral</b> vacuum pump devices and medication to improve blood flow, sexual sensation and arousal.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} unhooding of the clitoris {{involves a}} V–to–Y {{advancement of the}} soft tissues, {{which is achieved by}} suturing the <b>clitoral</b> hood to the pubic bone in the midline (to avoid the pudendal nerves); thus, uncovering the clitoris further tightens the labia minora.|$|E
25|$|Clitoromegaly occurs, and {{frequently}} reaches its apex within 2–3 years of therapy. Sizes generally range from 3–8cm with 4–5cm being about average. This is genetically determined, but some physicians advocate topical <b>clitoral</b> testosterone {{as an adjunct}} to growth before metoidioplasty. However, this testosterone is absorbed and should be calculated into your total regimen.|$|E
25|$|In sexual {{reassignment}} surgery, in {{the case}} of the male-to-female transgender patient, labiaplasty is usually the second stage of a two-stage vaginoplasty operation, where labiaplastic techniques are applied to create labia minora and a <b>clitoral</b> hood. In this procedure, the labiaplasty is usually performed some months after the first stage of vaginoplasty.|$|E
25|$|The missionary {{position}} {{may involve}} sexual penetration or non-penetrative sex (for example, intercrural sex), and its penile-vaginal aspect {{is an example}} of ventro-ventral (front-to-front) reproductive activity. Variations of the position allow varying degrees of vaginal tightness, <b>clitoral</b> stimulation, depth of penetration, participation {{on the part of the}} woman, and the likelihood and speed of orgasm.|$|E
25|$|In the female, a {{deep groove}} forms around the phallus. The sides of it grow dorsalward as the labioscrotal folds, which {{ultimately}} form the labia majora in females. The labia minora, in contrast, arise by the continued {{growth of the}} lips of the groove on the under surface of the phallus; {{the remainder of the}} phallus forms the <b>clitoral</b> glans.|$|E
