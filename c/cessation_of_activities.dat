The growth of the group, which peaked in 1983, corresponded with the foundation of the Centre of Social Democrats (CDS) in 1976 by Jean Lecanuet, which remained independent of the activities of the senatorial group. However, from 1983, the independence of the group became more structural than political with the rise of the Rally for the Republic (RPR) group and the emergence of a senatorial majority that established a clear political position, either for or against the government.|$|E

40|$|Abstract There is {{increasing}} {{evidence for a}} role of dopamine {{in the development of}} obesity. More specifically, dopaminergic hypofunction might lead to (over) compensatory food intake. Overeating and resulting weight gain may be induced by genetic predisposition for lower dopaminergic activity, but might also be a behavioral mechanism of compensating for decreased dopamine signaling after dopaminergic overstimulation, for example after smoking cessation or overconsumption of high palatable food. This hypothesis is in line with our incidental finding of increased weight gain after discontinuation of pharmaceutical dopaminergic overstimulation in rats. These findings support the crucial role of dopaminergic signaling for eating behaviors and offer an explanation for weight-gain after <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> associated with high dopaminergic signaling. They further support the possibility that dopaminergic medication could be used to moderate food intake. </p...|$|E

40|$|Country Risk in exports {{is derived}} from the {{capacity}} of payment and the losses that insolvency can cause to the creditors. Instead, the country risk in foreign direct investment is related to breach of contract, deprivation of property rights, damage to assets or <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities.</b> The operations of foreign direct investment (FDI) are different in nature to exports. Therefore, regarding country risks some questions arise: is country risk different also?, which are the common risks and which are specific risks to exports and FDI? Both share five types of country risk: the transfer risk, the impossibility of converting currencies, the exchange rate risk, the risk of war or political violence and sovereign risk. The risk of expropriation is specific to foreign direct investment and does not affect trade. This paper makes a comparative analysis of the risks in exports and foreign direct investment. The aim is to find out to what extent they differ. The conclusions are valid for multinational firms and developing countries with a growth strategy based on FDI...|$|E
40|$|Malaria is {{frequently}} imported into nonendemic industrialized areas. In {{this study we}} collated data on the reported malaria cases in industrialized countries during the period 1985 - 95, with the object of identifying trends and promising strategies. The main outcome measures were incidence, case-fatality rates (CFRs), and attack rates in tourists returning from Kenya. Our survey showed gross underreporting and marked heterogeneity in the type and availability of national data. The total incidence or reported numbers of malaria infections in Europe increased from 6840 in 1985 to 7244 in 1995, with a peak of 8438 in 1989. The principal importing countries were France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. In the former USSR, the reported annual incidence dropped from 1145 in 1989 to 356 in 1990 after <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> in Afghanistan. Among the imported species of malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum was identified in an increasing proportion, the CFR ranging from 0 % to 3. 6 %, with consistently high rates in Germany. The attack rates among travellers to Kenya in 1990 - 95 were high, ranging from 18 to 207 per 100, 000 travellers. Our findings indicate that in industrialized countries malaria {{is associated with a}} high CFR and remains a public health problem.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to study elderly persons’ {{everyday}} life {{and the benefits of}} community-based day care rehabilitation (DCR). Further aims were to describe everyday life as experienced by elderly persons eligible for DCR and what they expected to gain from attending DCR. Participants in  study I and II were 22 prospective elderly day-care patients with physical disabilities. Interviews about their experiences of everyday life (study I) and their expectations of DCR (study II) were conducted and analysed according to a qualitative research approach called phenomenography. In study III 15 elderly persons were interviewed about changes in everyday life after having been discharged from DCR. A narrative approach was used for analysing the interviews. In Study IV occupational therapy patients’ records from 59 patients that had been discharged from DCR were analysed using deductive content analysis for describing individual treatment goals and level of goal attainment. The findings in study I, showed that <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> and social contacts resulted in feelings of resignation and dejection for some participants. Participants also described how activities and social contacts continued, albeit in a different way, and that being active resulted in feelings of pleasure. In study II the findings described expectations of participating in physical training and socialisation with others at the DCR. The findings in study III, in the form of four case-stories, described positive changes in the participants’ everyday life such as improved occupational performance and heightened sense of wellbeing. The findings indicate that {{it was a combination of}} several events that together contributed to the changes. The findings in study IV showed that “Walking” was the category that contained the highest proportion of treatment goals. A majority of the treatment goals were either completely achieved or partially achieved. DCR could have a significant impact on elderly persons’ everyday life...|$|E

The construction sector is the highest contributor to work accidents and occupational illness in Bali. Rampant construction of temporary lodging facilities or hotels in Bali can be one of the contributors to accidents. This study aims to determine the potential hazard and any dominant risk contained in a hotel development process as well as provides preventive measures to reduce such risks. In this research, the method used was descriptive qualitative. The risk of Occupational Health and Safety (K 3) was identified through JSA (Job Safety Analysis). Questionnaire survey was carried out to get feedback from the experts regarding the potential hazards identified. The dominant category of risk assessment that was rated by the concept of ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable). The research identified 45 of dominant risks contained in the phase of work structures including 43 risks classified as high risk such as : exposed to maneuver heavy equipment and vehicles, heavy equipment rolled because the excavated area slid down/ subsided, cross rope of Tower Crane disconnected / entangled on the operation, the charge fell from Tower Crane and as many as two risks were classified as very high risk (extreme risk) that is : exposed to maneuver mixer and swing Tower Crane over the edge area of the project. The risks tended to be sourced in the work environment factors and work equipment. In order to minimize the impact of K 3 risks, it is necessary to conduct risk control, evaluation activities in a daily, weekly, monthly periodic, considering a safe distance hazard source from workers, setting working hours, scenario procedures of an emergency, as well as safe work through work instruction to remind the importance of working in a healthy and safe condition...|$|E
