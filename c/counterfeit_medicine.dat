40|$|Abstract—The sale of <b>counterfeit</b> <b>medicine</b> is a {{continuously}} growing global problem costing {{billions of}} dollars and effecting hundreds of thousands of precious human lives annually. Consumers of medicine have no reliable and simple way of distinguishing genuine medicine from counterfeit. In this paper we analyzed existing techniques of <b>counterfeit</b> <b>medicine</b> identification on the bases of usability, security and scalability. Different shortcomings and security weaknesses of these re-viewed solutions are identified. Based on these observations, a set of requirements is determined. These requirements address different aspects of a complete solution, such as usability by end users, security of the system against various types of attacks and scalability of the solution. We then propose a framework for reliably ensuring the fidelity of purchased medicine. The proposed framework is simple to use for consumers and does not require specialized equipment, training or technology. The proposed framework will enable the consumers to verify the legitimateness of their purchased medication by using their mobile phones.

Discussion 					Despite clear global public health threats, surveillance for <b>counterfeit</b> <b>medicines</b> remains extremely limited, with available data pointing to an increasing global criminal trade {{that has yet to}} be addressed appropriately. Efforts by a variety of public and private sector entities, national governments, and international organizations have made inroads in combating this illicit trade, but are stymied by ineffectual governance and divergent interests.

The UK’s Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency (MHRA) {{was one of the}} first national agencies to develop and implement a strategy to combat <b>counterfeit</b> <b>medicines.</b> Exploring this experience from different perspectives provides an opportunity to build knowledge and inform others considering adopting a similar approach. Aims The aim of this research is to describe and investigate the key components in developing an anti-counterfeit medicines strategy in the UK; through describing and examining agency and stakeholder views on its development, implementation and evaluation and the roles of pharmacists and GPs within this. Methods A mixed method qualitative and quantitative research design was used which comprised four separate studies. Two semi-structured interview studies of MHRA and stakeholders participants were undertaken alongside two postal survey studies of community pharmacists and GPs. Findings The significant risk to patients resulting from <b>counterfeit</b> <b>medicines</b> underpinned the decision to develop and implement a national strategy. Stakeholders have an important role in the development of the strategy and in its implementation by securing the supply chain, sharing information, educating others, being vigilant and reporting suspicions. Pharmacists and GPs reported limited experience of <b>counterfeit</b> <b>medicines.</b> Whilst GPs reported receiving no related education or training, pharmacists frequently reported supply practices which did not align with current guidance. Conclusion There was agreement that in order to effectively combat <b>counterfeit</b> <b>medicines</b> a national strategy was required. Stakeholders from the pharmaceutical industry, regulatory bodies, medical and pharmacy professions were seen to have an important role in both its drafting and implementation. Pharmacists and GPs mainly believed that they had a role in combating <b>counterfeit</b> <b>medicines</b> however it was identified that they required better underpinning education and training.

40|$|This thesis {{will discuss}} a new {{approach}} to preventing the adulteration of prescription medicines in America. The primary thrust of the solution is based on research conducted at MIT's Auto-ID Center on radio frequency technology. The United States faces a growing threat to patient health due to the increasing rate of <b>counterfeit</b> <b>medicine</b> being introduced into the legal pharmaceutical supply chain. This has long been an unresolved global problem, but only recently has it become a major threat in America. Existing legal and technical efforts to control counterfeiting are no longer sufficient to contain the problem. The threat of counterfeits can be partially ameliorated by installing RF-capable electronic tags onto medical packaging, and creating a unique electronic product code (EPC). RF tags though, are not the only component of the required solution. New legal actions, better use of existing technical countermeasures, and industry cooperation are also required.
