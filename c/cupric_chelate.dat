40|$|<b>Cupric</b> <b>chelate</b> of {{amino acids}} hydrate is safe for all animal species/categories up to the {{authorised}} maximum of total copper content in complete feed. Consumption surveys include copper from foodstuffs of animal origin. Since the supplementation of animal feed with copper-containing compounds has not essentially changed over the last decade, {{no change in the}} contribution of foodstuffs originating from supplemented animals to the overall copper intake of consumers is expected. No concerns for consumer safety are expected from the use of <b>cupric</b> <b>chelate</b> of {{amino acids hydrate}} in animal nutrition, which would substitute for other copper sources. The additive should be considered as a skin and eye irritant and, owing to its amino acid/peptide component, as a skin/respiratory sensitiser. Potential risks to soil organisms have been identified {{as a result of the}} application of piglet manure. Levels of copper in other types of manure are too low to create a potential risk within the timescale considered. There might also be a potential environmental concern related to the contamination of sediment resulting from drainage and the run-off of copper to surface water. In order to draw a final conclusion, further model validation is needed and some further refinement to the assessment of copper-based feed additives in livestock needs to be considered, for which additional data would be required. The use of copper-containing additives in aquaculture up to the authorised maximum of total copper content in complete feeds is not expected to pose an appreciable risk to the environment. The extent to which copper-resistant bacteria contribute to the overall antibiotic resistance situation cannot be quantified at present. <b>Cupric</b> <b>chelate</b> of amino acids hydrate is recognised as an efficacious source of copper to meet animal requirements...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the effect of pulverization treatment on the antioxidant properties of water caltrop pericarps. The results showed that crude fiber was the largest proportional constituent of water caltrop pericarps, comprising 72. 3 g/ 100 g (dry basis). After 10 min milling, five fractions were obtained 1 - 5 different particle sizes (285, 211, 138, 62 and 41 pm, respectively). Comparing the effect of pulverization on the fiber component of each fraction, the fraction 1 exhibited higher hemi-cellulose but lower lignin than smaller particle size fraction except fraction 5. At a dosage of 250 mu g/mL methanol extracts, the highest free radical-scavenging ability is obtained in the fraction 5, which is found to be 78. 3 g/ 100 g, followed by the fractions 1 - 4. The same tendency was observed in the reducing power and <b>cupric</b> ions <b>chelating</b> ability. The fractions 1 and 5 contained significantly higher total phenolics and total flavonoids than fraction 2 - 4 (p < 0. 05). (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Two inhibitors of the {{biosynthesis}} of aspergillin, {{the black}} spore pigment of Aspergillus niger, have been investigated. 2, 4 -Dithiopyrimidine exerted its inhibitory effect by intracellularly <b>chelating</b> <b>cupric</b> ion required for normal pigmentation.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the in vitro antioxidant capacities of extracts from Pleurotus pulmonarius via Folin-Ciocalteu, 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging, metal <b>chelating,</b> <b>cupric</b> ion reducing antioxidant capacity, and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays. Extract compositions {{were determined by}} phenol–sulfuric acid; Coomassie Plus (Bradford) protein; Spectroquant zinc, copper, and manganese test assays; and liquid chromatography– tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Methanol-dichloromethane extract, water fraction, hot water, aqueous extract and hexane fraction exhibited the most potent extracts in the antioxidant activities. LC/MS/MS and GC/MS showed that the extracts contained ergothioneine, ergosterol, flavonoid, and phenolic compounds. The selected potent extracts were evaluated for their inhibitory effect against oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins and protective effects against hydrogen peroxide–induced cytotoxic injury in human aortic endothelial cells. The crude aqueous extract was deemed most potent {{for the prevention of}} human low-density lipoprotein oxidation and endothelial membrane damage. Ergothioneine might be the compound responsible for the activities, as supported by previous reports. Thus, P. pulmonarius may be a valuable antioxidant ingredient in functional foods or nutraceuticals...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the total phenolics content and antioxidant activity of extracts from fresh (FS), freeze-dried (FD) and hot air-dried (HD) water caltrop hulls. The antioxidant properties, including 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -pierylhydrazyl (DPPH) free-radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and <b>cupric</b> ion <b>chelating</b> ability were evaluated along with alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in this study. The results showed that total phenolics content of methanolic extracts ranged from 5. 21 - 8. 59 g GAE/ 100 g, and the extracts of FS exhibited a substantial total phenolics content (8. 59 g GAE/ 100 g) compared with other dried samples. It was found that the antioxidative effect of water caltrop hulls was strongly concentration dependent. The dose response study indicated that before reaching a threshold level, there was a positive correlation between DPPH free-radical scavenging ability and concentration of methanolic extracts. At the point where the scavenging ability of DPPH free-radical was 79. 3 %, the dose of the methanolic extracts was 0. 2 mg/mL for FS, 1. 5 mg/mL for HID, 1. 8 mg/mL for FD, and 1. 3 mg/mL for BHT. The chelating ability of three different water caltrop hull extracts reached a threshold level of only 28 % at a dose of 2 mg/mL. The total phenolics contents were higher, but IC(50) was lower in FS extracts than in other antioxidants. Compared with other treatments with antioxidants, the reducing power of FS extracts was found to be significantly more pronounced than that of HD and FD extracts, BHT and alpha-tocophcrol, at dose ranges of 0 - 1. 0 mg/mL. This finding demonstrated that FS extracts is comparable to BHT in terms of its antioxidant properties in food application...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{ethanolamine}} plasmalogen {{extracted from}} bovine brain (BBEP) in maintaining oxidative stability of bulk soybean oil and liposome made with egg phospholipids (PL) was studied. In a purified soybean oil (PSO), {{the addition of}} 200 and 1000 ppm of BBEP promoted lipid oxidation at rates of 0. 037 and 0. 071 (all rates in ln (PV) h− 1, and PV stands for peroxide value), whereas soy lecithin (SL) added in the same amount showed a trend similar to the PSO blank, which had an oxidation rate of 0. 025. The PSO with BBEP was susceptible to cupric ion catalyzed oxidation, in that the oil was oxidized {{much more quickly than}} the PSO with SL and cupric ion. In commercial soybean oil (CSO) with the presence of tocopherols, SL at 1000 ppm acted synergistically as an antioxidant with the natural tocopherols, but addition of BBEP accelerated lipid oxidation, as evidenced by the oxidative stability index (OSI) test. In the egg PL liposome, the BBEP caused a fast breakdown of the lipid hydroperoxides and consequently promoted more thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) formation. The PL oxidation in the presence of copper in the liposome was not affected by the BBEP, which indicates that the hypothesis of ethanolamine plasmalogen (EthPm) <b>chelating</b> <b>cupric</b> ion as the antioxidation mechanism was not supported. The addition of cumene hydroperoxide to the egg PL liposome promoted lipid oxidation, as indicated by a fast development of PV and TBARS. However, the result with cumene hydroperoxide failed to differentiate the effect of BBEP and SL and their concentration on lipid oxidation. On the basis of the observations from this study, we conclude that EthPm is not an antioxidant but rather a pro-oxidant in a bulk lipid system, and it has no significant antioxidant effect for PL oxidation in the liposome...|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} {{theme of}} this dissertation focuses on better utilization of egg products and exploration and resolution of problems associated with functionalities of egg lecithin and egg protein in food. Egg provides both high quality protein and lipids, especially lecithin. Egg lecithin is the second major source for commercial lecithin, and its application covers foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical fields. One of the main functionalities of egg albumen protein in food preparation is its excellent foaming property as seen in various foamy food products, such as meringues and angel food cakes. A major concern in utilizing egg lecithin as an emulsifier in food emulsions is lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation causes off-flavor and losses in nutritional quality. In emulsion systems, multiple factors could affect oxidative stability of lecithin of both soy and egg sources. In our study, the role of transition metal ions, cupric and ferric ions, in oxidative stability of egg and soy lecithin was evaluated in emulsions. The effect of pH on lipid oxidation was also examined under two concentrations for each ion (50 yM and 500 yM). For the source of EL and SL used in the studies presented in Chapter 2, {{it was found that}} egg lecithin (EL) had a similar peroxide value (PV) development pattern as soy lecithin (SL) when treated with cupric ion under both acidic and neutral pH. Acidic pH of 3 accelerated oxidation of both EL and SL, especially under high concentration of cupric ion. When treated with ferric ion, EL oxidized much faster than SL. EL had higher secondary oxidation products (TBARS) than SL. Acidic pH accelerated TBARS development for both EL and SL, but EL had more significantly increased values. Cupric ion was more powerful than ferric ion in catalyzing oxidation of both EL and SL under both acidic and neutral pH conditions as measured by PV and TBARS. Overall, SL showed better oxidative stability than EL under our experimental conditions. This study also suggests that using multiple methods is necessary in properly evaluating lipid oxidative stability, especially in the situation where lipid hydroperoxides tend to be easily decomposed. As a minor component in egg lecithin, ethanolamine plasmalogen attracted our attention because of the increased interest in studying its antioxidant effect in an in vivo and in vitro. The reported antioxidant effect might have contributed to the better oxidative stability of EL than SL as we previously found in bulk oil. To better understand the role of ethanolamine plasmalogen in maintaining oxidative stability in in vitro system, an EthPm extracted from bovine brain (BBEP) was used in our oxidation study. It was found that in the purified soybean oil (PSO) system, the addition of 200 and 1000 ppm BBEP promoted lipid oxidation, whereas SL added at the same amount showed a similar oxidation trend to the PSO control. The more BBEP is added, the faster the lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation of BBEP treatments was even faster in the presence of cupric ion than its non-cupric counterparts. In commercial soybean oil (CSO) with the presence of tocopherols, SL at 1000 ppm as an antioxidant acted synergistically with the natural tocopherols, but the addition of BBEP accelerated lipid oxidation as evidenced by the oxidative stability index (OSI). In the model liposome system, BBEP-added egg PL (EPL) liposome tended to have a fast breakdown of the lipid hydroperoxides, consequently promoted more secondary oxidation products. The oxidation of liposome lipid in the presence of copper was not affected by the presence of BBEP, which indicates that the hypothesis of ethanolamine plasmalogens <b>chelating</b> <b>cupric</b> ion as the antioxidant mechanism was not supported. The addition of cumene hydroperoxide to the EPL liposome promoted lipid oxidation as reflected by a very fast development of PV and TBARS. However, our study failed to differentiate the effect of BBEP and SL and their concentration on oxidation. It can be concluded that EthPm is not an antioxidant but rather a pro-oxidant in bulk lipid systems, whereas addition of EthPm has no significant effect on oxidation in liposome PL. While egg lipid is of a concern due to its oxidative stability when used in emulsified food, yolk lipid contamination to egg white is another issue involved in egg protein foaming. Our study revealed that a concentration as low as 0. 022 % (as-is basis) of yolk contamination caused significant reductions in foaming capacity and foaming speed. Further test confirmed that it is the neutral lipid fraction of egg yolk causing the major detrimental effect on foaming, and the phospholipids fraction did not give significant foaming reduction at a concentration as high as 0. 1 %. High-speed and short-time shearing caused no apparent damage but longer shearing time significantly impaired foaming. Foaming was significantly reduced at a temperature of 55 yC for 10 min, whereas it did not change up to 3 min at a heating temperature of 62 to 64 yC. Industrial processing steps (pumping, pipe transfer, and storage) did not produce negative effects on foaming of the final products and the controlled pasteurization was actually beneficial for good foaming performance. Therefore, it is concluded that yolk contamination of the egg white was the major factor in reducing foaming properties of the white protein. Foaming properties of egg white protein are affected by yolk lipid contamination, but proteins of basic nature may restore the foaming properties of the yolk-contaminated egg white protein. In this study, we also esterified the acidic groups on soy protein isolate (SPI) and studied the potential of such modified protein in improving foaming. It was shown that the modification changed the isoelectric point of soy protein isolate (SPI) from 4. 5 to about 10. Sonication was proven to be a very effective means to re-disperse the methanol-denatured soy protein during the reaction condition, as shown by the improved solubility profile. The sonicated-modified SPI (SMSPI), when added to the yolk-contaminated (at 0. 4 % level, as-is basis) egg white, gave significantly improved foaming properties. Addition of SMSPI (16 %, based on dry egg white, and 1. 6 % based on liquid egg white) increased the foaming performance of both pure egg white and yolk-contaminated egg white. SMSPI consistently performed better than the unmodified SPI for improving foaming. Addition of SMSPI fully restored foam expansion and foam liquid stability of 0. 4 % yolk-contaminated egg white, and it even out-performed the foaming of pure white protein. Therefore, a feasible solution to restore the foaming properties of yolk-contaminated egg white has been identified...|$|R
