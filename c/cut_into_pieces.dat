5|$|Silver treasures, {{common in}} the Scandinavian countries, are found also in Slavic areas {{including}} Poland, especially northern Poland. Silver objects, coins and decorations, often <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces,</b> {{are believed to have}} served as currency units, brought in by Jewish and Arab traders, but locally more as accumulations of wealth and symbols of prestige. The process of hiding or depositing them, besides protecting them from danger, is believed by the researchers to represent a cult ritual.|$|E
5|$|Trigg was {{appointed}} to the Virginia Land Court Commission in 1779, charged with settling land titles in Kentucky. He then settled in Kentucky himself. In 1782, a raiding party of Shawnee Indians led by British and Loyalist officers attacked Bryan Station, but were driven off. Kentucky militia companies then pursued the fleeing invaders. Trigg commanded half of the men, Daniel Boone the other. Ignoring Boone's warnings of a trap, the militiamen charged into an Indian ambush at Blue Licks. Trigg and many others, including Boone's youngest son, were killed. Trigg's body was later found <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under Guatemalan law, Maya stelae {{and other}} archaeological {{artefacts}} are {{property of the}} Guatemalan government {{and may not be}} removed from the country without its permission. In the case of Machaquilá Stela2, the monument was well known before it was stolen and its illegal removal was easy to prove. The stela itself was <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces,</b> with the face being sawn off and moved to a fish packing factory in Belize, where it was packed into boxes and shipped to California. There it was seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after being offered for sale to various institutions. The stolen portion of the stela was returned to Guatemala and is now in storage at the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a generalized cake-cutting problem {{in which we}} seek to divide multiple cakes so that two players may get their most-preferred piece selections: a choice of one piece from each cake, allowing {{for the possibility of}} linked preferences over the cakes. For two players, we show that disjoint envy-free piece selections may not exist for two cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> two <b>pieces</b> each, and they may not exist for three cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> three <b>pieces</b> each. However, there do exist such divisions for two cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> three <b>pieces</b> each, and for three cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> four <b>pieces</b> each. The resulting allocations of pieces to players are Pareto-optimal with respect to the division. We use a generalization of Sperner’s lemma on the polytope of divisions to locate solutions to our generalized cake-cutting problem...|$|R

5|$|Several large {{stones are}} set in the ground near gates or at points outside the walls of Ambohimanga. Rulers would stand atop these stones, each {{identified}} by distinct names, to deliver speeches to the public. To the south were the stones called Ambatomasina and Ambatomenaloha, while Ambatorangotina was situated to the northwest. The latter stone was of particular importance: here the twelve leaders of the Ambatofotsy clan first declared their rejection of Andrianjafy's rule and their allegiance to his nephew, Andrianampoinimerina. Upon taking the throne, Andrianampoinimerina used this site to first declare new laws and decrees that would later be announced throughout the kingdom. This was also the main site at Ambohimanga for dispensing justice. After Andrianampoinimerina's succession to the throne, he sacrificed a black zebu whose mother had died, named Lemainty ("black one"), with repeated spear thrusts; after its death, the animal was <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces</b> and buried on the site. Lemainty was thereafter regularly invoked in royal speeches and decrees to allude {{to the fate of}} those who misguidedly sought to forsake the protection of their guardian, the sovereign, and his laws.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{receives}} a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), {{a police officer}} in the vice department and, Dexter believes, the only person who loves him. Debra says she is at a crime scene and wants him to be there, because she needs his help. Dexter arrives and Debra, undercover as a prostitute, informs him that another hooker has been killed, the third in five months. Dexter inspects the victim and is shocked to learn that the chopped up corpse is bloodless. Dexter leaves, awed by the killer's technique, and says that {{due to the lack of}} blood he can't help out. At the police station, Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes (Erik King), who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something. Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion, rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be. Dexter surveils Jamie Jaworski, a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant, and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime. Once he confirms that Jaworski is guilty, Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), a domestic violence victim. Because of her violent past with her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, and Dexter secretly feels comfortable with the lack of intimacy. Rita has two young children, Astor and Cody, whom Dexter genuinely feels for. While on a date with Rita, Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces</b> with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders. Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E

25|$|In January 1899, the New York World {{published}} {{a story by}} an anonymous writer about an American soldier, Private William Lapeer, who had allegedly been deliberately infected with leprosy. The story has no basis in fact however, and the name Lapeer itself is probably a pun. Stories in other newspapers described deliberate attacks by Filipino sharpshooters upon American surgeons, chaplains, ambulances, hospitals, and wounded soldiers. An incident was described in the San Francisco Call that occurred in Escalante, Negros Occidental, where several crewmen of a landing party from the CS Recorder were fired upon and later <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces</b> by Filipino insurgents, while the insurgents were displaying a flag of truce.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another use}} of philodendrons is for {{catching}} fish. A tribe in the Colombian Amazon {{is known to}} use Philodendron craspedodromum to add poison to the water, temporarily stunning the fish, which rise up to the surface, {{where they can be}} easily scooped up. To add the poison to the water, the leaves are <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces</b> and tied together to form bundles, which are allowed to ferment for a few days. The bundles are crushed and added to the water into which the poison will dissipate. Although the toxicity of Philodendron craspedodromum is not fully known, active ingredients in the poisoning of the fish possibly are coumarins formed during the fermentation process.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{versatility}} of both vegetables, {{they were}} usually boiled or steamed, and eaten by itself or as ingredients in soups and strews. Without {{the need for}} advanced agricultural technology, taro and sweet potatoes were a prime preference for farming. Canadian missionary George MacKay said of 19th century Taiwan: ‘the bulb of the sweet potato is planted in March. In about six weeks the vines are <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces</b> eight inches long, which are planted in drills, and from these vine-cuttings the bulbs grow and are ripe {{about the end of}} June. A second crop is planted in a similar way in July and is ripe in November.’ (Ibid). The influence of sweet potatoes and taro has been vast. They are still widely present in modern-day Taiwan, be it on the streets, night markets, or in successful food chains like ‘Meet Fresh’ (or 鮮芋仙).|$|E

25|$|In 1655, Abdal Khan the Kurdish Rozhiki {{ruler of}} Bidlis, formed a private army and fought a full scale {{war against the}} Ottoman troops. Evliya Çelebi noted the {{presence}} of many Yazidis in his army. The main reason for this armed insurrection was the discord between Abdal Khan and Melek Ahmad Pasha the Ottoman governor of Van and Abdal Khan. The Ottoman troops marched onto Bidlis and committed atrocities against civilians as they passed through Rozhiki territory. Abdal Khan had built great stone redoubts around Bitlis, and also old city walls were defended by a large army of Kurdish infantry armed with muskets. Ottomans attacked the outer defensive perimeter and defeated Rozhiki soldiers, then they rushed to loot Bidlis and attacked the civilians. Once the Ottoman force established its camp in Bidlis, {{in an act of}} revenge, Abdal Khan made a failed attempt to assassinate Melek Ahmad Pasha. A unit of twenty Kurdish soldiers rode into the tent of Yusuf Kethuda, the second-in-command and fought a ferocious battle with his guards. After the fall of Bidlis, 1,400 Kurds continued to resist from the city's old citadel. While most of these surrendered and were given amnesty, 300 of them were massacred by Melek Ahmad with 70 of them dismembered by sword and <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces.</b>|$|E
25|$|On February 4, 1999, a Japanese ship {{named the}} New Carissa ran aground {{on a beach}} 2.7 miles (4.3km) north of the {{entrance}} to Coos Bay, drawing international attention to the area. The New Carissa was empty of cargo at the time, heading for the Port of Coos Bay to pick up wood chips. When the captain {{was told that the}} weather was too severe for the ship to enter port, he anchored his ship close by. The crew put out only one anchor, and it appears that this was probably on too short a chain to be effective. The subsequent US Coast Guard investigation found several other aspects of the ship's company's handling of the situation to have been poor, leading to the conclusion that human error caused the grounding. 70,000 US gallons (260 m3) of fuel oil were spilt by the vessel, with a further 165,000 to 255,000 gallons (625 to 965 m3) being deliberately set alight and burnt off later. The stern of the ship remained on the beach; the bow was towed out to sea and sunk after structural damage caused by the fire split the ship in two. In 2008, the stern of the New Carissa was <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces</b> and removed from the beach.|$|E
25|$|The {{next great}} unit of {{exchange}} in the Mali Empire was salt. Salt was as valuable, {{if not more}} valuable, than gold in sub-Saharan Africa. It was <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces</b> and spent on goods with close to equal buying power throughout the empire. While it {{was as good as}} gold in the north, it was even better in the south. The people of the south needed salt for their diet, but it was extremely rare. The northern region on the other hand had no shortage of salt. Every year merchants entered Mali via Oualata with camel loads of salt to sell in Niani. According to Ibn Battuta who visited Mali in the mid-14th century, one camel load of salt sold at Walata for 8–10 mithqals of gold, but in Mali proper it realised 20–30 ducats and sometimes even 40. One particular source of salt in the Mali Empire was salt-mining sites located in Taghaza. Ibn Battuta had written that in Taghaza there were no trees and there is only sand and the salt mines. Nobody lived in the area except the Musafa servants who worked to dig the salts and lived on dates imported from Sijilmasa and the Dar'a valley, camel meat and millet imported from the Sudan. The buildings were constructed from slabs of salt and roofed with camel skins. The salt was dug from the ground and cut into thick slabs, two of which were loaded onto each camel where they would be taken south across the desert to Oualata and sold. The value of the salt was chiefly determined by the transport costs. Ibn Battuta mentions that the value of salt increased fourfold when transported between Oualata and the Malian capital.|$|E
