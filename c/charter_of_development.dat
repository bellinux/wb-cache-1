Another decade down the road, the Millennium Development Goals, embracing many of the Kerala Model's features - with the notable omission of land reforms - became the new <b>charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>development.</b> Raj's seminal contribution to development policy thus had worldwide repercussions.|$|E
5000|$|How is it {{possible}} then {{to ensure that the}} illustrated design on paper would indeed render a stable production landscape? The term [...] "stable" [...] means that the deployed systems would meet business and non-functional requirements. The promise of the Incremental Software Architecture, therefore, is rooted in the chief principle, “First Design then Develop.” But this alone is short of avoiding financial burden caused by failing implementations. Equally important, another related tenet calls for modifying the <b>charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> organizations: The software construction phase as we know it now, should focus on proving that architecture assumptions would certainly work in production. Bottomline, [...] "software construction must follow the pace of design evolution." [...] Obviously, not the other way around. The term [...] "design evolution" [...] means that architects should drive the product development life cycle, during which the end-state architecture could be incrementally modified, while software construction follows design alterations until architecture maturity is achieved.|$|E

40|$|Organisational Development {{is said to}} be {{reaching}} an age of maturity. Articles in recent years have welcomed its growth as a discipline and advocated the direction its own further development should take. (Friedlander 1976, Burke 1976). The most insistent belief expressed in these writings seems to be that maturity will be gained through increasing quantities of ever more sophisticated research. Certainly the last decade has seen a proliferation of work in a more obviously scholarly vein than {{was the case in the}} earlier and more impassioned years <b>of</b> Organisational <b>Development’s</b> emergence. The question is whether the direction <b>of</b> these <b>developments</b> is, from that earlier standpoint, truly an advance, or whether it represents a decline <b>of</b> Organisational <b>Development</b> as a radical influence within organisations. The argument of this article is, in summary, that: (1) The original <b>charter</b> <b>of</b> Organisational <b>Development</b> was based on a programme of radical change in the quality of human relationships at work and in the distribution of power in decision making...|$|R

40|$|DoctorateThis {{research}} set out {{to examine}} the impact of the Victorian Government's Accountability Framework, on three primary schools. Located within a naturalistic paradigm, this case study research focused on the understandings and experiences of principals, other school leaders and teachers, as they completed the first three-year cycle of implementation. Using the Hargreaves, Shaw and Fink (1997) Change Frames as the basis for interviews with participants, it was revealed that participants across the three schools faced many personal and professional challenges, as they engaged in processes <b>of</b> <b>charter</b> <b>development,</b> charter implementation and review. A mix of administrative, leadership, socio-cultural and educational factors impacted both positively and negatively on the implementation. A number of these factors were found to relate directly to political challenges of the period. The study reveals a key weakness in the Accountability Framework's capacity to translate findings arising from the self-evaluative components (Annual and Triennial Review) into teaching and learning practices. The findings suggest that there is a risk that some schools may `institutionalise' the practices <b>of</b> <b>charter</b> <b>development,</b> implementation and review, to meet Education Department of Education and Training expectations, but without significantly addressing the real needs of students within the Framework's processes, strategies and outcomes. A number of recommendations are offered to help strengthen the impact of the Framework on school improvement practices, and especially teaching and learning outcomes.

To this end we have interviewed key members of some professional bodies who operate from each of the two locations in order to do some comparative analysis of what they perceive as threats or pressure, how they operate as professional organizations and how they see their futures. This is an opportunity to hear ‘voices from the field’. From the UK context three professional bodies were selected, the <b>Chartered</b> Institute <b>of</b> Builders (CIOB), the <b>Chartered</b> Institute <b>of</b> Personnel <b>Development</b> (CIPD) and the <b>Chartered</b> Institute <b>of</b> Management Accountants (CIMA). From Australia the professional bodies selected for this chapter are the Law Council of Australia (LCA), Engineers Australia (EA) and the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA).
