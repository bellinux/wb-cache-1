Chicago was effectively the Swedish-American capital, accommodating about 10% of all Swedish Americans—more than 100,000 people—making it the second-largest Swedish <b>city</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> (only Stockholm had more Swedish inhabitants).|$|E

Moreover, it was {{named one of the}} Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. It is expected that in the next 10 years these three cities will capture the largest share of multinational corporation activity in the region.|$|E

The BBC is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the City. Many national newspapers are edited in London. London is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any <b>city</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> with a total spend of around £64.2billion. The Port of London is the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45million tonnes of cargo each year.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} two largest groups, Macedonians and Albanians, are {{sometimes}} difficult, as {{in the rest of}} the country. Each group tolerate the other but they tend to avoid each other and live in what can appear as two parallel worlds. The Roma minority is on its side very deprived. Its exact size is not known because many Macedonian Roma declare themselves as belonging to other ethnic groups or simply avoid censuses. However, even if official figures are underestimated, Skopje is the <b>city</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> with the largest Roma population.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the New York City Subway, which opened in 1904, helped bind the new city together, as did additional bridges to Brooklyn. In the 1920s Manhattan experienced large arrivals of African-Americans {{as part of the}} Great Migration from the southern United States, and the Harlem Renaissance, part of a larger boom time in the Prohibition era that included new skyscrapers competing for the skyline. New York City became the most populous <b>city</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in 1925, overtaking London, which had reigned for a century. Manhattan's majority white ethnic group declined from 98.7% in 1900 to 58.3% by 1990.|$|E

5|$|Tourism {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the city's service-driven economy. Many large worldwide hotel chains have a presence in the city. One of the oldest hotels is the Hotel Majestic. Kuala Lumpur is the sixth most visited <b>city</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> with 8.9 million tourists per year. Tourism here is driven by the city's cultural diversity, relatively low costs, and wide gastronomic and shopping variety. MICE tourism, which mainly encompasses conventions— has expanded in recent years to become a vital component of the industry, and is expected to grow further once the Malaysian government's Economic Transformation Programme kicks in, and with the completion of a new 93,000m2-size MATRADE Centre in 2014. Another notable trend is the increased presence of budget hotels in the city.|$|E
5|$|With {{increasing}} industrialisation, London's {{population grew}} rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{and it was}} for {{some time in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous <b>city</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the Second World War, but had declined to 7,192,091 at the 2001 Census.
