40|$|Graduation date: 1963 A {{study was}} {{conducted}} during 1959 and 1960 on the history and productivity of the crayfish, Pacitastacus leniusculus trowbridgii, in Berry Creek, a small woodland stream in western Oregon. This included an estimation of the annual <b>crayfish</b> <b>production,</b> in terms of tissue elaborated, of a 1500 foot controlled section of the stream during 1960. The possible role of crayfish in {{the economy of the}} controlled section was explored in the light of natural food habits and feeding tests in the laboratory. Copulation and spawning proceed from mid-September through October. The majority of females over 65 mm. mature and are thought to spawn every year. Initial maturation is possible in the third year of life but the majority of crayfish enter the breeding population in their fourth year. An abrupt change in rate of abdominal width expansion at moult marks the inception of maturity in small females. When the abdominal width exceeds 50 per cent of the cephalothorax length, maturity can be expected the next fall. A correlation was found between female size and ovarian egg count. Pleopod egg counts suggest a 40 - 50 per cent mortality prior to hatching in late April to early June. Hatching and the associated characteristics of stage one and two young are discussed. The stage two young leave the female parent to take up an independent existence. Sexual differentiation can be detected in stage five and six when the primary gonopods appear in juvenile males. Their development is described. Three age classes of Juvenile crayfish were found to occupy the shallow portions of the stream. At least three age classes of adult crayfish occupy the larger pools, giving a total of at least six age classes present in the population within the controlled section. The annual growth and growth per moult relations of this population were measured and were supplemented by laboratory data. The total <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> in the controlled section amounted to nearly 13 kilograms (123 lbs/acre) of which two-thirds originated in the juveniles. In terms of stream bottom type, one-third of the total production was elaborated in the riffles, glides, and small pools while two-thirds were elaborated in the medium-sized and large pools. Exoskeleton manufacture amounted to from 21 per cent to 34 per cent of the total production. There was a shift in feeding habits as the crayfish increased in size. Nearly 65 per cent of the diet of sub-yearlings consisted of animal matter whereas adults over 80 mm. relied chiefly on plant material, less than 10 per cent of their diet being in animal form. Juvenile crayfish fed extensively on mayfly nymphs and Tendipedid larvae. Plant material in the stomachs was almost entirely of direct terrestrial origin. Feeding tests in the laboratory served to supplement the stomach contents analysis. The food basis of <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> was explored. It was estimated that nearly 107 kilograms of food was consumed by the crayfish population during 1960, of which 70 per cent was plant material of terrestrial orig 1 n. Although only 19 per cent of the incoming food was consumed in the shallows by the first two age classes, they accounted for over 31 per cent of the total animal material consumed by the population. By contrast, nearly 90 per cent of the plant material was consumed in the medium-sized and large pools by the older age groups. The minimal contribution of terrestrial primary production to the controlled section was found to be 349 kilograms (dry weight). Of this amount, about six per cent may have been consumed by the crayfish population during 1960. Finally, the productivity of crayfish in aquatic communities and factors of possible influence on <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> in the controlled section are discussed...|$|E

40|$|A {{ecological}} sub-model for rice growth, {{adapted to}} the culture processes used in the lower Mondego river valley (Portugal), is presented. The structure of the model {{is based on the}} production of carbohydrates by the photosynthesis. Parallel structures were used to simulate the development stage of the crop, and the tillering process. The model is composed of 11 state variables, 14 forcing functions, 22 rate processes, 9 parameters and 17 switches, regulatory processes and calculated values. Simulations were performed for periods ranging from January 1995 to October 1996. During this period the simulation results were compared with data on aerial rice biomass and also on the tiller density. In addition, the simulated final rice production parameters were compared with the observed values for both years. It can be stated that the model performs well in what regards prediction of final production parameters but it underestimated rice biomass during the growth period.

40|$|Linear dynamic {{viscoelastic}} properties {{have been}} used to evaluate the influence of heat processing on the microstructure of crayfish protein isolate (CFPI) in order to explore the potentials of <b>crayfish</b> in the <b>production</b> of surimi-like gel products. CFPI dispersions have been subjected to a temperature cycle that consisted of a constant heating rate temperature ramp and a rapid cooling step, following the transitions taking place in the system through the evolution of G′ and G″, under different CFPI concentrations and pH values. The influence of CFPI concentration and pH on linear viscoelasticity functions of CFPI aqueous systems before and after thermal processing has also been analysed. Occurrence of a gel-like behaviour has been found for CFPI dispersions. The mechanical spectra of CFPI gels have revealed a remarkable enhancement in gel strength by thermal processing. An apparent gel network enhancement has also been found by increasing the CFPI content or reducing the pH, excepting at the isoelectric point. The strong dependence of microstructure on pH found for thermally processed CFPI gels has been confirmed by Electron Microscopy.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{to develop a}} viable crayfish industry in Minnesota currently exists. Crayfish biomass in our inland lakes can greatly exceed that of fishes; existing harvest techniques appear to have very little impact on the year-to-year crayfish population. Thus, Minnesota's crayfish {{appear to be an}} abundant and resilient resource. There are markets for soft and hard shell crayfish for food, soft and hard shell crayfish for bait, and peeled tail meat. A Minnesota crayfish product could currently be inserted in any of these markets, but crayfish as a bait appears to be the most attractive market. There is a very high seasonal demand for bait crayfish and the wholesale prices can be in the range of $ 15 to $ 25 per lb for soft shells. In addition to bait markets, large hard shell crayfish for food have a strong international export market, but this market requires that sufficient quantities be shipped at the right times. Also, there is local interest in peeled tail meat for retail sale. We examined four widely distributed Orconectes species (O. virilis, O. propinquus, O. rusticus, O. immunis) to assess commercial soft shell production potential. Crayfish were held in production-sized shallow trays with 2 cm of water at constant temperature similar to that used for commercial soft shell production. Molting success was examined as a function of capture date, sex, and stage of maturity. The timing of life cycle events dictates to a large extent the availability and soft shell production potential of wild caught crayfish, particularly in northern latitudes where market-sized crayfish are often nonjuveniles. Adults typically molt two to three times per growing season, associated with reproductive cycles. Molting rate in the laboratory was highest when crayfish were captured just prior to the wild molt. The first molt of the season was much more synchronous than the second molt. Molt timing varied by sex. Premolt Orconectid crayfish did not change color like Procambarus sp. but could be identified by the decalcification of the cheliped merus. The harvest of several species may be required to optimize soft shell production since synchronous molts occur at different times for different species. Our economic assessment of the crayfish food market suggests that it is relatively flat. This is due to: continued high production costs (including the lack of a proven tail meat separator); regional consumption (primarily in the south-central and Pacific states); unsophisticated packaging and marketing; and seasonally available supply. Crayfish are used in much of the Midwest for fishing bait. Since it is illegal to sell live crayfish for bait in Minnesota, markets in other states will have to be targeted. Problems to overcome include reducing mortality of crayfish shipped to out-of-state markets and drops in sales when crayfish are available closer to the markets. We have analyzed the economic feasibility of food and bait soft shell <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> facilities using flow-through and recirculating systems for {{the first two years of}} operation. Bait <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> in a recirculating system appeared to be the most profitable operation and food <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> in a flow-through system appeared to be the least profitable operation. The processing of large quantities of crayfish for a commercial tail meat operation in Minnesota requires that an inexpensive, automated system be developed in order to maintain the product's economic viability. We have evaluated the necessary engineering design components for developing a relatively inexpensive automated crayfish processing system, which could be linked to extant tail meat extruders. We feel that such a system is feasible, and could cost less than $ 15, 000 retail...|$|E
40|$|Population {{dynamics}} of crayfish (Paranephrops planifrons White) in streams draining native forest and pastoral catchments, Waikato, New Zealand, were investigated from September 1996 to July 1998. Crayfish densities were generally greater in native forest streams {{because of high}} recruitment over summer, but varied greatly between streams in both land uses. Peak densities in summer were 9 crayfish m- 2 in native forest and 6 crayfish m- 2 in pasture streams, but peak biomass in summer was much greater in pasture streams. Mark-recapture data showed that crayfish, particularly juveniles, in pasture streams grew faster than in native forest streams, through both greater moult frequency and larger moult increments. Females reached reproductive size at c. 20 mm orbit-carapace length (OCL) after their first year in pasture streams, but after 2 years in native forest streams. Annual degree days > 10 °C appeared to explain {{the differences in the}} timing of life cycles. Estimates of annual <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> (range = 0. 8 - 3. 4 g dry weight m- 2 year- 1) were similar in both land uses, and P/B ratios were between 0. 95 and 1. 2.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of an external, non-invasive crayfish marking technique for population or production studies. A general-use oil-based permanent marker suitable for under water use was tested. The marker was applied on the wet carapace of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), which were kept for 14 days in open- and closed-top cages in simulated <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> ponds. There was no significant degradation of the marks {{at the end of the}} 14 day experimental trial, except from natural fouling and dirt accumulation. Marked and non-marked crayfish averaged less than 4. 5 % and 7. 0 % mortality, respectively, suggesting that this marking technique is not directly harmful to crayfish. An observed 38 % increase in crayfish “missing” from the open-top cages was probably attributable to predation and/or escapism. In closed-top cages, less than 3 % of crayfish were missing, but it was inconclusive whether the bright markings contributed to predation in the open-top trial. This technique appears to be an excellent tool for conveniently marking crayfish for indoor or outdoor studies where moulting is not expected. It produces a durable mark, can be applied directly on wet or dry surfaces, dries in 25 – 35 seconds and there are several different colour and mark combinations possible. This technique also seems promising for marking other aquatic organisms...|$|E

40|$|Iranian native {{crayfish}} includes one crayfish species, Astacus leptodactylus, {{with two}} subspecies, A. l. leptodactylus (lives in freshwater) and A. l. eichwaldi (lives in the Caspian Sea with 12 ppt salinity). Only A. leptodactylus is commonly distributed in Iranian water resources. Nearly 80 years ago local fishermen started to catch Anzali Lagoon crayfish {{and sold them}} to foreigners and embassy employees. The consumption of crayfish in Iran is very low, approximately 1 t annually. The first commercially significant crayfish harvest in Iran was 11. 3 t from Anzali Lagoon in 1985. It {{was carried out by}} a Turkish company. In 1985, the introduction of A. leptodactylus was started into suitable Iranian freshwaters. For example, crayfish from Anzali Lagoon were introduced into Arass water reservoir in 1985. Today, Arass water reservoir is the main resource of crayfish in Iran. There was no further crayfish harvest in Iran until 1993. In that year, a private Iranian company began harvesting the Iranian crayfish and exporting them to European countries. In 1993, 3. 2 t of crayfish were exported from Iran. Although there have been fluctuations between years, the export of crayfish in Iran increased remarkably after 1996. The successful results of crayfish introductions gave rise to this increase. In 2003, the export of A. leptodactylus from Iran reached the maximum level (216 t). The commercial value of exported crayfish between 2000 and 2009 varied from 1. 5 – 2. 5 million US$ annually and its amount was 106 – 211. 5 t. However, there was a reduction in the export of A. leptodactylus from Iran after 2003, to just above 100 t. In conclusion, in order to increase <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> in Iran, introduction of A. leptodactylus into suitable water resources, and management, conservation and monitoring of present crayfish populations should be carried out...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of BiologyKeith B. GidoMany native {{freshwater}} {{animals are}} imperiled {{as a result}} of habitat alteration, species introductions and climate-moderated changes in disturbance regimes. Native conservation and nonnative species management could benefit from greater understanding of critical factors promoting or inhibiting native and nonnative success in the absence of human-caused ecosystem change. The objectives of this dissertation were to (1) explain spatiotemporal patterns of native and nonnative success, (2) describe native and nonnative response to uncharacteristic wildfire disturbance, and (3) test the hypothesis that wildfire disturbance has differential effects on native and nonnative species. This research was conducted across six sites in three reaches (tributary, canyon, and valley) of the unfragmented and largely-unmodified upper Gila River Basin of southwestern New Mexico. Secondary production was measured to quantify success of native and nonnative fishes prior to wildfires during 2008 - 2011. Native fish production was greater than nonnatives across a range of environmental conditions, although nonnative fish, tadpole, and <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> could approach or exceed that of native macroinvertebrates and fishes in canyon habitats, a warmwater tributary, or in valley sites, respectively. The second objective was accomplished by measuring biomass changes of a warmwater native and nonnative community during 2010 - 2013 before and after consecutive, uncharacteristic wildfires. Several native insect and fish taxa decreased after both wildfires, whereas nonnative decreases were most pronounced for salmonids and more limited for other taxa. Finally, effects of uncharacteristic wildfires followed by extreme flooding on metapopulations of native and nonnative fishes were contrasted during 2008 - 2013. Wildfire and flood disturbances increased extinction probabilities of all native fishes while leaving many nonnative fishes unaffected. These findings revealed a swinging pendulum of native and nonnative success, wherein wildfire disturbance resulted in a pendulum swing in favor of nonnatives. Ensuring the pendulum swings back in favor of natives will be facilitated by management activities that decrease wildfire size and intensity and maintain inherent ecosystem resilience...|$|E
30|$|In Italy, {{crayfish}} {{farming is}} principally {{based on a}} few extensive family managed farms (Quaglio et al. 2008). At the moment, <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> is somewhat limited, with a production of 4.1 tons in 2009, which was principally represented by the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) (AA.VV 2011). One of the main problems for European native crayfish farming is the spread of alien crayfish species originating from North America (Kozubíkova et al. 2008; Kouba et al. 2014), which often carries crayfish plague pathogens, oomycete Aphanomyces astaci (Adelrman 1996; Hirsch et al. 2008; Aquiloni et al. 2010; Coignet et al. 2012). The most valuable crayfish species for European aquaculture is the noble crayfish (Astacus astacus), which can reach prices of 60 – 80  € kg− 1 (Bohman and Edsman 2011; Gherardi 2011) with a European production of 41 tons in 2011 (FAOSTAT 2013). The main crayfish producing countries in Europe are Spain and Italy, where 1509 tons of red swamp crayfish were produced in 2010 (Vedia and Miranda 2013). The main problem of crayfish rearing in Italy is {{the high incidence of}} aquatic mycosis during egg incubation, which has two main consequences: the hampering of the diffusion of crayfish farming and the increasing environmental impact of crayfish farms. Dead eggs can be invaded by aquatic fungi, e.g., Saprolegnia sp. and other oomycetes, which often spread to the surrounding eggs, and may result in 100 % mortality in the worst cases (Edgerton et al. 2002; Kouba et al. 2013). The diffusion of this mycosis takes on an important ecological relevance as the disinfectants used in rearing conditions can contaminate output waters and the farms can also become direct vectors of disease in natural ecosystems. This fungal disease is usually controlled by manually removing dead eggs, the application of antifungal treatments, or a combination of both (Lilley and Inglis 1997; Policar et al. 2006, 2011; Kouba et al. 2010). Many disinfectants have already been tested for the treatment of artificially incubated crayfish eggs in experimental conditions (González et al. 2009). Formaldehyde, an alternative to malachite green, {{has been found to be}} the most effective for signal (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and noble crayfish (Sáez-Royuela et al. 2009; Kouba et al. 2010). Considering that maternal incubation is usually adopted in Italy, the aim of this work was to evaluate the disinfection efficacy of a formaldehyde bath on maternally incubated noble crayfish eggs.|$|E

Since no specific commercial feeds are available for noble crayfish, itâs important to find a readily available diet, suiting the crayfishesâ nutritional demands. Therefore, seven feeds were tested on two-summer-old noble crayfish in an indoor recirculating system: three commercial diets (pellets for shrimp, marine fish and carp), and four vegetable diets (alfalfa, potatoes, a soy/rapeseed mixture and beets). The effect of these different feeds on growth, survival rate and cheliped loss was evaluated. Of all treatments, the carp feed resulted in the highest specific growth rate (SGR) (0, 45 Â± 0, 04 %. day- 1, p= 0, 005) and the lowest loss of chelipeds (6, 93 Â± 8, 07 %, p= 0, 028).

40|$|Since 1893, {{crayfish}} plague, Aphanomyces astaci Schikora, has devastated Finland’s {{most productive}} {{populations of the}} native noble crayfish, Astacus astacus, causing great losses to once very valuable fisheries and exports. Efforts to halt {{the spread of the}} plague having failed, it was decided in the late 1960 s to attempt to revive <b>crayfish</b> <b>production</b> and fisheries by introducing the plague-resistant North American signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, into infected waters. So far P. leniusculus has been stocked in more than 300 waterbodies and is currently known to reproduce in roughly 100 of them. In some lakes both species live in sympatry. We have studied the interactions of co-existing A. astacus and P. leniusculus in the small lake of Slickolampi for 30 years. According to annual trap catches and population size estimates, A. astacus was clearly dominant up {{to the end of the}} 1980 s, but in the 1990 s P. leniusculus became dominant. In the last sampling, in August 1999, it accounted for > 98 % of total catches. In the course of three decades, then, P. leniusculus has almost completely replaced A. astacus. P. leniusculus has many of the characteristics commonly found in the successful crayfish invader. Our comparative studies in this lake show that P. leniusculus individuals grow considerably more rapidly, and that females reproduce for the first time at a younger age, attain reproductive activity at a larger size, and have greater fecundity in all size groups than A. astacus. The greater abundance of chelae injury in A. astacus than in P. leniusculus and the increase in injuries with expansion of the P. leniusculus population point to agonistic encounters in which P. leniusculus is dominant. Long-term data on co-existing A. astacus and P. leniusculus demonstrate that they cannot live in sympatry without competition in which P. leniusculus with its larger body and chela size, faster growth, more aggressive behaviour and greater fecundity would be the stronger. However, a similar weakening of the A. astacus population at sites with only a minor population of P. leniusculus suggests that the elimination of A. astacus is due, not to competitive exclusion alone, but to a combination of several interacting mechanisms and that the ultimate reason for the collapse of A. astacus is the almost complete cessation of successful reproduction as a result of reproductive interference between the two species. It is therefore futile to stock productive A. astacus waters with plague-free P. leniusculus in the expectation of better total catches. P. leniusculus should be introduced only into chronically plague-infected waters. The preservation of the native A. astacus, along with efforts to secure its valuable catches, requires above all the formulation of an action plan and a greater input into research, especially on crayfish plague control, crayfish management, and interactions between P. leniusculus and A. astacus...|$|E
