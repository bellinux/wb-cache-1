40|$|In {{this paper}} we review the {{theoretical}} and empirical literature on the cost structure of the provision of air transportation and specify and estimate our own cost functions. We develop a full cost model which identifies the key <b>cost</b> <b>components</b> and then we measure those <b>costs</b> <b>component</b> by component: user costs, carrier costs, infrastructure costs, time and congestion costs, noise costs, accident costs, and pollution costs. Applying the models to data for domestic air travel in the California Corridor, the total long run average cost {{is estimated to be}} $ 0. 13 per passenger kilometer traveled. The single largest cost category is owning and operating a plane. In general, because of large fixed <b>cost</b> <b>components,</b> the average <b>cost</b> of infrastructure exceeds the marginal cost. ...|$|R

50|$|A study {{compared}} the cost efficiency of three network patterns {{in improving the}} traffic performance of a district. It first established {{the cost of the}} network system of each before evaluating the efficiency ratio for the resulting traffic improvement. The analysis showed that the most significant capital cost of development is for roads. The conventional layout has the lowest capital costs for roads followed by the fused grid at 12% higher and the Neo-traditional (grid) layout at 46% higher. When considering the opportunity cost for land dedicated to right-of-ways (ROW), the fused grid allocated 9% more land to roads than the conventional grid, while the neo-traditional grid allocated 43% more. Similar to capital costs, roads remain the key <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> of community development after accounting for on-going operations, maintenance, and replacement costs.|$|E
50|$|Inspection can {{represent}} {{a significant percentage}} of an existing product's manufacturing cost. DFI may naturally be called for in redesign of a product to reduce that <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> when it is high. However, DFI will not always reduce inspection costs: it can also lead to increased rate of inspection, because more convenient or higher quality measurement may justify increasing measurements, say from a sampling rate satisfactory to support a basic level of tolerance to a higher rate (e.g. to 100%). Or DFI may make it economical for 100% inspections to measure more features or to make repeated measures of the same feature at different points within the manufacturing process. This would be justified if it would reduce internal failure costs (such as costs of rework or scrap) or external failure costs (such as customer returns) within the cost of quality framework.|$|E

50|$|The system cost of both LRT and {{monorail}} {{composed of}} vehicles, guideway, stations and control systems. Most {{of the literature}} states that the <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> of both LRT and monorail remains the same when considering an alignment on elevated section with 50 million USD/km. However, with LRT being able to operate on ground the cost can be considerably reduced to around 30 million USD/km. The RTS traces for the Megapolis has major portion as elevated since it is proposed within the CBD and heavily urbanized areas. However, the portion that can go on ground accounts for 13 km out of proposed 75 km which is 17% of the total length. Due to the possible ground operations, the total system cost can be reduced significantly.Mainly due to the instalment of Depots/Yards and some stations on ground. An elevated depot have a huge costs associated which needs elevated structures to park the vehicles. The monorail feasibility done by the JAICA for a 23.1 km of track length has proposed a 5.3 km of track within the depots showing the extra cost. The typical ground depot is 50% less than an elevated depot, while it is similar for stations as well.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{allocation}} of fixed costs to the outputs of a multiproduct firm. First we allocate short-run fixed costs through A-S prices which allocate the long-run costs. Long-run cost functions do not generally contain a fixed <b>cost</b> <b>component.</b> We show {{what part of the}} A-S prices associated with the long-run cost is allocated to the fixed cost and what part is allocated to the variable cost of the short-run costs. Second, in those cases in which the fixed costs must be allocated directly, we alter the axioms characterizing A-S prices slightly to accommodate cost functions which have a fixed <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> and derive an allocation mechanism characterized by these axioms for cost functions including those with a fixed <b>cost</b> <b>component...</b>|$|E

40|$|Revenue capping is {{a common}} way to {{regulate}} monopolistic utilities. A common suggestion when the revenue cap is cost based is that the regulator needs to determine the revenue cap so that both fixed and variable cost components {{as closely as possible}} match the true cost of the monopoly.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{incorporate}} a market wide {{buying and selling}} pressure <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> into a spread decomposition model as spread <b>cost</b> <b>component.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper extends a commonly used trade indicator spread decomposition model to include a component common to all stocks of a specialist firm and a market wide component common to all stocks. Findings – Strong evidence is found that specialists consider this common factor <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> when they set bid and ask quotes. Some specialist firms also take {{the next logical step}} and specifically manage their firm wide stock inventories. The common factor is in percentage terms largest for securities with the highest trade frequencies. Research limitations/implications – The relative importance of the common factor spread component decreases as the pricing grid becomes finer, but remains highly significant under the decimal trading regime. Originality/value – This is the first study to document not-security-specific spread cost components that are common to all stocks for which a specialist firm makes markets and to all stocks in the market. Using the model it is shown that market wide uncertainty translates into spreads of individual securities. Bid offer spreads, Financial markets, Securities...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that a pollution tax with a fixed <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> may lead, by itself, to segregation between clean and dirty firms without heterogeneous preferences or increasing returns. We construct a simple model with two locations and two industries (clean and dirty) where pollution is {{a by-product of}} dirty good manufacturing. Under proper assumptions, a completely stratified configuration with all dirty firms clustering in one city emerges as the only equilibrium outcome {{when there is a}} fixed <b>cost</b> <b>component</b> of the pollution tax. Moreover, a stratified Pareto optimum can never be supported by a competitive spatial equilibrium with a linear pollution tax. To support such a stratified Pareto optimum, however, an effective but unconventional policy prescription is to redistribute the pollution tax revenue from the dirty to the clean city residents. ...|$|E
