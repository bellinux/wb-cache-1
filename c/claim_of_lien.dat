Anyone can file a notice <b>of</b> <b>lien</b> against property such as real estate, vehicles, or other assets of another under the Uniform Commercial Code and other laws. In most states of the United States, the validity <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> is not investigated or inquired into at the time of filing. Notices <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> (whether legally valid or not) are a cloud on the title of the property and may affect the property owner's credit rating, ability to obtain home equity loans, refinance the property or take other action with regards to the property. Notices <b>of</b> releases <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> generally must be filed before property may be transferred. The validity <b>of</b> a <b>lien</b> is determined by further legal procedures. Clearing up fraudulent notices <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> may be expensive and time consuming.

40|$|Confidential {{preliminary}} draft—Do not forward without author’s permission 1 Secret liens and {{the financial}} crisis of 2008 By Michael Simkovic This article explains the roots of financial crises {{in one of the}} oldest and most fundamental problems of commercial law: hidden leverage. Common law courts wrestled with this problem for centuries and developed a time-tested solution: the doctrine <b>of</b> secret <b>liens.</b> If the debtor becomes insolvent, the doctrine <b>of</b> secret <b>liens</b> punishes secret lien holders by subordinating their <b>claims</b> to those <b>of</b> other creditors. In other words, by overriding privately negotiated payment priorities, the doctrine <b>of</b> secret <b>liens</b> creates incentives for transparency. This article argues that legal changes over the last 80 years eroded the doctrine <b>of</b> secret <b>liens,</b> and thereby led to the financial crisis. Due to these legal changes, complex and opaque financial products received the highest priority in bankruptcy, and creditors' incentives were therefore to structure transactions using these favored financial products. The opaque credit environment that resulted permitted debtors-particularly investment banks-to hide the extent of their leverage, to the detriment of all creditors. This article argues that Congress can prevent futur...|$|R
