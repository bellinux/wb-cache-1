All shops and businesses owned by the Fula community in Freetown were closed for several days in protest of the Freetown Police failure to bring down crime in the city.|$|E
50|$|In 1912-16, a King George V set was issued. All {{values up to}} 10d (except for the 3d) were key types. The 3d and 1s-£5 {{showed the}} King and the badge of the colony - an elephant. In 1932 a new {{definitive}} was issued portraying The King and a rice field (½d to 1s) or palm and <b>cola</b> <b>trees</b> (2s to £1). This {{was followed by a}} set of 13 issued in 1933 commemorating the centenary of abolition of slavery and the death of William Wilberforce. In 1935, the Crown Agents omnibus issue commemorating The King's Silver Jubilee was issued.|$|R
5000|$|The {{kola nut}} is {{the fruit of}} the kola <b>tree,</b> a genus (<b>Cola)</b> of <b>trees</b> that are native to the {{tropical}} rainforests of Africa. The caffeine-containing fruit of the tree is used as a flavoring ingredient in beverages, and is the origin of the term [...] "cola".|$|R

40|$|Although {{the flora}} of Africa is rather poor in plant species when {{compared}} to the floras of Tropical America or South-east Asia, this vast continent is the home {{of a wide range of}} plants useful to Man. Many of these have become famous in cultivation around the world. Coffee now provides an important source of income for certain countries, and the Yams yield one of the world’s staple foods. The Oil Palm and <b>Cola</b> <b>trees</b> are widely cultivated in Africa itself and elsewhere. African Mahoganies and Ironwoods are much sought after timber trees of excellent quality. Numerous grasses and pulses are well-known for their food value, and some of the native Cucurbitaceae are appreciated additions to our vegetable diet. African plants have also made their contribution to horticulture, ranging from world-famous trees such as the African or Gabon Tulip tree and many of the South African species of Proteaceae to the multitude of East and South African succulents. The present paper provides a survey of the most important of these useful plants and will emphasize the need of further research for forestry and agricultural as well as horticultural purposes, especially as far as some still little-known but potentially important plants species are concerned. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{kola nut}} is a caffeine-containing nut of {{evergreen}} {{trees of the}} genus Cola, primarily of the species Cola acuminata and Cola nitida. Cola acuminata, an evergreen tree about 20 metres in height, has long, ovoid leaves pointed at both the ends with a leathery texture. The trees have yellow flowers with purple spots, and star-shaped fruit. Inside the fruit, about a dozen round or square seeds develop in a white seed-shell. The nut’s aroma is sweet and rose-like. The first taste is bitter, but it sweetens upon chewing. The nut can be boiled to extract the <b>cola.</b> This <b>tree</b> reaches 25 meters in height and is propagated through seeds. C. nitida and C. acuminata can easily be interchanged with other Cola species.|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of tobacco}} (Nicotiana) and Kola <b>tree</b> (<b>Cola</b> acuminata) {{extracts}} on the corrosion inhibition of an aluminium alloy 2 S (1200) grade specimens immersed in 0. 5 M sulphuric acid was investigated {{at ambient temperature}} by gravimetric and metallographic methods. Extracts of kola plant and tobacco in different concentrations were used as ‘green’ inhibitors. This paper reports the results obtained from the weight loss method, calculated corrosion rates, inhibitor efficiencies and the optical microscopy metallographic observations. Addition of different concentrations of the plants extracts gave clear reduction in weight loss and in the corrosion rate of the test samples. This apparent corrosion inhibition {{was associated with the}} protective film provided on the aluminium alloy’s surface by the complex chemical constituents of the plants extracts. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis was to {{evaluate}} the potential of pectins from the Malian medicinal <b>tree</b> <b>Cola</b> cordifolia used {{in the treatment of}} gastric ulcer and wounds. This thesis is a small contribution to the ultimate goal of providing efficient none-toxic and inexpensive medicines for the Malian population. The Department of Traditional Medicine, our collaborating partner in Bamako, wants to promote the use of renewable plant parts to guarantee a sustainable supply of medicinal plants. The structures and biological activities of the bark and leaf pectins were therefore compared in order to make recommendation on plant part substitution as debarking can damage or even kill the tree. We found that the pectins from the bark and leaves are structurally related. However, the leaf pectins are more polydisperse and heterogeneous compared to the pectins found in bark. Pectins from the bark were generally more active in the complement fixation test and the macrophage assay. Comparing the 50 °C water extracts from bark and leaf in an experimental anti-ulcer model showed comparable and dose dependent inhibition of ulcer formation. However, a clinical trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the plant parts. Powdered roots of Vernonia kotschyana are highly valued as the improved traditional medicine “Gastrosedal”. The anti-ulcer activity of the medicine has previously been attributed to the presence of saponins. In this thesis, the anti-ulcer potential of 50 °C and 100 °C water extracts depleted of saponins, but high in inulin, 98 % and 83 % respectively, were evaluated in an experimental mouse model. The tested dose corresponded to the recommended daily intake of “Gastrosedal” and this dose showed a good inhibition of ulcer formation. We therefore concluded that inulin can also be responsible important for the anti-ulcer activity of “Gastrosedal”. In Mali, gastric ailments are rather common and contribute highly to morbidity in the country. In a previous study, Helicobacter pylori was found to be present in 95 % of Malian patients with gastric ulcer. For future investigations and clinical trials, it was of interest to find a reliable and simple method for H. pylori detection. One stool and one serological based immunochromatographic method were tested, and the results showed that the sensitivity of these tests is too low in the Malian population. The low sensitivity was probably due to strain variability, in addition to high use of anti-malaria drugs, which might eradicate or lower the bio-burden of H. pylori...|$|R
