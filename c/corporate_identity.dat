5|$|The {{standard}} <b>corporate</b> <b>identity</b> {{across the}} Metrolink system uses a pale yellow and metallic silver colour scheme, with a logotype {{that consists of}} a diamond motif formed from a pattern of repeating circles and the Metrolink name. The logo, signage and publicity use the Pantograph sans regular typeface. Tram livery features yellow at the vehicle ends with grey sides and black doors, and a pattern of circles.|$|E
5|$|Pick had {{a strong}} {{interest}} in design and its use in public life. He steered the development of the London Underground's <b>corporate</b> <b>identity</b> by commissioning eye-catching commercial art, graphic design and modern architecture, establishing a highly recognisable brand, including the first versions of the roundel and typeface still used today. Under his direction, the UERL's Underground network and associated bus services expanded considerably reaching out into new areas and stimulating the growth of London's suburbs. His impact on the growth of London between the world wars led to him being likened to Baron Haussmann and Robert Moses.|$|E
5|$|British Railways {{undertook}} a massive programme to establish itself by repainting all its locomotives {{with their new}} BR numbers and replacing their previous <b>corporate</b> <b>identity</b> with its own. Gone were the tenders proclaiming the railway companies' logos, emblems and even coats of arms, {{to be replaced by}} the stark 'BRITISH RAILWAYS' lettering. The enormity of this task meant that the necessary repainting was not necessarily carried out to coincide with an overall repaint. For the Coronation Class, all locomotives had been through this process by the end of 1948 except for Nos. 6223, 6238, 6248, 6250, and 6252–6255, a total of 29 locomotives. Only thirteen locomotives out of the 29 received new liveries to accompany their renumbering.|$|E

5|$|Francis Penny Burnage, {{son-in-law}} of Charles, became {{chairman of}} Charles Churchill & Co, and Gabriel {{continued to work}} for that company. They moved quickly to add manufacturing capacity to what {{would otherwise have been}} just a sales organisation: in December 1934 the company took over Cornelius Redman & Sons, renaming it Churchill-Redman Ltd. The facility was used initially to manufacture American machine tools under licence, rather as the machine tool company had started out in the early 1900s. A particularly notable example of its output was the licence granted in 1937 by Jones & Lamson of Springfield, Vermont, for the Fay automatic lathe. It was to become a pattern for Gabriel to orchestrate take-overs of other companies but not subsume them: they would have their own management team and retain a separate <b>corporate</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Market {{and brand}} focused {{organizations}} {{are concerned with}} the expression and perception of the corporate brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the <b>corporate</b> <b>identity,</b> or brand. This type of brand management is strongly anchored in the organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of managing design {{to achieve a}} business objective was first documented in 1907. The Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation) was established in Munich by twelve architects and twelve business firms as a state-sponsored effort to better compete with Great Britain and the United States by integrating traditional craft and industrial mass-production techniques. A German designer and architect, Peter Behrens, created the entire <b>corporate</b> <b>identity</b> (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) of Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG), and {{is regarded as the}} first industrial designer in history. His work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund's initiatives and objectives and can be considered as first contribution to design management.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} EVA Air livery utilizes dark green, signifying durability, and orange, representing technological innovation. The tail globe logo {{is intended}} to represent stability and reliability, and its positioning on the tail, with one corner off the edge, represents service innovation. The EVA Air livery was updated in 2002, adding a larger typeface {{and the use of}} green covering the aircraft below the window line. The tail design and logo remained unchanged. In late 2015, EVA Air redesigned their livery and tail logo, using the dark green color on the belly, and cancelled the orange line {{on the edge of the}} tail to highlight the <b>corporate</b> <b>identity.</b> It's the third generation livery of EVA Air, symbolizing their ambition to connect Taiwan to the world.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 1998, Braathens SAFE {{changed its}} name and <b>corporate</b> <b>identity</b> to Braathens. It {{introduced}} a new livery with a blue bottom, and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract, silver wing, that became the company's new logo. The re-branding {{was an attempt to}} create an international identity, and tone down the Norwegian national symbols that had been on the airplanes since 1946. At the same time, a two-class configuration was introduced: the 'Best' section, accounting for 70% of the planes capacity, received higher seat pitch, complimentary in-flight drinks, meals and newspapers, priority boarding and refundable tickets. The 'Back' section was for discount ticket holders, who received a no-frills service with a smaller seat pitch, and were located {{at the back of the}} aircraft behind a curtain. Best tickets became NOK300 more expensive, while it became easier to purchase discounted tickets. The scheme was, according to Erik G. Braathen, an attempt to differentiate between the full-fare customers, with whom Braathens was competing with SAS, and the low-fare customers, who Braathens was competing with Ryanair and the to-be established Color Air. The scheme as first introduced on the first 737-700 that was delivered.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, companies applied {{the principles of}} <b>corporate</b> <b>identity</b> and corporate design to increase awareness and recognition by consumers and differentiation from competitors. Olivetti became famous for its attention to design through their corporate design activities. In 1936 Olivetti hired Giovanni Pintori in their publicity department and promoted Marcello Nizzoli from the product design department to develop design in a comprehensive corporate philosophy. In 1956, inspired by the compelling brand character of Olivetti, Thomas Watson, Jr., CEO of IBM, retained American architect and industrial designer Eliot Noyes to develop a corporate-wide IBM Design Program consisting of coherent brand-design strategy together with a design management system to guide and oversee the comprehensive brand identity elements of: products, graphics, exhibits, architecture, interiors and fine art. This seminal effort by Noyes, with his inclusion of Paul Rand and Charles Eames as consultants, {{is considered to be}} the first comprehensive corporate design program in America. Up to and during the 1960s, debates in the design community were focused on ergonomics, functionalism, and corporate design, while debates in management addressed Just in time, Total quality management, and product specification. The main proponents of design management at that time were AEG, Bauhaus, HfG Ulm, the British Design Council, Deutscher Werkbund, Olivetti, IBM, Peter Behrens, and Walter Paepcke.|$|E

25|$|The Metro has a {{distinctive}} design and <b>corporate</b> <b>identity,</b> to distinguish {{itself from the}} decrepit rail system it replaced and to match the livery of the buses then in use. The Calvert typeface, used for signage and in printed materials, was designed specifically for the Metro by Margaret Calvert. The <b>corporate</b> <b>identity</b> was revised in 1998, de-emphasising the Calvert font, and adding the word Metro to its M logo. A further revision made in 2008, and subsequently rolled out, re-emphasises the Calvert font, most obviously in posters and in signage at the refurbished Haymarket station in the centre of Newcastle.|$|E

5000|$|Second, a <b>corporate</b> visual <b>identity</b> symbolizes an {{organization}} for external stakeholders, and, hence, contributes to its image and reputation (Schultz, Hatch and Larsen, 2000). Van den Bosch, De Jong and Elving (2005) explored possible relationships between <b>corporate</b> visual <b>identity</b> and reputation, {{and concluded that}} <b>corporate</b> visual <b>identity</b> plays a supportive role in corporate reputations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Corporate</b> visual <b>identity</b> plays a {{significant}} role in the way an organization presents itself to both internal and external stakeholders. In general terms, a <b>corporate</b> visual <b>identity</b> expresses the values and ambitions of an organization, its business, and its characteristics. Four functions of <b>corporate</b> visual <b>identity</b> can be distinguished. Three of these are aimed at external stakeholders.|$|R
50|$|Further, {{it seems}} to be {{important}} that the organization communicates the strategic aspects of the <b>corporate</b> visual <b>identity.</b> Employees need to have knowledge of the <b>corporate</b> visual <b>identity</b> of their organization - not only the general reasons for using the <b>corporate</b> visual <b>identity,</b> such as its role in enhancing the visibility and recognizability of the organization, but also aspects of the story behind the <b>corporate</b> visual <b>identity.</b> The story should explain why the design fits the organization and what the design - in all of its elements - is intended to express.|$|R

The sample was chosen to vary in size and industry but primarily reflects small and medium-sized enterprises, all in a Swedish context. The focus on family business as facet of <b>corporate</b> brand <b>identity</b> is another limitation.
