50|$|For {{purposes}} of employment {{in a field}} that is covered by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and {{not subject to the}} Exceptions Order, once a conviction is ‘spent’, the person is considered rehabilitated and the Act treats the person as if they had never committed an offence. As a result, the conviction or caution in question {{does not need to be}} disclosed by the person when applying for most jobs, educational courses, insurance, housing applications or other purposes, unless the role applied for is ‘exempt’ from the Act. If a role is covered by the Act, it is unlawful for an employer to refuse to employ a person (or dismiss an existing employee) because the individual has a ‘spent’ caution or conviction. It is also unlawful for an organisation to knowingly carry out (or enable someone else to obtain) a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) <b>check</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> for a role which is covered by the Act. If a role is covered by the Act, the employer is only legally entitled to carry out a basic criminal check known as a Basic Disclosure (provided by DBS) which will reveal only ‘unspent’ convictions.|$|E

This paper describes the technical aspects of <b>checking</b> constraints <b>on</b> <b>a</b> building model. Specifically, we look at the feasibility of <b>checking</b> constraints <b>on</b> <b>an</b> IFC model by creating a prototype in which constraints can be entered and <b>checked</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> imported IFC model. Conclusions are drawn on the suitability of the IFC model and how IFC can be extended or adjusted to support constraint checking...|$|R
