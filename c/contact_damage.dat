During berthing operations when an OSV comes alongside a pier or an offshore installation, it may come into contact with the other structures and may expose its side structure to very large local loads, resulting in local <b>contact</b> <b>damage.</b> Traditionally, <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> was rarely addressed, or treated in a rather simplistic manner in structural design codes. Normally, it was believed that such damage could be minimized or mitigated through crew training and improving OSV operations. In the recent improvement of classification rules, design formulae are included that guide designs of side shell plating against a possible contact event. In general, the mechanism of a contact event is less understood, and the related structural designs have received very limited attention. The latest design formulation in IACS common scantlings rules is a good step forward toward a more rationalized design approach, but comprehensive design guidance is still lacking, and it remains to be defined what the limits of operation will be, beyond which <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> may occur.

The {{effects of}} thermal fatigue {{conditions}} on the mechanical and <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> behavior in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are investigated as functions of the bond coat thickness and the preparation method. Three kinds of TBCs with different thickness in the bond coat are prepared by two different methods of APS and HVOF. The static and cyclic thermal fatigues for the TBCs are conducted at temperatures of 950 and 1100 with different dwell times of 10 and 100 hr and 10 cycles at each temperature. Mechanical properties, hardness H and modulus E, in each condition and component are measured by nano-indentation. The <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> behaviors are investigated by Hertzian indentation, including the cyclic fatigue behavior {{on the surface of}} the TBCs. The TGO formation is dependent on both temperature tested and time exposed, showing a similar effect with the cyclic thermal fatigues. The mechanical properties of the TBCs are increased due to the re-sintering of the top coating and the composition change of the bond coat during the thermal fatigues.

Both FGMs were based on silicon nitride, a highly successful structural ceramic material. Spherical indentation simulates <b>contact</b> <b>damage,</b> and as cone-cracks in these structures have been suppressed, their <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> resistance has been enhanced. This research has been extended from work involving similar structures in alumina-based ceramics, and further validates a recently developed theory concerning elastic modulus-graded structures. ^ The first graded system investigated was glass-based, and the second was non-glass based. The first system was a perfectly elastic, model system, and was produced by infiltrating a low modulus oxynitride glass into a dense, high modulus, silicon nitride material to produce the gradient. The second, non-glass-based structure, graded from bulk silicon nitride (lower modulus) at the surface, to bulk silicon carbide (higher modulus) in the interior. This system was more complicated than the first, with processing defects as well as inherent residual stresses present. It also exhibited a quasi-plastic response to indentation compared to the perfectly elastic response of the model glass-based material. ^ This thesis describes the fabrication of these novel structures and their subsequent mechanical testing.

Within this context, the influence of surface integrity changes caused by abrasive grinding of the hardmetal substrate, prior to coating, is evaluated with respect to <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> resistance. Three different substrate surface finish conditions are studied: ground (G), mirror-like polished (P) and ground plus heat-treated (GTT). Tests are conducted by means of spherical indentation under increasing monotonic load and the <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> resistance is assessed. Substrate grinding enhances resistance against both crack nucleation at the coating surface and subsequent propagation into the hardmetal substrate.

A finite element method (FEM) model was formulated with different wavelengths of 1000 nm, 500 nm, 250 nm and common height of 50 nm, which gives insight on the effect of different curvature on stress field generated under indentation. Elastic-plastic properties were assigned to the metal layer and substrate while the nitride layer was assigned perfectly elastic properties. Curved interface multilayers show delamination along the metal/nitride interface and vertical cracks emanating from the ends of the delamination. FEM revealed the presence of tensile stress normal to the interface even under the contact, along with tensile radial stresses, both present at the valley part of the curve, which leads to vertical cracks associated with interfacial delamination.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{based on}} full-field indentation measurements to characterize and quantify {{the effect of}} contact in thin plates is presented. The proposed method has been employed to evaluate the indentation damage generated {{in the presence of}} bending deformation, resulting from the contact between a thin plate and a rigid sphere. For this purpose, the 3 D Digital Image Correlation (3 D-DIC) technique has been adopted to quantify the out of plane displacements at the back face of the plate. Tests were conducted using aluminum thin plates and a rigid bearing sphere to evaluate the influence of the thickness and the material behavior during contact. Information provided by the 3 D-DIC technique has been employed to perform an indirect measurement of the contact area during the loading and unloading path of the test. A symmetrical distribution in the <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> region due to the symmetry of the indenter was always observed. In the case of aluminum plates, the presence of a high level of plasticity caused shearing deformation as the load increased. Results show the full-field <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> area for different plates’ thicknesses at different loads. The <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> region was bigger when the thickness of the specimen increased, and therefore, bending deformation was reduced.

Herein, we study the <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> performance of two armour ceramics, alumina and silicon carbide, with varying microstructures and one particle-reinforced ceramic nanocomposite, alumina/silicon carbide, {{in an attempt to}} understand the microstructural mechanisms that affect plasticity and cracking under quasi-static and dynamic conditions. Quasi-static <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> was imitated using Vickers indentation over a varying load regime. Numerical analysis of the indentation size effect, performed using the proportional specimen resistance model, allowed the contributions of plastic deformation and cracking to be separated into two individual values. In all three samples, higher levels of surface energy were found to correlate with increased amounts of cracking per unit area of indentation impression. Analytical modelling of crack initiation during Vickers indentation together with quantitative measurements of surface flaw populations revealed that such an increase in cracking damage was the result of higher densities of larger flaws. The hardness of the monolithic ceramics was found vary based on grain size and porosity levels, a smaller average grain size and lower porosity levels resulting in higher hardness values. In the nanocomposite materials, hardening was found to occur with further additions of silicon carbide nanoparticles. Such an effect has been attributed to the increased dislocation densities, as measured using Cr 3 +/Al 2 O 3 fluorescence spectroscopy, and the impedance of dislocation movement within the lattice due to the presence of silicon carbide nanoparticles. In order to simulate dynamic <b>contact</b> <b>damage,</b> a low velocity, scaled-down drop-weight test was designed and developed. The dynamic <b>contact</b> <b>damage</b> resistance was determined based on the depth of penetration of a blunt indenter. In the monolithic ceramics, the indenter penetration was found to be shallower in materials of higher hardness. However, the nanocomposite materials displayed an opposing trend, the indenter penetration becoming deeper in the samples of higher hardness. The macro-scale fracture patterns produced during drop-weight impacts were seen to vary based on flaw populations and indenter penetration.
