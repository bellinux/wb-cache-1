40|$|Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a {{sensitive}} method for detecting white matter damage, and in cross sectional studies DTI measures correlate with age related cognitive decline. However, {{there are few}} data on whether DTI can detect age related changes over short time periods and whether such change correlates with cognitive function. Methods: In a community sample of 84 middle-aged and elderly adults, MRI and cognitive testing were performed at baseline and after 2 years.

Methods: Participants were middle-aged, Finnish adults participating in a lifestyle intervention to prevent Type 2 diabetes (N = 389). Health cognitions and exercise were measured at baseline (preintervention) and twice after a lifestyle intervention took place (at 3 months and after 1 year).

However, these changes were most pronounced within those participants who started at a lower level to begin with.

40|$|Foreign {{language}} pedagogy {{has often}} been influenced by findings drawn from the area of first and/or second language acquisition with confusing results. The thesis explores {{the extent to which}} the inter-relation of variables in foreign language learning differs from that in natural acquisition processes and varies across a range of learning contexts, thereby encouraging different pedagogical approaches. Chapter one argues that some models underestimate the different variables involved and suggests that a socio-cultural approach is more effective in identiffing and explaining the shifting relation between context and cognition. Chapter two seeks to situate foreign language study within a more general process of jimctional differentiation' in the child's widening linguistic repertoire, arguing that not only does the relation of context and <b>cognition</b> <b>change</b> between L I and L 2 but also within L 2 itself. Chapter three examines the shifting relation between context and cognition with reference to the language programme of European Schools in general, and the one at Culham in particular. The latter provides a basis for answering two questions: (1) is there a correlation between success in an acquisition poor environment and the extent of the learner's analytic competence; (2) does motivation play an increasing role in affecting success in contexts where goals are long-term rather than immediate? Data collected from the school are analyzed in chapter four. Response to both questions would seem to he positive although the complexity of the learners' backgrounds produced greater variation in the role of affective factors than anticipated. Finally, chapter five argues that the relative success of foreign language study from an early stage in schemes such as the European schools or the immersion programmes depends upon a precise interplay of socio-cognitive variables which is unlikely to he replicated elsewhere...|$|E

We {{examined the relationship between}} cerebral Aβ level and longitudinal <b>cognition</b> <b>change</b> up to 20 years before the PET scan using latent growth curve models, controlling for age, education, ethnicity, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Results: Positive reading of Aβ was found in 41 of 116 (35 %) individuals. Cognitive scores at scan time was not related with Aβ. All cognitive scores declined over time. Aβ positive reading (B = - 0. 034, p = 0. 02) and higher Aβ burden in temporal region (B = - 0. 080, p = 0. 02) were associated with faster decline in executive/speed. Stratified analyses showed that higher Aβ deposition was associated with faster longitudinal declines in mean cognition, language, and executive/speed in African-Americans or in APOE ε 4 carriers, and with faster memory decline in APOE ε 4 carriers. The associations remained significant after excluding mild cognitive impairment participants. Conclusions: High Aβ deposition in healthy elders was associated with decline in executive/speed in the decade before neuroimaging, and the association was observed primarily in African-Americans and APOE ε 4 carriers.

40|$|Although, on average, {{cognition}} declines with age, cognition {{in older}} adults {{is a dynamic}} process. Hypertension is associated with greater decline in cognition with age, but whether treatment of hypertension affects this is uncertain.

Cognitive states were defined in relation to errors on the Mini-Mental State Examination, with more errors signifying worse <b>cognition.</b> <b>Change</b> in cognitive state was evaluated using a dynamic model of cognitive transition. In the model, the probabilities of transitions between cognitive states is represented by a Poisson distribution, with the Poisson mean dependent on the baseline cognitive state. The dynamic model of cognitive transition was good (R(2) = 0. 74) both for those on placebo and (0. 86) for those on active treatment. The probability of maintaining cognitive function, based on baseline function, was slightly higher in the actively treated group (e. g., for those with the fewest baseline errors, the chance of staying in that state was 63 % for those on treatment, compared with 60 % for those on placebo). Outcomes at two and four years could be predicted based on the initial state and treatment. A dynamic model of cognition that allows all outcomes (cognitive worsening, stability improvement or death) to be categorized simultaneously detected small but consistent differences between treatment and control groups (in favour of treatment) amongst very elderly people treated for hypertension. The model showed good fit, and suggests that most change in cognition in very elderly people is small, and depends on their baseline state and on treatment. Additional work is needed to understand whether this modelling approach is well suited to the valuation of small effects, especially in the face of mortality differences between treatment groups.

As if it were something worthless and part of "nothingness"? The only way to resolve this contradiction is to consider thoroughly what the role of "doubt" is in each part of "Meditations".
