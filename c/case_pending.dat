25|$|The {{decision}} of Chichester District Council finding that benefits had been overpaid to Mote had been challenged by {{him before the}} Social Security Appeal Tribunal. The appeals were pending at the time Mote was committed for trial at the Crown Court, and were heard on 3 September 2004, although Mote was not present. The Tribunal dismissed the appeals, and Mote appealed to the Social Security Commissioners who dismissed his action on 20 July 2006. The Court of Appeal agreed to hear a further appeal and Mote argued that the Social Security Appeal Tribunal should have adjourned the <b>case</b> <b>pending</b> the outcome of Mote's criminal proceedings. This {{was rejected by the}} Court which held that the continuation of the proceedings did not constitute a breach of Mote's human rights.|$|E
25|$|Mote {{appealed the}} {{decision}} of Portsmouth Crown Court to the Court of Appeal on two main grounds. First, that he had applied to the European Court of Justice to have his immunity as an MEP upheld {{and that it was}} an abuse of process for the Crown Court not to have suspended the <b>case</b> <b>pending</b> its decision. Second, that the fact the jury had convicted him on 21 counts of fraud and acquitted him on 4 counts was inconsistent. Giving his judgment, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, stated that Portsmouth Crown Court had correctly decided that {{there was no need to}} wait for the CFI's decision, noting in any case that it was unlikely the CFI would differ in its final judgment from {{the decision of}} the European Parliament. On the second ground of appeal, the Court did, however, quash one of the counts of fraud - that of failing to notify.|$|E

500|$|During the {{two weeks}} the {{so-called}} [...] "duumvirate" [...] held office, Whitlam sought to fulfill those campaign promises that did not require legislation. [...] Whitlam ordered negotiations to establish full relations with the People's Republic of China, and broke those with Taiwan. Legislation allowed the defence minister to grant exemptions from conscription. Barnard held this office, and exempted everyone. Seven men were at that time incarcerated for refusing conscription; Whitlam arranged for their liberation. The Whitlam government in its first days reopened the equal pay <b>case</b> <b>pending</b> before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and appointed a woman, Elizabeth Evatt, to the commission. Whitlam and Barnard eliminated sales tax on contraceptive pills, announced major grants for the arts, and appointed an interim schools commission. The duumvirate barred racially discriminatory sports teams from Australia, and instructed the Australian delegation at the United Nations to vote in favour of sanctions on apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia. It also ordered the Australian Army Training Team home from Vietnam, ending Australia's involvement in the war; most troops (including all conscripts) had been withdrawn by McMahon.|$|E

The report also states: [...] "FBI name checks, one of the security screening tools used by USCIS, may be the single biggest obstacle to the timely and efficient delivery of immigration benefits". The delays due to pending FBI Name Checks for naturalization applications are expected to increase due to a substantial surge {{in the number of}} naturalization applications in the spring-summer of 2007 that happened before {{a significant increase in the}} USCIS application fees.|$|R

2500|$|In November 2014, José Socrates {{was arrested}} on suspicions of {{corruption}} and money-laundering, it having become apparent that a close friend was holding millions of euros for his benefit. [...] Socrates claimed that he merely borrowed money from his friend, {{but there were no}} records of the amounts loaned, which admittedly funded a luxurious lifestyle in Paris after Socrates left the government. This came to light during the government's Operation Marquis investigation. He was originally held pending the conclusion of this investigation. Socrates was imprisoned in the jail at Évora until September 2015 when he was remanded to house arrest at a relative's house in Lisbon. He was freed from house arrest in October 2015, but was constrained to remain in Portugal and prohibited from contacting other suspects in the <b>case,</b> <b>pending</b> completion of the investigation. In 2017, Socrates was formally indicted on corruption charges including bribery, money laundering and tax fraud.|$|E

She stated that the evidence against Knox was insufficient, that Knox had been subjected to [...] "harsh treatment" [...] following her arrest, and that there had been [...] "negligence" [...] in the handling of evidence. She also complained that jurors had not been sequestered, allowing them to view [...] "negative news coverage" [...] about Knox, and that one of the prosecutors had a misconduct <b>case</b> <b>pending</b> in relation to another trial. Cantwell said she would seek assistance from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A spokesman for the State Department said in December 2009 that the Department had followed the case closely and would continue to do so.
