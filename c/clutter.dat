Its pulse-Doppler radar (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The radar, combined with an SSR, and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground <b>clutter</b> (radar) returns.|$|E
5|$|The F-16A/B was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Westinghouse AN/APG-66 fire-control radar. Its slotted planar array antenna {{was designed to be}} compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small nose. In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-clutter environment, and in look-down/shoot-down employs a medium PRF for heavy <b>clutter</b> environments. It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather. The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added a more powerful signal processing, higher output power, improved reliability and increased range in cluttered or jamming environments. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory.|$|E

The first and second MiG-17 flights were commanded by Cao Thanh Tinh and Nguyen Van Tho respectively. Once airborne, North Vietnamese pilots maneuvered their aircraft into positions to deploy their new tactic which required the MiG-17 fighters to act as bait, while the MiG-21 fighters attacked from the rear. After Chieu and Coc had departed from Phuc Yen Air Base, they flew at low level and stayed in the ground <b>clutter</b> to avoid detection by airborne radars employed by U.S aircraft.

5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working on the problem of removing the <b>clutter</b> from radar signals had developed a form of delay line memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of radio energy, the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft's frontal or side area {{from the perspective of}} a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar observability. Furthermore, the F-22's stealth contouring and radar absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. However, such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to <b>clutter,</b> and have low precision. Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging. According to the USAF an F-22 surprised an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that was attempting to intercept an American UAV, despite Iran's claim of having military VHF radar coverage over the Persian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|This led to Hanbury Brown's {{work on the}} Mark IVA, which {{differed}} from the Mk. IV primarily by having an additional display unit {{in front of the}} pilot. The radar operator had an additional control, the strobe, which could be adjusted to pick out returns at a particular range. Only those returns were sent to the pilot's display, resulting in much less <b>clutter.</b> Unlike the operator's display, the pilot's showed the target's location as a single dot in a bore-scope like fashion; if the dot was above and {{to the right of the}} centre of the display, the pilot had to turn to the right and climb to intercept. The result was what was known as a flying spot indicator, a single selected target showing a direct indication of the target's relative position.|$|E

5|$|Attempting {{his usual}} tactic, the British crew {{approached}} {{from behind and}} below. Suddenly the Heinkel lurched into a tight left-hand turn allowing the gunners to fire a broad-side. The bomber disappeared into the mist. Cunningham asked GCI for help. They tracked the Heinkel flying north near Shaftesbury. Engaging again the German pilot managed {{to turn into a}} head-on position and dive past almost upside down. He continually evaded Cunningham by turning in underneath him at near-impossible angles. Cunningham and Rawnsley came to understand they were not dealing with a novice. Soon a turning match began and then the German attempted to escape by twisting and diving. Cunningham forced him down to 900 feet but Rawnsley and GCI lost contact when the ground <b>clutter</b> hid the Heinkel's signal. Cunningham returned to base. News soon came through the He 111 had crashed onto the slopes on Cranborne Chase. Apparently, the Heinkel had broken through the clouds at only a hundred feet and dived vertically into the ground near the isolated village of Alvediston at 17:05. Intelligence later determined that the machine was a He 111H-6, Werknummer 4627, code 6N+FR, from 7./KGr 100. The bomber disintegrated upon impact. The pilot, Staffelkapitän ("squadron leader") Hauptmann Siegried Langer was killed along with his crew; Oberfeldwebel G. Schmidt, Feldwebel D. Hoffmann, P. Gaidies and Gefreiter W. Worring. It was a unique victory for Cunningham. He had not fired his guns in the 150-minute chase.|$|E
5|$|Detective Mode, {{allowing}} {{the investigation of}} crimes, was not considered an improvement by Kotaku and GameSpot; while they considered it a good idea, its execution was minimal since a player simply looks for the next highlighted piece of evidence rather than solving a puzzle. Game Informer liked it, {{saying that they were}} complicated and showed how Batman analyzes a crime scene. The combat system received mixed reviews. The shock gloves were criticized as overpowered and making fights too easy, allowing Batman unblockable attacks (instantly disabling most opponents) and removing the need for tactics. Reviewers said that changes to combat punished more than challenged; greater enemy numbers and variety made sustaining an attack difficult, and (combined with an array of gadgets which hindered—rather than damaged—enemies) made encounters long and repetitive. Joystiq noted that the game emphasized combat over stealth. Kotaku called the combat rating system distracting screen <b>clutter</b> which broke the player's concentration, but GameFront said that the system was positive reinforcement for successful fights. The stealth sections were considered of similar quality to previous installments; their unchanged function left the methods of obtaining victory the same, making for a rote experience. The Remote Claw was criticized for making stealth sections too easy, allowing multiple enemies to be disabled without moving from the player's starting position.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis and DeMar playtested {{the game}} themselves, and {{continually}} tweaked the designs {{as the project}} progressed. Though games at the time began to use scrolling to have larger levels, the developers chose a single screen to confine the action. To instill panic in the player, the character was initially placed {{in the center of}} the game's action, and had to deal with projectiles coming from multiple directions, as opposed previous shooting games such as Space Invaders and Galaxian, where the enemies attacked from a single direction. This made for more challenging gameplay, an aspect Jarvis took pride in. Enemies were assigned to stages in different groups to create themes. Early stages were designed to be relatively simple compared to later ones. The level of difficulty was designed to increase quickly so players would struggle to complete later stages. In retrospect, Jarvis attributes his and DeMar's average player skills to the game's balanced design. Though they made the game as difficult as they could, the high end of their skills ended up being a good challenge for expert players. The graphics were given a simple appearance to avoid a cluttered game screen, and object designs were made distinct from each other to avoid confusion. Black was chosen as the background color to help characters stand out and reduce <b>clutter.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Cluttering</b> is a {{communication}} disorder that Speech Language Pathologists have been attempting to define for decades. It is typically {{considered to be}} a fluency disorder, affecting the rate and organization of speech, as well as causing unexpected pausing and speech patterns. The most well-known fluency disorder is stuttering; the majority of people know someone who has a stutter, or at least are aware of what stuttering sounds like. <b>Cluttering</b> is much less recognized, and is often mistaken for stuttering by individuals who are unaware that <b>cluttering</b> exists. Unfortunately, the lack of awareness of <b>cluttering</b> is a widespread issue affecting professionals and nonprofessionals throughout the world.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{occurrence}} of <b>cluttering</b> in individuals with Down syndrome (DS) {{taking into account the}} wide range of symptoms that may be found in <b>cluttering.</b> Patients and Methods: Twenty-six speech language therapists, who had clients with DS among their caseload, administered the Predictive <b>Cluttering</b> Inventory in 76 individuals with DS aged between 3. 8 and 57. 3 years. Results: Sixty of the 76 participants (78. 9 %) obtained a score that classified them as a clutterer, and 13 other participants (17. 1 %) qualified as a clutterer-stutterer. In almost 65 % of the participants, not all items had been scored; thus, compromising strict administration of the Predictive <b>Cluttering</b> Inventory. Conclusion: The results clearly illustrate the need for a consensus on the symptoms that are essential for a diagnosis of <b>cluttering,</b> and also indicate that an instrument like the Predictive <b>Cluttering</b> Inventory may not be suitable for every clinical population. Future research is necessary to determine if the disfluent speech exhibited by certain clinical subgroups (such as individuals with DS) represents a distinct pattern that is different from developmental stuttering, and does not form part of a syndrome of <b>cluttering</b> either.

5|$|In 1977, {{plans were}} made for US 140 to be decommissioned, with PA 97 to replace the section in Pennsylvania. This {{proposal}} was made in order to eliminate short routes from the United States Numbered Highways system. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved {{the removal of the}} US 140 designation on October 28, 1977. In December 1978, the borough of Littlestown protested the renumbering of US 140 to PA 97. When the US 140 designation was retired on January 1, 1979, it was replaced by MD 140 from Baltimore to Westminster, and Maryland and Pennsylvania coordinated to have matching routes 97 {{on both sides of the}} state line between Westminster and Gettysburg. The northern terminus of PA 97 was located at the US 15 interchange, while the stretch of the former US 140 north into Gettysburg became unnumbered Baltimore Pike. With this change, the US 140 signs were removed from the square in downtown Gettysburg, and no signs directing motorists to PA 97 were put in their place. This move hurt businesses in the Littlestown area as motorists were unable to get to them without a marked route. The state did put signs directing motorists to PA 97 at the US 15 interchange and at the intersection of US 15 Business and Baltimore Street; however, signs for PA 97 were not placed in the square due to opposition from local officials in Gettysburg who did not want sign <b>clutter</b> in the square. The stretch of Baltimore Pike from the bypass to US 15 Business became State Route 2035 by 1989. PA 97 and the adjacent portion of Baltimore Pike were widened through the US 15 interchange in 2000.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clutter</b> is {{detected}} and neutralized in several ways. <b>Clutter</b> tends to appear static between radar scans; on subsequent scan echoes, desirable targets will appear to move, and all stationary echoes can be eliminated. Sea <b>clutter</b> {{can be reduced}} by using horizontal polarization, while rain is reduced with circular polarization (note that meteorological radars wish for the opposite effect, and therefore use linear polarization to detect precipitation). Other methods attempt to increase the signal-to-clutter ratio.|$|E
25|$|Constant {{false alarm}} rate, {{a form of}} {{automatic}} gain control (AGC), is a method that relies on <b>clutter</b> returns far outnumbering echoes from targets of interest.

In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver. As radars evolved, AGC became computer-software controlled and affected the gain with greater granularity in specific detection cells.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} action detection from <b>cluttered</b> videos. In recent years, many feature extraction schemes {{have been designed to}} describe various aspects of actions. However, due to the difficulty of action detection, e. g., the <b>cluttered</b> background and potential occlusions, a single type of features cannot effectively solve the action detection problems in <b>cluttered</b> videos. In this chapter, we propose a new type of features, Hierarchically Filtered Motion (HFM), and further investigate the fusion of HFM with Spatiotemporal Interest Point (STIP) features for action detection from <b>cluttered</b> videos. In order to effectively and efficiently detect actions, we propose a new approach which combines Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with Branch-and-Bound search to locate interested actions in <b>cluttered</b> videos. The proposed new HFM features and action detection method have been evaluated on the classical KTH dataset and the challenging MSR Action Dataset II which consists of crowded videos with moving people or vehicles in background. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing techniques especially for action detection in crowded videos...|$|R
