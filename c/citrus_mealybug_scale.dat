40|$|Endosymbiosis {{has been}} a major driver of {{evolutionary}} diversification of eukaryotes. However, symbiosis can create conflict between partners and symbiont density is often tightly regulated within hosts to ensure optimal functioning of the holobiont. The horticultural pest insects, <b>citrus</b> <b>mealybugs,</b> make an intriguing and potentially-powerful case study for endosymbiosis, harbouring two obligate, nutritional, vertically transmitted bacteria: Tremblaya princeps and Moranella endobia, in a nested mutualism. In this thesis, I examine the variation in the density of each of these obligate symbionts in <b>citrus</b> <b>mealybugs</b> under controlled environmental conditions, using qPCR, as well as the diversity of facultative symbionts that infect the mealybugs using next-generation sequencing and conventional targeted PCR. <b>Citrus</b> <b>mealybugs</b> were found to harbour Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, Cardinium and Rickettsia, which have been found to impact the fitness of their hosts in other insect species, whereas long-tailed mealybugs were not found to harbour any of these bacteria, but the symbiont communities in both species were found to be dominated by their obligate symbionts. The density of the two obligate symbionts varied by up to six-fold between different populations kept under identical environmental conditions and a hybridisation experiment indicated that M. endobia and T. princeps density may be controlled by symbiont and host genotype respectively. However, symbiont density was not found to correlate with life-history traits in the laboratory, the ability of mealybugs to exploit different plant species, or the susceptibility of the mealybugs to insecticide and artificial reduction of symbiont density by heat-stress also had no effect on host fitness. <b>Citrus</b> <b>mealybugs</b> harbour seemingly superfluous symbionts with no clear fitness costs or benefits...|$|R

Climate was compared across areas where the parasitoid has shown successes and failures in controlling mealybug populations. If climatic conditions impact significantly on C. perminutus biocontrol performance, the CLIMEX output of Ecoclimatic Index (EI) would indicate that the localities worldwide where the species is relatively successful have suitable climatic conditions (EI > 40). Southeastern Queensland data indicated C. perminutus population is relatively low in <b>citrus</b> <b>mealybug</b> samples from two citrus-producing localities, Mundubbera and Nambour. If climatic conditions impact significantly on C. perminutus survival, the model should also predict that the climates, as expressed by the climate Match Index (MI), of southeastern Queensland are not particularly suitable for C. perminutus (MI < 40). CLIMEX predicted Mundubbera and Nambour to be favorable for the population growth and persistence of C. perminutus. Also, the climates of these two Australian localities matched closely with those of localities worldwide where C. perminutus does impose some degree of biocontrol. Although the model requires adjustment, it does establish that the citrus-producing areas of southeastern Queensland are suitable for the persistence of C. perminutus.

The research was conducted at the Laboratory of Entomology of Embrapa Semiarid, Petrolina-PE, on leaves of grapevine kept in a controlled environment (25 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 10 % R.

Increases in height (cm), leaf number, leaf surface area (cm 2), or branch number resulted in a decrease in attack rates whereas {{increasing the number of}} <b>citrus</b> <b>mealybugs</b> per plant resulted in higher attack rates. However, the low number of attacks and the relatedness of the plant architectural characteristics made it difficult to determine which characterizations of plant size were most important in influencing the foraging success of L. dactylopii. ^ Observations were conducted on L. dactylopii in cages to associate attack rates with behavior. Leptomastix dactylopii behaviors were categorized based on mobility (moving and stationary) and location (plant and cage). Low attack rates made it difficult to directly associate these behaviors with attacks. The low attack rates by L. dactylopii may have resulted from the parasitoid requiring time to habituate to a new searching environment. These findings suggest that modifying rearing environments to condition natural enemies to target crops prior to release may increase natural enemy activity and performance. In addition, because all characterizations of plant size influenced the attack rate of L. dactylopii, biological control practitioners may eventually be able to use any convenient measure of plant size to adjust release rates of natural enemies. ...|$|R

The research presented here builds on previous study in which it was shown on laboratory scale that the odour profile released by plants after damage by mealybugs differs from the odour profile released by undamaged plants and plants that suffer from spider mite or mechanical damage. In the present study the change of several compounds in response to mealybug infection was shown to depend on a number of different factors: the growth stage of the plant (flowering/non-flowering), the time of the day sampling took place, the mealybug density and the duration of the mealybug infection. Although in each of the laboratory experiments several plant volatiles were found to significantly differ between mealybug-infested plants and control plants, so far no candidate indicator-volatiles have been found that always reacted significantly and in the same manner to a mealybug infection.
