We tested the MD-score {{for a wide range of}} commonly available fragmentation methods and found it to be applicable throughout with high statistical significance. However, the different fragmentation techniques differ strongly in their ability to localize phosphorylation sites. At 1 % false localization rate, the highest number of correctly assigned phosphopeptides was achieved by higher energy collision induced dissociation in combination with an Orbitrap mass analyzer followed very closely by low resolution ion trap spectra obtained after electron transfer dissociation. Both these methods are significantly better than low resolution spectra acquired after collision induced dissociation and multi stage activation. Score thresholds determined from simple calibration functions for each fragmentation method were stable over replicate analyses of the phosphopeptide set. The MD-score outperforms the Ascore for tyrosine phosphorylated peptides and we further show that the ability to call sites correctly increases with increasing distance of two candidate sites within a peptide sequence. The MD-score does not require complex computational steps which makes it attractive in terms of practical utility. We provide all mass spectra and the synthetic peptides to the community so that the development of present and future localization software can be benchmarked and any laboratory can determine MD-scores and localization probabilities for their individual analytical set up...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} protein {{arginine}} methylation {{has seen a}} surge {{in the number of}} known methylation sites in higher eukaryotes over recent years, but our understanding of the functions of these modifications is lagging behind. A better knowledge of arginine methylation in a model organism like Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is relatively amenable to experimental manipulation may inform on arginine methylation also in higher eukaryotes. The proteome-wide identification of methylation sites in S. cerevisiae, based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in combination with several enrichment and fractionation strategies and on the use of heavy methyl SILAC is presented here. The majority of sites identified are in good agreement with previous reports of arginine methylation, i. e. occur in glycine-arginine-rich regions, locate to proteins involved in RNA-processing and overlap with known sites. Additionally, the data obtained suggest a bias for localisation of arginine methylation in unstructured protein regions and asparagine-rich contexts. It is further shown that the use of heavy methyl SILAC is useful for <b>confident</b> <b>site</b> identification. To overcome challenges in the global approach, the detection of methylation sites on overexpressed candidate proteins was also employed. This strategy yielded methylation sites on {{more than half of the}} 38 successfully purified proteins, but also brought to light challenges in the localisation of sites. Subsequently, it was investigated which methyltransferases are responsible for methylating mapped sites on two of these proteins. These experiments strongly indicate that Lsm 4 is neither exclusively methylated by Hmt 1 nor Hsl 7, while Hmt 1 appears to be the sole methyltransferase responsible for methylating Scd 6. It was further shown that the methylation of the glycine-arginine-rich region of Scd 6 is reduced upon prolonged sodium azide stress which may have potential implications in stress-induced translational repression. Overall, these results both inform on methods for the assignment of arginine methylation and improve its biological characterisation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Performance Assessment (PA) {{is the use}} of {{mathematical}} models to simulate the long-term behavior of engineered and geologic barriers in a nuclear waste repository; methods of uncertainty analysis are used to assess effects of parametric and conceptual uncertainties associated with the model system upon the uncertainty in outcomes of the simulation. PA is required by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency as part of its certification process for geologic repositories for nuclear waste. This paper is a dialogue to explore the value and limitations of PA. Two “skeptics” acknowledge the utility of PA in organizing the scientific investigations that are necessary for <b>confident</b> <b>siting</b> and licensing of a repository; however, they maintain that the PA process, at least as it is currently implemented, is an essentially unscientific process with shortcomings that may provide results of limited use in evaluating actual effects on public health and safety. Conceptual uncertainties in a PA analysis can be so great that results can be confidently applied only over short time ranges, the antithesis of the purpose behind long-term, geologic disposal. Two “proponents” of PA agree that performance assessment is unscientific, but only in the sense that PA is an engineering analysis that uses existing scientific knowledge to support public policy decisions, rather than an investigation intended to increase fundamental knowledge of nature; PA has different goals and constraints than a typical scientific study. The “proponents” describe an ideal, six-step process for conducting generalized PA, here called probabilistic systems analysis (PSA); they note that virtually all scientific content of a PA is introduced during the model-building steps of a PSA; they contend that a PA based on simple but scientifically acceptable mathematical models can provide useful and objective input to regulatory decision makers. The value of the results of any PA must lie between these two views and will depend on the level of knowledge of the site, the degree to which models capture actual physical and chemical processes, the time over which extrapolations are made, and the proper evaluation of health risks attending implementation of the repository. The challenge is in evaluating whether the quality of the PA matches the needs of decision makers charged with protecting {{the health and safety of}} the public...|$|R

40|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} is {{the most}} frequent eukaryotic post-translational modification and can act as either a molecular switch or rheostat for protein functions. The deliberate manipulation of protein phosphorylation has great potential for regulating specific protein functions with surgical precision, rather than the gross effects gained by the over/underexpression or complete deletion of a protein-encoding gene. In order {{to assess the impact}} of phosphorylation on central metabolism, and thus its potential for biotechnological and medical exploitation, a compendium of highly <b>confident</b> protein phosphorylation <b>sites</b> (p-sites) for the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been analyzed together with two more datasets from the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Our analysis highlights the global properties of the regulation of yeast central metabolism by protein phosphorylation, where almost half of the enzymes involved are subject to this sort of post-translational modification. These phosphorylated enzymes, compared to the nonphosphorylated ones, are more abundant, regulate more reactions, have more protein- protein interactions, and a higher fraction of them are ubiquitinated. The p-sites of metabolic enzymes are also more conserved than the background p-sites, and hundreds of them have the potential for regulating metabolite production. All this integrated information has allowed us to prioritize thousands of p-sites in terms of their potential phenotypic impact. This multi-source compendium should enable the design of future high-throughput (HTP) mutation studies to identify key molecular switches/rheostats for the manipulation of not only the metabolism of yeast, but also that of many other biotechnologically and medically important fungi and eukaryotes. </p...|$|R

Compared with large scale phosphorylation analysis at proteome level, comprehensive and reliable phosphorylation site mapping of individual phosphoprotein is equally important. A novel method for <b>confident</b> phosphorylation <b>site</b> analysis of individual phosphoproteins was developed without manual interpretation of spectra. Phosphopeptides enriched from tryptic digests of phosphoproteins were analyzed by nano-LC-MS 2 -MS 3, and the acquired MS 2 and MS 3 spectra in valid MS 2 /MS 3 pairs were searched against the composite database separately. This methodology combined with multi-protease digestion approach was applied to analyze the phosphorylation of the standards phosphoproteins and cyclic AMP dependent protein kinases. In silico digestion of proteins in human proteome database by trypsin indicates that {{a significant percentage of}} tryptic N-glycopeptides is not in the preferred detection mass range of shotgun proteomics approach, that is, from 800 to 3500 Da. And the quite big size of glycan groups may block trypsin to access the K, R residues near N-glycosites for digestion, which will result in generation of big glycopeptides. Thus many N-glycosites could not be localized if only trypsin was used to digest proteins. We developed a comprehensive way to analyze the N-glycoproteome of human liver tissue by combination of hydrazide chemistry method and multiple enzyme digestion, which leads to great improvement in coverage of N-glycosites identified. 大连化学物理研究...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the thesis were to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans and Puumala virus (PUU) occurrence in relation to bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) dynamics and environmental factors in a region of high incidence of NE in northern Sweden. Nephropathia epidemica is a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, and in northern Sweden the most prevailing serious febrile viral infection, second to influenza. All serologically confirmed NE cases during 1991 - 2001 in the four northernmost counties (n = 2, 468) were used to establish spatio-temporal patterns of the occurrence of the human disease. Within the study region, the bank voles show marked population fluctuations with 3 - 4 yr cycles and the incidence of NE has a temporal component strongly correlated to annual numbers of bank voles in autumn. People living in rural dwellings near coastal areas were abundant among notified cases and middle-aged males were over-represented. The patients were often infected in autumn when engaged in activities such as handling of fire wood, gardening or hay-handling near man-made rodent refugia or cleaning/redecorating within one. A proportion of these patients, <b>confident</b> about <b>site</b> of PUU exposure, were used to establish field sites in two separate studies. Firstly a five year study (1995 - 1999) at six sites spanning a bank vole population cycle, and secondly a spatially extensive study at 32 sites was conducted in autumn 1998. Densities, fluctuations and demography of vole populations differ between sites of known occurrence of NE were compared to random forest sites. Five years of repeated biannual sampling revealed that case sites harbored more bank voles than random forest sites, in particular during population peaks. For the individual bank voles, the probability of PUU infection was significantly higher in population peak year, increased with age and was higher for males than for females. In the spatially extended study, {{it was found that}} in particular environmental characteristics associated with old-growth moist forests (i. e. Alectoria spp., Picea abies, fallen wood and Vaccinium myrtillus) were associated with high bank vole numbers and numbers of PUU infected bank voles. This implies that success in circulation and persistence of PUU within local bank vole populations is strongly influenced by the local environments. In future modeling of PUU transmission, influence of bank vole demography and environmental factors should be useful on establishing risk assessments and identifying areas of particular risk of PUU exposure...|$|R
40|$|CREAM is {{an acronym}} for coal recovery, evaluation, {{analysis}} and management and is a business improvement project at BMA’s Goonyella Riverside mine that is focussed on maximising coal recovered. In August 2003, Goonyella Riverside was set a challenge to quantify coal loss and dilution {{and their relationship to}} cost, revenue and ultimately profit. While the mine was <b>confident</b> in its <b>site</b> forecasts of recovery (and loss), {{it was clear that the}} traditional measurement and analysis systems were inadequate to firstly, identify key loss areas and mechanisms and secondly, successfully quantify the benefit of various coal recovery initiatives. The path that BMA Goonyella Riverside has travelled to maximise coal recovered can be divided into four key steps: 1. Mapping the process – This step involved the development of a coal flow process map for Goonyella Riverside that stepped through each component of the process from the coal reserve to the customer and identified key measurement points for the purposes of reconciliation. 2. Understanding coal loss and identifying opportunities – This step involved conducting two detailed Reserve to Customer projects at the mine site to track a block of coal from the reserve to the customer and to gain a greater understanding of the relationship of dilution, coal loss mechanisms, revenue and costs associated with recovering additional coal. 3. Coal data systems development – Two important coal data systems have been developed and implemented at Goonyella Riverside in the past twelve months, namely Snowden’s Coal Reconcilor and SeamFix. These systems enable coal losses and dilution to be quantified and reconciled back to the initial coal reserve. 4. Implementation of loss reduction initiatives – This step involved the formation of a business improvement project referred to as ‘CREAM’ in August 2004, for the purposes of improving pit coal recovery and maximising business value. To date a series of coal recovery trials have been run in a number of pits at Goonyella Riverside that have yielded significant improvements in business value. The key to the success of this project has been the discipline to follow a defined process map, management commitment through resourcing and shared key performance indicators, a successful acceptance strategy resulting in holistic ownership and the implementation of sustainable reconciliation systems. Coal loss and dilution are now quantifiable and their relationship to cost, revenue and ultimately profit is well understood. This paper discusses the process that Goonyella Riverside has adopted to maximise coal recovered...|$|R
