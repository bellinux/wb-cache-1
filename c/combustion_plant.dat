She sold the remaining property (excluding the house and greenhouse) to the Santa Rosa Junior College for use as a training ground. This lasted until 1954 (J. B.

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 2000s, {{concerns}} grew over the prospect of an 'energy gap' in United Kingdom generating capacity. This was forecast to arise because it was expected that a number of coal fired power stations would close due to being unable to meet the clean air requirements of the European Large <b>Combustion</b> <b>Plant</b> Directive (directive 2001/80/EC). In addition, the United Kingdom's remaining Magnox nuclear stations were to have closed by 2015. The oldest AGR nuclear power station has had its life extended by ten years, and it was likely many of the others could be life-extended, reducing the potential gap suggested by the current accounting closure dates of between 2014 and 2023 for the AGR power stations.|$|E

Oxygen gas is fed through the cathode, where it absorbs electrons to create oxygen ions. The oxygen ions then travel through the electrolyte to react with hydrogen gas at the anode. The reaction at the anode produces electricity and water as by-products. Carbon dioxide may also be a by-product depending on the fuel, but the carbon emissions from an SOFC system are less than those from a fossil fuel <b>combustion</b> <b>plant.</b> The chemical reactions for the SOFC system can be expressed as follows: ...|$|E

[...] His study optimised a vast grid covering North Africa, Eastern Europe, Norway, and Iceland. His study ran a number of scenarios, wind, csp, nuclear etc., and the optimisation showed that all European power could largely come from wind energy, with relatively low amounts of <b>combustion</b> <b>plant</b> needed during universal low wind periods. Furthermore, the study showed that no new storage would be required. Existing hydro is sufficient. The total cost, including for new <b>combustion</b> <b>plant,</b> fuelled by biomass, the cost of the interconnections, the inefficiency of starting and stopping the <b>combustion</b> <b>plant,</b> all indicated a power price at the same as Germany was paying in 2005.|$|E

The directive applied to fossil-fuel power stations, and other large thermal plant such as petroleum refineries and steelworks.

40|$|International audienceThe European Directives on waste {{incineration}} (2000 / 76 /CE) and on large <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> (2001 / 80 /CE) require {{to refer to}} international and national standards for emission monitoring and they specify requirements for the performance characteristics and the total uncertainty attached to the results provided by the automated monitoring systems (AMS) used for continuous monitoring.

It applies to incineration and <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> but its use could be extended to other industrial plants after the publication of the future integrated European Directive which will replace the 7 already existing European directives.

30|$|After {{implementing}} BAT/BEP (best available techniques/best environmental practices) {{in large}} thermal PCDD/F sources in industrial countries, the emissions from domestic heating and small <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> have become major PCDD/F air emission sources in industrial countries [10, 229, 230]. For instance, this source category accounts for approximately 42 % (29  g TEQ/year) of annual dioxin emissions in Germany. Stoves or small wood boilers using exclusively natural wood generally {{have a low}} PCDD/F formation/release, which does not result in significant emissions or contamination of ash [226, 231]. However, emissions and ash from small <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> in which waste wood or other wastes are incinerated or co-incinerated can have elevated PCDD/F release [226, 231]. Over time, {{this can lead to}} soil contamination, and might be a reason for the elevated levels in highly populated areas. For instance, garden soils in densely populated areas in Germany had between 5 and 20  ng TEQ/kg [17, 232] and, therefore, exceeded levels appropriate for raising chicken/eggs.|$|R
