40|$|The {{contribution}} analyses {{the rules}} on the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> rights contained in the (at the time) Draft UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions. It first presents the basic general assumptions on which such rules are based and then offers an assessment of their compatibility with existing European secured transactions regimes, with particular regard to the prevailing approach found in continental legal systems. A number of specific issues are dealt with: differentiation between “attachment” (effectiveness inter partes) and “perfection” (effectiveness as against third parties); {{the influence of a}} “notice-filing system” as opposed to a “transaction-based system” of registration; the recognition <b>of</b> title-based <b>security</b> devices; the need to provide rules for acquisition security rights and retention of title instruments (with a comparative discussion of existing national and uniform models). The conclusion is that the UNCITRAL rules on the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> rights over movables not only are compatible with modern European legal systems, but, in addition, should be considered a good model for a future common European secured transactions' law, since they represent a marked improvement in efficiency with respect to more traditionally oriented solutions.

50|$|Of the {{two types}} of implementation, the most used is based on shared secrets. The great {{advantage}} of GAA/GBA is that it allows the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> associations between the user agent and the various applications. These partnerships consist primarily to share a key (the shared secret), which allows subsequent user agent authentication against the application, and, if necessary, other security features such as the guarantee of confidentiality and integrity of information (through encryption and digital signature), non-repudiation (digital signature), etc. The problem with these mechanisms is the way to agree on this shared secret. As I mentioned earlier, the secret is derived from the authentication keys used in AKA.|$|R
