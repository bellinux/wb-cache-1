40|$|Effective {{visual field}} in reading, called perceptual span (PS), is a {{language}} / orthographic dependent feature.

PS for Chinese, on the other hand, is one <b>character</b> <b>space</b> to the left and three <b>character</b> <b>spaces</b> to the right of the fixation. PS for Hebrew, however, is asymmetric towards left as it is read right to left. In the present study we examined asymmetry in PS for a group of Indian students reading English.

40|$|Abstract In {{this note}} we {{construct}} Swiss cheeses X such that R(X) is non-regular but such that R(X) has no non-trivial Jensen measures. We also construct a non-regular uniform algebra with compact, metrizable <b>character</b> <b>space</b> such that every {{point of the}} <b>character</b> <b>space</b> is a peak point. In [Co] Cole gave a counterexample to the peak point conjecture by constructing a non-trivial uniform algebra A with compact, metrizable <b>character</b> <b>space</b> ΦA such that every point of ΦA is a peak point for A. This uniform algebra was obtained from an example of McKissick [M] by a process of repeatedly adjoining square roots. Because McKissick’s algebra is regular, so is this first example constructed by Cole (see [F 2] and [Ka]). This leads to the following question: Let A be a uniform algebra with compact, metrizable <b>character</b> <b>space</b> ΦA such that every point of ΦA is a peak point for A. Must A be regular? In this note we construct {{an example of a}} Swiss cheese X for which the uniform algebra R(X) is non-regular, but such that R(X) has no non-trivial Jensen measures. We then apply Cole’s construction to this example to produce an example of a non-regular uniform algebra with compact, metrizable <b>character</b> <b>space</b> such that every point of the <b>character</b> <b>space</b> is a peak point. We begin by recalling some standard facts about Jensen measures. Notation For a commutative Banach algebra A, we denote by ΦA the <b>character</b> <b>space</b> of A. Now suppose that A is a uniform algebra on a compact space X. For x ∈ X, let Mx and Jx be the ideals of functions in A vanishing at x, and in a neighbourhood of x, respectively. Definition 1 Let A be a uniform algebra on a compact space X, and let φ ∈ ΦA. Then a Jensen measure for φ is a regular, Borel probability measure µ on X such that, for all f ∈ A, log |φ(f) | ≤ log |f(x) |dµ(x) (where log(0) is defined to be −∞). X Let x ∈ X. We say that x is a point of continuity for A if there is no point y of X {x satisfying Mx ⊇ Jy. It is standard (see, for example, [G, p. 33]) that every φ ∈ ΦA has a Jensen measure supported on X, and that each such measure represents φ, i. e., for all f ∈ A, φ(f) ...|$|R

40|$|We give {{a survey}} of the known {{connections}} between regularity conditions and amenability conditions in the setting of uniform algebras. For a uniform algebra $A$ we consider the set, $A_{lc}$, of functions in $A$ which are locally constant on a (varying) dense open subset of the <b>character</b> <b>space</b> of $A$. We show that, for a separable uniform algebra $A$, if $A$ has bounded relative units at every point of a dense subset of the <b>character</b> <b>space</b> of $A$, then $A_{lc}$ is dense in $A$. We construct a separable, essential, regular uniform algebra $A$ on its <b>character</b> <b>space</b> $X$ such that every point of $X$ is a peak point for $A$, $A$ has bounded relative units at every point of a dense open subset of $X$ and yet $A$ is not weakly amenable. In particular, this shows that a continuous derivation from a separable, essential uniform algebra $A$ to its dual need not annihilate $A_{lc}$. Comment: 11 pages, no figure...|$|R

40|$|<b>Space</b> <b>characters</b> {{can have}} an {{important}} role in disambiguating text. However, few, if any, Chinese information extraction systems make full use of <b>space</b> <b>characters.</b> However, it seems that treatment of <b>space</b> <b>characters</b> is necessary, especially in cases of extracting information from semi-structured documents. This investigation aims to address the importance of <b>space</b> <b>characters</b> in Chinese information extraction by parsing some semi-structured documents with two similar grammars- one with treatment for <b>space</b> <b>characters,</b> the other ignoring it. This paper also introduces two post processing filters to further improve treatment of <b>space</b> <b>characters.</b> Results show that the grammar that takes account of spaces clearly out-performs the one that ignores them, and so concludes that <b>space</b> <b>characters</b> can play a useful role in information extraction. ...|$|R

5000|$|In digital typography, kerning {{is usually}} applied to letter pairs {{as a number}} by which the default <b>character</b> <b>spacing</b> should be {{increased}} or decreased: a positive value for an increase, a negative value for a decrease. The number is expressed in font units, one unit being a certain fraction of an em (one em is the type size currently used). Different fonts may use different units, but common values are 1000 and 2048 units/em. Thus, for 1000 units/em, a kerning value of 15 means an increase in <b>character</b> <b>spacing</b> by 0.015 of the current type size.

40|$|Radiations {{of large}} clades often {{accompany}} rapid morphological diversification. Evolutionary biologists debate {{the impact of}} external restrictions imposed by ecology, and intrinsic constraints imposed by development and genetics, on {{the rate at which}} morphological innovations are gained. These issues are particularly interesting for groups such as tetrapods, which evolved novel body plans relative to their piscine ancestors and which also invaded new ecosystems following terrestrialization. Prior studies have addressed these issues by looking at either ranges of morphological variation or rates of character change. Here, we address a related but distinct issue: the numbers of characters that freely vary within a clade. We modify techniques similar to those used by ecologists to infer species richnesses to estimate the number of potentially varying characters given the distributions of changes implied by a model phylogeny. Our results suggest both increasing constraints/restrictions and episodes of ‘character release’ (i. e. increasing the number of potentially varying characters). In particular, we show that stem lissamphibians had a restricted <b>character</b> <b>space</b> relative to that of stem amniotes, and that stem amniotes both had restrictions on some parts of <b>character</b> <b>space</b> but also invaded new <b>character</b> <b>space</b> that had been unavailable to stem tetrapods...|$|R

Also, using the Fourier algebra, we show that C_BSE(Δ(A)) is not a C^*-algebra in general. Finally for some subsets E of A^*, we define the subspace of BSE-like functions on Δ(A) ∪ E and give a nice application of this space related to Goldstine's theorem.
