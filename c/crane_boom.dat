50|$|To {{demolish}} {{roofs and}} other horizontal spans, {{the ball is}} typically suspended by a length of steel chain attached to the lifting hook of a <b>crane</b> <b>boom</b> above the structure, the rope drum clutch is released and the ball is allowed to free-fall onto the structure. To demolish walls the ball is suspended at the desired height from a <b>crane</b> <b>boom</b> and a secondary steel rope pulls the ball toward the crane cab. The lateral rope drum clutch is then released and the ball swings as a pendulum to strike the structure. Another method for lateral demolition is to pivot the <b>crane</b> <b>boom</b> to accelerate the ball toward the target. This is repeated as needed until the structure is broken down into debris that can easily be loaded and hauled away. The demolition action is carried out entirely through the kinetic energy of the ball.|$|E

40|$|Millions of cranes {{are used}} around the world. Because of their wide-spread use in {{construction}} industries, <b>boom</b> <b>cranes</b> {{are an important}} class of cranes whose performance should be optimized. One limitation of most <b>boom</b> <b>cranes</b> is they are usually attached to a stationary base or a mobile base that is only used for initial positioning and not during operation. This limits the workspace of the <b>boom</b> <b>crane</b> significantly. If a <b>boom</b> <b>crane</b> was attached to a mobile base that could be safely used during lifting operations, then the <b>boom</b> <b>crane</b> workspace could be extended significantly. The problem with using cranes, and in particular mobile cranes, is the large oscillations of the payload that are typically induced when moving the crane. One control strategy {{that has been used}} to control oscillation on other types of cranes is called Input Shaping, a command filtering technique that reduces motion-induced vibration in oscillatory systems. This thesis develops a dynamics model for a mobile <b>boom</b> <b>crane</b> and analyzes the difficulty of controlling payload oscillation on a <b>boom</b> <b>crane.</b> Input shaping will shown to be effective for controlling oscillation on <b>boom</b> <b>cranes.</b> A new method for operating a <b>boom</b> <b>crane</b> in Cartesian coordinates will also be shown. This thesis will also detail the design of a small-scale mobile <b>boom</b> <b>crane</b> for experimental and research purposes. A substantial part of this thesis will also focus on the development of new input-shaping methods for nonlinear drive systems commonly found on boom and other types of cranes. An example application of a control system featuring input shaping for an industrial bridge crane will also be discussed. M. S.

5000|$|Camera cranes may be small, medium, or large, {{depending}} on the load capacity and length of the loading arm. Historically, the first camera crane provided for lifting the chamber together with the operator, and sometimes an assistant. The range of motion of the boom was restricted {{because of the high}} load capacity and the need to ensure operator safety. In recent years a camera <b>crane</b> <b>boom</b> tripod with a remote control has become popular. It carries on the boom only a movie or television camera without an operator and allows shooting from difficult positions as a small load capacity makes it possible to achieve a long reach of the <b>crane</b> <b>boom</b> and relative freedom of movement. The operator controls the camera from the ground through a motorized panoramic head, using remote control and video surveillance by watching the image on the monitor. A separate category consists of telescopic camera cranes. These devices allow setting an arbitrary trajectory of the camera, eliminating the characteristic jib crane radial displacement that comes with traditional spanning shots.|$|E

40|$|Marine cranes are {{important}} loading/unloading equipment in use at ports for transferring goods to/from marine vessels {{such as a}} merchantman. One {{of the most important}} design decision criteria for marine cranes is to ensure that the stress magnitudes remain below the maximum allowable stress values on the crane’s structural members during their operation. However, a full scale test to investigate such loading during design validation may be a very expensive practice or almost impossible. Therefore, it is considered more practicable to work with scale models to investigate stress distributions and likely deformations physically. This study presents stress analysis for a sample marine <b>crane’s</b> <b>boom,</b> which is originally designed with a boom length of 9 m using experimental and numerical methods. To enable the experimental part of the study, a 1 : 10 scale model of a sample marine <b>crane’s</b> <b>boom</b> has been considered. Strain measurement techniques (using strain-gauges) were utilised for the experimental stress measurement of the scale model. Finite Element Method (FEM) as a numerical method was used to map and simulate stress distribution on the scaled boom structure. The results showed that significant information about stress distribution on the crane members could be obtained from FEM simulation. A good correlation between experimental and simulation values of stresses were observed until the boom’s plastic deformation failure...|$|R
40|$|<b>Boom</b> <b>cranes</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{dynamically}} complicated types of cranes because they possess rotational joints as opposed to the linear tracks of bridge and gantry cranes. In addition, if the <b>boom</b> <b>crane</b> is placed on a mobile base, additional complexity is added to the system. However, mobile <b>boom</b> <b>cranes</b> have huge potential benefits as they can be quickly transported from one location to another. Furthermore, if they utilize their mobile base during lifting operations, then they can have an extremely large workspace. All cranes share the same limiting weakness; the payload oscillates when the crane moves. A command-generation approach is taken to control the payload oscillation. Input shaping is one such command-generation technique that modifies the original reference command by convolving it with a series of impulses. The shaped command produced by the convolution can then move the crane without inducing payload oscillation. Input shaping can accommodate parameter uncertainties, nonlinearities, multiple modes of vibration, and has been shown to be compatible with human operators. This thesis focuses on three aspects of mobile boom cranes: 1) dynamic analysis, 2) input-shaping control, and 3) experimental testing. A majority of the thesis focuses on analyzing and describing the complicated dynamics of mobile <b>boom</b> <b>cranes.</b> Then, various input-shaping controllers are designed and tested, including two-mode shapers for double-pendulum dynamics. In order to experimentally verify the simulation results, a small-scale mobile <b>boom</b> <b>crane</b> has been constructed. The details of the mobile <b>boom</b> <b>crane</b> and its important features are presented and discussed. Details of the software used to control the crane are also presented. Then, several different experimental protocols are introduced and the results presented. In addition, a set of operator performance studies that analyze human operators maneuvering the mobile <b>boom</b> <b>crane</b> through an obstacle course is presented. M. S.
