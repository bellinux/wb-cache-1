Soon after leaving the lake they came to a rapid part of the river which flows out of it, where they were obliged to land and carry canoes and goods to the still water further down, but here the ice was still unthawed on the banks, rendering the process of reloading difficult. Soon after they came to a place called the Portage d'Embarras, which is occasioned by driftwood filling up the channel of the river. There they entered the Slave River, where there is a portage or carrying-place named the Mountain, the landing at which is very steep and close to the fall. Below this fall there is a mile of dangerous rapids--and here they met with their first disaster.|$|R

Others hunt by soaring <b>over</b> open <b>ground</b> with wings held in a dihedral, using their stellar vision to watch for prey activity below. It occasionally <b>courses</b> low <b>over</b> the <b>ground</b> like a northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) or hovers like a rough-legged hawk (B. lagopus) while hunting. They frequently engage in transect-glides while actively hunting in flight. It commonly perches on the ground both during migration and on the breeding grounds. While hunting on the ground, almost entirely for large insects, their gait can appear awkward but they are often successful in pinning down several insects per day. During migration, it typically roosts for the night on bare ground with scattered trees, a habit that distinguishes it from fellow long-distance migrants such as the broad-winged hawk (B. platypterus), which roosts in closed-canopy woodlands.|$|R

So back he ran with all speed, and had gotten safely past the thickets, when the seven men came forth into the open road.

50|$|The use of <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> support walkers as an {{approach}} for gait {{training for the}} adult population is another recent development in adult rehabilitation. The value of <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> gait trainers is that these devices are typically more affordable than BWS systems, and they enable additional walking practice beyond the physical therapy session, whether in the institution or in the patient’s home or community environment. By using a gait trainer for <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> walking practice, the patient has support for balance and can now incorporate walking practice into his or her daily routine. For example, rather than remaining in a wheelchair between gait therapy sessions, an individual can use the <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> gait trainer for walking practice {{to and from the}} cafeteria within an institution, or while at a mall when out in the community.Early research indicates that sufficient <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> locomotor training may result in equivalent or possibly greater improvements in walking capacity as compared to the body-weight support treadmill training. The <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> walking practice is a closer replication to the real-world task of walking.

30|$|We can browse almost {{real-time}} ship distributions {{derived from}} AIS data on web {{sites such as}} MarineTraffic ([URL] According to the IMO regulations, ships exceeding 300 gross tonnage and all passenger ships have to send their AIS information via very-high-frequency (VHF) radio transmission (Tetley and Calcutt 2001; IMO 2002). The AIS data include dynamic and static information. The dynamic information includes latitude/longitude (without vertical height), speed over ground (SOG), <b>course</b> <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> (COG), and ship heading (HDG). The static information includes draft, Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI), ship type, and ship name. The AIS data from nearshore vessels (<[*]~[*] 100  km from coast) are received by coastal stations, and those from ships farther offshore can be also received by low-Earth-orbit satellites such as ORBCOMM (Carson-Jackson 2012). The number of ships recognized with AIS data is increasing year by year with increasing seaborne trade and number of satellites (Tournadre 2014; Willick 2014).|$|E
40|$|Collision {{avoidance}} {{is one of}} the high-level {{safety objectives}} and requires a complete and reliable description of the maritime traffic situation. The radar is specified by the IMO as the primary sensor for collision avoidance. In this paper we study the performance of multi-target tracking based on radar imagery to refine the maritime traffic situation awareness. In order to achieve this we simulate synthetic radar images and evaluate the tracking performance of different Bayesian multi-target trackers (MTTs), such as particle and JPDA filters. For the simulated tracks, the target state estimates in position, speed and <b>course</b> <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> will be compared to the reference data. The performance of the MTTs will be assessed via the OSPA metric by comparing the estimated multi-object state vector to the reference. This approach allows a fair performance analysis of different tracking algorithms based on radar images for a simulated maritime scenario...|$|E
40|$|The {{information}} on the Closest Point of Approach (CPA) is required in a potential collision situation as it determines the risk to each vessel. CPA is usually calculated based on the speed {{and direction of the}} approaching ship neglecting the Change Of Speed (COS) and the Rate Of Turn (ROT). This will make the CPA less useful. To improve the CPA calculation, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) information containing the Speed Over Ground (SOG), <b>Course</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Ground</b> (COG), COS and ROT is used. Firstly, a model using these four factors is built to predict ship positions better. Secondly, a three-step CPA searching method is developed. The developed CPA calculation method can assist in informing the navigation decisions and reducing unnecessary manoeuvres. Through the analysis of a real collision scenario, this paper shows that the proposed method can help identify and warn anomalous ship behaviours in a realistic time frame...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{proposes a}} novel application of Skid-to-Turn maneuvers for fixed wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) inspecting locally linear infrastructure. Fixed wing UAVs, following {{the design of}} manned aircraft, commonly employ Bank-to-Turn ma- neuvers to change heading and thus direction of travel. Whilst effective, banking an aircraft during the inspection of ground based features hinders data collection, with body fixed sen- sors angled away {{from the direction of}} turn and a panning motion induced through roll rate that can reduce data quality. By adopting Skid-to-Turn maneuvers, the aircraft can change heading whilst maintaining wings level flight, thus allowing body fixed sensors to main- tain a downward facing orientation. An Image-Based Visual Servo controller is developed to directly control the position of features as captured by onboard inspection sensors. This improves on the indirect approach taken by other tracking controllers where a <b>course</b> <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> directly above the feature is assumed to capture it centered in the field of view. Performance of the proposed controller is compared against that of a Bank-to-Turn tracking controller driven by GPS derived cross track error in a simulation environment developed to replicate the field of view of a body fixed camera...|$|E
40|$|The use of radar {{information}} for collision avoidance is common, {{however it is}} effective only for constant values of ship motion parameters.

30|$|We {{investigated}} ship navigation records {{known as}} Automatic Identification System (AIS) data near the source {{region of the}} 2011 Tohoku, Japan, tsunami. The AIS data of 16 ships in the offshore navigation could be compiled by about 40  min after the tsunami generation. Most of the AIS data showed notable deviation of the ship heading from the <b>course</b> <b>over</b> <b>ground</b> during the tsunami passage. There was good agreement in terms of amplitude/phase between the ship velocity and the simulated tsunami velocity in the direction normal to the ship heading. An equation of motion due to wave drag and inertia forces was examined for an offshore movable floating body. We explain that the ship movement in the direction normal to the heading immediately responds to the tsunami current, and relative velocity between the ship and the tsunami current asymptotically become zero. This indicates the movement velocity of navigating ships in the direction normal to the heading derived from AIS data will work as an offshore tsunami current meter. We examined the AIS data during the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and showed these data could be useful for tsunami source estimation and forecast. The AIS data in the current framework will possibly be a crowd-sourced tool for monitoring offshore tsunami current and tsunami forecast.|$|E

Efficiently extracting featured data from AIS database is always a challenge and time-consuming work for maritime administrators and researchers.

An Evidential Reasoning rule based methodology was proposed to simulate the procedure of extracting routes from AIS database artificially. First, the frequency distributions of ship dynamic attributes, such as the mean and variance of Speed over Ground, <b>Course</b> <b>over</b> <b>Ground,</b> are obtained, respectively, according to the verified AIS data samples. Subsequently, the correlations between the attributes and belief degrees of the categories are established based on likelihood modeling.

In addition, the weight coefficients were trained in a nonlinear optimization model to extract the AIS data more accurately.

The effects of environmental conditions, vessel heave, crabbing (i. e., the difference between vessel heading and actual vessel <b>course</b> <b>over</b> <b>ground),</b> and bottom current on trawl performance with three trawling modes were investigated. Means {{and standard deviations of}} trawl geometry measures were not significantly different between autotrawl and locked-winch systems. Bottom trawls performed better with either autotrawl system as compared to trawling with locked winches by reducing the variance and increasing the symmetry of the footrope contact with the bottom. The equal tension autotrawl system was most effective in counteracting effects of environmental conditions on footrope bottom contact. Footrope bottom contact was most inf luenced by environmental conditions during tows with locked winches. Both of the autotrawl systems also reduced the variance and increased the symmetry of bridle bottom contact. Autotrawl systems proved to be effective in decreasing the effects of environmental factors on some aspects of trawl performance and, as a result, have the potential to reduce among-haul variance in catchability of survey trawls.

The new observing period, known as Cycle 1, is scheduled to begin in 2012. It includes 46 science flights grouped in four multi-week observing campaigns spread through a 13 -month span. Automation of the flight scheduling process offers a major challenge to the SOFIA mission operations.

40|$|AIS (Automatic Identification System) {{data have}} proven to be a {{valuable}} source to investigate vessel behavior. The analysis of AIS data provides a possibility to recognize vessel behavior patterns in a waterway area. Furthermore, AIS data can be used to classify vessel behavior into several categories. The analysis results would help the port authority and other equivalent parties in port design and optimization or marine traffic management. For researchers, it provides a systematic way to understand, simulate and predict vessel behavior. This paper focuses on vessel classification in the Botlek area, Rotterdam from the perspective of vessel behavior. In this paper, the vessel properties, including vessel type, GT (Gross Tonnage), length and beam, have been analyzed to investigate the vessel behavior, which is described by four factors including heading, COG (<b>Course</b> <b>over</b> <b>Ground),</b> SOG (Speed over Ground), and position. In order to discover the behavior patterns in normal situations, several thresholds are set in order to filter the collected AIS data to define such situations. By plotting the AIS data, behavioral changes with the changes of properties have been observed. Hence, the correlations between vessel behavior and different vessel properties are investigated. The results reveal that a vessel’s sailing position and COG are both strongly determined by beam, while SOG is affected by GT. For the heading of a vessel, no obvious correlation with any vessel property is found. Each behavioral factor is clustered according to the correlated vessel property. This way, the criteria to classify the vessels are determined. The vessel classification results based on their behavior would likely to lead to more consistency in the analysis, simulation and prediction of the vessel behavior. The reason is that the development of such a simulation model is based on a systematic recognition of the vessel behavior patterns. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
