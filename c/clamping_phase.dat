40|$|Objectives: To measure paddle motion {{during the}} <b>clamping</b> <b>phase</b> of a breast phantom {{for a range}} of machine/paddle combinations. Methods: A {{deformable}} breast phantom was used to simulate a female breast. Twelve mammography machines from three manufacturers with twenty two flexible and twenty fixed paddles were evaluated. Vertical motion at the paddle was measured using two calibrated linear potentiometers. For each paddle, the motion in millimeters was recorded every 0. 5 seconds for 40 seconds while the phantom was compressed with 80 N. Independent t-tests were used to determine differences in paddle motion between flexible and fixed, small and large, GE Senographe Essential and Hologic Selenia Dimensions paddles. Paddle tilt in the medial-lateral plane for each machine/paddle combination was calculated. Results: All machine/paddle combinations demonstrate highest levels of motion during the first 10 s of the <b>clamping</b> <b>phase.</b> Least motion is 0. 17 ± 0. 05 mm/ 10 s (n= 20) and the most is 0. 51 ± 0. 15 mm/ 10 s (n= 80). There is a statistical difference in paddle motion between fixed and flexible (p< 0. 001), GE Senographe Essential and Hologic Selenia Dimensions paddles (p< 0. 001). Paddle tilt in the medial-lateral plane is independent of time and varied from 0. 04 ° to 0. 69 °. Conclusions: All machine/paddle combinations exhibited motion and tilting and the extent varied with machine and paddle sizes and types. Advances in knowledge: This research suggests that image blurring will likely be clinically insignificant 4 seconds or more after the <b>clamping</b> <b>phase</b> commences...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{dead-time}} {{effect of}} the SVPWM inverter was analyzed {{as well as its}} effect on the control system performance (distortion of phase voltage and zero-current <b>clamp</b> phenomenon of <b>phase</b> current, etc). Then, basing on the analysis about the generation of the dead-time effect, the error voltage vector compensation strategy was raised. In order to verify the correctness and reasonableness of the compensation strategy, simulation system was constructed in use of Matlab/Simulink software to implement analysis and research. Simulation results show that the zero-current <b>clamp</b> phenomenon of <b>phase</b> current was basically eliminated after using the dead-time compensation. Then spectrum analysis was made for the phase current waveform, which showed that the compensation strategy weakened the fifth and seventh harmonic waveform brought by the dead for the inverter, significantly improved sinusoidal and system control performance of the phase current, and proved the theoretical correctness and experimental feasibility. In order to prevent short-circuit fault occurring for the simultaneous conduction of the two power switching devices of the same bridge arm, sometimes dead time is artificially added and set in the software for the voltage source space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) inverter.

A continuous thermodilution method (CCO) and a method for continuous estimation using the arterial pulse wave (PCCO) are also available. METHODS: We compared two methods of intermittent CO measurements in patients during liver transplantation: COpa, regarded as the current clinical standard, and an aortic transpulmonary thermodilution technique (COart) performed with the PiCCO system. We also compared CCO and PCCO. Measurements were made in 62 patients at three stages: after the induction of anaesthesia, after caval <b>clamping</b> <b>phase,</b> {{and at the end}} of surgery. We used Bland-Altman and correlation analysis. RESULTS: We found close agreement between the techniques. Mean bias between COart and COpa and PCCO and CCO was 0. 15 (2 SD of differences between methods= 1. 74) litre min(- 1) and - 0. 03 (1. 75) litre min(- 1), respectively. Mean bias between CCO and COpa and PCCO and COpa was 0. 02 (1. 48) litre min(- 1) and 0. 04 (1. 69) litre min(- 1), respectively.

40|$|Analytical closed-form {{expressions}} for {{harmonic distortion}} factors corresponding to various pulsewidth modulation (PWM) techniques for a two-level inverter {{have been reported}} in the literature. This paper derives such analytical closed-form expressions, pertaining to centered space-vector PWM (CSVPWM) and eight different advanced bus-clamping PWM (ABCPWM) schemes, for a three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverter. These ABCPWM schemes switch each phase at twice the nominal switching frequency in certain intervals of the line cycle while <b>clamping</b> each <b>phase</b> to one of the dc terminals over certain other intervals. The harmonic spectra of the output voltages, corresponding to the eight ABCPWM schemes, are studied and compared experimentally with that of CSVPWM over the entire modulation range. The measured values of weighted total harmonic distortion (WTHD) of the line voltage V-WTHD are used to validate the analytical closed-form expressions derived. The analytical expressions, pertaining to two of the ABCPWM methods, are also validated by measuring the total harmonic distortion (THD) in the line current I-THD on a 2. 2 -kW constant volts-per-hertz induction motor drive...|$|R

A dynamic bubble trap might {{reduce the number of}} gaseous microemboli. MethodsA total of 50 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operation were recruited for this study. In 26 patients a dynamic bubble trap was placed between the arterial filter and the aortic cannula (group 1), and in 24 patients a placebo dynamic bubble trap was used (group 2). The number of high-intensity transient signals within the proximal middle cerebral artery was continuously measured on both sides during bypass, which was separated into 4 periods: phase 1, start of bypass until aortic clamping; <b>phase</b> 2, aortic <b>clamping</b> until rewarming; <b>phase</b> 3, rewarming until <b>clamp</b> removal; and <b>phase</b> 4, <b>clamp</b> removal until end of bypass. S 100 β values were measured before, immediately after, and 6 and 48 hours after the operation and before hospital discharge. ResultsThe bubble elimination rate during bypass was 77 % in group 1 and 28 % in group 2 (P <. 0001). The number of high-intensity signals was lower in group 1 during phase 1 (5. 8 ± 7. 3 vs 16 ± 15. 4, P <. 05 vs group 2) and phase 2 (6. 9 ± 7. 3 vs 24. 2 ± 27. 3, P <. 05 vs group 2) but not during phases 3 and 4. Serum S 100 β values were equally increased in both groups immediately after the operation. Group 2 patients had higher S 100 β values 6 hours after the operation and significantly higher S 100 β values 48 hours after the operation (0. 06 ± 0. 14 vs 0. 18 ± 0. 24, P =. 0133 vs group 2).

40|$|Voltage source {{inverter}} (VSI) is used {{to control}} the speed of an induction motor by applying AC voltage of variable amplitude and frequency. The semiconductor switches in a VSI are turned on and off in an appropriate fashion to vary the output voltage of the VSI. Various pulse width modulation (PWM) methods are available to generate the gating signals for the switches. The process of PWM ensures proper fundamental voltage, but introduces harmonics at {{the output of the}} VSI. Ripple in the developed torque of the induction motor, also known as pulsating torque, is a prominent consequence of the harmonic content. The harmonic voltages, impressed by the VSI on the motor, differ from one PWM method to another. Space-vector-based approach to PWM facilitates a large number of switching patterns or switching sequences to operate the switches in a VSI. The switching sequences can be classified as conventional, bus-clamping and advanced bus-clamping sequences. The conventional sequence switches each phase once in a half-carrier cycle or sub-cycle, as in case of sine-triangle PWM, third harmonic injection PWM and conventional space vector PWM (CSVPWM). The bus-clamping sequences <b>clamp</b> a <b>phase</b> to one of the DC terminals of the VSI in certain regions of the fundamental cycle; these are employed by discontinuous PWM (DPWM) methods. Popular DPWM methods include 30 degree clamp PWM, wherein a <b>phase</b> is <b>clamped</b> during the middle 30 degree duration of each quarter cycle, and 60 degree clamp PWM which <b>clamps</b> a <b>phase</b> in the middle 60 degree duration of each half cycle. Advanced bus-clamping PWM (ABCPWM) involves switching sequences that switch a phase twice in a sub-cycle besides <b>clamping</b> another <b>phase.</b> Unlike CSVPWM and BCPWM, the PWM waveforms corresponding to ABCPWM methods cannot be generated by comparison of three modulating signals against a common carrier. The process of modulation in ABCPWM is analyzed from a per-phase perspective, and a computationally efficient methodology to realize the sequences is derived. This methodology simplifies simulation and digital implementation of ABCPWM techniques. Further, a quick-simulation tool is developed to simulate motor drives, operated {{with a wide range of}} PWM methods. This tool is used for validation of various analytical results before experimental investigations. The switching sequences differ in terms of the harmonic voltages applied on the machine. The harmonic currents and, in turn, the torque ripple are different for different switching sequences. Analytical expression for the instantaneous torque ripple is derived for the various switching sequences. These analytical expressions are used to predict the torque ripple, corresponding to different switching sequences, at various operating conditions. These are verified through numerical simulations and experiments. Further, the spectral properties are studied for the torque ripple waveforms, pertaining to conventional space vector PWM (CSVPWM), 30 degree clamp PWM, 60 degree clamp PWM and ABCPWM methods. Based on analytical, simulation and experimental results, the magnitude of the dominant torque harmonic with an ABCPWM method is shown to be significantly lower than that with CSVPWM. Also, this ABCPWM method results in lower RMS torque ripple than the BCPWM methods at any speed and CSVPWM at high speeds of the motor. Design of hybrid PWM methods to reduce the RMS torque ripple is described. A hybrid PWM method to reduce the RMS torque ripple is proposed. The proposed method results in a dominant torque harmonic of magnitude lower than those due to CSVPWM and ABCPWM. The peak-to-peak torque in each sub-cycle is analyzed for different switching sequences. Another hybrid PWM is proposed to reduce the peak-to-peak torque ripple in each sub-cycle. Both the proposed hybrid PWM methods reduce the torque ripple, without increasing the total harmonic distortion (THD) in line current, compared to CSVPWM. CSVPWM divides the zero vector time equally between the two zero states of a VSI. The zero vector time can optimally be divided to minimize the RMS torque ripple in each sub-cycle. It is shown that such an optimal division of zero vector time is the same as addition of third harmonic of magnitude 0. 25 times the fundamental magnitude to the three-phase sinusoidal modulating signals. ABCPWM applies an active state twice in a sub-cycle, with the active vector time divided equally. Optimal division of active vector time in ABCPWM to minimize the RMS torque ripple is evaluated, both theoretically and experimentally. Compared to CSVPWM, this optimal PWM is shown to reduce the RMS torque ripple significantly over a wide range of speed. The various PWM schemes are implemented on ALTERA CycloneII field programmable gate array (FPGA) -based digital control platform along with sensorless vector control and torque estimation algorithms. The controller generates the gating signals for a 10 kVA IGBT-based two-level VSI connected to a 5 hp, 400 V, 4 -pole, 50 Hz squirrel-cage induction motor.

40|$|Rationale: There {{are several}} methods to measure cardiomyocyte (CM) and muscle {{contraction}} but these require customized hardware, expensive apparatus and advanced informatics or {{can only be}} used in single experimental models. Consequently, data and techniques {{have been difficult to}} reproduce across models and laboratories, analysis is time consuming and only specialist researchers can quantify data. Objective: Here we describe and validate an automated, open source software tool (MUSCLEMOTION) adaptable for use with standard laboratory- and clinical imaging equipment that enables quantitative analysis of normal cardiac contraction, disease phenotypes and pharmacological responses. Methods and Results: MUSCLEMOTION allowed rapid and easy measurement of contractility from high-speed movies in: (i) 1 -dimensional in vitro models such as isolated adult and human pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (hPSC-CMs); (ii) 2 -dimensional in vitro models, such as beating CM monolayers or small clusters of hPSC-CMs; (iii) 3 -dimensional multicellular in vitro or in vivo contractile tissues such as cardiac "organoids", engineered heart tissues (EHT), zebrafish- and human hearts. MUSCLEMOTION was effective under different recording conditions (bright field microscopy with simultaneous patch <b>clamp</b> recording, <b>phase</b> contrast microscopy and traction force microscopy). Outcomes were virtually identical to the current gold standards for contraction measurement such as optical flow, pole deflection, edge-detection systems or manual analyses.

40|$|Ferrets are an {{important}} emerging model of cystic fibrosis related diabetes. However, there is little documented experience {{in the use of}} advanced techniques to quantify aspects of diabetes pathophysiology in the ferret. Glycemic clamps are the gold standard technique to assess both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in humans and animal models of diabetes. We therefore sought to develop techniques for glycemic clamps in ferrets. To assess insulin sensitivity, we performed euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps in 5 – 6 week old ferrets in the anesthetized and conscious states. To assess insulin secretion, we performed hyperglycemic clamps in conscious ferrets. To evaluate responsiveness of ferret islet and entero-insular hormones to low glucose, a portion of the hyperglycemic clamps were followed by a hypoglycemic clamp. The euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps demonstrated insulin responsiveness in ferrets similar to that previously observed in humans and rats. The anesthetic isoflurane induced marked insulin resistance, whereas lipid emulsion induced mild insulin resistance. In conscious ferrets, glucose appearance was largely suppressed at 4 mU/kg/min insulin infusion, whereas glucose disposal was progressively increased at 4 and 20 mU/kg/min insulin.

To elucidate potential mechanisms that may explain this observation, we investigated the effect of All on insulin action in isolated adipocytes obtained from healthy females.

Here, we {{have examined the}} efficacy and mechanisms of action of a novel anti-inflammatory compound (HE 3286) in vitro and in vivo. In primary murine macrophages, HE 3286 attenuates LPS- and TNFα-stimulated inflammation. In Zucker diabetic fatty rats, inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was downregulated in liver and adipose tissue by HE 3286 treatment, as was macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. In line with reduced inflammation, HE 3286 treatment normalized fasting and fed glucose levels, improved glucose tolerance, and enhanced skeletal muscle and liver insulin sensitivity, as assessed by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic <b>clamp</b> studies. In <b>phase</b> 2 clinical trials, HE 3286 treatment led to an enhancement in insulin sensitivity in humans. Gluconeogenic capacity was also reduced by HE 3286 treatment, as evidenced by a reduced glycemic response during pyruvate tolerance tests and decreased basal hepatic glucose production (HGP) rates. Since serum levels of gluconeogenic substrates were decreased by HE 3286, it indicates that the reduction of both intrinsic gluconeogenic capacity and substrate availability contributes to the decrease in HGP. Lipidomic analysis revealed that HE 3286 treatment reduced liver cholesterol and triglyceride content, leading to a feedback elevation of LDL receptor and HMG-CoA reductase expression. Accordingly, HE 3286 treatment markedly decreased total serum cholesterol. In conclusion, HE 3286 is a novel anti-inflammatory compound, which displays both glucose-lowering and cholesterol-lowering effects...|$|R

The current was abolished by 200 μM Ba 2 + or omission of external K + (K 0 +) and showed biexponential inactivation. The current-voltage relation for the peak of the transient outward component showed moderate inward rectification.

40|$|In {{high power}} {{induction}} motor drives, the switching {{frequency of the}} inverter is quite low due to the high losses in the power devices. Real-time PWM strategies, which result in reduced harmonic distortion under low switching frequencies and have maximum possible DC bus utilisation, are developed for such drives in the present work. The space vector approach is taken up for the generation of synchronised PWM waveforms with 3 -Phase Symmetry, Half Wave Symmetry and Quarter Wave Symmetry, required for high-power drives. Rules for synchronisation and the waveform symmetries are brought out. These rules are applied to the conventional and modified forms of space vector modulation, leading to the synchronised conventional space vector strategy and the Basic Bus Clamping Strategy-I, respectively. Further, four new synchronised, bus-clamping PWM strategies, namely Asymmetric Zero-Changing Strategy, Boundary Sampling Strategy-I, Basic Bus Clamping Strategy-II and Boundary Sampling Strategy-II, are proposed. These strategies exploit the flexibilities offered by the space vector approach like double-switching of a phase within a subcycle, <b>clamping</b> of two <b>phases</b> within a subcycle etc. It is shown that the PWM waveforms generated by these strategies cannot be generated by comparing suitable 3 -phase modulating waves with a triangular carrier wave. A modified two-zone approach to overmodulation is proposed. This {{is applied to the}} six synchronised PWM strategies, dealt with in the present work, to extend the operation of these strategies upto the six-step mode. Linearity is ensured between the magnitude of the reference and the fundamental voltage generated in the whole range of modulation upto the six-step mode. This is verified experimentally. A suitable combination of these strategies leads to a significant reduction in the harmonic distortion of the drive at medium and high speed ranges over the conventional space vector strategy. This reduction in harmonic distortion is demonstrated, theoretically as well as experimentally, on a constant V/F drive of base frequency 50 Hz for three values of maximum switching frequency of the inverter, namely 450 Hz, 350 Hz and 250 Hz. Based on the notion of stator flux ripple, analytical closed-form expressions are derived for the harmonic distortion due to the different PWM strategies. The values of harmonic distortion, computed based on these analytical expressions, compare well with those calculated based on Fourier analysis and those measured experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Voltage source {{inverters}} (VSI) {{are popular}} in variable speed induction motor drive applications. Pulse width modulation (PWM) is employed to achieve variable voltage variable frequency output from a fixed DC bus voltage. The modulation method greatly influences the harmonic distortion in line current and the inverter switching loss. This thesis evaluates a few space vectorbased PWM techniques which reduce the harmonic distortion and/or the inverter switching loss, compared to conventional space vector PWM (CSVPWM), {{at a given}} average switching frequency. In space vector-based PWM, the average voltage vector applied over a sub-cycle equals the commanded reference vector, thereby maintaining voltsecond balance. The given average vector can be realized by applying the voltage vectors of the inverter in different sequences. CSVPWM employs a switching sequence {{in which all the}} phases switch once in a sub-cycle. Sequences, in which a <b>phase</b> is <b>clamped,</b> while the other two phases switch once in a sub-cycle have been reported in literature. Further, certain special switching sequences have also been reported recently. These special sequences involve switching a phase twice, while switching the second <b>phase</b> once and <b>clamping</b> the third <b>phase</b> in a sub-cycle. This work investigates the use of such special switching sequences to reduce line current distortion and inverter switching loss in an induction motor drive. The influence of various switching sequences on line current ripple and inverter switching loss is discussed in the thesis. Comparison of the sequences in terms of switching loss leads to a hybrid PWM technique, which deploys the best sequence to reduce switching loss under a given operating condition. This technique is referred to as minimum switching loss PWM (MSLPWM). Further, a procedure for design of hybrid PWM techniques to achieve reduced line current distortion as well as inverter switching loss is elaborated. Four such specially designed hybrid PWM techniques are discussed. Analytical methods are presented for the evaluation of total RMS harmonic distortion factor of line current and inverter switching loss corresponding to different PWM techniques. The MSLPWM and the hybrid PWM techniques are evaluated analytically in terms of harmonic distortion and switching loss. It is observed that the switching loss corresponding to MSLPWM is considerably less than that with CSVPWM over the entire range of power factor. The reduction in switching loss with MSLPWM is as high as 36 % at high power factors close to unity, while it is not less than 22 % at power factors close to zero. MSLPWM also reduces the harmonic distortion for power factors close to unity at high modulation indices. Compared to CSVPWM, the hybrid PWM techniques result in a maximum reduction of about 40 % in the harmonic distortion at fundamental frequencies close to 50 Hz, and about 30 % reduction in switching loss at power factors close to unity. The various PWM techniques are tested on a constant V /f induction motor drive with a digital control platform based on ALTERA Cyclone II field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. With a 10 kVA IGBT based inverter feeding a 2. 2 kW, 415 V, 50 Hz, three-phase induction motor, the total RMS harmonic distortion factor of line current (IT HD) is measured at different fundamental frequencies for the various PWM techniques. The average switching frequency is 2. 44 kHz. The measured values of IT HD show a reduction in distortion with the hybrid PWM techniques over CSVPWM at high speeds of the drive. The relative values of IT HD corresponding to different PWM techniques agree with the theoretical predictions. With the 10 kVA IGBT based inverter feeding a 6 kW, 400 V, 50 Hz, 4 pole, three-phase induction motor, the switching losses corresponding to CSVPWM and MSLPWM are evaluated and compared. This is done by measuring the steady state temperature rise of the heat sink over the ambient for the two techniques under different conditions. The thermal measurements are carried out at different loads with power factor ranging from 0. 14 to 0. 77. The measurements are also carried out at different fundamental frequencies (or modulation indices). Further, to separate conduction (constant) losses and switching (variable) losses, the heat sink temperatures are measured at two different switching frequencies, namely 2. 44 kHz and 4. 88 kHz. It is observed that the temperature rise due to MSLPWM is less than that due to CSVPWM consistently under various operating conditions. The thermal measurements confirm the theoretical prediction of reduction in switching loss with MSLPWM. Measurements of heat sink temperature rise corresponding to CSVPWM, MSLPWM and the hybrid PWM techniques are carried out at a higher power factor of 0. 98 (lag) with the inverter feeding an RL load (instead of an induction motor). The hybrid PWM and MSLPWM result in lower switching losses as indicated by the reduction in temperature rise...|$|R
