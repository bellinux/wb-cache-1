5|$|It is {{possible}} to prevent the onset of prepatellar bursitis, or prevent the symptoms from worsening, by avoiding trauma to the knee or frequent kneeling. Protective knee pads can also help prevent prepatellar bursitis for those whose professions require frequent kneeling and for athletes who play <b>contact</b> <b>sports,</b> such as American football, basketball, and wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in <b>contact</b> <b>sports.</b>|$|E

5|$|When Rocky was {{diagnosed}} with brain damage, {{it must be noted}} that many athletes have a form of brain damage including football players, soccer players, and other individuals in <b>contact</b> <b>sports</b> such as rugby, etc. Rocky never went for a second opinion and yielded to his wife's wishes to stop. So with the advent of new research techniques into brain damage, Rocky was found to be normal among fighters, and he was suffering the results of a severe concussion. By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a clean bill of health for fighters.|$|E
5|$|Once in control, {{however, the}} group allows power {{to go to}} their heads. At first they {{efficiently}} implement their ideas for Springfield, which include banning green traffic lights and playing only classical music at the dog races, which elevates Springfield past East St. Louis on the list of America's 300 Most Livable Cities. However, they begin to internally fight over other ideas such as having theaters for shadow puppets and a broccoli juice program, and their wildly unpopular plans at a public meeting (including the banning of all <b>contact</b> <b>sports</b> and Comic Book Guy's plan to limit breeding to every 7 years) further expose the rifts inside the group.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} outcome of athletes {{returning}} to <b>contact</b> <b>sport</b> with indwelling fracture implants. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of professional rugby union players competing in the South Wales premier league. RESULTS: Fifteen athletes were identified who had returned to competitive rugby union with retained fracture implants during the period 1990 - 97. After fracture fixation, the players resumed their preinjury level of <b>contact</b> <b>sport</b> within one to 12 months. Only two athletes suffered complications {{in relation to the}} retained implant, whereas the other 13 athletes played for up to six years without symptoms. CONCLUSION: The results from this preliminary series suggest that an early return to <b>contact</b> <b>sport</b> is feasible in selected cases. Avoiding the extended delay associated with implant removal affords not only minimal disruption to competitive participation, but also prevents prolonged financial losses for the professional player...|$|R

25|$|Contact {{rules are}} fairly {{straightforward}} and {{are similar to}} other <b>contact</b> <b>sports.</b> Tackles are legal between the knees and shoulders. A player may not initiate a tackle with two hands. All tackles must be initiated from the front side of the opposing player. Any back tackles made {{will result in a}} yellow card, however, if the player turns their back into the tackle, it is not considered illegal. Players can only tackle other players of their same position (with keepers considered chasers) if they have the ball. Pushes are allowed if the arm is held straight; it is illegal to push if the arm is bent and then extended when pushing another player. Players are not allowed to dive for balls, trip opposing players, or initiate contact around the neck. If a player is found making any of these offenses it will result in a card depending on the severity of the offense.|$|E

Herpes Simplex is {{the virus that causes}} cold sores this virus can be spread by oral seceretions and can also cause Herpes Gladiatorial. Once a person becomes infected the virus stays in the body forever and can reactivate itself anytime causing cold sores. Herpes Gladiatorial is a skin infection. it comes from the Herpes Simplex virus which is causes the same lesion one has when they have a cold sore. This form of herpes is on the skin and can be spread through contact with others or sharing beverages with someone who is infected or using anything that they may have contaminated. This virus remains in your system and can reactivate itself at any time causing lesions to appear. Herpes Zoster is the virus which causes shingles and chicken pox. Once one has had the chicken pox they carry the virus forever. Once one has chicken pox the virus is inactive but, if it becomes active again they get the shingles.|$|E
