40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a two-good model of price {{competition}} in an oligopoly where the two goods can be complements or substitutes and each retailer has a <b>captive</b> <b>consumer</b> base `a la Burdett and Judd (1983). We find that the symmetric Nash Equilibrium of this model features atomless pricing strategies for both goods. When the two goods are complements the prices charged by any retailer are, at least locally, negatively correlated so if one of the goods is priced high the other one is on a discount. This finding is supported by an empirical observation that simultaneous discounts of complements are infrequent. In contrast, if the goods are substitutes or independently valued the prices will be randomized independently unless the less valuable substitute is not sold at all. In the case of complements the retailers earn higher profit relative to the case of selling both goods only as a bundle. The ability to "discriminate" between the captives and the shoppers through keeping the sum of the two prices high while setting one of the prices low drives the result. Such discrimination is impossible when the goods are substitutes as consumers switch to buying the lower priced substitute. Additionally, we provide some insights on bundling in the price dispersion setting. ...|$|E

We analytically determine prices that provide generators with a guarantee to avoid such penalties, transferring risk to the suppliers. Additionally, we prove that collaborative learning, through coalitions of suppliers among which information is shared, minimizes the sum of their average risk. Simulations, run for a large sample of parameter combinations, using external and internal regret minimization, show that the convergence of collaborative learning strategies is clearly faster than that resulting from individual learning. Finally, we analyze the suppliers' incentives to organize in a grand coalition versus multiple coalitions, and the tightness of the learning algorithm's theoretical bounds...|$|R

Previous studies have drawn attention {{to the importance of}} the daily rates paid by the federal government to individual facilities in driving the emphasis on detention. This paper, in contrast, argues that tracing the political and economic geography of money inside detention facilities is also critical for understanding detention expansion and its consequences. We define the processes, mechanisms, and practices of generating profit above and beyond the "per-bed" daily rate as "internal micro-economies" of migrant detention. Drawing on an ongoing examination of migrant detention facilities in the greater New York City metropolitan area, we identify four micro-economies evident in detention facilities: the commissary systems, phone and other forms of communication, detainee labor, and detainee excursions outside detention. These economies show how detained migrants' needs and daily routines are tailored in ways that produce migrants as both <b>captive</b> <b>consumers</b> and laborers. Recognition of multiple micro-economies also highlights the fact that the numbers of individuals and entities invested in the incarceration of immigrants proliferate in tandem with the objectification of detainees. The paper further suggests that attending to relationships embedded in the inner workings of detention exposes economic links across carceral boundaries, rendering visible the porosity between government, private companies, and publics...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of uncertainty and risk in electric utility resource planning has received considerable attention in recent years. During the 1980 s, many utilities suffered financial losses because of unexpectedly high plant construction costs and low growth in electricity demand. In addition, {{the introduction of}} competition to the electric industry is creating new risks for power companies. No longer will utilities {{be able to count}} on regulatory protections and a base of <b>captive</b> <b>consumers</b> to provide a stable market and adequate return on their investments. Alternative risk management strategies will have to be considered instead. One approach to managing risk is for a utility company to invest in diverse power sources such as wind power plants. Since wind plants consume no fuel, can be built in relatively small increments with short construction lead times, and generate no pollutants, it is often said that they offer significant protection from risks associated with conventional fossil-fuel power plants. So far there have been few efforts to quantify these benefits, however. The study compares the costs and risks of two competing resource options, a gas-fired combined cycle plant and a wind plant, both utility-owned, through decision analysis. The case study utility is Texas Utilities Electric, a very large investor-owned company serving an area with substantial, high-quality wind resources. The authors chose a specific moment in the future - the year 2003 - when the utility currently plans to build a large fossil-fueled power plant, and examined the implications for the utility`s expected revenues, costs, and profits if a wind plant were to be built instead...|$|R

40|$|The {{natural gas}} {{industry}} combines activities with natural monopoly characterisitics {{with those that}} are potentially competitive. Pipeline transport and distribution, which have natural monopoly characterisitcs, require regulation of price and non-price behavior. Production is a contestable activity, but in a few countries (including Mexico) it remains a state monopoly. Gas marketing is also contestable, but {{the presence of a}} dominant, upstream, vertically integrated incumbent may pose significant barriers to entry. Market architecture decisions [...] such as horizontal structure, regional development, and the degree of vertical integration [...] are also crucial. The authors report that Mexico has undertaken structural reform in the energy sector more slowly than many other countries,but it has introduced changes to attract private investment in natural gas transport and distribution. These changes were a response to the rapid growth in demand for natural gas (about 10 percent a year) in Mexico, which was in turn a response to economic development and the enforcement of environmental regulations. The new regulatory framework provides incentives for firms to invest and operate efficiently and to bear much much of the risk associated with new projects. It also protects <b>captive</b> <b>consumers</b> and improves general economic welfare. The continued vertical integration of the state-owned company Pemex and its statutory monopoly in domestic production posed a challenge to regulators. Their response in liberalizing trade, setting first-hand sales prices, and regulating natural gas distribution makes the Mexican case an interesting example of regulatory design. As the first phase of investment mobilization and competition for the market in Mexican distribution project concludes, remaining challenges include consistently and transparently enforcing regulations, coordinating tasks among government agencies, and ensuring expansion of gas transport services and domestic production. A key challenge in the near term will be fostering competition in the market. In strengthening the role of market forces, one issue is Pemex's discretionary discounts on domestic gas and access to transport services, made possible by its monopoly in domestic production and marketing activities and its overwhelming dominance in transport. The main instrument available to the regulator is proscribing Pemex contract pricing, but more durable and tractable instruments should be considered.

40|$|The three {{chapters}} of this dissertation {{contribute to the}} understanding of strategic firm behavior in oligopolistic markets. In particular, I link spatial market features to standard competition analysis, which enables new perspectives to explain market outcomes in geographically defined markets and provide applications to the grocery retail industry. Chapter 1 studies the importance of returns to product differentiation and distribution economies for a firm’s optimal location choice. Inspired by the empirical work of Holmes (2011), I introduce endogenous distribution costs in the model of Hotelling (1929). The proposed model shows an interesting trade-o between demand and cost considerations when a firm plays a hybrid location strategy. Given the location of local distribution centers and agents’ displacement cost parameters, it is shown that, under certain conditions, the optimal locations of the firms are in the interior of the Hotelling line rather than {{at the edges of the}} line. The supply-cost effect which drives this result diminishes with the distance of the distribution center from the market so that the scale of the distribution area also becomes determinant for an optimal location strategy. Chapter 2 investigates empirically the effect of anticipated price competition and distribution costs in firms’ location choices within an oligopolistic market. I set up a static location-price game of incomplete information in which retailers choose their locations based on (firm-) location-specific characteristics, the expected market power and the expected degree of price competition. In particular, I tie the firms’ strategic location incentives to the population distribution using the concept of <b>captive</b> <b>consumers.</b> This approach is in line with theoretical spatial price competition models and does not require price or quantity data. I address the computational difficulties of the estimation using mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints. Applied to grocery stores operated by the two main conventional supermarket chains in the US, the model confirms the existence of benefits of spatial differentiation for the firms’ profits and provides evidence that the firms anticipate price competition and distribution costs in their site selections. Chapter 3 studies empirically the volatility of retail price indexes at the store level as a result of changes in the local market structure within an urban market. Using a reduced-form pricing equation, I decompose the potential competition effect in the effect of incumbent retailers and the effect of new grocery store openings. Considering the Spanish supermarket industry, which is strongly regulated, I make use of panel data and use a first-difference approach to estimate a distributed-lag model. The results suggest an instantaneous price reaction to entry which is smaller than the long-term competition effect. Possible explanations are constrained price- exibility for incumbent firms in the short run or difficulties of the entrant in establishing themselves as coequal rivals. I find that this gradual price reaction is especially pronounced for supermarkets positioned in the middle price-segment, and the strongest price reaction has been found for high-price retailers.

40|$|The {{residential}} meal {{experience has}} certain unique characteristics {{that can be}} attributed to both the socio-demographic profile of the student and the type of food service provided. These characteristics result in specific expectations that should be satisfied to meet the organisational and financial goals of the service provider and the University. The main challenges include addressing cultural diversity of <b>captive</b> <b>consumers</b> and providing for the specific needs of Generation Y. Globally there is an increased effort to determine the level of satisfaction of students with their meal experiences, in order to improve the food service provided. Limited research within the unique multi-cultural South African context; the changing demographic profile of Pretoria University students since 1996, and the increase in negative media reports regarding foodservice provided on campus motivated the urgent need for an investigation. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the satisfaction of the University of Pretoria‟s residential students regarding their meal experience in terms of the food itself, the service and the ambience, in order to provide the University‟s Department of Residence Affairs and Accommodation with recommendations to improve the meal experience offered by taking into account the demographic profile of students. To obtain the relevant data to meet the stated aim, focus group discussions in which probing questions were asked of the participants were conducted in order to develop a questionnaire. Self-administered questionnaires were issued to a stratified random sample of 878 respondents from 22 responding residences. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and the chi-square test. - vi - Results indicated that most respondents were satisfied with the meal experience. Respondents were most satisfied with the ambience and least satisfied with the food. Respondents were most satisfied with the sensory and portion size attributes, but least satisfied with the price attributes of the food. Respondents were most satisfied with the tangible and empathy attributes of the service and most satisfied with the cleanliness and neatness attributes of the ambience. Food was ranked as most important followed by service and ambience. Freshness, nutritional value and cost (value for money) were ranked the most important attributes of food. Operating hours and cleanliness (neatness) were ranked most important for service and ambience respectively. The food dimension was identified as a priority for improvement, specifically with respect to: the price of both booked meals and commercial items, regular incorporation of new menu items, healthy/nutritious food and variety of fruit and vegetables provided. Apart from the food attributes the availability of stock at item sales and the operating hours in general, were identified as attributes of the service requiring improvement. In addition, statistically significant relationships were found between satisfaction and specific profile characteristics such as ethnic group, gender and the number of years using a specific dining hall. The results of the open-ended question confirmed the findings of the rest of the questionnaire. This study has contributed to the limited literature on student satisfaction regarding their meal experiences at residential dining halls. Valuable recommendations for improvement of the residential meal experience were provided.

40|$|The Zambian {{government}} {{like most}} African governments continue {{to intervene in}} food markets. One such intervention mechanism used in Zambia is the Food Reserve Agency which provides marketing opportunities to farmers {{but at the same}} time protects farmers against the exploitative behaviour of private traders. These private traders are believed to extract monopoly rents from their position between scattered and ill-informed producers, on one hand, and <b>captive</b> <b>consumers,</b> on the other hand. Marketing margin analysis has usually been used to examine the behaviour and competitiveness of markets and the share of a retail commodity price accruing to farmers. Most studies that have used marketing margins analysis have typically considered margins to vary either spatially or temporally. There has been little attempt to understand how or why marketing margins may vary across households holding both space and time constant, even though inter-household variability has been observed in most rural maize marketing areas. This study, therefore, determines the relative importance of spatial factors, temporal factors, and household-specific factors in the maize prices received by farmers in Zambia and in the associated farm-to-retail marketing margin under the assembly trader channel. Understanding where most of the variation in marketing margins and farm prices comes from is an important question that has great policy implications. The study findings reveal that the mean farm-to-retail marketing margin was ZMK 195. 70 per kg of maize, compared to a mean retail price of ZMK 1018. 44 per kg. On average, the farm-gate price was 80 percent of the price obtaining at the retail centres. However, there are wide variations in the prices received by farmers even within the same localized areas and time of sales. Spatial factors were found to account for the largest source of explained variation (72 %) in the maize marketing margin and farm-gate prices obtained by farmers. There is wide inter-district variability in marketing margins. Temporal factors account for the second largest explained variation (16. 7 %) in the marketing margin and the price obtained by farmers. Household-specific factors account for the smallest source of explained variation (11. 3 %) in the marketing margin; factors that were found to significantly affect the size of the marketing margin were marital status, kinship ties to either the chief or village elders and access to price information. The wide inter-household variation in farm-gate prices within the same locality and month suggest the importance of unobserved household-specific factors. These results indicate that the prices that maize farmers in Zambia obtain are not exogenous to farmer characteristics and attributes. In order to raise maize prices that farmers obtain, policies should be aimed at providing timely price information to farmers. Given the importance of spatial factors in explaining variations in farm-gate prices and marketing margins, the results suggest that improved road infrastructure in areas where marketing margins are high could significantly improve farm-gate prices. Lastly, the study reveals that roughly 75 % of the farmers did not travel to sell their produce, because the assembly traders travelled to their homesteads to buy maize. For those farmers who did travel off their farms to market their grain, the average distance travelled from the farm to the point of maize sale was 4. 5 km. These findings suggest that private traders are relieving most Zambian maize farmers of the need to organize transport for them to sell their grain. Nevertheless, the study’s findings indicate great potential for specific public sector investments to narrow the wedge between maize prices received by farmers, and those paid by consumers.

40|$|Tax cuts {{like those}} of 1 January 2000 drive {{consumer}} demand, even though {{only part of the}} liquidity thus gained will be spent on consumption, whereas savings grow to an even greater extent. The propensity to save rises, {{at least in the short}} term, as is the case when the economy is on an upswing. The effect achieved by the cut in direct taxation is countered by the marked rise of some energy prices (especially fuels and heating oil) and the increase of indirect taxes in the second half of 2000, which jointly dampen demand because of their reduction of real income. Energy consumption is forced upon <b>captive</b> <b>consumers,</b> at least in the short term, so that the savings rate usually declines when energy prices go up. Demand was brisk in the first half of 2000 because the effects of the tax reform and the business upswing counteracted the effects of rising energy prices, a situation which also profited retail sales. Since mid-year, retailers report lower sales – a fact which does not give rise to considerable optimism in view of Christmas season. Private household expenditure for private consumption in the first half of 2000 was about 5 percent in nominal terms and 3. 5 percent in real terms above the previous year's figures. As expected, the distinct rise was achieved in spite of a greater savings rate. Real demand for durable consumer goods stagnated in the first six months of 2000. Declining expenditure for passenger cars due to so-called echo effects, and for furniture in the course of the sagging growth in residential building was offset by a growth in expenditure for leisure goods. Conspicuous growth was found in expenditure for communications in the train of the sustained handy and Internet boom. Thanks to greater consumer goods spending on the part of the Austrians, and the higher growth rates enjoyed by the local tourism industry, retailers reported brisk business in the first half of 2000. Wholesalers achieved even higher growth rates than retailers, since industrial production and foreign trade were both expanding vigorously. Prices rose faster in the first six months of 2000 than in the previous years, due to the hefty rise in oil prices. Productivity had also picked up markedly: it appears that keener competition drives streamlining measures. Accordingly, employment is rising at a slow rate only, apparently extending primarily with regard to part-time and marginal jobs. In the second half of the year, retail business was slackening. Average sales in July and August were below the high level of the previous year – a fact which does not give rise to much optimism for Christmas season sales, which is of special import for some sectors. According to the WIFO estimation, Christmas season sales are those sales in December which are in excess of a normal measure calculated using key factors for retail trade development (trend, business cycle, season, calendar, fiscal measures, special effects, etc.). Because of a current change in the statistical base, only a trend can be usefully derived this year. Calculations show that achieving the previous year's levels for Christmas season sales should already be considered a success. Konsumwachstum fiskalisch gestützt.

Acerca de efeitos para a concessionÃria de energia, as discussÃes indicaram que a adesÃo de potenciais consumidores, provavelmente da ultima faixa de consumo (maior que 220 kWh) poderia ocasionar impactos econÃmicos na Receita Operacional Liquida, o que pode ser objeto de pesquisas futuras, mas que a rede elÃtrica seria afetada de forma positiva, uma vez que a carga descentralizada traria uma reduÃÃo de perdas, estabilidade de tensÃo de fornecimento e a possibilidade de postergaÃÃo dos investimentos na ampliaÃÃo da rede de distribuiÃÃo. A pesquisa conclui que a implementaÃÃo plena da ResoluÃÃo ANEEL 482 / 2012 torna-se viÃvel com modificaÃÃes regulatÃrias, regras claras no aspecto tÃcnico, maior participaÃÃo governamental na concessÃo de incentivos financeiros e em linhas especiais de financiamento. Por estas implementaÃÃes, benefÃcios tarifÃrios poderiam refletir de forma positiva para o consumidor cativo, uma vez a energia excedente injetada na rede, acarretaria um melhor planejamento de engenharia das empresas, dimensionando melhor os equipamentos elÃtricos, otimizando, assim, os Ãndices de aproveitamento destes bens, aumentando sua vida Ãtil e contribuindo para a modicidade tarifÃria. This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} financial viability deployment of photovoltaic power generation projects from a consumer perspective. By ANEEL Normative Resolution 482 / 2012, which establishes the general conditions for micro-generation access and minigeneration granted to electricity distribution systems via the compensation method of that energy product. Therefore, {{the survey was}} conducted on Photovoltaic Systems Connected to Network - SFCR {{through the construction of}} two scenarios: (i) proposal for self-sufficiency in photovoltaic generation, paying the cost of distribution and availability taxes due and (ii) where the aim is to use photovoltaics in order to cancel the "sun hours" in alternative generation, also bearing availability and costs owed taxes. The simulations used the KD 140 SX-UPU panel for his money and life, based on the residential user tariff B 1 approved by ANEEL for COELCE through Ratifying Resolution 1, 711 / 2014, which is US $ 0. 35922 / kWh. The outcome of the economic analysis for the consumer proved to be attractive only in the scenario (ii) since the internal rate of return was higher than the Minimum Rate of Attractiveness and the average time calculated Payback 9. 92 years. About effects on power utility, the discussions indicated that the accession of potential consumers, probably the last track consumption (greater than 220 kWh) could cause economic impacts in Net Operating Revenue, which can be further research object, but that the grid would be affected in a positive way, since the decentralized load would bring a reduction of losses, supply voltage stability and the possibility of postponement of investments in the expansion of the distribution network. The research concludes that the full implementation of ANEEL Resolution 482 / 2012 becomes feasible with regulatory changes, clear rules on the technical side, greater government involvement in financial incentives and special lines of credit. For these implementations, tariff benefits could reflect positively to the <b>captive</b> <b>consumers,</b> as surplus energy injected into the network, would lead to better planning engineering companies, better sizing electrical equipment, thus optimizing the utilization rates of these goods, increasing its life and contributing to the low tariff...|$|R
