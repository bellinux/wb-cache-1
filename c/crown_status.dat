40|$|Abstract We studied {{correlation}} between crown conditions and tree-ring widths in 260 trees of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) growing on 33 sites in southern Sweden. The tree-ring increment over 1998 – 2002 was highest in trees with healthy crowns, intermediate in trees with moderately de-clined crowns, and lowest in trees with heavily declining crowns. The time period with significant {{correlation between}} <b>crown</b> <b>status</b> and tree-ring incre-ment varied between 10 years (given autocorrelation in tree-ring chronologies preserved) and 4 years (auto-correlation removed). In pairwise comparisons of three crown classes, differences in tree-ring increment be-tween trees with healthy crowns and trees with heavily declining crowns were the most pronounced, Fisher LSD P value staying below 0. 05 over 13 years (autocorrelation preserved) or 4 years (autocorrelation removed). Over two 5 -year periods (1993 – 1997 vs. 1998 – 2002) the cumulative increment increased sig-nificantly for trees with healthy crowns, did not change in trees with moderately declining crowns, and significantly decreased in trees with heavily declining crowns. For trees with healthy crowns, this dynamics may represent growth recovery after 1992 drought. Instead, oaks with defoliation above 60 % appear to reach a threshold {{in their ability to}} recover growth. At sites on nutrient-poor soils cumulative increments over 1998 – 2002 differed significantly among trees with different crown condition and no differences were observed at sites on nutrient-rich soils. Analyses and interpretation of the oak growth trends as recovered from tree-ring chronologies may be improved by controlling for the <b>crown</b> <b>status</b> of the trees sampled, e. g., by using sampling strategy that would represent the average crown and growth conditions of the sites...|$|E

40|$|Cambial {{electrical}} resistance (CER) {{was used as}} an objective measure of vitality of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in the forests of Slovenia. Trees were rated during the growing season by CER and a subjective <b>crown</b> <b>status</b> index (CSI). Both CER and CSI were inversely correlated to annual ring width increment. Using both CER and CSI, fir were assigned to vitality and vigor categories. Inferences made from these categories and radial growth trends indicated that ring growth decreased prior to the development of canopy symptoms. This decrease in ring growth would have been detected as an increase in CER. This pattern of decline is consistent with the decline of trees due to chronic belowground stress. Variation in CER was due both to the vascular cambium and to the thickness of the nonconducting phloem...|$|E
40|$|Foliar {{features}} can be {{subdivided into}} morphological, chemical, and physiological traits, disease or damage symptoms. Foliar analysis of forest trees is, usually, employed in large scale monitoring programmes, {{taking into account}} only chemical traits.

40|$|Context - One {{short-term}} {{adjustment of}} trees to drought is {{the reduction of}} photosynthetic tissues via leaf shedding. But in conifers, it usually takes several years to fully restore needle mass and assimilation capacity. Aims - This study aims to evaluate whether leaf shedding sustainably damages conifers or if these trees still {{have the ability to}} recover from drought with respect to their foliage and wood formation. Methods - An irrigation experiment was established in a mature dry forest to test the growth reactions of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) differing in crown transparency (low, medium, high) to a drought release by irrigation in comparison with equivalent control trees growing under naturally dry conditions on the same site. Results - Drought and high crown transparency had a combined negative effect on radial tree growth: Control trees with medium to high crown transparencies showed a substantially shorter growth period and a long-lasting growth depression in response to the severe summer drought in 2003. However, all trees benefited from irrigation, irrespective of their <b>crown</b> <b>status,</b> and immediately increased growth in response to irrigation. Conclusion - The progressed drought-induced defoliation seemed to be a weakening factor for trees suffering from drought, but this can be reversed if the water supply is improved...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} {{the prevalence of}} inflammatory root resorption and associated factors in 1068 primary mandibular molars in 453 children 3 to 12 years of age. Age, dental history and medical history were recorded using a questionnaire administered to the children's parents/caregivers. Previously trained and calibrated examiners assessed radiographic images of the primary molars by direct observation, {{with the aid of}} a viewing box. Root resorption (physiological or inflammatory), dental <b>crown</b> <b>status</b> (healthy, carious with no pulp involvement, carious with pulp involvement and evidence of restoration), and pulpotomy or pulpectomy were determined. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, the chi-square test and a multiple logistic regression (p < 0. 05). The prevalence of inflammatory root resorption was 16. 2 % (n = 173). The male gender (OR: 1. 4; 95 % CI), the 3 -to- 7 -years age bracket (OR: 1. 5; 95 % CI), an unhealthy dental crown (OR: 8. 7; 95 % CI), caries with pulp involvement (OR: 7. 4; 95 % CI), pulpotomy (OR: 3. 1; 95 % CI), and pulpectomy (OR: 5. 4; 95 % CI) were risk factors for the occurrence of inflammatory root resorption in primary molars. In conclusion, the prevalence of inflammatory root resorption in the present sample was 16. 2 %. Gender, age, an unhealthy tooth, caries with pulp involvement, pulpotomy, pulpectomy, and the absence of a restoration were associated with a higher occurrence of inflammatory root resorption in primary molars...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey on}} the {{occurrence}} of Phytophthora species in oak ecosystems in Austria was conducted from April to May 1999 and in June 2000. The investigations were carried out at 35 study sites distributed throughout the zone of oak forests in eastern Austria. Four oak species, including Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. cerris and Q. pubescens were considered in the survey. Rhizosphere soil samples were taken from sample trees, which consisted of healthy and declining trees as indicated by their crown transparency. Young oak leaflets were used as baits to recover Phytophthora species. The assemblage of Phytophthora spp. detected in Austrian oak forests consisted of five species, including Phytophthora quercina, P. citricola, P. gonapodyides, P. europaea and P. syringae. P. quercina and P. citricola were isolated from 11 and seven sites, respectively, and were thus {{the most common and}} most widely distributed species. The three other species were recovered only sporadically. P. citricola could be separated into two morphologically and genetically well-characterized types (A and B). Phytophthora species, in particular the common P. quercina and P. citricola occurred on sites showing a wide variety of soil types, soil textures and moisture classes. There was mild evidence for connection between deteriorating <b>crown</b> <b>status</b> and the presence of Phytophthora spp. Furthermore, significant differences in contents of magnesium, as well as calcium, aluminium, nitrogen and carbon at different soil depths (0 – 10, 10 – 20 and 20 – 40 cm) were detected between Phytophthora-infested and Phytophthora-free sites. The {{results of the present study}} provide circumstantial evidence that Phytophthora species are involved in oak decline at certain sites in Austria. ...|$|E
40|$|Ash dieback due to Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is {{threatening}} the Fraxinus excelsior species {{in most of}} its natural range in Europe and it is becoming obvious that other species in the Fraxinus genus are susceptible to the disease. The fungal pathogen apparently originates from Asia where it may act as an endophyte of local species like F. mandshurica. Previous studies reported significant levels of genetic variability for susceptibility in F. excelsior either in field or inoculation experiments. The present study {{was based on a}} field experiment planted in 1995, fifteen years before onset of the disease. Crown and collar status were monitored on 788 trees from 23 open-pollinated progenies originating from 3 French provenances. Susceptibility was modelled using a Bayesian approach where spatio-temporal effects were explicitly taken into account, thus providing accurate narrow-sense heritability estimates (h 2). While moderate narrow-sense heritability estimates for Crown Dieback (CD, h 2 = 0. 42 in this study) have already been reported in the literature, this study is first to show that Collar Lesions are also heritable (h 2 = 0. 49 for prevalence and h 2 = 0. 42 for severity) and that there is significant genetic correlation between the severities of both traits (rspearman= 0. 40). Unexpectedly, their spatio-temporal dynamics followed almost opposite patterns. While no significant Provenance effects were detected for any trait, significant Family effects were found for both CD and CL. Moreover, the analysis strategy implemented here allowed to compute Individual Breeding Values (IBV) and to show that there is more genetic variability within families than between families. In agreement with previous reports, early flushing correlates with better <b>crown</b> <b>status.</b> Consequences of these results in terms of management and breeding are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{disturbances}} play a {{key role}} in forest ecosystems. However, they potentially cause severe economic damage to forest owners and may have an inappropriate ecological impact on the environment. In Central Europe, beetle infestations in Norway spruce (Picea abies, L.) forests increased step by step over the past two decades with some dramatically increase in consequence of dry years (e. g. years 2003 / 2004). Considering the climate change, itâ€™s necessary to establish early detection and early warning systems with suitable automated monitoring methods. Insofar remote sensing techniques are considered effective for early detection of potentially infested areas. Numerous studies point out the capacity of remote sensing for detecting the (declining) health status of trees. While advanced stages of damage (so called "red-attack" and "grey-attack") can be easily detected, the early detection of an infestation (referred to as "green-attack") is still problematic. For this reason, research to detect infestation before visible discoloration (â€œgreen attackâ€) with help of remote sensing has to go on. In our study we analysed the suitability of very high spatial resolution multi- to hyperspectral remote sensing data for mapping spruce vitality in Central Europe. The test site in Bavaria (Germany) consists of two Norway spruce stands (60 and 100 years old). In each of the two stands, 70 trees were artificially weakened by girdling (done in May 2013). A 20 cm wide stripe of bark was circularly removed from the trunk. At the same time, unstressed control trees were identified. For monitoring of the trees, we used mainly airborne hyperspectral data with ground resolution between 0. 5 m (VNIR) and 2. 0 m (SWIR). The data were acquired during the vegetation period of 2013 and data collection continued throughout 2014. Additionally, WorldView- 2 satellite data with 2. 0 m spatial resolution and eight spectral bands from five acquisition times (2013 and 2014) were acquired. Object based methods were used to analyse individual tree crowns. The experiment was complemented by field based inspections of <b>crown</b> <b>status</b> as well as needle sample collection. The needles were measured with a field spectrometer and analysed chemically. With this unique multi-temporal data set we were able to locate the most sensitive wavelength regions for this phenomenon and to detect the extent where girdled trees still appear green but changes in reflectance spectra indicate a declining vitality. In autumn 2013 the test area was extended by another test site in Austria where the analysis methods were adopted...|$|E
