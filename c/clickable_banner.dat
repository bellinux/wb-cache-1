The research objective was to determine, why people do not click on banners and to find ways in which advertisers can make banner advertisements appeal to consumers more effectively. Outcomes of the research suggested which features advertisers should avoid when developing clickable banners. An extensive literature review was carried out in order to highlight important aspects of historic research. The analysis conducted on this topic indicated that a gap exists in the area of public attitudes towards <b>clickable</b> <b>banner</b> advertising and the reasons why people avoid clicking on banners. To address the above questions, peoples’ attitudes towards banner and other Internet advertising were investigated through focus group interviews and surveys. The findings suggest that the main reason for the ignorance surrounding clickable banners was the low involvement between the product or service being advertised and the viewer’s interests. Other reasons included the high annoyance level of banner advertising and the threat of viruses that some banners may pose. Conclusions of the research recommend narrow targeting and personalisation of banner advertisements, constant rotations and replacements of banners to avoid burnouts as well as trustful and original appeal and content. Other important findings included: • The majority of people are indifferent towards banners, • People with less than three years of Internet experience tend to click more than people with more than three years of Internet experience, • Females showed more “clickable behaviour” than males, • People are more likely to click on banners which present interesting information, are bright and animated or promote catchy phrases for the surfer, • People prefer to see banners located on the top of the page or on the right side of the page, • Pop-ups are the most noticeable and are possibly the route cause of what triggers people to become annoyed or dislike banner ads, Findings of this research have high social value. If advertisers would take into account the results of the current study, they would be able to create more effective banners, which could effectively be redirected to the appropriate target market. This will enable them to cut their costs. Furthermore, online users would enjoy a more polite and friendly online environment, where their interests will be taken into account, which would diminish the current gap between customers and advertiser...|$|E
