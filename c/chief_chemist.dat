After receiving his doctorate in 1893, he published a scientific treatise on malaria entitled On Malarial Pathology (El Hematozoario del Paludismo), which was favorably received in the scientific community. He then went to Belgium and France, and worked as assistant to Dr. Latteaux at the Pasteur Institute and to Dr. Laffen. In recognition of his ability, he was commissioned by the Spanish government to study tropical and communicable diseases. In 1894, {{he returned to the}} Philippines where he took part in an examination to determine who would become the <b>chief</b> <b>chemist</b> of the Municipal Laboratory of Manila. Luna came in first and won the position.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} adhesive {{was a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's <b>Chief</b> <b>Chemist</b> was soon working on the problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E

25|$|Freeth {{became the}} company's <b>chief</b> <b>chemist</b> in 1909, working at Winnington in Cheshire. In 1909, he was tasked with {{investigating}} {{the manufacture of}} ammonium nitrate for explosives; needing to read a paper by Franciscus Hubertus Schreinemakers in Dutch, he bought study materials for the language and quickly learned to read it. Freeth corresponded with Dutch chemists, joined the Dutch Chemical Society in 1911 and devoured the Dutch chemical literature in his areas of interest almost entirely by 1914.|$|E
5000|$|Observers at {{this test}} {{produced}} optimistic accounts. The chief of incendiary testing at Dugway wrote: A reasonable number of destructive fires can be started {{in spite of}} the extremely small size of the units. The main advantage of the units would seem to be their placement within the enemy structures without the knowledge of the householder or fire watchers, thus allowing the fire to establish itself before being discovered. The National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) observer stated: [...] "It was concluded that X-Ray is an effective weapon." [...] The <b>Chief</b> <b>Chemist's</b> report stated that, on a weight basis, X-Ray was more effective than the standard incendiary bombs in use at the time: [...] "Expressed in another way, the regular bombs would give probably 167 to 400 fires per bomb load where X-Ray would give 3,625 to 4,748 fires." ...|$|R

Apparently in 1865 he had been made a brigadier general in the Georgia Militia, too, though he also kept his Confederate rank. His older brother Gabriel J. Rains was a West Point absolvent of 1827 and served as Confederate brigadier general as well. The older Rains had specialized in the creation and use of mines, booby traps and torpedoes; and headed the Torpedo Bureau. Though not working together the brothers were collectively known as Bomb Brothers while George Rains on his own had been called the <b>Chief</b> <b>Chemist</b> of the Confederacy.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Fowler suggested to Edward Ardern, his <b>chief</b> <b>chemist,</b> and William Lockett, the chief research assistant, that they research {{ways to reduce the}} growth of algae. They lowered the light levels, as sunlight often triggered the growth of algae, and kept the precipitant floc, which contained many bacteria, from one experiment to the next. Each subsequent experiment was more successful than the last, as the sludge showed better clarifying properties as it got older. Ardern and Lockett had discovered the Activated Sludge Process, which was soon being used worldwide. The research was carried out at Manchester University, and Fowler presented the results at the Grand Hotel in Manchester in April and November 1914.|$|E
25|$|After the Alvord mine in California was {{destroyed}} in a fire, Burnham stayed in California until 1894 to wrap up his family's affairs with the mine and left for the South African Republic {{as soon as he}} could to join his brother Fred already in Bulawayo, Matabeleland. He soon found work as a mining engineer and {{was in charge of the}} assay laboratory and smelting room at the Langlaagte Royal Mine in the Transvaal. In 1895, he was preparing to accompany his brother in a massive expedition into Northern Rhodesia when he took ill and was forced to leave for Europe to recuperate. He left for Germany accompanied by his nephew Roderick, and the two of them then went to London, England. In 1895, he married his first wife Margaret. He returned to the United States and from 1896-1898 attended the Michigan Mining School (now Michigan Technological University), graduating with an S.B. By September 1898, he and his wife were back in Africa and he was working for an English syndicate and supervising over 2,000 miners at the Rosa deep gold mine near Johannesburg, South Africa. While in the Transvaal, Burnham was a <b>chief</b> <b>chemist,</b> an engineer, and an assistant inspector for mines, and he wrote a textbook: Modern Mine Valuation.|$|E

25|$|Florence Hawley {{was born}} in Cananea Sonora, Mexico where her father was <b>chief</b> <b>chemist</b> for a copper mine. In 1913, after the {{outbreak}} of the Mexican Revolution, her family moved to Miami, Arizona. She was introduced to archaeology at a young age from her father during his excavating of ruins around their home in southern Arizona. In 1936 Florence married archaeologist Donovan Senter; together they had a daughter named Andrea. In 1950, after a divorce from Senter, she married Bruce Ellis who was a historian. Their marriage lasted until {{the time of his death}} in 1985. She began teaching at the University of Arizona in 1929, where she was introduced to dendrochronology in a class taught by A. E. Douglass. She began teaching at the University of New Mexico fall of 1934 until she retired in 1971. It is possible that more professional anthropologists in the United States were taught by Hawley than by any other member of the profession. Even after her retirement she remained active in field research up until her death in 1991. She continued to write and excavate. She was passionate about her work and even after a broken hip returned to the field during her recuperation to supervise. She broke new ground in her research by developing and applying innovative techniques of chemical analysis, dendrochronology, ethnohistory, and Ethnoarchaeology.|$|E

500|$|During the First World War, {{the morning}} of 13 June 1917 was the first ever {{daylight}} air-raid over the East End which in total killed 104 people. Sixteen of the dead were 5 and 6 year olds who were sitting in their class room at Upper North Street School, Poplar when the bomb hit. The memorial which still stands today in Poplar Recreation Ground was built by A.R. Adams, a local funeral director at the time. [...] Also, on 19 January 1917, 73 people died, including 14 workers, and more than 400 were injured, in a TNT explosion in the Brunner-Mond munitions factory in Silvertown. Much of the area was flattened, and the shock wave was felt throughout the city and much of Essex. This was the largest explosion in London history, and was heard in Southampton and Norwich. Andreas Angel, <b>chief</b> <b>chemist</b> at the plant, was posthumously awarded the Edward Medal for trying to extinguish the fire that caused the blast. The same year, on 13 June, a bomb from a German Gotha bomber killed 18 children in their primary school in Upper North Street, Poplar.

The eam had discovered viscose but were unable to discover how it might be spun. Beer solved that puzzle with acid fixing treatment to secure the requisite strength, softness and lustre. The silken substance could then be used to create thread suitable for numerous applications in the clothing trade, though further development was needed to make the process reliable. In addition, pyroxyline was introduced from which collodion could be produced in thin sheets, which when shaped and carbonised would be used in electric lamps, textile fabrics and even insulating thread.|$|R
