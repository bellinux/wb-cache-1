5|$|Elizabeth David Ltd {{was never}} more than {{modestly}} profitable, but David would not lower her standards {{in search of a}} commercial return. A new manager was brought in to run the shop and David fought against many of his changes, but she was always in the minority against her fellow directors. The stress of disagreements over company policy—and the deaths of her sister Diana in March 1971 and her mother in June 1973—contributed to health problems and she suffered from <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> and swollen, ulcerous legs. Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, the shop continued to trade under her name, although she tried periodically to persuade her former colleagues to change it.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins. This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue</b> syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{investigate}} whether premorbid maternal and childhood psychological problems are {{risk factors for}} <b>chronic</b> disabling <b>fatigue</b> at age 13  years among children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort. MethodsChronic disabling fatigue was defined as fatigue of at least 3 -month, and up to 5 -year, duration that prevented school attendance or hobbies/sport/leisure activities, and for which other causes were not identified. Maternal psychological factors were symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed up to eight times between pregnancy and age 6  years. We investigated critical periods for maternal effects and effects of paternal depression at three time points. Child psychological factors included internalizing and externalizing problems and upsetting life events occurring at age 7 – 8  years. ResultsOf 5, 657 children, 110 (1. 9 %) had <b>chronic</b> disabling <b>fatigue</b> at age 13  years. Maternal anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1. 19; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 09 – 1. 31 per episode), maternal depression (AOR, 1. 24; CI, 1. 11 – 1. 39 per episode), child psychological problems (AOR, 1. 19; CI, 1. 00 – 1. 41 per problem), and upsetting events (AOR, 1. 22; CI,. 99 – 1. 58 per event) were associated with <b>chronic</b> disabling <b>fatigue.</b> Associations of child psychological problems and upsetting events were attenuated (AOR, 1. 12; CI,. 93 – 1. 33 per problem; AOR, 1. 19; CI,. 94 – 1. 52 per event) after further adjusting for maternal anxiety and depression. ConclusionsPediatricians {{need to be aware}} that children whose mothers experience anxiety and/or depression between pregnancy and child's age 6  years have an increased risk of developing <b>chronic</b> disabling <b>fatigue</b> in early adolescence. Conversely, clinicians need to be alert to fatigue in children whose mothers have longstanding anxiety and depression. These findings suggest the importance of family-based approaches to treatment...|$|R

5|$|In 1989, the {{character}} {{was used to}} highlight another important gynaecological health issue, fibroids. The storyline sees Pauline ignoring health problems, such as <b>chronic</b> <b>fatigue,</b> and using homoeopathic preparations rather than seeking medical assistance. Her fibroids are discovered by chance, when {{the character}} Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) knocks her down in his Austin Mini. In the 1989 Boxing Day episode, Pauline spends time in hospital, recovering from a necessary hysterectomy. Wendy Richard has since revealed that the storyline had originally been scripted differently. Before the outcome of Pauline's illness was screened, producers had decided that the character was to be killed off with cancer. This was a decision {{that had been made}} by the show's boss, Mike Gibbon, to refresh the format by replacing some of the serial's older characters. The scriptwriters went as far as giving Pauline a mystery illness. The newly appointed executive producer, Michael Ferguson, decided to scrap the original storyline, believing that Pauline, as one of the soap's original characters, was too valuable an asset to lose. The storyline was rewritten and the character was given a different gynaecological ailment that was treatable.|$|E

40|$|Fatigue is {{a common}} and {{distressing}} long-term consequence of cancer. <b>Chronic</b> cancer-related <b>fatigue</b> affects work ability, hampers in maintaining social relations, and impacts patients’ well-being. Most treatments for <b>chronic</b> cancer-related <b>fatigue</b> focus to some extend on changing physical behavior, {{but there is a}} large variability in the way they do this. This thesis focuses on an online intervention that targets physical behavior by using an ambulant activity coach. In this ambulant activity feedback therapy (AAF), a physiotherapist guides patients following a nine week intervention protocol. The ambulant activity coach, consisting of a hip worn accelerometer and a smartphone, provides feedback on a patient’s physical behavior during the day and reinforces a physical activity goal that the patient defines together with the physiotherapist. A three-armed randomized controlled trial was performed to test AAF and an online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy next to a control group that received weekly psycho-educational information. This trial has led to a number of studies, and provided insight in the heterogeneity of the physical behaviors of the study population, in the effectiveness of the intervention in terms of fatigue, mental health, and perceived work ability, and in its working mechanisms. As two thirds {{of the participants in the}} AAF group reduced fatigue clinically significantly, and effects remained up to a year after randomization, it was concluded that AAF is a promising intervention for reducing <b>chronic</b> cancer-related <b>fatigue...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To gain {{an insight}} into the daily {{physical}} activity levels of patients with <b>chronic</b> pain or <b>fatigue</b> compared with asymptomatic controls. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Picarta, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, reference tracking and a manual search of relevant journals. Review methods: A systematic, computerized database search of the medical databases up to September 2006 was performed. In addition, a hand search of relevant journals was carried out. Appropriate studies reported on the daily physical activities of adult patients with <b>chronic</b> pain or <b>fatigue</b> and included an asymptomatic control group. Two reviewers independently carried out methodological quality assessment and data extraction. A qualitative analysis was performed. Results: Twelve studies were included, involving five different syndromes. Results show large heterogeneity in methods used and syndromes investigated, which limited evidence. Eleven different methods {{were used to assess}} daily physical activities resulting in 16 different outcome parameters. There seem to be differences between the different syndromes, but results are not conclusive. Eight studies reported a lower physical activity level in patients compared with controls.

40|$|<b>Chronic</b> daytime <b>fatigue</b> and {{excessive}} daytime sleepiness (EDS) are potentially invalidating and also common complaints in primary care and general neurological practice. The lack of distinction in the clinical use of terms like fatigue and sleepiness is an important issue. Although these semiological concepts present fundamental differences from physiological and pathological points of view, general medical literature still often confuses both symptoms. The objective of the present review is {{to contribute to the}} clinical distinction between fatigue and sleepiness and describe available measurement tools and respective treatment options. We found that sleepiness and fatigue both present with semiological multidimensionality and clinical complexity. Although relating to different underlying concepts, they can show overlapping features and several clinical conditions can present with both complaints simultaneously. Existing specific assessment tools are sometimes underutilised, causing EDS and fatigue to continue to be confounded. The blurring contributions of several studies are mainly {{due to the fact that}} typically only one of these two clinical dimensions is investigated. Despite consensus on objective sleepiness measures, simple and validated objective fatigue assessments are generally lacking and seem elusive. Causal and symptomatic treatment options exist predominantly for sleepiness-associated conditions. Although comprehension of sleepiness and its under - lying physiology has seemed to improve over time, descriptions of common pathways of fatigue remain relatively incomplete. Clinical research and practice should systematically investigate both conditions with adequate measurement tools. Behavioural medicine is certainly underestimated, especially in the management of <b>chronic</b> daytime <b>fatigue.</b> SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
