5|$|A second Feast Day {{was added}} in 2007 by a benefaction from George Moody, {{formerly}} of Oriel, {{to be celebrated}} on or near St George's Day (23 April). The only remaining gaudy had been Candlemas; the new annual dinner was {{to be known as}} the St. George's Day Gaudy. The dinner is black tie and gowns, and by request of the benefactor, the main <b>course</b> <b>will</b> normally be goose. The inaugural event took place on Wednesday 25 April 2007.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} in March 2011 that Franco will teach a fall semester course on modifying poetry into short films to ten to twelve third-year graduate film students at NYU.

5|$|The chased hare {{will then}} run at around 40–45km/h (24–26mph) and the <b>course</b> <b>will</b> last around 35–40seconds over 0.5km (0.3 miles). The greyhounds which pursue the hare will, being faster, start {{to catch up}} with it. As greyhounds are much larger than hares but less agile, they find it {{difficult}} to follow the hares' sharp turns which they make to evade the dogs. This agility gives the hare an important and often crucial advantage as it seeks to escape. Under some coursing club rules, the dogs are awarded points on how many times they can turn the hare, and how closely they force the hare's progress. In the UK, the contest between the greyhounds was usually judged from horseback, and the winning greyhound proceeded to the next round of a knock-out tournament. The 2003 UK coursing season ran from 1 October to 28 February.|$|E

25|$|The {{academic}} programme at IIT Jammu {{would follow}} the curriculum of IITDelhi to begin with. IIT Jammu will evolve its own curriculum with time. Thus, in the first year, all students, irrespective of the branch, will undergo the same curriculum. In the first year, the students would do courses on basic sciences and basic engineering. In addition, non-graded courses on language, professional ethics & social responsibility and introduction to engineering are also included. The institute will follow a credit system and the performance in a <b>course</b> <b>will</b> be continuously evaluated. A relative grading system will be followed.|$|E
25|$|Where {{a course}} {{begins with a}} quoin stretcher, the <b>course</b> <b>will</b> ordinarily {{terminate}} with a quoin stretcher at the other end. The next course up will begin with a quoin header. For the course's second brick, a queen closer is laid, generating the lap of the bond. The third brick along is a stretcher, and is—on account of the lap—centred above the header below. This second course then resumes its paired run of stretcher and header, until the final pair is reached, whereupon a second and final queen closer is inserted as the penultimate brick, mirroring the arrangement {{at the beginning of}} the course, and duly closing the bond.|$|E

25|$|In most {{competition}}s, riders {{are allowed}} to walk the initial course but not the jump-off course (usually the same course with missing jumps, e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) before competition to plan their ride. Walking the course before the event {{is a chance for}} the rider to walk the lines he or she will have to ride, in order to decide how many strides the horse will need to take between each jump and from which angle. Going off <b>course</b> <b>will</b> cost time if minor errors are made and major departures will result in disqualification.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 a {{university}} level course aiming {{to encourage and}} support practitioners working with young children to introduce the Cornish language into their settings was launched. The Cornish Language Practice Project (Early Years) is a level 4 course approved by Plymouth University and run at Cornwall College. The course is not a Cornish language course, but students will be assessed {{on their ability to}} use the Cornish language constructively in their work with young children. The <b>course</b> <b>will</b> cover such topics as Understanding Bilingualism, Creating Resources and Integrating Language and Play, but the focus of the language provision will be on Cornish. A non-accredited specialist Cornish language course has been developed to run alongside the level 4 course for those who prefer tutor support to learn the language or develop their skills further for use with young children.|$|E

500|$|Injury to {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve commonly occurs during neck surgery, including neck dissection and lymph node excision. It can also {{occur as a}} result of blunt or penetrating trauma, and in some causes spontaneously. Damage at any point along the nerve's <b>course</b> <b>will</b> affect the function of the nerve. The nerve is intentionally removed in [...] "radical" [...] neck dissections, which are attempts at exploring the neck surgically for the presence and extent of cancer. Attempts are made to spare it in other forms of less aggressive dissection.|$|E
500|$|The praise Seward has {{received}} extends {{to his work}} during the Civil War. Stahr wrote that Seward [...] "skillfully managed the nation's foreign affairs, avoiding the foreign intervention that would have ensured that the Confederacy would become a separate nation". Nevertheless, historians, focusing on the battlefields of the Civil War, have given him relatively little attention. Seward has a dozen biographers, while thousands of books focus on Lincoln. According to Crofts, [...] "Seward and Lincoln were {{the two most important}} leaders spawned by the intersection of antebellum idealism and partisan politics. Lincoln, of <b>course,</b> <b>will</b> always overshadow Seward. Before 1860, however, Seward eclipsed Lincoln." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{start of}} this year's race {{was moved to the}} University of London Boat Club, {{approximately}} [...] further upstream. [...] After discussion between the umpire, the two boat club presidents, the coaches Haig-Thomas and Gibbons, and a representative of the Port of London Authority, the course was shortened to avoid potential eddies around temporary buttresses erected by Putney Bridge which was undergoing repair. [...] As noted by former Oxford rower E. P. Evans, writing in The Manchester Guardian, [...] "no comparisons of times with previous races can be made, because the points on the <b>course</b> <b>will</b> be different". [...] It was {{the first time since the}} 1863 race that the event was not conducted between the University Stone and Mortlake.|$|E
500|$|Maurice {{retreated to}} Exeter, while the Earl of Essex {{continued}} down into Devon and Cornwall, after sending Blake to capture Taunton. Essex's campaign failed, suffering a total defeat at the Battle of Lostwithiel in early September 1644. His remaining forces retreated back to Dorset, leaving only Plymouth, Lyme Regis and Taunton under Parliamentarian {{control in the}} south-west. The Earl of Warwick {{sent a letter to}} Parliament, detailing the hardships endured by the town during the siege, and requesting [...] "some speedy <b>course</b> <b>will</b> be taken for their relief". Parliament voted to grant the town £1,000 a year and that unconditional compensation should be paid to residents who had suffered losses in the siege. Lyme maintained a garrison through the war, finally disbanding in July 1647.|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{generally}} recognised prestige, {{the competition}} has been strongly criticised by some established Australian pianists. The pianist and composer Larry Sitsky said: [...] "The title Sydney International Piano Competition sounds grand and definitive. But behind the facade {{is a rather}} shabby private party in progress". The Liszt specialist and composer Leslie Howard said: [...] "I was asked {{to be on the}} international advisory panel for this years ago ... and since then have never heard from any of them. ... No-one, of <b>course,</b> <b>will</b> ever hear from any of the prize-winners. They all seem to have had rather too close connections with members of the jury, which in any case is composed mostly of lacklustre teachers ... who have never been professional concert pianists in their lives and wouldn't recognise good and original artistry if it jumped up and bit them". Michael Kieran Harvey has asked: [...] "What does the complete lack of success past SIPCA winners have had at making a career say about the cloth-eared selectors who travel around the world at great expense auditioning young hopefuls? Why, if SIPCA is such an internationally significant competition, are second-rate teachers no-one's ever heard of, to say nothing of completely unqualified non-musicians, sitting in judgment at this supposedly premier music event?" [...] Despite his criticism, Harvey agreed to become the commentator for the ABC's radio broadcast of the 2000 competition, [...] "in an attempt to provide some objective analysis".|$|E

500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a <b>course</b> <b>will</b> be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E
