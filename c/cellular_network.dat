40|$|Abstract—Wireless <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> are {{large-scale}} {{networks in}} which asymptotic capacity investigation {{is no longer}} a cliché. A substantial body of work has been carried out to improve the capacity of <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> by introducing ad hoc communica-tions, resulting in the so-called multihop <b>cellular</b> <b>networks.</b> Most of the previous research allows ad hoc transmissions between certain source and destination pairs to alleviate base stations’ relay burden. However, since reports show that Internet data traffic {{is becoming more and more}} dominant in <b>cellular</b> <b>networks,</b> we explore in this paper the capacity of multihop <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> with all traffic going through base stations and ad hoc transmissions only acting as relay. We first investigate the capacity of regular multihop <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> where both nodes and base stations are regularly placed. By fully exploiting the link rate variability, we find that multihop <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> can have higher per-node throughput than traditional <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> by a scaling factor of log 2 푛. Then, for the first time we extend our study to the capacity of heterogeneous multihop <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> where nodes are distributed according to a general Inhomogeneous Poisson Process and base stations are randomly placed. We show that under certain conditions multihop <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> can also outperform traditional <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> by a scaling factor of log 2 푛. Moreover, both throughput-fairness and bandwidth-fairness are considered as fairness constraints for both kinds of networks. I...|$|R

Therefore, downlink transmit power levels of multi-layer hierarchical <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> need to be controlled in order to fully exploit their benefits. In this work, we present an analytical derivation to determine optimum power levels for two-layer <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> and generalize our solution to multi-layer <b>cellular</b> <b>networks.</b> We also simulate our results in a typical multi-layer network setup and observe significant power savings compared to single-layer <b>cellular</b> <b>networks.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to IEEE GLOBECOM 201...|$|R
