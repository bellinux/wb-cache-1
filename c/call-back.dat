5|$|Many of {{the cast}} members {{at the time were}} {{relatively}} unknown actors—Texans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow. Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there. Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center. Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he spotted her picture in the Austin American-Statesman. For her last <b>call-back</b> he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members' costumes.|$|E

Roberts was approached about returning in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin, who was also responsible for casting fellow newcomers Rakie Ayola as Kyla Tyson and Tom Chambers as Sam Strachan. Although his guest appearance constituted a single scene, Roberts believes it was enough to secure his <b>call-back</b> for the part of Joseph. He recalls that it [...] "got the attention of the producers", and that actress Amanda Mealing, who portrayed Connie Beauchamp, [...] "put a good word in for [...] ". He felt lucky to join alongside Chambers and Rosie Marcel as Jac Naylor, due to the [...] "feeling of solidarity" [...] which developed between them.|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt {{was married}} to Sonia Forbes-Adam, the {{daughter}} of Reverend Sir Timothy Forbes Adam. The two met when Nesbitt went to the final <b>call-back</b> for Hamlet at Loughborough Hall in 1989, and they soon began dating. They split up for {{a year after the}} release of Hear My Song but reunited and married in 1994. They have since had two daughters, Peggy and Mary (both of whom appeared in the final two Hobbit movies as the daughters of Bard the Bowman). Nesbitt's three sisters all became teachers. In 2002, a Sunday tabloid published an interview with a legal secretary who claimed to have had a two-month affair with Nesbitt. Shortly afterwards, another tabloid story revealed an affair with a prostitute, who claimed Nesbitt had boasted of liaisons with his Cold Feet co-star Kimberley Joseph, and Amanda Brunker, a former Miss Ireland. Commenting on the publication of details about his personal life, Nesbitt has said he feared that he would lose his marriage, though the exposing of his [...] "dual life" [...] allowed him to [...] "take a long and considered look" [...] at himself. In October 2013, Nesbitt announced {{that he and his wife}} Sonia Forbes-Adam would separate from each other after 19 years. The couple says that the filming of The Hobbit Trilogy has forced the couple to live separately for the past two years. The split came as a mutual decision and the couple says that infidelity was not one of the reasons for their decision. He is the proud father of BUCS 10,000m women's record holder Jenny Nesbitt.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of survey}} plans, which {{contemplate}} several tries or <b>call-backs</b> when endeavouring to capture individual data, may supply unarguable information in certain sampling situations with non-ignorable non-response. This paper presents an algorithm whose final aim is {{the estimation of}} the individual non-response probabilities from a general perspective of discrete response regression models, which includes the well known probit and logit models. It will be assumed that the respondents supply all the variables of interest when they are captured. Nevertheless, the <b>call-backs</b> continue. even after previous captures, for {{a small number of}} tries, r, which has been fixed beforehand only for estimating purposes. The different retries or <b>call-backs</b> are supposed to be carried out with different capture intensities. As mentioned above. the response probabilities, which may vary from one individual to another, are sought by discrete response regression models, whose parameters are estimated from conditioned likelihoods evaluated on the respondents only. The algorithm, quick and easy to implement, may be used even when the capture indicator matrix has been partially recorded. Finally, the practical performance of the proposed procedure is tested and evaluated from empirical simulations whose results are undoubtedly encouraging...|$|R

Their mentor decided whether or not to put them through to the <b>call-backs.</b> At the start of the <b>call-backs</b> the mentor, with the help of their advisors, decides on the final 16 acts (final 10 in series 1). The advisors then leave and the mentor judges the rest of the call backs alone. The final 16 acts come back and perform again. They also give their reasons for why they should be put through to the live shows. The mentor then selects their final eight (final five in series 1) acts to put through to the live shows.|$|R

[...] Citing [...] "The Monster Who Came to Bikini Bottom", he said [...] "What is also notable {{here is the}} episode's ending, which {{features}} a brilliant <b>call-back</b> to an earlier seen flashback (more shades of Lost) that ties up the threads of the episode {{as well as any}} Larry David penned half-hour. This first short is SpongeBob at its best." [...] Robbins called [...] "The Main Drain" [...] as [...] "Not a good episode." [...] and [...] "Sponge-Cano!" [...] as [...] "A strong segment." [...] In reviewing [...] "The Curse of the Hex", Robbins said [...] "Unfortunately, this lousy episode ends the disc on a sour note as a hagfish curses The Krusty Krab. The only notable aspect to this dull segment is that the hagfish is voiced by Saturday Night Lives Kristen Wiig, which, depending on your current view of the comedy institution, may make the episode more or less interesting. Either the writers got tired of attempting allusions to Lost by this point, or I simply got tired of looking for them." ...|$|E

[...] The `number' being offered to the receiver {{is referred to as}} a [...] "Call-back". Again, the loose coupling or decoupled nature of this functional object is apparent. The receiver of the <b>call-back</b> is unaware of what or who is being called. It only knows that it can make the call and decides for itself when to call. In reality, the <b>call-back</b> may not even be to the one who provided the <b>call-back</b> in the first place. This level of indirection is what makes function objects an excellent technology for achieving loosely coupled programs.|$|E
