40|$|The planar and {{axisymmetric}} variable-density flows induced in a quiescent gas by {{a concentrated}} source of momentum that is simultaneously either a source or a sink of energy are investigated for {{application to the}} description of the velocity and temperature far fields in laminar gaseous jets with either large or small values of the initial jet-to-ambient temperature ratio. The source fluxes of momentum and heat are used to construct the characteristic scales of velocity and length in the region where the density differences are of the order of the ambient density, which is slender for the large values of the Reynolds number considered herein. The problem reduces to the integration of the dimensionless boundary-layer conservation equations, giving a solution that depends on the gas transport properties but is otherwise free of parameters. The boundary conditions at the jet exit for integration are obtained by analysing the self-similar flow that appears near the heat source in planar and axisymmetric configurations and also near the heat sink in the planar case. Numerical integrations of the boundary-layer equations with these conditions give solutions that describe accurately the velocity and temperature fields of very hot planar and round jets and also of very <b>cold</b> <b>plane</b> jets in the far field region where the density and temperature differences are comparable to the ambient values.

Many VIIRS environmental data records (EDR) have been continuously generated from its sensor data records (SDR) with improved quality, enabling a wide range of applications in support of users in both the operational and research communities. This paper provides a brief review of sensor on-orbit calibration methodologies for both the reflective solar bands (RSB) and the thermal emissive bands (TEB) and an overall assessment of their on-orbit radiometric performance using measurements from instrument on-board calibrators (OBC), as well as regularly scheduled lunar observations.

Its 16 thermal emissive bands (TEB), each with 10 detectors, are located on the two <b>cold</b> focal <b>plane</b> assemblies (FPAs) controlled by a passive radiative cooler. Because of instrument design complexity and stringent calibration requirements, extensive calibration and characterization activities were conducted pre-launch by the sensor vendor for both Terra and Aqua MODIS. For TEB, these activities include characterization of detectors' noise and non-linearity and evaluation of their radiometric performance in thermal vacuum at difference instrument temperatures and FPA temperatures. In addition TEB system level response versus scan-angle (RVS) and relative spectral response (RSR) were characterized.

The temperature predictions of many scanner components in the original thermal model had poor agreement with the spacecraft and instrument integrated sun-pointing safehold (SPSH) thermal balance (T/B) test results. The spacecraft and instrument integrated T/B test led to a change of the Full Aperture Calibrator (FAC) motor stack "solar shield" coating from MIL-C- 5541 to multi-layer insulation (MLI) thermal blanket. The temperature predictions of the Auxiliary Electronics Module (AEM) in the thermal model also had poor agreement with the T/B test results.

Two exceptions when elevated cold FPA temperatures were observed were the period before complete activation of the cryo-cooler and the brief time during an orbital pitch maneuver. Dependence of the VIIRS TEB (thermal emissive band) noise on the cold FPA temperature was measured using onboard calibrator data acquired during these occurrences. The on-orbit measurements have enabled prediction that if the cold FPA temperature were to increase from 80 K to 82 K, noise in the VIIRS LWIR (long-wave infrared) bands, M 14, M 15, M 16, and I 5, would increase by approximately 20 %. Since large margins exist between the current VIIRS TEB noise performance and the product requirements, such an increase, although not negligible, would still be acceptable for measurements of sea surface temperature and cloud top properties. Nevertheless, it will be beneficial if the VIIRS cold FPA temperature remains unchanged for the next several years of the Suomi NPP mission...|$|R
40|$|There was {{a thermal}} anomaly of the Landsat- 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) {{radiative}} cooler cold stage during the cooler outgas phase in flight. With the cooler {{door in the}} outgas position and the outgas heaters enabled, the cold stage temperature increased {{to a maximum of}} 323 K when the spacecraft was in the sunlight, which was warmer than the 316. 3 K upper set point of the outgas heater controller on the cold stage. Also, the outgas heater cycled off when the cold stage was warming up to 323 K. A corrective action was taken before the attitude of the spacecraft was changed during the first week in flight. One orbit before the attitude was changed, the outgas heaters were disabled to cool off the cold stage. The cold stage temperature increase was strongly dependent on the spacecraft roll and yaw. It provided evidence that direct solar radiation entered the gap between the cooler door and cooler shroud. There was a concern that the direct solar radiation could cause polymerization of hydrocarbons, which could contaminate the cooler and lead to a thermal short. After outgas with the cooler door in the outgas position for seven days, the cooler door was changed to the fully open position. With the cooler door fully open, the maximum cold stage temperature was 316. 3 K when the spacecraft was in the sunlight, and the duty cycle of the outgas heater in the eclipse was the same as that in the sunlight. It provided more evidence that direct solar radiation had entered the gap between the cooler door and cooler shroud. Cooler outgas continued for seven more days, with the cooler door fully open. The corrective actions had prevented overheating of the cold stage and <b>cold</b> focal <b>plane</b> array (CFPA), which could damage these two components. They also minimized the risk of contamination on the cold stage, which could lead to a thermal short...|$|R
