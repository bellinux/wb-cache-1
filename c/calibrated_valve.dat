The water was sprinkled uniformly at the top side of the absorber using galvanized pipe of ½ inch in diameter with 25 drilled holes each of 1  mm diameter. The spacing between any two successive holes was 20  mm, thus producing a nearly uniform film flow of water sliding down over the absorber plate. The flow of brine water was regulated by a <b>calibrated</b> <b>valve</b> placed between the water tank and the water pipe distributor in the absorber.

40|$|Three {{types of}} colonic {{sphincter}} substitutes were placed at an abdominal colostomy in dogs. Simple valve construction (8) {{was based on}} orthograde intussusception of the colon over 3. 5 cm. In <b>calibrated</b> <b>valves</b> (6) the intraluminal pressure was increased by reducing {{the diameter of the}} overlying muscle coat. Reverse smooth muscle plasties (5) and simple colostomies (5) served as controls. Immediately after construction highest pressure (50 +/- 8. 9 mm Hg) was obtained in <b>calibrated</b> <b>valves.</b> After 1 month the pressure dropped to 20 mm Hg, but remained stable thereafter. Although valvular constructions cannot maintain high pressure, they may be useful as substitutes for the internal anal sphincter by filling up the lumen so that the action of a surrounding striated muscle ring becomes more effective. status: publishe...|$|R

We study valve performance regarding opening time duration, optimal valve-to-skimmer distance, mean velocity, velocity spread, state purity, and relative intensity. We put particular emphasis on their suitability in crossed beam scattering experiments that employ a decelerator. Where possible, we support our experiences with measurements on the Stark deceleration of ND 3 molecules, and with numerical simulations. In addition, we describe the procedures we have developed to <b>calibrate</b> <b>valve</b> performance, and to optimally load the beam into the decelerator.|$|R

40|$|A very simple, {{low-cost}} gas-liquid {{flow meter}} that only employs conventional field instrumentation {{has been used}} to monitor severe slugging occurring at the exit of a vertical pipe. This meter has been originally developed for conventional oil field application [1] and is based on the readings of a multiphase orifice and the pressure drops of the gas-liquid mixture flowing in a vertical section of the pipe. Liquid and gas flow rates have been determined by means of semi-empirical equations developed for the specific set of flow parameters (geometry, flow rates, physical properties) adopted in a series of laboratory tests conducted in the Multiphase Flow Laboratory of TEA Sistemi. The transient behavior of the flow system, including the orifice, has also been predicted by means of a 1 -D flow simulator [2]. The results of these simulations agree quite well with the experimental readings, thus providing a powerful method to monitor severe slugging by means of low cost instrumentation, in particular, by replacing a cumbersome instrument such as a -densitometer with a differential pressure transmitter. In field operation, the multiphase orifice used in these experiments can be replaced by a <b>calibrated</b> control <b>valve...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{energy-saving}} programmable valves, {{a unique}} combination of five independently controlled poppet type cartridge valves, {{have been shown}} to significantly reduce energy usage while maintaining excellent control performance. Due {{to the fact that the}} flow characteristics of poppet type cartridge valves are very difficult to model, pressure compensated flow mapping via off-line system identification were used in all previous controller designs. However, individually <b>calibrating</b> each <b>valve</b> in use would prohibit their widespread industrial applications. It is desirable to have a controller requiring only the manufacturer supplied valve flow mappings, which may differ from the true individual valve flow characteristics to certain degrees. This paper presents an Adaptive Robust Controller to control the multi-input valve system with the manufacturer supplied flow mapping only. Robust stability is guaranteed under bounded modelling errors, and the effect of modelling errors is effectively attenuated by the use of nonlinear robust feedback structure that achieves a prescribed transient performance and final tracking accuracy. In addition, real-time adaptation is used to reduce the degree of modelling errors for an improved performance. Experimental results are obtained to validate the proposed scheme.

Prior to adsorption measurements, ca. 100  mg {{of the sample was}} reduced in a flow of hydrogen (50  mL/min) at 300  °C for 3  h and flushed out subsequently in a pure helium gas flow for an hour at 300  °C.

CO uptake was determined by injecting pulses of 9.96  % CO balanced helium from a <b>calibrated</b> on-line sampling <b>valve</b> into the helium stream passing over the reduced samples at 300  °C. Ruthenium surface area, percentage dispersion and Ru average particle size were calculated assuming the stoichiometric factor (CO/Ru) as 1.

The associated pressure can be determined, and thus, the transducer pressure readings can be calibrated. The zirconia membrane obtains oxygen. {{from the surrounding}} environment when possible. Otherwise, an oxygen reservoir or other source is utilized. In another embodiment, a reversible fuel cell assembly is used to pump oxygen and hydrogen into the system. Since a known amount of gas is pumped across the cell, the pressure produced can be determined, and thus, the device can be <b>calibrated.</b> An isolation <b>valve</b> system is used to allow the device to be calibrated in situ. Calibration is optionally automated so that calibration can be continuously monitored. The device is preferably a fully integrated MEMS device.

Cirillo et al. (4) have shown transmutation of elements on the tungsten cathode during similar types of plasma electrolysis. Also, Fauvarque et al. (5) have shown the production of excess heat. All these experiments have been performed with light water at boiling temperature i. e. 100 °C and atmospheric pressure. We have developed a new calorimeter that can operate at higher temperatures and higher pressures. The cell is of cylindrical shape made of Teflon 10 cm in diameter and 21 cm high. The cell is positioned on a balance {{in order to measure}} continuously the weight loss of the cell during operation.

40|$|AbstractThe overall {{purpose of}} this project is to test the impact and {{potential}} benefits of Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies (AR&VR) to improve maintenance operation in industrial equipment. The main function for a Flapper valve of a Fuller-Kinyon type M pump is to prevent that the air generated to convey the bulk material through a conveying pipe flows inside of the material chute through the rotating screw. If this will occur, the material flow will decrease or even stop, causing a reduction of the pump capacity. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} maintain <b>calibrated</b> each flapper <b>valve</b> in the plant. This process of maintenance is done once a month, or when necessary, and it needs the pump to be shut down, taking up to four hours to finish the complete process. For this reason, an augmented reality application is being developed, aiming to reduce the consumed time by the maintenance process. Using this application, it is expected to dedicate less time training the new personnel responsible for the maintaining process, displaying tridimensional models, animations, images and text information that would simplify the instructions shown in a printed manual and adding an interactive environment between the users and the information displayed. A mobile device either a tablet or a smartphone is to be used as the hardware that will run the application, allowing the user to take it right to the working area, either in a workshop or directly in field. The information displayed includes CAD models of the pump and its components as well as animations illustrating the instructions to follow in each step of the process. Also, the right tool to use in each step will be indicated following by security warnings when needed. This project was developed according to the collaboration cathedra between CEMEX and ITESM, following the LEAD methodology developed by CEMEX to support the project administration, the general process development was constructed from knowledge and experiences gathered among the different previous AR projects developed at ITESM. This information has been studied and “best practices” has been noted, learned and established to develop and implement AR...|$|R
