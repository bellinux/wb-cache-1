Recent research has shown that online control of <b>chemical</b> <b>dosing</b> can significantly reduce dosing costs, while achieving better control performance. One of the bottlenecks of online control is the prediction of sewage retention time in sewers, governed by future sewage flows. This study developed a methodology for real-time future flow prediction in sewers based on autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models and multistep iterative prediction. This methodology was validated with flow data collected from two pumping stations with different flow characteristics and different wet-well storage capacities. The results showed that the proposed methodology was capable of predicting future flow rates with good accuracy under different weather conditions.

40|$|Chemicals such as {{magnesium}} hydroxide (Mg(OH) (2)) and iron salts {{are widely used}} to control sulfideinduced corrosion in sewer networks composed of interconnected sewer pipe lines and pumping stations. <b>Chemical</b> <b>dosing</b> control is usually non-automatic and based on experience, thus often resulting in sewage reaching the discharge point receiving inadequate or even no <b>chemical</b> <b>dosing.</b> Moreover, intermittent operation of pumping stations makes traditional control theory inadequate. A hybrid automata-based (HA-based) control method is proposed in this paper to coordinate sewage pumping station operations by considering their states, thereby ensuring suitable chemical concentrations in the network discharge. The performance of the proposed control method was validated through a simulation study of a real sewer network using real sewage flow data. The physical, chemical and biological processes were simulated using the well-established SeweX model.

40|$|Chemicals such as Mg(OH) 2 {{and iron}} salts are widely dosed to sewage for {{mitigating}} sulfide-induced corrosion and odour problems in sewer networks. The <b>chemical</b> <b>dosing</b> rate {{is usually not}} automatically controlled but profiled based on experience of operators, often resulting in over- or under-dosing. Even though on-line control algorithms for <b>chemical</b> <b>dosing</b> in single pipes have been developed recently, network-wide control algorithms are currently not available. The key challenge is that a sewer network is typically wide-spread comprising many interconnected sewer pipes and pumping stations, making network-wide sulfide mitigation with a relatively limited number of dosing points challenging. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an Event-driven Model Predictive Control (EMPC) methodology, which controls the flows of sewage streams containing the <b>dosed</b> <b>chemical</b> to ensure desirable distribution of the <b>dosed</b> <b>chemical</b> throughout the pipe sections of interests. First of all, a network-state model is proposed to predict the chemical concentration in a network. An EMPC algorithm is then designed to coordinate sewage pumping station operations to ensure desirable chemical distribution in the network. The performance of the proposed control methodology is demonstrated by applying the designed algorithm to a real sewer network simulated with the well-established SeweX model using real sewage flow and characteristics data. The EMPC strategy significantly improved the sulfide mitigation performance with the same chemical consumption, compared to the current practice...|$|R
40|$|Controlling sulfide (H(2) S) {{production}} and emission in sewer systems is critical {{due to the}} corrosion and malodour problems that sulfide causes. <b>Chemical</b> <b>dosing</b> {{is one of the}} most commonly used measures to mitigate these problems. Many chemicals have been reported to be effective for sulfide control, but the extent of success varies between chemicals and is also dependent on how they are applied. This industry survey aims to summarise the current practice in Australia with the view to assist the water industry to further improve their practices and to identify new research questions. Results showed that dosing is mainly undertaken in pressure mains. Magnesium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and nitrate are the most commonly used chemicals for sewers with low flows. In comparison, iron salts are preferentially used for sulfide control in large systems. The use of oxygen injection has declined dramatically in the past few years. <b>Chemical</b> <b>dosing</b> is mainly conducted at wet wells and pumping stations, except for oxygen, which is injected into the pipe. The dosing rates are normally linked to the control mechanisms of the <b>chemicals</b> and the <b>dosing</b> locations, with constant or profiled dosing rates usually applied. Finally, key opportunities for improvement are the use of mathematical models for the selection of <b>chemicals</b> and <b>dosing</b> locations, on-line dynamic control of the dosing rates and the development of more cost-effective chemicals for sulfide control.
