40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>chia</b> oil on heat shock protein (HSP) and related parameters in diet-induced obese rats. Methods: Animals were divided in six groups: control, high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFF), and HFF with <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> or <b>chia</b> oil in short (6 -wk) and long (12 -wk) treatments. Plasma indicators of glucose tolerance and liver damage, skeletal muscle expression of antioxidant enzymes, and proteins controlling oxidative energy metabolism were determined. The limit of significance was set at P < 0. 05. Results: The HFF diet induced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and altered parameters related to obesity complications. The consumption <b>of</b> <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> or <b>chia</b> oil did not reduce body weight gain or abdominal fat accumulation. However, <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>chia</b> oil in both treatments improved glucose and insulin tolerance. Chia oil in both treatments induced expression of HSP 70 and HSP 25 in skeletal muscle. Short treatment with <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> increased expression <b>of</b> HSP 70, but not HSP 25. Chia oil in both treatments restored superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase expression. Extended treatment with <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and short treatment with chia oil restored peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator- 1 alpha (PGC- 1 alpha) expression. Conclusion: Chia oil restored the antioxidant system and induced the expression of a higher number <b>of</b> proteins than <b>chia</b> <b>seed.</b> The present study demonstrated new properties and molecular mechanisms associated with the beneficial effects <b>of</b> <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>chia</b> oil consumption in diet-induced obese rats.

HFF diet induced weight gain, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in plasma and liver of animals. Compared to HFF group <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>chia</b> oil (12 and 6 weeks) intake increased plasma reduced thiol (GSH) levels, plasma catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. In the liver glutathione reductase (GRd) activity was enhanced, while CAT and GPx activities did not change. There were no differences in plasma and liver superoxide dismutase activity among chia diets and HFF group. <b>Chia</b> (<b>seed</b> and oil) intake did not modify liver lipid peroxidation, but was able to reduce plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 8 -isoprostane levels increased by HFF group. Plasma and hepatic antioxidant capacity values were increased in <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and oil groups about 35 % and 47 %, respectively, compared to HFF group. Chia groups presented similar antioxidant potential, regardless of treatment time. Dietary <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and oil reduced oxidative stress in vivo, since it improved antioxidant status and reduced lipid peroxidation in diet-induced obese rats. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|Applicado {{is where}} the designs are painted onto a base coat, a {{technique}} also done {{in other parts of}} Mexico. This work traces back to at least the 18th century, and while may include motifs such as patriotic symbols, most are not Mexican, but instead stylized flowers, European landscapes and images from Asia. The two techniques can be combined, which is called punteado (dotted), were small dots are painted in areas that are not etched. This became popular starting {{at the end of the}} 1970s. Like rayado pieces, animals, flowers and geometrical designs are prevalent and all available space is filled. Most Olinalá artisans are anonymous and poor. Pieces are rarely signed and if they are, it is by the person who creates the decorative design. However, the work is done in family workshops with different members doing different jobs. While women do most of the work, almost all of the rayado work is done by men. Most Olinalá artisans begin as children, learning to blend colors and adding dot patterns, then moving up to creating figures and more complicated designs. Olinalá families often specialize in colors and designs, [...] with techniques and motifs handed down from generation to generation. However, artisans have adapted their works to new markets and new tastes as most of their wares are now sold in Mexico City and abroad. [...] One example is the recent use of pastel colors. Other innovations include the use of more modern materials, but the most notable artisan is Margarito Ayala, who still relies completely on traditional methods and materials, including the grinding <b>of</b> <b>chia</b> <b>seeds</b> himself.|$|R

The specific gravity, viscosity and refractive index of CSO {{at ambient temperature}} were 0. 93, 43. 2 mPa. s and 1. 48, respectively. The acid, peroxide, saponification and iodine values and unsaponifiable matter content of CSO were 2. 54 g KOH/kg oil, 4. 33 meq O 2 /kg oil, 197 g KOH/kg oil, 204 g I 2 /kg oil and 1. 12 %, respectively. α-linolenic acid is the most abundant fatty acid comprising (64. 39 % of total oil) followed by linoleic acid (21. 46 %), while saturated fatty acid content is less than 10 %. This CSO contained twelve triacylglycerols (TAGs) out of which trilinolenin (αLnαLnαLn) was the most abundant comprising 33. 2 % of total TAG. Melting point and melting enthalpy of CSO were - 34 °C and 77. 48 J/g, respectively. CSO remained stable up to 300 °C with negligible degradation.

Key words: <b>chia</b> <b>seeds,</b> salvia hispanica, cardiovascular disease, prevention, omega- 3, omega- 6. Streszczenie Pacjenci geriatryczni są specyficzną grupą chorych ze względu na to, iż w organizmie starszych osób dochodzi do wielu zmian związanych ze starzeniem się organizmu. Pogarsza się wydolność wielu układów m. in. układu pokarmowego, oddechowego oraz pojawiają się zmiany w naczyniach. Zmiany w motoryce przełyku zwane przełykiem starczym są skutkiem chorób występujących w tej grupie wiekowej. Zmniejsza się kwasowość soku żołądkowego co jest przyczyną zmian atroficznych w błonie śluzowej oraz nadużycia inhibitorów pompy protonowej. Dochodzi również do obniżenia liczby hepatocytów a tym samym zmniejszenia masy wątroby. Do zmian w układzie moczowym zaliczamy zmniejszoną zdolność do zagęszczania i rozcieńczenia moczu a także regulacji pH [1]. Osoby starsze często chorują na nadciśnienie, miażdżycę czy inne schorzenia sercowo-naczyniowe. Do produktów, będących źródłem wielu witamin, minerałów czy składników pożądanych w diecie seniorów możemy zaliczyć nasiona chia. Małe ziarenka, bogate w białko oraz kwasy tłuszczowe omega- 3 i omega- 6, zawierające w 100 g więcej wapnia niż mleko mogą stać się ważnym elementem w diecie osób starszych. Zawarty w nich kwas alfa-linolenowy (ALA) może obniżać ciśnienie tętnicze krwi u osób z nieleczonym nadciśnieniem, wspomaga pracę mózgu, poprawia pamięć i koncentrację oraz posiada działanie protekcyjne na układ krążenia. Badanie GISSI-Prevention Study wykazało, że kwasy omega- 3 mogą zmniejszać ryzyko nagłego zgonu, umieralności całkowitej oraz sercowo-naczyniowej u chorych po świeżo przebytym zawale mięśnia sercowego [2]. Abstract Geriatric patients are a special group of patients, due to the fact that the body of older people there are many changes associated with aging of the body. Deteriorating performance of many systems including the gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory changes occur in the vessels. Changes in the motility of the esophagus called esophageal senile are the result of diseases that occur in this age group. This reduces the acidity of the gastric juice which is the cause of atrophic mucosa and misuse of proton pump inhibitors. This leads also to a reduction in the number of hepatocytes and thereby reduce the weight of the liver. Changes in the urinary system include reduced ability to concentrate and dilute urine and pH adjustment [1]. Older people often suffer from hypertension, atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. Products, which are the source of many vitamins, minerals or desirable ingredients in the diet of seniors can include <b>chia</b> <b>seeds.</b> Small grains, rich in protein and fatty acids omega- 3 and omega- 6, containing 100 g more calcium than milk can become an important element in the diet of older people. Included in these alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) may lower blood pressure in people with untreated hypertension, supports the work of the brain, improves memory and concentration and has protective effects on the cardiovascular system. GISSI-Prevention Study showed that omega- 3 may reduce the risk of sudden death, total mortality and cardiovascular disease in patients after recent myocardial infarction [2]...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{ascertain}} view of dietitians on "superfoods" promoted through the media. The thesis consists of a theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part is supported by foreign scholarly articles and clinical studies and is focusing on characteristics of five specific examples <b>of</b> "superfoods" (<b>chia</b> <b>seeds,</b> quinoa, goji berries, acai and cocoa beans). Each of these foods is examined primarily in terms <b>of</b> chemical <b>composition,</b> content <b>of</b> most significant substances and their prospective effect on human health. The practical part is focused on dietitians and their opinion on "superfoods". This part includes survey with the aim {{to answer the questions}} whether the dietitians have cognizance of "superfoods", if they recommend them in their practice and what is their opinion on this kind of food. Data evaluation is illustrated in graphs which concluded that "superfoods" are acknowledged by 90, 9 % of asked dietitians and specific examples evaluated in this thesis are acknowledged by more than a half of respondents. In their practice the "superfoods" are recommended by 41, 7 % of respondents and their opinion can be evaluated only from certain points of view therefore the attitude towards "superfoods" cannot be clearly determined as positive or negative.

40|$|<b>Chia</b> <b>seeds</b> {{contain the}} {{essential}} fatty acid, a-linolenic acid (ALA). This study has assessed whether <b>chia</b> <b>seeds</b> attenuated the metabolic, cardiovascular and hepatic {{signs of a}} high-carbohydrate, high-fat (H) diet [carbohydrates, 52 % (wt/wt); fat, 24 % (wt/wt) with 25 % (wt/vol) fructose in drinking water] in rats. Diets of the treatment groups were supplemented with 5 % <b>chia</b> <b>seeds</b> after 8 weeks on H diet for a further 8 weeks. Compared with the H rats, chia seed-supplemented rats had improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, reduced visceral adiposity, decreased hepatic steatosis and reduced cardiac and hepatic inflammation and fibrosis without changes in plasma lipids or blood pressure. <b>Chia</b> <b>seeds</b> induced lipid redistribution with lipid trafficking away from the visceral fat and liver with an increased accumulation in the heart. The stearoyl-CoA desaturase- 1 products were depleted in the heart, liver and the adipose tissue <b>of</b> <b>chia</b> seed-supplemented rats together {{with an increase in}} the substrate concentrations. The C 18 : 1 trans- 7 was preferentially stored in the adipose tissue; the relatively inert C 18 : 1 n- 9 was stored in sensitive organs such as liver and heart and Cl 8 : 2 n- 6, the parent fatty acid of the n- 6 pathway, was preferentially metabolized. Thus, <b>chia</b> <b>seeds</b> as a source of ALA induce lipid redistribution associated with cardioprotection and hepatoprotection. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
