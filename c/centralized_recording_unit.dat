In disaster areas, however, {{it is likely}} that the existing terrestrial communication network and the power grid will be cut off. Therefore, a reliable asset tracking system should be independent of those terrestrial networks, especially in terms of communication. This paper explores the development of a reliable low power local wireless communication network for portable GNSS-based positioning sensors and a <b>centralized</b> <b>recording</b> <b>unit,</b> as part of the independent communication network. The wireless sensors network is based on the ZigBee standard protocol and the IEEE 802. 15. 4 compliant transceiver CC 2530 from Texas Instrument. The network features low cost, low power, mesh topology, high reliability and high security...|$|E
