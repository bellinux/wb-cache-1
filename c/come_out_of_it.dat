25|$|The opening Test at Brisbane has {{a history}} of having {{important}} psychological effects on the teams. The four England teams before ours had all lost there. Even Len Hutton's eventually victorious side went down there by an innings. We drew the match and I believe this was the turning point of our tour. Nobody expected us to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> with our pride intact.|$|E
25|$|Among {{other things}} in the recent update, the band said they were {{extremely}} surprised on how well their last album, Awake?, did in the market considering it had no tour support by them {{and that it was}} thrown onto Ferret's label in the 11th hour. Zao said the best thing to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is that they learned a lot of the last release and it showed them that fans still enjoy their music and this inspired and motivated them to continue making music. According to social media reports, on July 11, 2014, Zao went into the studio, after a five-year unofficial hiatus and working on side projects like Lonely Ghost Parade and Young Fox, is currently, tracking and recording their 11th album. Guitar tracking began in January 2015. Xenophobe, the band's first EP since 1998, was released on July 10, 2015.|$|E
25|$|The fourth-day of {{the battle}} was noted for the valour shown by Bhima. Bhishma {{commanded}} the Kaurava army to move on the offensive from the outset. While Abhimanyu {{was still in his}} mother's womb, Arjuna had taught Abhimanyu on how to break and enter the chakra vyuha. But, before explaining how to exit the chakra Vyuha, Arjuna was interrupted by Krishna (other story: Abhimanyu's mother falls asleep while Arjuna was explaining her). Thus from birth, Abhimanyu only knew how to enter the Chakra vyuha but didn't know how to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> When the Kauravas formed the chakravyuha, Abhimanyu entered it but was surrounded and attacked by a number of Kaurava princes. Arjuna joined the fray in aid of Abhimanyu. Bhima appeared on the scene with his mace aloft and started attacking the Kauravas. Duryodhana sent a huge force of elephants at Bhima. When Bhima saw the mass of elephants approaching, he got down from his chariot and attacked them single-handedly with his iron mace. They scattered and stampeded into the Kaurava forces killing many. Duryodhana ordered an all-out attack on Bhima. Bhima withstood all that was thrown at him and attacked Duryodhana's brothers, killing eight of them. Bhima was soon struck by an arrow on the chest and sat down in his chariot dazed.|$|E

500|$|Barnes {{continued}} to score heavily, and during one match, he crossed paths with Johnson, who reportedly apologised {{to him for}} the exclusion from the team. However, Johnson advised Barnes to [...] "keep quiet and say nothing" [...] and added that [...] "You will <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all right, {{you will be a}} certainty for the 1953 trip [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The {{nickname}} [...] "Needy" [...] {{was given}} to Seyfried's character to underline the essentially condescending dynamic in Jennifer and Needy's high school relationship, as Needy often admires Jennifer and feels she needs her. Cody said [...] "Jennifer {{is a product of}} a culture that pressures girls to be skinny, beautiful and just like movie stars" [...] and that she [...] "hopes the film inspires girls to take life into their own hands and do with it, what they want". [...] "If I had gone to this movie as a teenage girl, I would've <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> feeling totally inspired", she stated. [...] "I would've wanted to write, I would've wanted to create and I would've felt like I watched something that was speaking to me." ...|$|E
500|$|DeGeneres began {{dropping}} hints in {{the episodes}} {{leading up to}} [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] that she was planning {{to come out in}} real life and have her character come out as well, including such sight gags as Ellen Morgan stumbling into an actual closet so that she could <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> She also invited comment with her off-screen actions, as when she kissed k.d. lang while presenting her with an award at a Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center function in early 1997. DeGeneres finally officially came out in Time magazine, with an April 14, 1997 cover emblazoned with the words, [...] "Yep, I'm Gay". She appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show with then-girlfriend Anne Heche the day [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] was set to air.|$|E

500|$|Kelly {{believes}} that there's now {{a chance to}} change a political environment he thinks is filled with far too much vitriol. He hoped that the tragedy would also be an opportunity to improve the tone of our national dialogue and cool down the rhetoric. In {{response to a question}} on February 4, regarding the discussions about civility in politics Kelly said: [...] "I haven’t {{spent a lot of time}} following that, but I think that with something that was so horrible and so negative, and the fact that six people lost their lives including a nine-year-old girl, a federal judge, Gabby’s staff member Gabe—who was like a younger brother to her—it’s really really a sad situation. I am hopeful that something positive can <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I think that will happen, so those are good things." ...|$|E
500|$|The JAMs {{were not}} entirely sure {{what they would have}} said to ABBA if they had been able to meet them. Rockman told NME: [...] "We were hoping to explain [...] to them and that maybe we'd <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> friends, you know, them {{producing}} our album and us producing theirs—the kind of thing that often happens at these meetings." [...] King Boy: [...] "Yeah, we'd have said, 'Look, you haven't had many hits lately, you don't really wanna bother with all this West End musical shit do you? Come and do the new JAMMS [...] album.'" [...] In 1994, The Guardian looked back on the Swedish sojourn as [...] "a grand, futile, attention-grabbing gesture, the kind that would come to characterise [...] collaborative career... "We were being totally stupid about it" [...] Drummond later acknowledged." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1943, artist Cornelia Geer LeBoutiller {{criticized the}} painting, {{comparing}} it unfavorably with Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase (a work {{with which it}} is often compared) and Picasso's Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, calling Balla's work [...] "more crude, less mature, almost childish indeed ... Balla takes himself and his dog so seriously, so studiedly, that {{it is doubtful that}} any pleasure has ever <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> anywhere; certainly no movement has." [...] Writing in 1947, critic Henry R. Hope called Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash [...] "a cliché of modern art". Writer Geoffrey Wagner declared Balla's painting to be anathema to the Vorticist aesthetic of British painter Wyndham Lewis, who criticized Futurism for its [...] "romantic excess" [...] and dynamism. However, S. I. Hayakawa credited Balla's [...] "classic" [...] for its introduction of the time dimension in its representation of its subject.|$|E

2500|$|The {{completed}} album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Borland later stated {{was part}} of Limp Bizkit's plan to get noticed. [...] "The {{best way to get}} our message across is through shock value.

"The {{only thing}} I think I really don't like that much is [...] "The Perfect Drug" [...] song. <b>It</b> was one <b>of</b> {{those things where}} you have a week to do a track for a movie, the mindset that you kind of adapt in that situation, or I did, was 'let's go in and {{experiment}} and see what happens, and it's not, y'know, whatever <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> it's {{not the end of the}} world'. And I think what <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> married with a bloated, over-budget video, feels like ... the least thing that I would play to somebody if they said play me, y'know, the top hundred songs you've written, that probably wouldn't be in the top hundred.

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, Bob Simpson {{said the}} positives to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> for Australia were the opening {{partnership}} of Boon and Marsh, the batting of Border and Ritchie, the promise of Waugh and Matthews, and the bowling of Reid, McDermott, Davis and Gilbert, although he felt McDermott was an enigma.

2500|$|Navratilova was a {{guest on}} CNN's Connie Chung Tonight show on July 17, 2002. During the show, Chung quoted a German {{newspaper}} which quoted Navratilova as saying: [...] "The most absurd part of my escape from the unjust system is that I have exchanged one system that suppresses free opinion for another. The Republicans in the U.S. manipulate public opinion and sweep controversial issues under the table. It's depressing. Decisions in America are {{based solely on the}} question of how much money will <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and not on the questions of how much health, morals or environment suffer as a result." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{embarked}} on The Velvet Rope Tour, visiting Europe, North America, Japan, New Zealand, Africa, and Australia. It used an autobiographical theme derived from elements of Broadway theater. She stated, [...] "To me, being onstage is about entertaining. I {{know there are}} people who just walk onstage and give you a show by just doing their music, but I always wanted something extra". She added, [...] "I knew what I wanted everyone to look like, especially for the opening number. I knew what I wanted everyone to wear. I visualized the whole thing". Among the first tours to use LED technology, Mark Fisher stated, [...] "She wanted to have a book opening and herself <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> So I finessed that book into the video screen".|$|E

Anybody who's been suddenly left like that will know it's very, very traumatic. I managed to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but it took about five years. It was like a death, a loss, like being told your child's {{been killed in a}} war. There's no other way to describe it.
