40|$|Abstract. Vertical {{vibratory}} conveyor has some advantages like simple configuration, less occupied, long conveying distance, less energy consumed. The configuration and force analysis of vertical {{vibratory conveyor}} are conducted. The model of system with considering the {{friction between the}} materials and the spiral <b>conveying</b> <b>trough</b> is developed. The numerical simulations are done and the dynamical responses curves are given. Suitable configuration parameters of vertical vibratory conveyor and parameters of materials can make it work normally...|$|E
40|$|The use of laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) for scrap {{analysis has}} been evaluated for elemental monitoring of steel scrap loading an electrical arc furnace (EAF). A LIBS prototype was developed and installed during a field test above a pendulum <b>conveying</b> <b>trough</b> between the scrap charging area and the EAF, approx. 25 m from the EAF. The width and depth of the <b>conveying</b> <b>trough</b> filled with the scrap are approx. 2 m and 1 m, respectively. The average scrap velocity is adjusted to the EAF loading requirements within a range of 0. 3 to 5. 5 m/min, resulting in a scrap throughput of 100 tons per hour, typically. At the installation site, primarily, the detection of a high content of silicon in the low-alloy steel scrap is of interest for an improved control of the EAF. The on-line LIBS measurement showed the capability of detecting high silicon scrap in an industrial environment, although the developed prototype detected {{only a fraction of}} the scrap load surface due to the restricted measuring volume of 600 ? 600 ? 180 mm 3. Increasing the measuring volume should further improve the performance in order to exploit it for charging/process control and management...|$|E
40|$|Robots {{should be}} able to {{represent}} emotional states to interact with people as social agents. There are cases where robots cannot have bio-inspired bodies, for instance because the task to be performed requires a special shape, {{as in the case of}} home cleaners, package carriers, and many others. In these cases, emotional states have to be represented by exploiting movements of the body. In this paper, we present a set of case studies aimed at identifying specific values to <b>convey</b> emotion <b>trough</b> changes in linear and angular velocities, which might be applied on different non-anthropomorphic bodies. This work originates from some of the most considered emotion expression theories and from emotion coding for people. We show that people can recognize some emotional expressions better than others, and we propose some directions to express emotions exploiting only bio-neutral movement...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: Psychological Conflict, Psychoanalysis Theory, Moral Values. Literary work {{especially}} novel {{provides a}} lot of inspirations of life. Novel gives the reader an awareness that story happens in a novel is a reflection from a real life. Therefore, the reader can adapt the kindness from novel. Novel performs many interesting aspects to be researched. One of them is psychological conflicts happened in the main character of a novel. The Land of The Five Towers Novel performs a teenager as the main character who has psychological conflicts in the story. Alif as the main character is considered as a good model of a teenager. It can be explained that {{the way in which}} Alif as a teenager solves the psychological conflicts he faced is good enough to give the reader a good behavior how to solve the problem. It can give moral values for the reader. Then, the psychological conflict here is analyzed based on psychoanalysis theory by Sigmund Freud as a branch of Psychology. The formulation of the research problems were: 1) What kinds of psychological conflicts are experienced by Alif as the main character in The Land of Five Towers novel? 2) How do the psychological conflicts happen to Alif as the main character analyzed based on the basic principle of Psychoanalysis Theory? 3) What messages are conveyed through the psychological conflicts experienced by Alif as the main character? The purposes of this study were to: 1) describe psychological conflicts are experienced by Alif as the main character in The Land of Five Towers novel, 2) explain psychological conflict happen to Alif analyzed based on the basic principle of Freud’s Psychoanalysis theory 3) identify the messages of the novel contained in psychological conflicts. The research method: 1) this research was categorized as a library research by using documentation as the method in collecting data. In collecting data, the researcher uses some steps such as: a) Reading The Land of Five Towers Novel repeatedly, b) understanding the content of the novel, c) finding out the data related to research problems, d) writing the significance note, e) organizing the data 2) The process of data analysis are: a) Reading the novel repeatedly, b) exploring and describing the data, c) concluding data analysis, d) interpreting the data, e) extracting the moral values. 3) The Subject of the study was The Land of Five Towers Novel originally written by A. Fuadi then translated by Angie Killbane. The result showed that the main character’s psychological conflicts can be categorized into three: a) Approach-Approach-Conflict, b) Approach- Avoidance-Conflict, c) Multiple-Approach-Avoidance-Conflict. While, the researcher chose three psychological conflicts analyzed based on psychoanalysis theory. They are: 1) The Psychological conflict happened because of Alif’s failure in enrolling Senior High School, Bukittinggi, 2) The Psychological Conflict Caused by Randai’s success in enrolling Senior High School, Bukittinggi, 3) The Psychological Conflict Caused by Alif’s Strong Heart Desire to Study at Bandung Institute of Technology. Then, the moral values <b>conveyed</b> <b>trough</b> the psychological conflicts are: 1) Bravery, 2) Sincerity, 3) Honesty, 4) Love and Affection, 5) Steadfastness, 6) Thankfulness...|$|R
