Hagel voted to establish the United States Department of Homeland Security, and supported increasing Defense Department spending, voting in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act every year he served in the Senate. Hagel voted for spending increases in preventing HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria funding, and voting against caps on the U.S.'s Foreign aid budget.|$|E
25|$|Intelligence {{indicated}} that {{chemical and biological}} weapons stocks may have been located at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre along the shore of the al Qadisiyah reservoir among government and residential buildings, on the evening of 26 March, a DEVGRU assault element supported by B Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). Whilst the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but its door gunner suppressed it. A-10As engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky – pinpointing the orbiting helicopters for enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60Ks inserted their blocking teams, one Ranger was wounded, the two pairs of AH-6Ms and MH-60L DAPs supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47Es carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire whilst DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6Ms engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles, one Nightstalker crew was wounded as the MH-47Es lifted off. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen whilst the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached - engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> at the Objective Beaver.|$|E

Israel also claims that Syria is providing the organization with these weapons. Syria has denied supplying these weapons and views these claims as an Israeli excuse for an attack. Leaked cables from American diplomats suggest that the United States has been trying unsuccessfully to prevent Syria from [...] "supplying arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon", and that Hezbollah has [...] "amassed a huge stockpile (of arms) since its 2006 war with Israel"; the arms were described as [...] "increasingly sophisticated."

2500|$|During {{all parts}} of the war, use of {{chemical}} and biological weapons were extremely limited, by both sides, [...] Italy used mustard gas and phosgene during the short Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Germany employed chemical agents such as Zyklon B against Jews, political prisoners and other victims in extermination camps during the Holocaust, and Japan employed chemical and biological weapons in China. In 1943 a U.S. ship carrying [...] a secret Chemical Warfare Service cargo of mustard gas as a precationary retaliatory measure was sunk in an air raid in Italy, causing 83 deaths and about 600 hospitalized military victims plus a larger number of civilian casualties. Generally speaking, World War II was conducted (1939–1945) without use of <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> on the conventional battlefield, and certainly not on the scale of the use of poison gas during World War I.|$|E

2500|$|In foreign policy, {{following}} the September 11, 2001 {{attacks in the}} United States, Blair greatly supported U.S. President George W. Bush's new War on Terror which began with the forced withdrawal of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Blair's case for the subsequent war in Iraq was based on their alleged possession {{of weapons of mass}} destruction and consequent violation of UN resolutions. He was wary of making direct appeals for regime change, since international law does not recognise this as a ground for war. A memorandum from a July 2002 meeting that was leaked in April 2005 showed that Blair believed that the British public would support regime change in the right political context; the document, however, stated that legal grounds for such action were weak. On 24 September 2002 the Government published a dossier based on the intelligence agencies' assessments of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Among the items in the dossier was a recently received intelligence report that [...] "the Iraqi military are able to deploy <b>chemical</b> <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> within 45 minutes of an order to do so". A further briefing paper on Iraq's alleged WMDs was issued to journalists in February 2003. This document was discovered to have taken a large part of its text without attribution from a PhD thesis available on the internet. Where the thesis hypothesised about possible WMDs, the Downing Street version presented the ideas as fact. The document subsequently became known as the [...] "Dodgy Dossier".|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{planning}} for disaster response to terrorist events usually assumes {{the use of}} <b>chemical,</b> radiological, <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons.</b> Historically, most victims of terrorist attacks are injured {{by the use of}} conventional explosives rather than weapons of mass destruction. Such attacks will likely produce victims who have suffered burn injuries along with conven-tional trauma. Alternately, the large number of patients sustaining conventional soft-tissue or crush injuries will benefit from burn center expertise. This study summarizes the current state of knowledge related to the management of terrorism mass casualty incidents caused by the use of conventional explosives. A review of pertinent medical, technical, and popular literature relating to terrorism and explosives, along with instruction received at Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel on the management of mass casualty terrorism events was under-taken, and the pertinent medical and scientific literature relating to bomb delivery methods, blast mechanics, blast pathophysiology, and medical response to a terrorist bombing is pre-sented here. Although terrorist use of <b>chemical,</b> radiological, <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> is possi-ble, historical analysis consistently demonstrates that the most likely terrorist weapon caus-ing a mass casualty event is a standard explosive device detonated in a crowded area. The medical basis for management of such casualties is herein described. (J Burn Care Re...|$|R
