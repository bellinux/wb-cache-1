Hence, we have increased the <b>c-factor</b> to overcome the low electron charge density that originated from the vacancy for our case. It is worth to note that, in practice, the <b>c-factor</b> cannot be unlimitedly increased. Thus, the experimental bandgap cannot be always exactly reproduced by increasing the <b>c-factor</b> in {{the current version of}} the mBJ method for every case without considering the electron charge density variation and bonding nature of the case. Indeed, there can be a critical value for the <b>c-factor,</b> as reported in [10]. For larger c values than the critical c value, the bandgap may be drastically decreased to a meaningless value far from the experiment. This shows that the mBJ potential may result in an incorrect electron charge density, if one uses a very large <b>c-factor.</b> The latter point was perfectly demonstrated [10] by calculating the electric field gradient, as an extremely sensitive physical quantity to the shape of the valence electron charge density, versus the <b>c-factor</b> for the Cu 2 O compound. Consequently, the <b>c-factor,</b> as a measure for the electron charge density, should be carefully examined and optimized at least for those cases having low electron charge density. The low charge density may originate from some hollow spaces due to the vacancies, as what existed in the γ-Al 2 O 3 case, or from weak van der Waals bonds, as what existed in the fcc-C 60 fullerite. Therefore, from the above discussion, we would, as a corollary result, anticipate that the <b>c-factor</b> may not be also well produced by the regular mBJ method for the case of fcc-C 60. Thereby, one needs to first optimize the <b>c-factor</b> for this case as well. The latter anticipation needs more elaboration which is out of the scope of this work.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The <b>C-Factor</b> {{has been}} used widely to {{rationalize}} the changes in shrinkage stress occurring at the tooth/resin-composite interfaces. Experimentally, such stresses have been measured in a uniaxial direction between opposed parallel walls. The situation of adjoining cavity walls has been neglected. The aim {{was to investigate the}} hypothesis that: within stylized model rectangular cavities of constant volume and wall thickness, the interfacial shrinkage-stress at the adjoining cavity walls increases steadily as the <b>C-Factor</b> increases. Methods. Eight 3 D-FEM restored Class I 'rectangular cavity' models were created by MSC. PATRAN/MSC. Marc, r 2 - 2005 and subjected to 1 % of shrinkage, while maintaining constant both the volume (20 mm(3)) and the wall thickness (2 mm), but varying the <b>C-Factor</b> (1. 9 - 13. 5). An adhesive contact between the composite and the teeth was incorporated. Polymerization shrinkage was simulated by analogy with thermal contraction. Principal stresses and strains were calculated. Peak values of maximum principal (MP) and maximum shear (MS) stresses from the different walls were displayed graphically as a function of <b>C-Factor.</b> The stress-peak association with <b>C-Factor</b> was evaluated by the Pearson correlation between the stress peak and the <b>C-Factor.</b> Results. The hypothesis was rejected: there was no clear increase of stress-peaks with <b>C-Factor.</b> The stress-peaks particularly expressed as MP and MS varied only slightly with increasing <b>C-Factor.</b> Lower stress-peaks were present at the pulpal floor in comparison to the stress at the axial walls. In general, MP and MS were similar when the axial wall dimensions were similar. The Pearson coefficient only expressed associations for the maximum principal stress at the ZX wall and the Z axis.

Material and METHODS: Cylindrical cavities with 5. 0 mm diameter and three different depths (A= 1. 0, B= 2. 0 and C= 3. 0 mm) were prepared on the occlusal surface of 30 human molars and restored in a single increment with P 60. The composite resin was light-cured according to two protocols: standard - 850 mW/cm² / 20 s and gradual - 100 up to 1000 mW/cm² / 10 s + 1000 mW/cm² / 10 s.

Methods: Cylindrical cavities, 1 mm deep and 3 mm in diameter (<b>C-factor</b> = 2. 3) or 2 mm in diameter (Cfactor = 3) were prepared on flat superficial bovine dentin surfaces. The teeth were restored with Clearfil Photo Bond, Clearfil Liner Bond 2 or Super-Bond D Liner adhesive systems followed by Photo Clearfil Bright composite. The resins were cured with a conventional method using 600 mW/cm 2 (tip-to-resin distance 0 mm) for 60 s, or the slow-start curing method of 270 mW/cm 2 (tip-to-resin distance 10 mm) for 10 s, followed by a 5 -s interval, then 50 s at 600 mW/cm 2.

40|$|During {{polymerization}} of resin composites, shrinkage stresses {{compete with}} resin-dentin bonds {{in a manner}} that can cause failure of the bond, depending upon the configuration of the cavity, its depth, and the restorative technique. The hypothesis tested in this study was that the effect of cavity configuration (C) and remaining dentin thickness (RDT) influence resin bond strength to the dentin of Class I cavity floors. The occlusal enamel was ground to expose a flat superficial dentin surface as a control (superficial dentin, <b>C-factor</b> = 1) in human extracted third molars. Cavities 3 mm long × 4 mm wide were prepared to a depth 2 mm below the ground dentin surfaces (deep dentin within cavity floor, <b>C-factor</b> = 3). To assess the relationship between <b>C-factor</b> and RDT, we removed the walls of cavities, making a deep flat surface for bonding (deep dentin, <b>C-factor</b> = 1). The teeth were restored with either Clearfil Liner Bond II (LB II), One-Step (OS), or Super-Bond D Liner (DL), followed by Clearfil Photo Posterior resin composite. After 24 hrs' storage in water, the teeth were sectioned vertically into 3 or 4 slabs (0. 7 mm thick) and trimmed for the micro-tensile bond test so that we could determine the strength of the resin bonds to the pulpal floor. All groups gave high bond strengths to superficial dentin, but OS and DL gave significantly lower bond strengths to flat deep dentin when the <b>C-factor</b> was 1. When the <b>C-factor</b> was increased to 3 by the creation of a three-dimensional cavity preparation, the bond strengths of all materials fell (range, 21 to 35 %), but the difference was significant (p < 0. 05) only with DL. SEM observations of failure patterns showed that specimens with high bond strengths tended to exhibit cohesive failures within the hybrid layer, while specimens exhibiting low bond strengths showed failures {{at the top of the}} hybrid layer.

40|$|Land use {{and land}} cover are most {{important}} in quantifying soil erosion. Based on the <b>C-factor</b> of the popular soil erosion model, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and a scale-pattern-process theory in landscape ecology, we proposed a multi-scale soil loss evaluation index (SL) to evaluate the effects of land use patterns on soil erosion. We examined the advantages and shortcomings of SL for small watershed (SLsw) by comparing to the <b>C-factor</b> used in RUSLE. We used the Yanhe watershed located on China's Loess Plateau {{as a case study}} to demonstrate the utilities of SLsw. The SLsw calculation involves the delineations of the drainage network and sub-watershed boundaries, the calculations of soil loss horizontal distance index, the soil loss vertical distance index, slope steepness, rainfall-runoff erosivity, soil erodibility, and cover and management practice. We used several extensions within the geographic information system (GIS), and AVSWAT 2000 hydrological model to derive all the required GIS layers. We compared the SLsw with the <b>C-factor</b> to identify spatial patterns to understand the causes for the differences. The SLsw values for the Yanhe watershed are in the range of 0. 15 to 0. 45, and there are 593 sub-watersheds with SLsw values that are lower than the <b>C-factor</b> values (LOW) and 227 sub-watersheds with SLsw values higher than the <b>C-factor</b> values (HIGH). The HIGH area have greater rainfall-runoff erosivity than LOW area for all land use types. The cultivated land is located on the steeper slope or is closer to the drainage network in the horizontal direction in HIGH area in comparison to LOW area. The results imply that SLsw can be used to identify the effect of land use distribution on soil loss, whereas the <b>C-factor</b> has less power to do it. Both HIGH and LOW areas have similar soil erodibility values for all land use types. The average vertical distances of forest land and sparse forest land to the drainage network are shorter in LOW area than that in HIGH area.

An experimental composite with demonstrated remineralizing potential was also formulated by inclusion into the BT resin of zirconia-hybridized amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) filler at a mass fraction of 40 % (BT/ACP composite). A commercial glass-filled composite (TPH) was used as a control. To assess the effect of the test geometry on PSD, <b>C-factor</b> was systematically varied between 0. 8 and 6. 0 by varying the height of the cylindrical composite specimens. The measured PSD values obtained by cantilever beam tensometry for specimens with variable C-factors were normalized for mass to specimens with a <b>C-factor</b> of 1. 33 (h= 2. 25 mm) as controls to give calculated PSD values. Degrees of vinyl conversions (DC) attained in the TPH control and in the experimental BT/ACP composites were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy.

Results: Significantly lower scores of LD and SF were observed for Filtek Silorane (LD: 12. 0 µm ± 1. 3, SF: 13. 7 N ± 1. 0) than for Filtek Supreme XT (LD: 25. 0 µm ± 0. 6, SF: 36. 3 N ± 2. 9). Both variables, ie, composite type and <b>C-factor,</b> had a significant effect on marginal adaptation (p < 0. 05). In the groups with high <b>C-factor</b> (SSA was applied on the entire cavity surface) percent of continuous margin (%CM) (mean ± SD) before and after loading, respectively, was 24. 4 ± 16. 6 and 2. 1 ± 2. 4 for Filtek Supreme XT, and 58. 8 ± 9. 9 and 35. 4 ± 4. 1 for Filtek Silorane. When adhesion was confined to enamel margins (lower <b>C-factor),</b> %CM before and after loading, respectively, increased to 76. 1 ± 9. 6 and 64. 2 ± 11. 5 for Filtek Supreme XT, and 96. 6 ± 1. 7 and 94. 2 ± 2. 1 for Filtek Silorane. Conclusions: The silorane-based composite exhibited significantly lower shrinkage forces and better marginal adaptation than did the methacrylate-based composite...|$|E
40|$|Soil erosion can {{be linked}} to {{relative}} fractional cover of photosynthetic-active vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic-active vegetation (NPV) and bare soil (BS), which can be integrated into erosion models as the cover-management <b>C-factor.</b> This study investigates the capability of EnMAP imagery to map fractional cover in a region near San Jose, Costa Rica, characterized by spatially extensive coffee plantations and grazing in a mountainous terrain. Simulated EnMAP imagery is based on airborne hyperspectral HyMap data. Fractional cover estimates are derived in an automated fashion by extracting image endmembers to be used with a Multiple End-member Spectral Mixture Analysis approach. The <b>C-factor</b> is calculated based on the fractional cover estimates determined independently for EnMAP and HyMap. Results demonstrate that with EnMAP imagery it is possible to extract quality endmember classes with important spectral features related to PV, NPV and soil, and be able to estimate relative cover fractions. This spectral information is critical to separate BS and NPV which greatly can impact the <b>C-factor</b> derivation. From a regional perspective, we can use EnMAP to provide good fractional cover estimates that can be integrated into soil erosion modeling...|$|E

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the influence of the <b>C-factor</b> and the mode of polymerization on the cohesive strength of various dual-cure resin cements. Methods Three curing conditions were tested; chemical curing with free shrinkage conditions (C = 0), and constraint shrinkage conditions (C = 25), and dual-curing with free shrinkage conditions (C = 0). Opaque polyethylene, brass (pretreated with Clearfil SE bond), and transparent polyethylene tubes respectively, were filled with the different cements. The tubes were 20 mm long with an inner diameter of 1. 6 or 1. 8 mm. Five cements, DC Core Automix, Panavia F 2. 0, Maxcem, Multilink, and RelyX Unicem, were tested with ten specimens per group. The specimens were trimmed to an hour-glass shape with a neck diameter of 1 mm, stored in water (37 °C, 24 h), and subjected to microtensile testing (1 mm min− 1). SEM analysis was carried out on chemically cured samples of DC Core Automix C = 0 and C = 25. Data were statistically analyzed (Two-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc test, p < 0. 05). Results Most cements showed no significant differences between the curing modes. A high <b>C-factor</b> negatively influences the cohesive strength of some cements. SEM analysis shows that chemical curing of DC Core Automix in a high <b>C-factor</b> environment leads to more and larger microvoids in the cement. Significance Constraint shrinkage conditions, i. e. a high <b>C-factor,</b> can negatively influence the physical properties of a dual-cured resin cement, which would clinically be the case in the confined space of a root canal or post space preparation...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} cavity <b>C-factor</b> and LED curing mode on microleakage of class V resin composite restorations. Methods: Eighty extracted human maxillary premolars were divided into four groups. In groups I and II, V-shaped class V cavities (<b>C-factor</b> ≈ 1. 5) were prepared while box-shaped class V cavities (high <b>C-factor</b> ≈ 4) were prepared in groups III and IV. All the cavities were prepared on the vestibular surfaces of the teeth. All the cavities were prepared by one operator with specific dimensions. The same adhesive system (Excite) and the same restorative composite (Tetric Ceram) were used in all the groups. The restorations in groups I and III were cured with the fast curing mode of LED curing light, while the restorations in groups II and IV were cured with the soft-start mode of the same curing light. The samples were thermocycled, immersed in a 0. 5 % basic fuchsin solution for 24 hours, and sectioned. The degree of dye penetration was measured quantitatively and then qualitatively at both enamel and dentin/cementum margins. Results: Quantitatively, there was no statistical difference {{in the degree of}} microleakage between the groups at the enamel margin (P>. 05). At the dentin/cementum margin, group III showed significantl...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} quantity of resin composite, <b>C-factor,</b> and geometry in Class V restorations on shrinkage stress after bulk fill insertion of resin using two-dimensional finite element analysis. Methods: An image of a buccolingual longitudinal plane {{in the middle of}} an upper first premolar and supporting tissues was used for modeling 10 groups: cylindrical cavity, erosion, and abfraction lesions with the same <b>C-factor</b> (1. 57), a second cylindrical cavity and abfraction lesion with the same quantity of resin (QR) as the erosion lesion, and then all repeated with a bevel on the occlusal cavosurface angle. The 10 groups were imported into Ansys 13. 0 for two-dimensional finite element analysis. The mesh was built with 30, 000 triangle and square elements of 0. 1 mm in length for all the models. All materials were considered isotropic, homogeneous, elastic, and linear, and the resin composite shrinkage was simulated by thermal analogy. The maximum principal (MPS) and von Mises stresses (VMS) were analyzed for comparing the behavior of the groups. Results: Different values of angles for the cavosurface margin in enamel and dentin were obtained for all groups and the higher the angle, the lower the stress concentration. When the groups with the same <b>C-factor</b> and QR were compared, the erosion shape cavity showed the highest MPS and VMS values, and abfraction shape, the lowest. A cavosurface bevel decreased the stress values on the occlusal margin. The geometry factor overcame the effects of <b>C-factor</b> and QR in some situations. Conclusion: Within the limitations of the current methodology, it is possible to conclude that the combination of all variables studied influences the stress, but the geometry is the most important factor to be considered by the operator...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAimTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different configuration factors “C-factors” on the marginal gap formation of two types of contemporary composite resin systems before and after thermal loading. Materials and methodsOne hundred and twenty eight human sound molars were used. The occlusal surface of each tooth was wet-ground until flat dentin surfaces were obtained. Teeth were divided into four main groups in which cylindrical cavities were prepared representing different C-factors. Samples in each group were subdivided into 2 subgroups according {{to the type of}} composite resin system. The cavities in subgroup A were restored with Clearfil SE bond and Clearfil Majesty Esthetic while those in subgroup B were restored with Futurabond DC and Grandio SO. Eight samples in each subgroup were thermo-cycled. All samples were processed for SEM evaluation to examine the restoration margins at (25 × and 500 ×) magnification. The marginal gap was measured for all the samples using AutoCAD software. ResultsThe median values (IQR) of the marginal gap were 0 (0) in all the samples restored with Clearfil Majesty Esthetic. The same was found in samples restored with Grandio SO which were not subjected to thermo-cycling, while those subjected to thermo-cycling, a direct relation was found between <b>C-factor</b> and gap length. Thermo-cycling had a significant effect on marginal gap particularly in samples restored with Grandio SO with high <b>C-factor</b> preparations. The two tested composite resin systems had a significant effect on the marginal gap particularly in high <b>C-factor</b> preparations. The <b>C-factor</b> had no significant effect on the marginal gap except in samples restored with Grandio SO. ConclusionThe different C-factors had no effect on the marginal gap formation in the samples of both subgroups which were not subjected to thermo-cycling but could influence the marginal gap formation in the samples restored with Grandio SO subjected to thermo-cycling...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{consistent}} way of describing heavy baryons containing a heavy quark as bound states of an SU(2) soliton and heavy mesons. The resulting mass formula reveals the heavy quark symmetry explicitly. By extending {{the model to}} the orbitally excited states, we establish the generic structure of the heavy baryon spectrum. As anticipated from the heavy quark spin symmetry, the <b>c-factor</b> denoting the hyperfine splitting constant vanishes and the baryons with the same angular momentum of light degrees of freedom form degenerate doublets. This approach is also applied to the pentaquark exotic baryons, where the conventional <b>c-factor</b> plays no more a role of the hyperfine constant. After diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of order N − 1 c, we get the degenerate doublets, which implies the vanishing of genuine hyperfine splitting...|$|E
