A reference target separation distance is determined using single viewpoint photogrammetry for a "wind off condition. An apparent target separation distance is then computed for "wind on. " The difference between the reference and apparent target separation distances is minimized by recomputing the single viewpoint photogrammetric solution for incrementally changed values of target semispan distances.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This volume documents the research effort which provided a flight test system and flight data to determine the stability and control derivatives for the Rockwell Commander N 700 AE aircraft. The presented research was conducted from June 1994 to May 1995. A set of data sensors was installed on the aircraft which measured time histories of aircraft states. These states included airspeed, altitude, relative-wind orientation, control surface deflections, linear accelerations, and angular velocities. The required sensors were designed or purchased and then installed, in-house. Calibration and testing of the sensors were performed. Existing avionics sensors were not "tapped" for data. A system for acquiring and processing the flight data was developed: a laptop computer was used which could interface with the data acquisition cardsand data sensors through a PCMCIA connection. Flight tests were performed to determine the response of the aircraft to different control inputs, atmospheric conditions and flight modes. Maneuvers were performed that would yield the most useful data for determining stability and control derivatives. Flight tests were performed for various airspeeds, altitudes, and aircraft configurations. Takeoff, landing, cruise and engine-out configurations were considered. Time histories of the aforementioned aircraft states were recorded for each of the proposed flight modes. Flight test data suitable for the extraction of stability derivatives was obtained on May 15 and May 19, 1995. Data acquisition throughput rates better than 145 samples/sec/chan were achieved. Relative-wind and control surface deflections were measured to an accuracy better than 0. 17 ' and 0. 09 ', respectively. Drift in flights lasting three hours was less than 0. 2 ' for all relative-wind angles and all but one <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>angle</b> (1. 2 ' drift in rudder deflection angle). Noise levels were less than 1. 3 % of full scale angles. Linear accelerations were measured with an accuracy of 0. 0007 g's with drifts less than 0. 01 9 for all but one sensor (0. 04 g for x-axis accelerometer). Acceleration noise levels ranged from 0. 2 % to 6. 1 % full scale. Angular velocities as fine as 0. 07 '/sec were measured and drifted less than 0. 12 '/sec. Angular velocity noise levels less than 1 % of full scale were observed. All these noise levels were based on raw measurements; no filtering was performed. The flight test system developed was reliable and robust {{with the exception of the}} pitot-static system. The data acquired was suitable for derivative extraction. Future efforts should include repair and calibration of the pitot-static system, installation of additional sensors, estimation of mass and inertial properties, and stability derivative extraction...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to qualitatively explain the flow phenomena which occur on a balanced flap type <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> at supersonic speeds and to find means of calculating the pressure distributions occurring. The popular and generally useful linearized flow theory, and in fact any inviscid theory, cannot be used since viscosity plays a predominant part in {{the determination of the}} flow. It is shown that the flow often involves shock induced separation and reflection of shock waves by these separated wakes. Experimental data in the form of pressure distributions and shadowgraph pictures of the flow are used to arrive at a description of the flow. By use of the empirical results given, a method of predicting the pressure distributions for this type of surface is derived. This procedure is then used to calculate several pressure distributions which are compared with those experimentally determined. The separation effects that occur at the larger angles of attack and/or <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> deflection <b>angles</b> cause the control effectiveness and hinge moments to be very non-linear.

40|$|An {{overview}} of {{the contributions of the}} NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) to the DARPA/AFRL/NASA/ Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) Smart Wing program is presented. The overall objective of the Smart Wing program was to develop smart** technologies and demonstrate near-flight-scale actuation systems to improve the aerodynamic performance of military aircraft. NASA LaRC s roles were to provide technical guidance, wind-tunnel testing time and support, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses. The program was divided into two phases, with each phase having two wind-tunnel entries in the Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT). This paper focuses on the fourth and final wind-tunnel test: Phase 2, Test 2. During this test, a model based on the NGC Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) concept was tested at Mach numbers up to 0. 8 and dynamic pressures up to 150 psf to determine the aerodynamic performance benefits that could be achieved using hingeless, smoothly-contoured <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> actuated with smart materials technologies. The UCAV-based model was a 30 % geometric scale, full-span, sting-mounted model with the smart <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> on the starboard wing and conventional, hinged <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> on the port wing. Two LaRC-developed instrumentation systems were used during the test to externally measure the shapes of the smart <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> and quantify the effects of aerodynamic loading on the deflections: Videogrammetric Model Deformation (VMD) and Projection Moire Interferometry (PMI). VMD is an optical technique that uses single-camera photogrammetric tracking of discrete targets to determine deflections at specific points. PMI provides spatially continuous measurements of model deformation by computationally analyzing images of a grid projected onto the model surface. Both the VMD and PMI measurements served well to validate the use of on-board (internal) rotary potentiometers to measure the smart <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> deflection <b>angles.</b> Prior to the final entry, NASA LaRC also performed three-dimensional unstructured Navier Stokes CFD analyses in an attempt to predict the potential aerodynamic impact of the smart <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> on overall model forces and moments. Eight different <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> shapes were selected for study at Mach = 0. 6, Reynolds number = 3. 25 x 10 (exp 6), and + 2 deg., 3 deg., 8 deg., and 10 deg. model angles-of-attack. For the baseline, undeflected <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> geometry, the CFD predictions and wind-tunnel results matched well. The agreement was not as good for the more complex aero-loaded <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> shapes, though, because of the inability to accurately predict those shapes.

40|$|The {{selection}} of design loads and requirements is defining the structural weight of airplanes and their safety. Therefore {{the definition of}} requirements should be performed very critically by the customer and structural weight should be assessed based on sensitivity analysis of the total aircraft which includes flight manoeuvre simulation, flight control system, aerodynamics and elastic effects introduced by finite elements. To produce these analyses {{is the job of}} the aircraft companies. After {{selection of}} most load critical flight manoeuvres (pull up manoeuvres, initiation of roll manoeuvres etc.) the calculation of airloads and inertia loads must include the flight control system and its failure cases because it affects the motion of the <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> and therefore the aircraft. With the advent of carbon fibre composite structures discrete loads are the predominant limiting design conditions but it should be emphasised that most structures are of a hybrid nature with metal frame which are still susceptible to fatigue loads. For airplanes designed to civil requirements such as transport airplanes, tankers etc. the definition of continuous turbulence and inclusion of FCS failure cases and nonlinearities such as <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>angles</b> is extremely important. There was a long way from load assumptions used by the Wright Brothers who designed their Flyer to a 5 g limit to the load limiting capabilities of the care free handling flight control system of the Eurofighter. Also the US-Airforce Mil-Specifications which were used to design NATO airplanes such as Tornado, F 16 and F 18 in the 1970 ’s are obsolete today and the MIL-A- 87221 (USAF) is only a frame without the essential quantitative material. All these issues are addressed in this manual including comparisons of regulations and descriptions of new specifications. Complete procedures how to establish design loads are presented which should help for the design of new airplanes. The importance of dynamic phenomena which produce design loads for various aircraft parts such as intakes, leading edges etc. is also highlighted. Loads monitoring systems are necessary to prove calculated loads and monitor fatigue loads to establish the remaining structural life. There is a description of a modern system. For transport type aircraft gust load cases are the most critical for strength design and they are also the main fatigue loading source for the major part of the structure. Methods for discrete and continuous gust loading cases are presented together with nonlinear example calculations. In the appendix there is a description of failure cases and their effect on loads for transport aircraft and a specification of a landing gear which could be used as an example how to specify the whole structure as a system. The military use of this manual is to establish procedures to build the lightest structure for the military requirements. Agreement on requirements and design loads within the NATO countries could standardise pilot training, aircraft usage, increase aircraft life and reduce maintenance. Since the search of the best usage of the aircraft for its military purpose will continue to integrate structure and avionics such as fire and flight control systems as an example there will be a continuous need for future work...|$|R
