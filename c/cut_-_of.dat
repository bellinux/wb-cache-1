40|$|Excerpt] 2 ̆ 2 It {{has been}} argued that the {{antitrust}} laws’ legislative history supports the notion that the laws were meant to prohibit anticompetitive price <b>cuts</b> <b>–</b> regardless <b>of</b> whether they are below cost. Thus, predatory pricing claims used to turn simply on whether the allegedly predatory price was intended to harm rivals. In fact, liability for predatory price discrimination was found without requiring probable or actual monopolization. Yet some cases brought early under Section 2 suggest that below cost pricing was indicative of, if not proof of, the type of conduct Section 2 prohibits. The results under this old scheme were mixed. ...|$|R

40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{estimate}} serum vitamin B 12 {{levels in}} {{type 1 diabetes}} and to evaluate the influence of duration of diabetes, diabetic control, and age on B 12 levels. Importance of Study: Vitamin B 12 deficiency {{is known to be}} associated with autoimmune disorders. However, currently there is very limited and controversial data regarding the prevalence of B 12 deficiency in type 1 diabetes in South Indian population. If our study demonstrates the presence of low serum B 12 levels in type 1 diabetes in our population, a recommendation for regular screening and supplementation of vitamin B 12 could be considered in these patients. Materials and Methods: This was a cross- sectional study. Ninety type 1 diabetic patients (44 males and 46 females) were randomly selected based on inclusion/ exclusion criteria from the diabetes registry at Bangalore Diabetes Centre. Serum vitamin B 12 level and parameters for diabetic controls were estimated using fully automated methods. All statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 16. Results: The study showed that 45. 5 % of the diabetics had low B 12 using the manufacturer′s <b>cut</b> <b>-</b> off <b>of</b> 180 pg/mL and 54 % had low B 12 using the published <b>cut</b> <b>-</b> off <b>of</b> 148 pmol/l (200 pg/mL). There {{was no significant difference in}} B 12 levels between males and females (mean difference = - 14. 3 : P > 0. 05). The study did not demonstrate any significant correlation between vitamin B 12 levels and age, duration of diabetes, and diabetes control (the r values being - 0. 18, - 0. 11, and - 0. 08 respectively and the P-value > 0. 05). Conclusion: Results of our study shows the presence of low serum B 12 levels in type 1 diabetics. These findings merits further research on a larger population to investigate into the cause of deficiency and the benefit of B 12 supplementation in these patients...|$|R
50|$|On 14 July 2012 Cork and Wexford faced {{off in a}} do-or-die {{qualifier}} {{meeting at}} Semple Stadium. The game started with a welter of goals, Luke O'Farrell’s early effort for Cork was immediately matched by Diarmuid Lyng, but O’Farrell continued to impress, scoring his second goal before earning a penalty that was emphatically despatched by goalkeeper Anthony Nash. Still Wexford continued to pose a threat through Rory Jacob and Lyng landed a couple <b>of</b> sideline <b>cuts</b> <b>-</b> one <b>of</b> which was scarcely credible <b>-</b> to <b>cut</b> the half-time deficit to 3-7 to 1-11. Cork had the breeze on the resumption though and gradually {{took control of the}} game, and with Patrick Horgan and Niall McCarthy in form they pulled away. Garrett Sinnott pulled a goal back for Wexford but the score - along with the late dismissal of Wexford’s David Redmond - had little influence on the game which Cork won by 3-24 to 2-17.|$|R

The crosslinked membranes are resistant to N-methyl pyrrolidone (which is solvent of the non-crosslinked membranes) and have very good mechanical properties. In contrast to the state-of-the-art polyimide crosslinked membranes, the created covalent bond is expected to be thermally stable enabling applications at elevated temperatures. The transport characteristics (permeance and molecular weight <b>cut</b> off <b>–</b> MWCO) <b>of</b> the crosslinked membranes are changed in comparison to non-crosslinked ones.

40|$|Cut- Outs {{throw the}} {{fuselage}} are {{very common in}} commercial aircrafts. One {{of the most critical}} Cut- Out that an aircraft has in its fuselage, is the one used to mount the Horizontal Stabilizer because a very high load concentration in this region occurs. Therefore, additional structures such as splices and beams must be installed to carry the loads around the openings. This Master Thesis studies the mechanical behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>Cut</b> <b>–</b> Out <b>of</b> the Horizontal Stabilizer with a Finite Element Model and provides the static sizing and fatigue check of the parts related to it. The analyses performed on the structure are: static strength of the splices, damage tolerance at skin, bolted joints analysis and fatigue check of the splices. The results show a very small reserve factors in this region. Therefore, this Cut- Out must be treated as critical, especially during the manufacturing of the aircraft but this also implies a good design because it will withstand all the known load cases and it is as light as possible...|$|R
