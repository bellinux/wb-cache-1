500|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. [...] Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the cable length. [...] In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). [...] Unfortunately, there is no easy, non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. [...] It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, return loss. [...] Return loss by itself does not reveal much, since the <b>cable</b> <b>design</b> will have some intrinsic return loss anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. [...] The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of return loss with frequency. [...] The minimum return loss so measured is called the structural return loss (SRL). [...] SRL is a measure of a cables' adherence to its nominal impedance {{but it is not a}} direct correspondence, errors further from the generator have less effect on SRL than those close to it. [...] The measurement must also be carried out at all in-band frequencies to be significant. [...] The reason for this is that equally spaced errors introduced by the manufacturing process will cancel and be invisible, or at least much reduced, at certain frequencies due to quarter wave impedance transformer action.|$|E

40|$|The quench {{development}} process was studied with two six-strand superconducting cable samples with insulated strands and different <b>cabling</b> <b>design.</b> One sample was the traditional ‘six-around-one’ cable, {{the other was}} of the ‘round-braid’ type. Quench was initiated by a heating pulse applied to a single strand. A significant difference was observed in the current redistribution among strands due to the different <b>cabling</b> <b>designs.</b> It has an important influence on the stability of multistrand cables. A new concept of the ‘single-strand stability’ was proposed and corresponding stability criteria were offered.
