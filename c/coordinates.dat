5|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of the introduction of polar <b>coordinates</b> {{as part of a}} formal coordinate system. The full history of the subject is described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge's Origin of Polar <b>Coordinates.</b> Grégoire de Saint-Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid-seventeenth century. Saint-Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647, while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653. Cavalieri first used polar <b>coordinates</b> to solve a problem relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral. Blaise Pascal subsequently used polar <b>coordinates</b> to calculate the length of parabolic arcs.|$|E

Specifying a position in ecliptic <b>coordinates</b> requires specifying a particular equinox, that is, the equinox of a particular date, known as an epoch; the <b>coordinates</b> are referred to {{the direction of the}} equinox at that date. For instance, the Astronomical Almanac lists the heliocentric position of Mars at 0h Terrestrial Time, 4 Jan 2010 as: longitude 118° 09' 15".8, latitude +1° 43' 16".7, true heliocentric distance 1.6302454 AU, mean equinox and ecliptic of date.

40|$|We have {{designed}} an orthogonal curvilinear terrain-following <b>coordinate</b> (the orthogonal σ <b>coordinate,</b> or the OS <b>coordinate)</b> {{to reduce the}} advection errors in the classic σ <b>coordinate.</b> First, we rotate the basis vectors of the z <b>coordinate</b> in a specific way {{in order to obtain}} the orthogonal, terrain-following basis vectors of the OS <b>coordinate,</b> and then add a rotation parameter b to each rotation angle to create the smoother vertical levels of the OS <b>coordinate</b> with increasing height. Second, we solve the corresponding definition of each OS <b>coordinate</b> through its basis vectors; and then solve the 3 -D <b>coordinate</b> surfaces of the OS <b>coordinate</b> numerically, therefore the computational grids created by the OS <b>coordinate</b> are not exactly orthogonal and its orthogonality is dependent on the accuracy of a numerical method. Third, through choosing a proper b, we can significantly smooth the vertical levels of the OS <b>coordinate</b> over a steep terrain, and, more importantly, we can create the orthogonal, terrain-following computational grids in the vertical through the orthogonal basis vectors of the OS <b>coordinate,</b> which can reduce the advection errors better than the corresponding hybrid σ <b>coordinate.</b> However, the convergence of the grid lines in the OS <b>coordinate</b> over orography restricts the time step and increases the numerical errors. We demonstrate the advantages and the drawbacks of the OS <b>coordinate</b> relative to the hybrid σ <b>coordinate</b> using two sets of 2 -D linear advection experiments...|$|R

The paper presents a general expression of the <b>coordinate</b> transformation matrixes in three-phase circuit and {{points out that the}} <b>coordinate</b> transformation matrixes having different specific expressions are due to existing the parameters which can be selected in the general expression. On this basis, the three often used expressions of <b>coordinate</b> transformation matrixes rotating at arbitrary speed are obtained through selecting these different parameters, which are Park transformation, orthogonal transformation and the <b>coordinate</b> transformation in the theory of instantaneous power. The paper further points out that, through particularly choosing <b>coordinate</b> rotation speed,it can get commonly used special <b>coordinate</b> transformation matrixes between the three-phase stationary <b>coordinate</b> systems, and between the stationary <b>coordinate</b> system and synchronous rotating <b>coordinate</b> system by matrix general expression.
