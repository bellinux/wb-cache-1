5|$|Dedicated EVA Air Cargo {{operations}} {{began in}} April 1995, {{with the first}} weekly McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter flights to Taipei, Singapore, Penang, San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. EVA Air Cargo's fleet was expanded to five freighters {{by the end of}} the year. Previously, EVA Air Cargo operations mainly relied on passenger aircraft <b>cargo</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|The DB9 {{is rated}} well by car critics, who {{appreciate}} the car's {{interior and exterior}} design. In spite of comments regarding the DB9's weaker engine and handling, reviewers liked the car's ride and driving experience. Some also held issue with the DB9's small rear seats, <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> and poor satnav.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} more ships joined the fleet {{in the early}} 1900s: Peterborough, which was {{acquired}} from the Shellharbour Steam Navigation Company, and Merimbula. At the time Merimbula was the company's finest vessel. She was a 1122-ton screw steamer which provided accommodation for 106 passengers (96 saloon and 10 second class) as well as possessing refrigerated <b>cargo</b> <b>space,</b> and she was capable of between 13 and 14 knots. Unfortunately she ran aground off Beecroft Head in 1928.|$|E
50|$|Net tonnage (NT) {{is based}} on a {{calculation}} of the volume of all <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> of the ship. It indicates a vessel's earning space and {{is a function of the}} moulded volume of all <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> of the ship.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{constructed}} with fire-resistant materials and also had enhanced fire-detecting and fire-extinguishing equipment installed for the time. A [...] "smoke-pipe" [...] fire-detecting system {{was installed in}} all <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces,</b> the paint locker, carpenter shop, dry storeroom and bosun's storerooms. A CO2 fire suppression system protected the <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces,</b> service spaces and machinery space in addition to standard fire fighting equipment.|$|R

5|$|Founded {{concurrently}} {{with the}} passenger operations of EVA Air, EVA Air Cargo operates facilities in Europe, Asia, and North America. Its cargo operations have diversified to include transportation of high-tech equipment and special care {{items such as}} museum artwork and live zoological specimens. EVA Air has stated its goal of achieving a 50/50 split in revenues between its passenger and cargo operations. The airline's cargo operations are mainly operated via a fleet of Boeing 747-400, MD-11 dedicated freighters, Boeing 747-400 Combi aircraft, and additional belly <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> on passenger aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Throughout late 1796, {{progress}} on the expedition faltered. Hoche publicly blamed the naval command and specifically Vice-amiral Villaret de Joyeuse for the delay, whom he accused of being {{more interested in the}} planning of a proposed invasion of India. In October, Villaret was replaced by Vice-amiral Morard de Galles and the India plans were cancelled, while Hoche was placed in direct command of discipline within the fleet. By the second week of December the fleet was ready, consisting of 17 ships of the line, 13 frigates and 14 other vessels, including several large transports created made by removing the cannon from old frigates to maximise <b>cargo</b> <b>space.</b> Each ship of the line carried 600 soldiers, the frigates 250 and the transports approximately 400. Included were cavalry units, field artillery and substantial military stores with which to arm the thousands of anticipated Irish volunteers. Hoche was still dissatisfied, announcing to the Directory on 8 December that he would rather lead his men in any other operation than the planned attack on Ireland. He was supported by Morard de Galles, who admitted that his men were so inexperienced at sea that encounters with the enemy should be avoided wherever possible.|$|E
25|$|Many drivers {{found that}} having limited <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> {{and only two}} seats was more {{restrictive}} than the limited range.|$|E
50|$|There were no {{refrigerated}} <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> {{but deep}} tanks under #2 and #5 holds had a combined bulk liquid cargo capacity of 1,871 tons.|$|R
5000|$|In shipping, a [...] "full {{scantling}} vessel" [...] {{is understood}} to be a geared ship, that can reach all parts of its own <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> with its own gear.|$|R
25|$|In 1911 {{the toll}} measure changed at Suez {{to account for}} all <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces,</b> and {{contemporaneous}} refinements {{in the design of}} ships of more conventional hull form eliminated the structural advantages of turret deck ships. Construction of the type therefore ceased.|$|R
25|$|The {{ship has}} <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> of , {{which can be}} {{unloaded}} via two ramps, either from the starboard side or the stern.|$|E
25|$|The second feature was her {{compound}} steam engine, {{designed by}} Alfred Holt. As {{well as being}} more efficient than others of the time, it was a relatively compact engine, so used less <b>cargo</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
25|$|When the YOH-4A was {{eliminated}} by the Army, Bell went about {{solving the problem}} of marketing the aircraft. In addition to the image problem, the helicopter lacked <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> and only provided cramped quarters for the planned three passengers. The solution was a redesigned fuselage, sleeker and aesthetically appealing, adding 16ft3 (0.45m3) of <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> in the process. A Bell executive contributed to this redesign by drawing on a sketch two lines extending the fuselage to where it meets the tail. The redesign was designated Bell 206A, and Bell President Edwin J. Ducayet named it the JetRanger, denoting an evolution from the popular Model 47J Ranger.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cargo</b> and <b>space</b> {{measurement}} surveys.|$|R
25|$|The ship's gross tonnage, {{a measure}} of the volume of all its {{enclosed}} spaces, is 14,793. Its net tonnage, which measures the volume of the <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces,</b> is 4,437. Its total carrying capacity in terms of weight, is , the equivalent of approximately 300 adult male sperm whales.|$|R
50|$|Since 18 July 1994 {{the gross}} and net tonnages, {{dimensionless}} indices {{calculated from the}} total moulded volume {{of the ship and}} its <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> by mathematical formulae, have been the only official measures of the ship's tonnage. However, the gross and net register tonnages are still widely used in describing older ships.|$|R
25|$|At the January 2011 North American International Auto Show, Toyota {{revealed}} the 2012 model year Prius v, an extended hatchback wagon, which {{is derived from}} the third-generation Prius and features over 50 percent more interior <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> than the original Prius design.|$|E
25|$|Catamarans {{range in}} size from small (sailing or rowing vessels) to large (naval ships and car ferries). The {{structure}} connecting a catamaran's two hulls ranges from a simple frame strung with webbing to support the crew to a bridging superstructure incorporating extensive cabin and/or <b>cargo</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{ship had}} four 100 lbf/in2 {{double-ended}} auxiliary boilers. Onboard electricity was supplied by five six-cylinder 900 bhp Allan diesel engines, each powering a 600 kW 220 volt generator. Much of her <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> was refrigerated. Her navigation equipment included wireless direction finding, and echo sounding device and a gyrocompass.|$|E
50|$|During 1961 and 1962, Eltanin was {{modified}} throughout at a New York shipyard {{to fill a}} new role as a floating laboratory. Former <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> were replaced with labs, workshops, and staterooms for scientists, and further labs were added above decks. Anti-roll tanks were also added, along with protective bulwarks. On 23 August 1962 her classification was changed to Oceanographic Research Vessel and designated T-AGOR-8.|$|R
2500|$|Both GT and NT are {{obtained}} by measuring ship's volume and then applying a mathematical formula. [...] Gross tonnage {{is based on}} [...] "the moulded volume of all enclosed spaces of the ship" [...] whereas net tonnage is based on [...] "the moulded volume of all <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> of the ship". [...] In addition, a ship's net tonnage is constrained to be no less than 30% of her gross tonnage.|$|R
25|$|In July 2012, Freedom was dry docked {{in order}} to expand {{berthing}} by 20 and for firefighting and boat handling improvements. After another docking to apply a new paint scheme and apply another fix for the aft ramp, she will depart for Singapore with a core crew of 50 plus 3 trainees, plus a mission crew with berthing for 98. Additional crew above that level will again be bedded in the <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|R
25|$|In World War II, Germany used Milk Cow {{submarines}} {{to refuel}} its hunter U-boats in the Atlantic. As these boats {{were part of}} Kriegsmarine (Nazi Germany's navy), did carry light armaments (anti-aircraft guns), and never engaged in trade as such, they do not qualify as merchant submarines. However, they shared the large amounts of <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> compared to normal submarines of their day.|$|E
25|$|Indiana {{had a major}} refit {{with the}} {{installation}} of a triple-expansion steam engine to replace her original compound steam engine in 1891. The new engine, built and installed by James Howell of Glasgow, was smaller, allowing for more <b>cargo</b> <b>space,</b> and was more economical to run. At the same time, she was refitted to accommodate only intermediate and third class passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle was}} the second mass-produced hybrid on the American market, after the two-seat Honda Insight. While the larger Prius could seat five, its battery pack {{restricted}} <b>cargo</b> <b>space.</b> The vehicle interior featured a dash-mounted shift lever, and a small touch screen with a hybrid powertrain display. This feature showed the vehicle operation regarding the interplay between gasoline engine, battery pack, and electric motors, and could also show a bar graph of fuel economy results.|$|E
50|$|A {{cofferdam}} {{may also}} refer to an insulating space between two watertight bulkheads or decks within a ship. A cofferdam {{may be a}} void (empty) space or a ballast space. Cofferdams are usually employed to ensure oil or other chemicals do not leak into machinery spaces. If two different cargoes that react dangerously with each other are carried on the same vessel, one or more cofferdams are usually required between the <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the C-82, the cockpit was moved forward to fit flush with the nose rather than its previous location over the cargo compartment. This resulted in more usable <b>cargo</b> <b>space</b> and larger loads than the C-82 could accommodate. The C-119 also featured more powerful engines, and a wider and stronger airframe. The first C-119 prototype (called the XC-82B) first flew in November 1947, with deliveries of C-119Bs from Fairchild's Hagerstown, Maryland factory beginning in December 1949.|$|E
25|$|Between 1887 and 1891, {{all four}} ships {{of the class}} were {{refitted}} with smaller but more modern triple expansion steam engines, which were more economical to run and allowed for more <b>cargo</b> <b>space.</b> At the same time, all but Ohio were downgraded to carry only cabin- and steerage-class passengers. During the 1890s, the vessels operated {{a variety of different}} routes, sometimes under charter to the Red Star Line, including Antwerp–New York and Antwerp-Philadelphia, as well as their original Liverpool to Philadelphia route.|$|E
25|$|Turret deck ships had a low {{net tonnage}} (an {{approximate}} measure of <b>cargo</b> <b>space)</b> {{in comparison to}} their deadweight capacity (weight of cargo) allowing them to operate at a lower fee structure than a conventional hull. Net tonnage is a computation of volume, and the method of measurement used at the Suez Canal to determine tolls {{was based on a}} measure of net tonnage which excluded some of the cargo spaces of these unconventional hulls. Turret and trunk deck ships therefore paid less in tolls than conventional ships of the same capacity.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the sharp}} {{increase}} {{in the price of}} oil and the greater thermal efficiencies of diesel engines, these were the last two steam powered ships to be operated by Irish Shipping.Note:-Both of these vessels were acquired in the 1950s, not the 1960s the Poplar in 1956 and the Spruce in 1957, built to order for Irish Shipping, and had refrigerated <b>cargo</b> <b>spaces</b> for the carriage of frozen meat. They both survived to the early 1970s.|$|R
