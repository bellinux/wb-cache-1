The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987.

50|$|In <b>computer</b> <b>programming,</b> gene {{expression}} programming (GEP) is an evolutionary algorithm that creates <b>computer</b> <b>programs</b> or models. These <b>computer</b> <b>programs</b> are complex tree structures that learn and adapt by changing their sizes, shapes, and composition, {{much like a}} living organism. And like living organisms, the <b>computer</b> <b>programs</b> of GEP are also encoded in simple linear chromosomes of fixed length.

5|$|For instance, {{when one}} cell of a {{spreadsheet}} changes, {{it is necessary}} to recalculate the values of other cells that depend directly or indirectly on the changed cell. For this problem, the tasks to be scheduled are the recalculations of the values of individual cells of the spreadsheet. Dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell. In such a case, the value that is used must be recalculated earlier than the expression that uses it. Topologically ordering the dependency graph, and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates, allows the whole spreadsheet to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell. Similar problems of task ordering arise in makefiles for program compilation and instruction scheduling for low-level <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> optimization.|$|E
