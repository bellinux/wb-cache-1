5|$|The Sega CD {{received}} several variations during its lifetime, of which Sega constructed three. The original model utilized a front-loading motorized disc tray and sat underneath the Genesis. Sega later released the second {{model of the}} Sega CD, which was redesigned {{to sit next to}} the Genesis console and featured a top-loading disc tray in place of the motorized tray of the original model. In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released the Genesis CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console was a combination of the Genesis and Sega CD in one unit and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> <b>player.</b>|$|E
5|$|Continuing the {{tradition}} {{set by the}} first game, Wipeout 3 contains electronica offerings from various artists, including The Chemical Brothers, Orbital, and the Propellerheads. Psygnosis' development manager, Enda Carey, focused on bringing together music early in the game's development cycle, instead of as an afterthought or last-minute addition to the game. Unlike previous soundtracks, Psygnosis selected a single music director, DJ Sasha, who worked with artists to create a cohesive soundtrack. Sasha included several of his own tracks made specifically for the game. The game disc is a Mixed Mode CD that allows Wipeout 3s soundtrack to be played in a standard <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> <b>player.</b> To promote Wipeout 3 and its game music, Psygnosis sponsored a Global Underground tour for Sasha. Game pods featuring Wipeout 3 were placed at parties and venues, accompanied by a tie-in marketing campaign.|$|E

TV sets and VCR's accounted for two-thirds of sales that year. Later that year, Emerson Radio moved its headquarters to North Bergen, New Jersey, and acquired H.H. Scott, Inc., a company that manufactured high-fidelity audio and visual equipment. Products were sold under the Scott name until 1991, the year the line was discontinued.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, {{the base}} model was dropped {{in favor of}} a sedan version (replacing the 6000 which ended {{production}} the next year and the Canada-only Tempest), entering production on September 12, 1989. A notable introduction for the Grand Prix in 1990 is the new STE (Special Touring Edition) which replaced the STE model of the Pontiac 6000. In contrast to that model, it trades in all-wheel-drive for the available Turbo 3.1L V6. Standard features include a cassette stereo with equalizer and eight speakers (a <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> <b>player</b> was optional), remote keyless entry, eight-way power driver's seat with multiple lumbar and sidewing adjustments for both front seat occupants, and a compass/trip computer that was more informative than the units in the SE and turbo coupes. An LE sedan was also available for 1990, standard with a 2.3L Quad 4 engine and a 3-speed automatic, the first use of an inline 4 cylinder engine in a Grand Prix. The 2.8L V6 engine was discontinued, while the 3.1L engine gained widespread availability and a standard five-speed manual transmission.|$|E
500|$|Other {{improvements}} {{include the}} change to a manual [...] transmission with six forward speeds (instead of the previous four), and increased stability resulting from wider track axles than its predecessor. Leaf springs were replaced with modern coil spring suspension front and rear, and the Storm II features rear Dana 44 axles and front TJ Dana 30s, factory designed slip yoke eliminators, and the added safety of standard airbags.

2500|$|The first working laser was {{demonstrated}} on 16 May 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories. When first invented, {{they were called}} [...] "a solution looking for a problem". Since then, lasers have become a multibillion-dollar industry, finding utility in thousands of highly varied applications. The first application of lasers visible in {{the daily lives of}} the general population was the supermarket barcode scanner, introduced in 1974. The laserdisc player, introduced in 1978, was the first successful consumer product to include a laser, but the <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> <b>player</b> was the first laser-equipped device to become truly common in consumers' homes, beginning in 1982. These optical storage devices use a semiconductor laser less than a millimetre wide to scan the surface of the disc for data retrieval. Fibre-optic communication relies on lasers to transmit large amounts of information at the speed of light. Other common applications of lasers include laser printers and laser pointers. Lasers are used in medicine in areas such as bloodless surgery, laser eye surgery, and laser capture microdissection and in military applications such as missile defence systems, electro-optical countermeasures (EOCM), and lidar. Lasers are also used in holograms, bubblegrams, laser light shows, and laser hair removal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>players</b> {{have been}} on the market in more than two decades, and a {{majority}} of the involved control problems have been solved. However, there are still problems with playing <b>Compact</b> <b>Discs</b> related to surface faults like scratches and fingerprints. Two servo control loops are used to keep the Optical Pick-up Unit focused and radially on the information track of the <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc.</b> The problem is to design servo controllers which are well suited for handling surface faults which disturbs the position measurement and still react sufficiently against normal disturbances like mechanical shocks. In this paper a novel method called feature based control is presented. The method is based on a fault tolerant control scheme, which uses extracted features of the surface faults to remove those from the detector signals used for control during the occurrence of surface faults. The extracted features are Karhunen-Loève approximations of the surface faults. The performance of the feature based control scheme controlling <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Players</b> playing <b>Compact</b> <b>Discs</b> with surface faults have been validated by experimental work with positive conclusive results...|$|R
