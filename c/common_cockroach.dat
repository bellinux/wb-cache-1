Nevertheless, some topics have, if anything, become more indelicate than they were, and this is especially true of the discussion of income, of any discussion that tends, however remotely, to inquire, Who is it at the base of everything who really pays in blood and muscle and involuntary submissions for your freedom and magnificence? This, indeed, is almost the ultimate surviving indecency. So that it was with considerable private shame and discomfort that Lady Harman pursued even in her privacy the train of thought that Susan Burnet had set going. It had been conveyed into her mind long ago, and it had settled down there and grown into a sort of security, that the International Bread and Cake Stores were a very important contribution to Progress, and that Sir Isaac, outside the gates of his home, was a very useful and beneficial personage, and richly meriting a baronetcy. She hadn't particularly analyzed this persuasion, but she supposed him engaged in a kind of daily repetition, but upon modern scientific lines, of the miracle of the loaves and fishes, feeding a great multitude that would otherwise have gone hungry. She knew, too, from the advertisements that flowered about her path through life, that this bread in question was exceptionally clean and hygienic; whole front pages of the Daily Messenger, headed the [...] "Fauna of Small Bakehouses," [...] and adorned with a bordering of Blatta orientalis, the <b>common</b> <b>cockroach,</b> had taught her that, and she knew that Sir Isaac's passion for purity had also led to the Old Country Gazette's spirited and successful campaign for a non-party measure securing additional bakehouse regulation and inspection. And her impression had been that the growing and developing refreshment side of the concern was almost a public charity; Sir Isaac gave, he said, a larger, heavier scone, a bigger pat of butter, a more elegant teapot, ham more finely cut and less questionable pork-pies than any other system of syndicated tea-shops. She supposed that whenever he sat late at night going over schemes and papers, or when he went off for days together to Cardiff or Glasgow or Dublin, or such-like centres, or when he became preoccupied at dinner and whistled thoughtfully through his teeth, he was planning to increase the amount or diminish the cost of tea and cocoa-drenched farinaceous food in the stomachs of that section of our national adolescence which goes out daily into the streets of our great cities to be fed. And she knew his vans and catering were indispensable to the British Army upon its manoeuvres....|$|E

40|$|Cockroach {{allergen}} is a {{major risk}} factor for IgE-mediated allergic response and asthma in sensitized individuals. Serine pro-teases have been identified from various sources and characterized as major allergens. The present study was aimed to express and characterize recombinant allergen Per a 10 (rPer a 10) from Periplaneta americana. rPer a 10 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in soluble form, yielding 0. 75 mg/liter of culture. Homology of the Per a 10 protein sequence exhibited 27 to 38 % similarity to the mite serine protease and 41 to 52 % similarity to other insect trypsins. The purified rPer a 10 protein re-solved at 28 kDa on SDS-PAGE and was recognized by cockroach-hypersensitive patients ’ sera by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In competitive ELISA, rPer a 10 required 96 ng of purified protein for 50 % inhibition of IgE binding, whereas 34 ng of native protein (nPer a 10) was required for the same inhibition. rPer a 10 and nPer a 10 induced basophil histamine release {{in the range of}} 47 to 64 % and 60 to 85 %, respectively, when sensitized with cockroach-hypersensitive patients ’ sera. In conclusion, Per a 10 was subcloned, and the protein was purified to homogeneity. rPer a 10 showed reduced IgE binding and histamine release and showed no proteolytic activity. These data suggest that rPer a 10 has potential for immunotherapy.

40|$|Background: Cockroaches are {{of vital}} {{importance}} medically and hygienically {{as they can}} disperse human patho­genic agents and are especially responsible for food contamination and spreading of food borne pathogens. In this study, part of mtDNA-COI gene of five <b>common</b> pest <b>cockroaches</b> was tested for diagnostic and phylogenetic pur­poses. Methods: We have described barcode region of mtDNA-COI gene of five cockroach species: Blattella germanica, Blatta orientalis, Periplaneta americana, Shelfordella lateralis, and Supella longipalpa, along {{with the development of}} a PCR-RFLP method for rapid detection and differentiation of these health pest species. Results: The PCR generates a single 710 bp-sized amplicon in all cockroach specimens, followed by direct se­quencing. Alu I predicted from the sequencing data provided different RFLP profiles among five species. There was a significant intra-species variation within the American cockroach populations, but no genetic variation within other species. Accordingly, phylogenetic analysis demonstrates <b>common</b> monophyly for <b>cockroach</b> families in agreement with conventional taxonomy. However S. longipalpa (Ectobiidae) diverged as an early ancestor of other cockroaches and was not associated with other Ectobiidae. Conclusion: The PCR-RFLP protocol might be useful when the conventional taxonomic methods are not able to identify specimens, particularly when only small body parts of specimens are available or they are in a decaying condition. mtDNA-COI gene shows potentially useful for studying phylogenetic relationships of Blattodea order. </p...|$|R

500|$|There is a <b>common</b> {{misconception}} that <b>cockroaches</b> are serious vectors of disease.

40|$|Asthma is {{the most}} common chronic disease of childhood. Exposure to allergens plays an {{important}} role in asthma. Recently, cockroach has attracted attentions as an important allergen. This study was performed to evaluate cockroach allergy in Iranian children with asthma. One hundred children with definite diagnosis of asthma were selected. After obtaining primary information, the severity of their disease was determined according to their history, physical exam and measurement of PEFR (Peak Expiratory Flow Rate) with a mini peakflowmeter. Also, serum total IgE and blood eosinophil count were measured. The patients were skin prick tested with cockroach (Blattella germanica), trees, weeds, grasses, cats, mite, feather and common food allergens. According to cockroach skin prick test (SPT) results, the patients were divided into two groups (sensitive and non&# 8209;sensitive) and compared. Positive SPT for cockroach was detected in 29 % of patients. Cockroach sensitive group had a more severe asthma than non-sensitives (P< 0. 02). Also, asthmatic patients with cockroach allergy had perennial symptoms (P< 0. 05). A remarkable number of sensitive patients were born in winter (P< 0. 05). Eosinophilia was more common in sensitive group (P< 0. 02) and they had a higher level of serum total lgE (P< 0. 04). Prevalence of cockroach allergy was near to other <b>common</b> aeroallergens. <b>Cockroach</b> sensitive group had perennial symptoms, which is compatible with other indoor allergens. Cockroach allergy was more prevalent in children born in winter. Maybe these children are kept at home during their first months of life and are more exposed to cockroaches.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding {{the origin}} and {{diversification}} of organisms requires a good phylogenetic estimate of their age and diversification rates. This estimate {{can be difficult to}} obtain when samples are limited and fossil records are disputed, as in Dictyoptera. To choose among competing hypotheses of origin for dictyopteran suborders, we root a phylogenetic analysis (~ 800 taxa, 10 kbp) within a large selection of outgroups and calibrate datings with fossils attributed to lineages with clear synapomorphies. We find the following topology: (mantises, (other cockroaches, (Cryptocercidae, termites)). Our datings suggest that crown-Dictyop-tera—and stem-mantises—would date back to the Late Carboniferous (~ 300 Mya), a result compatible with the oldest putative fossil of stem-dictyoptera. Crown-mantises, however, would be much more recent (~ 200 Mya; Triassic/Jurassic boundary). This pattern (i. e., old origin and more recent diversification) suggests a scenario of replacement in carnivory among polyneopterous insects. The most recent <b>common</b> ancestor of (<b>cockroaches</b> + termites) would date back to the Permian (~ 275 Mya), which contradicts the hypothesis of a Devonian origin of cockroaches. Stem-termites would date back to the Triassic/Jurassic boundary, which refutes a Triassic origin. We suggest directions in extant and extinct species sampling to sharpen this chronological framework and dictyopteran evolutionary studies...|$|R
