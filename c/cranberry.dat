5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are at {{increased}} risk for urinary tract infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction. It is {{the most common cause of}} infection in this population, as well as the most common cause of hospitalization. Additionally, use of <b>cranberry</b> juice or <b>cranberry</b> supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E
5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that <b>cranberry</b> (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of UTIs in those with frequent infections. A Cochrane review concluded that the benefit, if it exists, is small. Long-term tolerance is also an issue with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30%. <b>Cranberry</b> juice is thus not currently recommended for this indication. As of 2015, probiotics require further study {{to determine if they}} are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Clan badge: There {{have been}} two clan badges (or plant badges) {{attributed}} to Clan MacAulay: <b>cranberry</b> and scots pine. Both clans MacAulay and MacFarlane have been attributed with a badge of <b>cranberry.</b> Clan MacFarlane, also a west-Dumbartonshire clan, claims a descent from Alwyn II, Earl of Lennox.

50|$|Many home {{recipes for}} dried <b>cranberries</b> involve {{allowing}} the <b>cranberries</b> to sit overnight {{in a water}} and sugar solution, prior to freeze-drying or air-drying.

5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} {{for nearly three}} decades to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving a ghost town in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's <b>cranberry</b> harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal would harm <b>cranberry</b> harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid potential damage to the <b>cranberry</b> crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely impervious to water.|$|E

50|$|Dried <b>cranberries</b> {{can be used}} as an {{addition}} in various foods including salads, oatmeal, cookies, muffins, loaves, breads and trail mix. They can act as a direct replacement for raisins or any dried fruit.Because dried <b>cranberries</b> are a dried fruit, spoilage is less of a concern than for fresh fruit. Dried <b>cranberries</b> can be a useful product to carry while traveling because of their extended shelf life.|$|R

5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed {{during the first}} few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of <b>cranberry</b> products for treating current infections.|$|E

50|$|Dried <b>cranberries</b> {{contain the}} same {{nutrients}} as fresh <b>cranberries</b> (notably dietary fiber and antioxidants). However, commercial drying processes substantially reduce the vitamin A and vitamin C content. The nutrient density is also reduced if sugar is added.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cranberries</b> {{for fresh}} market {{are stored in}} shallow bins or boxes with {{perforated}} or slatted bottoms, which deter decay by allowing air to circulate. Because harvest occurs in late autumn, <b>cranberries</b> for fresh market are frequently stored in thick walled barns without mechanical refrigeration. Temperatures are regulated by opening and closing vents in the barn as needed. <b>Cranberries</b> destined for processing are usually frozen in bulk containers shortly after arriving at a receiving station.|$|R
50|$|Typically 2-10% {{of fruit}} in diseased beds is {{infected}} and becomes unmarketable. Wisconsin {{is the largest}} producer of <b>cranberries</b> in the United States (it is Wisconsin's state fruit). In 2010, Wisconsin produced 3.96 million barrels of <b>cranberries,</b> representing nearly 60% of the nation's crop. <b>Cranberries</b> contribute nearly $300 million annually in Wisconsin, and support approximately 3,400 jobs in the state. Even relatively small amounts of cottonball infections can have a dramatic effect on producers' incomes.|$|R

5|$|In September 1998, Odwalla {{began to}} sell energy bars made with fruit and grains, named food bars, as an {{alternative}} to its drinks in an attempt to raise revenue following the 1996 E.coli outbreak. The first three flavors released were <b>Cranberry</b> Citrus, Organic Carrot & Raisin, and Peach Crunch, all three of which are now discontinued. Within eight weeks of their release, the Odwalla Bar was one of the top-selling energy bar brands in the market. The bars {{come in a variety of}} flavors, and weigh 2 ounces (56grams) per bar. As of 2001, before Odwalla was acquired by Coca-Cola, food bars accounted for less than five percent of Odwalla's revenue.|$|E
5|$|NY333 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with CR11 and CR24 in Risingville, an isolated hamlet within the Steuben County town of Thurston. It headed eastward, following Michigan Creek along {{the base of}} a valley surrounding the waterway. Due to the terrain of the area, NY333 intersected only a handful of roads, one of which was <b>Cranberry</b> Lake Road (CR2), a north–south highway that met NY333 midway between the hamlets of Risingville and Thurston. The route continued onward, turning northeastward toward Thurston Pond and the small hamlet of Thurston at {{the eastern edge of the}} small lake. Here, NY333 curved back to the east as it met Savona–Thurston Road (CR12) in the western half of the community.|$|E

5|$|Before the AirTrain was completed, {{there were}} already plans to extend it to Manhattan. Between September 2003 and April 2004, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the MTA, the Port Authority, and the New York City Economic Development Corporation {{conducted}} a feasibility study on the Lower Manhattan–Jamaica/JFK Transportation Project. This project would use the LIRR's Atlantic Branch to Downtown Brooklyn and a tunnel to Lower Manhattan. This would provide faster service to JFK via a one-seat ride and LIRR service to Lower Manhattan via a transfer at Jamaica (i.e. the same plan proposed by the RPA in 1999). Under this proposal, baggage could be checked in Manhattan and transferred directly to planes at the airport. The study examined several alternatives, including using the existing <b>Cranberry</b> Street Tunnel or Montague Street Tunnel under the East River, or building an entirely new cross-river tunnel. The project was halted in 2008 before an environmental impact statement could be created.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} that Gates was there, {{research}} focused mainly on honey production, brood diseases, wax extraction and horticultural pollination in the cucumber and <b>cranberry</b> industries. From 1913 to 1920 the laboratory was also operated by a superintendent, John L. Byard, hired on by Gates to maintain the facilities {{from day to day}} as well as perform wax extractions and other services to beekeepers from around the state. Following Gates' resignation in 1918, the school ceased to offer its summer beekeeping school, many of its state extension services, and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R. Shaw as the new professor of beekeeping in 1931. With Shaw's retirement in 1969, the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical entomology research, with the former beekeeping program falling into relative obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Past here, Route 70 {{loses the}} Marlton Pike name and {{continues}} east into the heavily wooded Pine Barrens. It passes {{to the south}} of the Leisuretowne retirement village before entering predominantly rural areas, with two fire lanes paralleling the road on either side. Route 70 eventually turns slightly to the northeast and forms the border between Southampton Township to the north and Woodland Township to the south. Along this borderline, the route comes to the Four Mile Circle, where it intersects the western terminus of Route 72 as well as CR 644 and CR 646. Past the traffic circle, Route 70 becomes the border between Pemberton Township to the north and Woodland Township to the south. The road passes {{to the south of}} the wooded Presidential Lakes Estates residential development before turning northeast through more of the Pine Barrens entirely within Pemberton Township. The road passes near some <b>cranberry</b> bogs before intersecting CR 530. At this intersection, CR 530 heads east concurrent with Route 70.|$|E
