40|$|Evidence is {{increasing}} that brain {{areas that are}} responsible for action planning and execution are activated during the information processing of action-related verbs (e. g., pick or kick). To obtain further evidence, we conducted three experiments to see if <b>constraining</b> arm <b>posture,</b> which could disturb the motor planning and imagery for that arm, would lead to delayed judgment of verbs referring to arm actions. In all experiments, native Japanese speakers judged as quickly as possible whether the presented object and the verb would be compatible (e. g., ball-throw) or not (e. g., ball-pour). <b>Constrained</b> arm <b>posture</b> was introduced to the task by asking participants to keep both hands behind their back. Two types of verbs were used: manual action verbs (i. e., verbs referring to actions performed on an object by a human hand) and non-manual action verbs.

50|$|Active or dynamic sitting is the {{opposite}} of static sitting. Static sitting occurs when seating is rigid, and results in sustained mechanical tissue loading. The bodily strain occurring with traditional rigid seating is widely thought to contribute to negative health effects. The human body is not well adapted for long hours spent sitting in a restrictive or <b>constrained</b> <b>posture.</b> In static sitting, the abdominal muscles may instinctively relax and even atrophy over prolonged periods of lessened physical activity. Furthermore, the prolonged postural loading of the spine while sitting, without natural movement and mobilization of the spinal joints, can reduce joint lubrication and increase stiffness, which can be detrimental to back health. Circulation, particularly of the legs, can be adversely affected as well. In fact, back pain and circulation discomfort are part of a growing avalanche of complaints which can be attributed in part to extensive static sitting. Additionally, sustained postures at a computer can place the upper back and neck muscles into positions of strain that, when combined with stress factors, contribute to muscle tension and resulting pain. The field of ergonomics recognizes that only in recent history is {{a large proportion of the}} human population sitting for long periods with little movement. The rising number of office jobs, as well as driving, contributes to the increased amount of static sitting that occurs.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} of chronic musculoskeletal disorders, such as {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} and wrist tendinitis, to prolonged alphanumeric keyboard use is controversial. Known risk-factors for these disorders, such as repetition of task, forceful exertions, awkward joint postures, direct mechanical pressure, and prolonged <b>constrained</b> <b>posture,</b> may be applicable to keyboard use. In this study fingertip forces were measured for 10 typists using three alphanumeric keyboards that differed only in their key force and displacement characteristics. While subjects typed, peak fingertip force was collected for each keystroke using strain gauge load cells. The mean peak fingertip forces applied by all subjects for all keys for the three keyboards were 193 gm, 182 gm and 220 gm; significantly different means. The 18 % reduction in fingertip force in the second keyboard compared with the third is attributed to a higher minimum force of activation and a higher force at total key travel in the third keyboard. This study indicates that keyboard key force-displacement characteristics can be altered to reduce the fingertip forces applied by typists and theoretically this may {{reduce the risk of}} developing chronic musculoskeletal disorders...|$|E
40|$|In a {{questionnaire}} survey {{the prevalence of}} back pain in 163 helicopter pilots was compared {{to that in a}} control group of 297 non-flying air force officers who underwent the same pre-employment medical examination. Since pilots document their hours of flight in a personal flight log, an accurate estimate of the duration of exposure could be made. In addition, vibration levels of the helicopters were measured and an accumulative vibration dose was calculated for each pilot. 'Transient' back pain of a short duration was more frequent amongst the pilots compared to the control group, and the prevalence of 'chronic' back pain of a persistent nature was also higher amongst the helicopter pilots. Transient back pain seemed to be most strongly related to the average hours of flight per day, whereas chronic back pain was more closely related to total hours of flight or the accumulative vibration dose. A significant higher prevalence of this chronic back pain was observed only after 2000 hours of flight or a vibration dose of 400 m 2 h/s 4.

40|$|Repetitive {{work and}} work in <b>constrained</b> <b>postures</b> are risk factors for {{developing}} musculoskeletal disorders. Low-cost, user-friendly technical methods to quantify these risks are needed. The aims were to validate inclination angles and velocities of one model of {{the new generation of}} accelerometers with integrated data loggers against a previously validated one, and to compare meaurements when using a plain reference posture with that of a standardized one. All mean (n = 12 subjects) angular RMS-differences in 4 work tasks and 4 body parts were < 2. 5 ° and all mean median angular velocity differences < 5. 0 °/s. The mean correlation between the inclination signal-pairs was 0. 996. This model of the new generation of triaxial accelerometers proved to be comparable to the validated accelerometer using a data logger. This makes it well-suited, for both researchers and practitioners, to measure postures and movements during work.

40|$|The {{visual display}} {{terminal}} (VDT) {{is an integral part}} of the modern office. An issue of concern associated with the use of the VDT is maintaining privacy of on-screen materials. Privacy filters are products designed to restrict the viewing angle to documents displayed on a VDT, so that the on-screen material is not visible to persons other than the VDT operator. Privacy filters restrict the viewing angle either by diffraction or diffusion of the light emitted from the VDT. <b>Constrained</b> <b>posture</b> is a human factors engineering problem that has been associated with VDT use. The purpose of this research was to evaluate whether the use of privacy filters affected: 1) the restriction of postures associated with VDT use, 2) operator performance, and 3) subjective ratings of display issues, posture, and performance. Nine participants performed three types of tasks: word processing, data entry, and Web browsing. Each task was performed under three filter conditions: no filter, diffraction filter, and diffusion filter.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{experiment}} was to investigate the effects of a neutral preparation during the foreperiod on motor and postural programming processes in a voluntary upper limb movement. The foreperiod duration (300, 500, 700 and 900 ms) and the postural condition (sitting vs standing) were manipulated using a neutral preparation (no advanced information during the preparatory signal). Thirteen subjects performed a raising arm movement with 1 kg load at the wrist. Premotor time, latency of the anticipatory postural adjustments and the vertical torque were calculated. A previous experiment showed that the optimal foreperiod duration (i. e. leading to the shortest premotor time) increased from sitting to standing in a selective preparation (Cuisinier et al. in Brain Res Bull 66 (2) : 163 - 170, 2005). The present experiment replicated this finding in a neutral preparation. It was found that (1) this optimal foreperiod duration still increased from 500 ms in sitting to 700 ms in standing in a neutral preparation, (2) this increased optimal foreperiod duration resulted from a greater level of alertness necessary to control a more <b>constrained</b> <b>posture</b> in standing than in sitting, and (3) the existence of a temporal modulation in the central organization of the postural and focal commands was according to the foreperiod duration...|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{continuous}} development of production systems work-related musculoskeletal disorders is still a large problem. One reason might be the difficulties in quantifying the ergonomic effects of interventions. In this paper ergonomic consequences of technical and organisational changes were quantified in a plant for producing slats for parquet flooring. Muscle activity, work postures and movements were assessed for neck/shoulders and upper limb by direct technical measurements at three generations of production lines. The physical workload for 31 operators at the manual, semi-automated and automated line was derived based on all existing work tasks. The work was characterised by moderate muscular loads, the 50 th percentiles being 1. 2 - 3. 8 %MVE for the neck/shoulder muscles, high repetitiveness and constant movements of the hands and a high prevalence of neck/shoulder disorders. There were statistically significant differences considering exposure levels between the work tasks within each line {{as well as between}} the lines. The semi-automated line implied reduced muscular load for all muscles registered but more <b>constrained</b> work <b>postures.</b> The automated line, on the other hand, required higher skills, offered less <b>constrained</b> <b>postures,</b> lower loads and repetitiveness for the hands as well as frequent changes between different physical load levels. Relevance to industry: When designing or redesigning production systems, technical solutions are often used to obtain 'beneficial' ergonomic conditions, implying a strive for low physical workloads. However, there is a risk that this might lead to more constrained physical activities. Possibilities for job enlargement must be thoroughly utilised. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Firstly, 12 participants wearing six reflective markers completed a surgery simulation using all three displays, and their sagittal planes were video recorded. Secondly, randomly selected frames were captured and coordinates calculated in Matlab.

40|$|Proactive {{ergonomics}} {{is generally}} considered to be a more efficient and cost effective way of designing working environments than reactive ergonomics. It often requires preemptively selecting working postures and forces to reduce potential injury risk. One major issue with proactive ergonomic design is correctly identifying the true manual forces that will be required of a worker to complete defined tasks. Typically, these forces are represented as in direct opposition to the forces required by a particular task. However, this is likely an oversimplification as forces often act in different directions than the task-required direction to increase required force level, enhance balance and reduce joint moments, depending on specific experimental conditions. This study aims to quantify these off-axis forces as they change with different required on-axis force intensities. This thesis evaluated the effects of force intensity on the presence of off-axis forces across four conditions, which included free and constrained postures, and with and without off-axis force. Eighteen female subjects performed static, unilateral, manual pushing and pulling exertions while seated and were limited to force contributions from the right upper extremity. Hand forces and location of bony landmarks were collected from each subject and force intensity consisted of both maximal and submaximal levels (5 % to 50 % of the maximum producible on-axis force in increments of 5 %). All principle direction forces were scaled to the on-axis force level and anatomically relevant joint moments scaled to the maximum capacity joint moment. The main objective {{of this study was to}} analyze off-axis force production as force intensity was increased under various constraint conditions. The highest maximum on-axis force was in the fully free condition (off-axis force allowed and posture unconstrained) and as conditions became more constrained for both pushing and pulling exertions, maximum on-axis force production decreased (p=< 0. 0001). For submaximal exertions in the free posture, participants used off-axis forces to target the shoulder flexion-extension moment by pushing increasingly upwards (p= 0. 0122) and to the left by 5. 6 % on-axis (p= 0. 0025), and by pulling 12. 6 % on-axis downward (p=< 0. 0001) and 4. 7 % on-axis rightward (p= 0. 0024) compared to when off-axis force was not allowed. When comparing the free to the <b>constrained</b> <b>posture</b> while allowing off-axis force, participants pushed downwards instead of upwards by a difference of 12. 9 % on-axis (p= 0. 0002) and pulled less downward (becoming slightly upward) by an increasing difference (p= 0. 0002) and from decreasing to increasing rightward (p= 0. 0006). These changes in off-axis force showed a unifying strategy of using less shoulder flexion-extension strength by targeting wrist and elbow moments for pushing and pulling exertions. When in the <b>constrained</b> <b>posture</b> allowing and not allowing off-axis force resulted in more internal elbow flexion (p= 0. 0003) moment during pushing, and less internal shoulder flexion (p= 0. 0092), more internal shoulder adduction (p= 0. 0252), more to less internal elbow supination (p= 0. 0415), and increasingly less internal wrist flexion (p= 0. 0296) moments during pulling, which verified previously observed strategies. Finally, for both maximal and submaximal exertions, pulling was more sensitive to changes in off-axis forces compared to pushing which was more sensitive to postural flexibility. In conclusion, the underlying principles as to how and why off-axis forces change provides valuable knowledge to ergonomists so that they can more accurately predict force production in workplace design, ultimately reducing the potential for injury...|$|E
40|$|The {{cause of}} {{low back pain}} in populations of {{professional}} drivers is uncertain. A literature review revealed factors {{that seem to be}} associated with low back pain (e. g. physical factors: exposure to whole body-vibration, prolonged sitting posture, frequent lifting, pushing and pulling, lack of physical fitness; psychosocial factors: job satisfaction or stress; individual factors: age, gender, anthropometrics, tobacco, alcohol consumption, etc.). This thesis investigates the occurrence of back pain in professional car drivers – a group found to be not focussed upon in previous epidemiological studies. The thesis seeks to advance understanding of response relationships between risk factors and low back pain in populations of car drivers (209 taxi drivers and 365 police drivers) and 485 non-drivers. A longitudinal study with cross-sectional baseline combined with field measurement of driving in selected vehicles was performed to investigate the occurrence of musculoskeletal problems (mainly low back pain) and the relationship between risk factors and low back pain experienced for at least one day during the past 12 months in the two populations of professional drivers (taxi drivers and police drivers) and professional non-drivers. The cross-sectional baseline of the longitudinal study revealed that 45 % (38. 3 - 51. 7 %) of taxi drivers, 53 % (48 - 58. 6 %) of police drivers and 46 % (41 - 50. 1 %) of police non-drivers reported low back pain for at least one day during the past 12 -months (p = 0. 09). The prevalence of low back pain in the non-driving population of police employees fell within prevalence range reported by professional car drivers in this study and in previous epidemiological studies. The cross-sectional study revealed risk factors associated with the prevalence of low back pain (i. e., stature, previous physical demands, increased psychosomatic distress, daily and cumulative driving in taxi drivers; age, lifting, bending, increase psychosomatic distress in police drivers; stature, bending, increased psychosomatic distress in police non-drivers). Measurements of whole-body vibration in selected taxi and police vehicles revealed frequencyweighted accelerations in the dominant vibration direction (i. e., z-axis) to be 0. 47 ms- 2 r. m. s. in taxi vehicles and 0. 58 ms- 2 r. m. s. in police vehicles. A study of cumulative exposure to whole-body vibration in a group of taxi drivers pointed to a possible overestimation of their self-estimated duration of vibration exposure by 31 % on average. The longitudinal study revealed a lower incidence of low back pain in taxi drivers than in both police drivers and police non-drivers (p = 0. 02). The difference might be attributed to a different approach to low back pain in taxi drivers who lose income if unable to work. An alternative explanation for increased low back pain among police employees could be that taxi drivers with low back pain leave their profession and were excluded from the follow-up study – a healthy worker effect. The longitudinal study revealed that increased psychosomatic distress was a risk factor associated with the development of new episodes of low back pain in all three of the studied populations (i. e. taxi drivers and police drivers and non-drivers). In police drivers, increased daily duration of driving was a risk factor for the development of low back pain. Although the results point to increased incidence of low back pain with increasing duration of daily driving, non-drivers were at a similar risk of developing of low back pain. Plausible explanations for this finding include ergonomic factors that were present for both the drivers and the non-drivers (e. g., the duration of sitting or duration in a <b>constrained</b> <b>posture)</b> and the presence of other risk factors not investigated in the study but associated with increased incidence of low back pain in non-drivers.

40|$|Background: The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the biomechanical exposure to the trapezius muscle activity in female weavers for a prolonged period in the workstation A (suggested by previous studies) and workstation B (proposed by the present study). Methods: Electromyography {{data were collected from}} nine females during four hours for each ergonomically designed workstation at the Ergonomics Laboratory, Hamadan, Iran. The design criteria for ergonomically designed workstations were: 1) weaving height (20 and 3 cm above elbow height for workstations A and B, respectively), and 2) seat type (10 ° and 0 ° forwardsloping seat for workstations A and B, respectively). Results: The amplitude probability distribution function (APDF) analysis showed that the left and right upper trapezius muscle activity was almost similar at each workstation. Trapezius muscle activity in the workstation A was significantly greater than workstations B (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: In general, use of workstation B leads to significantly reduced muscle activity levels in the upper trapezius as compared to workstation A in weavers. Despite the positive impact of workstation B in reducing trapezius muscle activity, it seems that <b>constrained</b> <b>postures</b> of the upper arm during weaving may be associated with musculoskeletal symptoms...|$|R

Manual scaling and machinery (use of ultrasonic scaling and hand-pieces) showed higher loads on the trapezius muscles, regarding muscular rest, as well as the 10 th and 50 th percentiles, than the other tasks, and for the forearm extensor muscles, an almost complete lack of muscular rest (0. 1 % time), and much higher loads regarding the 10 th and 50 th percentiles. Further, more pronounced head flexion and lower head and upper arm velocities were found, indicating more <b>constrained</b> <b>postures</b> for the neck and shoulders for the manual scaling and machinery. Use of ultrasonic scaler reduced the 50 th percentile loads on the right forearm extensor muscles, but had no effect on the fraction of muscular rest and on the 10 th percentile load.

40|$|BACKGROUND: All {{around the}} world, {{there is a}} rising trend of {{computer}} use among young children especially at home; yet the computer furniture is usually not designed specifically for children's use. In Hong Kong, this creates an even greater problem as most people live in very small apartments in high-rise buildings. Most of the past research literature is focused on computer use in children in the school environment and not about the home setting. OBJECTIVE: The present pilot study aimed to examine ergonomic issues in children's use of computers at home in Hong Kong, which has some unique home environmental issues. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen children (six male, nine female) aged 8 - 11 years and their parents were recruited by convenience sampling. METHODS: Participants {{were asked to provide}} information on their computer use habits and related musculoskeletal symptoms. Participants were photographed when sitting at the computer workstation in their usual postures and joint angles were measured. RESULTS: The participants used computers frequently for less than two hours daily and the majority shared their workstations with other family members. Computer furniture was designed more for adult use and a mismatch of furniture and body size was found. Ergonomic issues included inappropriate positioning of the display screen, keyboard, and mouse, as well as lack of forearm support and suitable backrest. These led to awkward or <b>constrained</b> <b>postures</b> while some postural problems may be habitual. Three participants reported neck and shoulder discomfort in the past 12 months and 4 reported computer-related discomfort.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken into occupational overuse injuries. Overuse injuries are {{commonly associated with}} repetitive movements, sustained or <b>constrained</b> <b>postures,</b> and forceful movements. Other factors, such as work environment, amount of keyboard use, and the ergonomic status of the work area, {{have been identified as}} elements in the development of overuse injuries. These perspectives were used to provide research objectives in studying a sample of subjects working in the newspaper industry. Five hundred and seventy five respondents completed a questionnaire, which included a measure of the incidence and severity of overuse injuries, and questions aimed at discovering the effectiveness of different types of treatment and intervention strategies. Using a combination of descriptive and bivariate statistics, this data was analyzed. The analysis revealed low levels of reported muscular aches and pains. Of those subjects who did report some form of ache or pain, the majority answered that the level of their aches and pains had remained the same. As well, the image of the aetiology of overuse injuries which emerged, was in contradiction to much of the proceeding research in this area. The analysis also demonstrated that the treatment and intervention strategies being employed were ineffective. This was despite the fact that subjects often reported that they considered a particular strategy to be productive in managing their overuse injury. In the discussion section, the limitations of the questionnaire as a survey technique in this area of research was considered, and the possible effects these limitations have on the present study. This point has special relevance to the application of clinical models of overuse injury. It was concluded that the results demonstrated a need for research into effectively manipulating working conditions to counter-act the development, incidence and severity of overuse injuries. Such strategies as job enlargement and job rotation were suggested...|$|R

For environments in which arm posture had a large effect on tracking accuracy, the self-selected postures oriented the direction of maximal endpoint stiffness towards the direction of the unstable haptic environment. These results demonstrate how changes in arm posture can have a dramatic effect on task performance and suggest that postural selection is a fundamental mechanism by which kinematic redundancies can be exploited to regulate arm stiffness in unconstrained tasks...|$|R

The preventive measures included improvement of working environment, exercises at work breaks, medical advice to the workers with severe LBP and decreasing overtime work brought by change in the economic situations at enterprises. Results were as follows : (1) Point, period (a month) prevalence rates and prevalence rate of severe LBP and absence days due to LBP (deducted absence days in a year) were all significantly lower than those of 10 years ago. (2) Onset of LBP among young workers were mainly chronic, which is closely related to heavy lifting and <b>constrained</b> working <b>postures</b> such as bending and squatting etc. (3) Absence from work due to LBP was related to work years, severity of LBP and level of job satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Much {{research}} has been done on interventions to reduce work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) at the workplace. However, this problem is still a major concern in working life. The economic cost for WMSDs corresponds to between 0. 5 % and 2 % of the gross national product in some European countries, and in 2007, 8. 6 % of workers in the EU had experienced work-related health problems during the previous 12 months. In Sweden, one in five of all employees have rated occurrence of WMSDs during the previous 12 months. In spite of comprehensive ergonomic improvements of workplace and tool design in dentistry the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in neck, upper arms and back is reported to be between 64 % and 93 %. The present thesis investigates if the perceived high exertion during work corresponds to actual physical exposures. Further, it is investigated if risk full physical exposures may be generated due to rationalisations. Specifically, changes in physical exposures are investigated prospectively during a period of rationalisations. Empirical data on production system performance, individual measured physical workload, and self-rated physical workload are provided. High estimates of self-rated workload were found. These high scores for perceived workload were associated with high measured muscular workload in the upper trapezius muscles. Also, negative correlations were found between low angular velocities in the head, neck and upper extremities on the one hand, and estimates for perceived workload on the other. Both measured muscular workload and mechanical exposure among dentists indicate a higher risk of developing WMSDs than in occupational groups with more varied work content. Value-Adding Work (VAW) comprised about 57 % of the total working time and compared to industrial work an increase with about 20 percent units is hypothesised. Furthermore, VAW compared to non-VAW (“waste”) implies more awkward postures and especially low angular velocities interpreted as <b>constrained</b> <b>postures.</b> Consequently, when increasing the proportion of time spent in VAW due to rationalisations, work intensification is expected. However, at follow up, we did not find such work intensification. Previous research indicates that rationalisation in working life may be a key factor in the development of WMSD. The present thesis suggests that ergonomics may then be considered proactively as part of the rationalisation process...|$|R
2500|$|From {{at least}} the late Republic onward, the toga became {{increasingly}} unsuited to manual work or physically active leisure. It was expensive, heavy, hot and sweaty, hard to keep clean, costly to launder and challenging to wear. A toga worn correctly <b>constrained</b> both <b>posture</b> and gait; it was best suited to stately processions, oratory, sitting in the theatre or circus, and displaying oneself before one's peers and inferiors while [...] "ostentatiously doing nothing" [...] at salutationes. These early morning, formal [...] "greeting sessions" [...] were {{an essential part of}} Roman life, in which clients attended their patrons, competing for favours or investment in business ventures. A client who dressed well and correctly - in his toga, if a citizen - showed respect for himself and his patron, and might stand out among the crowd.

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research into musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) {{they continue to}} plague workers. Manual materials handling (MMH), in particular the concurrence of load manipulation and awkward body posture, {{has been identified as}} a key factor in the onset of MSDs. Only a few studies have looked at the interaction between manipulation tasks and working posture during assembly tasks and as a result their relationship has not been widely explored. Assessing the stresses resulting from individual task factors and body posture in isolation and adding them together may be too simplified to estimate an overall risk profile, since this {{does not take into account}} that there may be a non-linear interaction in strain responses when manipulation task and body posture interact. Therefore, the present study investigated biophysical, physiological and psychophysical responses to combined tasks, rather than individual tasks of body posture and manipulative tasks. The objective of the research was to establish the interactive effects of <b>constrained</b> body <b>postures</b> and manipulative tasks and to identify whether a cumulative or compensatory reaction occurs during this interaction. Nine conditions were assessed in a laboratory setting, which included combinations of three working postures (standing, sitting and stooping) and three assembly tasks (torque wrenching, precision and no task). Thirty-six subjects were required to complete all nine conditions, with each condition lasting ninety seconds. Muscle activity was recorded for seven muscles from the upper extremity, trunk and lower extremity regions and was complemented by physiological (heart rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation, oxygen consumption, energy expenditure and breathing frequency) and psychophysical (body discomfort) data. At the completion of all nine conditions subjects completed a retrospective psychophysical rating questionnaire pertaining to discomfort felt during the conditions. Responses obtained for the different task and posture combinations revealed compensatory reactions (additive > combined) for most of the conditions assessed for the biomechanical and physiological responses. In the majority of cases for muscle activity, no significant differences were found between the combined and the additive effects (p < 0. 05), while for the physiological responses there were mostly significant differences observed. Psychophysical responses indicated that there was a significant difference overall between the additive and combined effects. The results of this study demonstrate that in order to identify risk areas, manipulation tasks and <b>constrained</b> working <b>postures</b> may be considered either in isolation and added together (additive) or as a combined task, since there were very few significant differences observed between these two effects. Further studies are required, however, to provide conclusive evidence. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Quay crane {{operators}} are specialized in moving containers {{to and from}} vessels while adopting <b>constrained</b> sitting <b>postures</b> for prolonged periods (4 – 6 consecutive hours) in a very challenging environment. Thus, {{they are exposed to}} discomfort or pain that may result in deterioration of their performance with consequent reduction of operational safety levels. Such discomfort can be indirectly and partially assessed by measuring contact pressure at the body-seat interface. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the feasibility, usefulness, and effectiveness of monitoring the variations in seat-body interface pressure during a regular work shift of 4 hours performed in a simulated environment. METHODS: Eight professional operators performed a four-hour shift in a realistic control station set inside a quay crane simulator. Seat-body contact pressures were measured at 10 Hz using two pressure-sensitive mats placed on the seat pan and the backrest. Raw pressure data were processed to extract pressure vs. time curves related to the whole seat surface and, for the seat pan only, values associated with four anatomical regions (i. e. left and right thighs and buttocks). RESULTS: During the work shift, the mean backrest pressure was low and fairly constant. Seat pan pressure increased by 10...|$|R
40|$|Introduction:Cervicogenic {{tinnitus}} is a {{not generally}} accepted pathogenetic subtype, {{which might be}} subsumed under the concept of somatosensory tinnitus. After the personal experience of therapy resistant tinnitus in context with a cervical pain syndrome (CS) and successful add-on treatment with cervical collar (CC), the idea was persued in several individual treatments in patients. Patients and Methods:Reporting one particular case with chronic tinnitus considered untreatable, but rapidly improved with CC use. Thereafter tinnitus was experimentally replicated by head inclination, the respective neck-head angles and cerebral blood flow measured. Results:Chronic subjective tinnitus of a 20 years duration completely disappeared within 4 weeks with an intermittent short time application of CC. Thereafter, tinnitus was liberately again induced by head inclination, set on with anterior tilt of 14 °, reaching maximum strength by 23 °. Tinnitus stopped with return to neutral head position. Blood flow in the vertebral arteries on both sides was unchanged during head inclination with prevalent tinnitus, however blood flow was physiologically reduced with head rotation though not accompanied by tinnitus. Discussion:In a single case of chronic tinnitus, we found that treatment with CC rapidly led to full remission. Nevertheless, tinnitus could be resumed by <b>constrained</b> head <b>postures.</b> Experimental tinnitus replication by inclination points to an underscored role of upper posterior cervical muscle groups, matching with animal experiments, working in concert with other triggers including psychological factors. Blood flow reduction in vertebral arteries was unrelated to tinnitus...|$|R
40|$|It was {{clarified}} that energy-efficient dynamic bipedal walking can {{be achieved}} by effectively applying the principle of passive dynamic walking. Approaches based on virtual gravity are typical methods for generating efficient level dynamic gait. These methods, however, had the problem that the specified control input includes a singular point which causes complicated motion. This paper then proposes a new method, which is termed as the pseudo virtual passive dynamic walking, to solve this problem. We first formulate the basic method for a planar underactuated biped model with an upper body by introducing the concept of pseudo center of mass. We also consider to inhibit swing-leg retraction by <b>constraining</b> the impact <b>posture</b> to achieve the maximum efficiency condition. In addition, we discovered that the constraint on impact posture strongly extends the stable domain and improves the convergence speed to the steady gait through numerical simulations. We report the detailed analysis results and theoretically investigate how the constraint affects the gait properties...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMuch of {{our current}} {{understanding}} of human prehension in a comparative context is based on macaque models in a sitting, <b>constrained</b> body <b>posture.</b> In a previous study, we clearly showed differences in the amplitude of the forelimb joints between five primate species (lemur, capuchin, chimpanzee, gorilla and human) during unconstrained grasping where the animals were free to choose their body posture. One of our interrogations was to know if these differences {{could be due to}} the body posture. To address this question, this study compares humans with new data for gorillas during an unconstrained food prehension task in two body postures, a sitting and a quadrupedal one. The objective is to determine the behavioral and kinematic strategies (amplitudes and patterns of evolution of the articular angles) as well as differences and invariants of trunk and forelimb motions between species. The subjects were recorded by five cameras, and landmarks were digitized frame by frame to reconstruct 3 D movement. Our results show that (1) despite significant influences of body postures on ranges of motion in gorillas and humans, species preserve their specific forelimb joint and trunk contribution; (2) body posture has a limited effect on the basic pattern of wrist velocity. Our study indicates that different primate species have specific kinematic features of limb coordination during prehension, which dose not alter with changes in posture. Therefore, across varying species, it is possible to compare limb kinematics irrespective of postural constraints and unconstrained condition need to be explored in other primates to understand the evolution of primate prehension...|$|R
