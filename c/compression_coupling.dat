Estimation of {{intracranial}} {{stress distribution}} caused by mass effect {{is critical to}} the management of hemorrhagic stroke or brain tumor patients, who may suffer severe secondary brain injury from brain tissue <b>compression.</b> <b>Coupling</b> with physiological parameters that are readily available using MRI, eg, tissue perfusion, a non-invasive, quantitative and regional estimation of intracranial stress distribution could offer a better understanding of brain tissue’s reaction under mass effect. A quantitative and sound measurement serving this particular purpose remains elusive due to multiple challenges associated with biomechanical modeling of the brain. One such challenge for the conventional Lagrangian frame based finite element method (LFEM) is that the mesh distortion resulted from the expansion of the mass effects can terminate the simulation prematurely before the desired pressure loading is achieved. In this work, we adopted an arbitrary Lagrangian and Eulerian FEM method (ALEF) with explicit dynamic solutions to simulate the expansion of brain mass effects caused by a pressure loading. This approach consists of three phases: 1) a Lagrangian phase to deform mesh like LFEM, 2) a mesh smoothing phase to reduce mesh distortion, and 3) an Eulerian phase to map the state variables from the old mesh to the smoothed one. In 2 D simulations with simulated geometries, this approach is able to model substantially larger deformations compared to LFEM. We further applied this approach to a simulation with 3 D real brain geometry to quantify the distribution of von Mises stress within the brain...|$|E

Cycle-level simulation of DISE decompression shows that it can reduce static program size by 35 % and execution time by 20 %.

The method of compression is strikingly similar to the previously published Color Cell Compression, which is in turn an adaptation of Block Truncation Coding published in the late 1970s. Unlike some image compression algorithms (e.g. JPEG), S3TC's fixed-rate data <b>compression</b> <b>coupled</b> with the single memory access (cf.

While S3 Graphics is no longer a competitor in the graphics accelerator market, license fees are still levied and collected for the use of S3TC technology, for example in game consoles and graphics cards.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{experimental}} {{results of the}} fast electron transport in compressed plasmas, created by laser-induced shock propagation in both cylindrical and planar geometry. Two experiments were carried out. The first one {{was based on the}} compression of a polyimide cylinder filled with foams of three different initial densities (rho(0)). X-ray and proton radiographies of the target during the <b>compression</b> <b>coupled</b> with hydrodynamic simulations show that the obtained core densities and temperatures range from 2 to 11 g/cm(3) and from 30 to 120 eV, respectively. By studying the K-shell fluorescence from dopant atoms inside the target and from tracer layers situated at both front and rear side of the target it has been possible to investigate the fast electron propagation. The results show that Cu K(alpha) yield emitted by the target rear side foil decreases with increasing compression, independently of rho(0). An electron collimation can also be observed for certain experimental conditions where a convergent resistivity gradient interacts with the fast electron beam. The second experiment was performed in a planar geometry with a compressing shock counter-propagative to the fast electron beam. In this case the areal density rho z seen by the electrons is constant during the compression {{in such a way that}} changes in the fast electron range should be ascribed to collective mechanisms. The study of the K(alpha) fluorescence, from buried fluorescent layers of different atomic numbers, shows that the electrons with energy < 75 key are more affected by resistive losses in compressed compared to non-compressed targets.

Sluggish degree of DRX is observed at intermediate strain rates characterized by low volume fraction of DRX grains and dominant presence of deformation substructure bounded with diffuse grain boundaries.
