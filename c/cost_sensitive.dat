40|$|Highway {{alignment}} optimization {{based on}} cost minimization requires comprehensive formulation of <b>costs</b> <b>sensitive</b> to alignment {{and development of}} efficient solution algorithms. The complexity of the applicable cost functions severely limits the search algorithms that can be employed. Recently, genetic algorithms, which can search very effectively through complex spaces with huge numbers of local optima, have been successfully developed for highway alignment optimization. However, in order to solve real-world problems the optimization algorithms should work directly with a Geographic Information System (GIS) which stores relevant geographic information, such as land boundaries, environmentally sensitive regions, and topographic data. This paper presents a model for highway alignment optimization that integrates a GIS with genetic algorithms, examines the effects of various costs on alignment selection, and explores optimization in constrained spaces that realistically reflect the limits on road improvement projects. The paper integrates several previously published developments and adds some new analysis approaches. A real-world problem using a GIS database for Maryland is solved using the proposed method. An example using an artificial map to investigate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed model in mountainous terrain is also demonstrated. The results indicate that travel-time cost, which is often neglected by highway agencies in selecting alignments, significantly affects the alignment optimization. Computation time increases significantly with the number of properties affected by each alignment. The model can optimize alignments in mountainous terrain or regions with very complex geography. ...|$|R

It uses a continuous-time stochastic dynamic general equilibrium model based on a recursive utility function that disentangles risk aversion from intertemporal substitution.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesProductivity costs {{constitute}} a substantial {{proportion of the}} total societal costs associated with cancer. We compared the results of applying two different analytical methods—the traditional human capital approach (HCA) and the emerging friction cost approach (FCA) —to estimate breast and prostate cancer productivity costs in Ireland in 2008. MethodsData from a survey of breast and prostate cancer patients were combined with population-level survival estimates and a national wage data set to calculate costs of temporary disability (cancer-related work absence), permanent disability (workforce departure, reduced working hours), and premature mortality. ResultsFor breast cancer, productivity costs per person using the HCA were € 193, 425 and those per person using the FCA were € 8, 103; for prostate cancer, the comparable estimates were € 109, 154 and € 8, 205, respectively. The HCA generated higher costs for younger patients (breast cancer) because of greater lifetime earning potential. In contrast, the FCA resulted in higher productivity costs for older male patients (prostate cancer) commensurate with higher earning capacity over a shorter time period. Reduced working hours postcancer was a key driver of total HCA productivity costs. HCA <b>costs</b> were <b>sensitive</b> to assumptions about discount and growth rates. FCA <b>costs</b> were <b>sensitive</b> to assumptions about the friction period. ConclusionsThe magnitude of the estimates obtained in this study illustrates the importance of including productivity costs when considering {{the economic impact of}} illness. Vastly different results emerge from the application of the HCA and the FCA, and this finding emphasizes the importance of choosing the study perspective carefully and being explicit about assumptions that underpin the methods...|$|R
