You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, there were a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I {{thought it was going}} to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

There, {{she told him she}} was a singer and gave him a copy of her demo CD. He was impressed by her song [...] "Smile" [...] and asked her to work together. Regarding the process of composing the song, Ronson stated: We spent a day together and worked on a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> and went to record shops where I played samples to her.

Vince Zampella, creative director of Infinity Ward, said, [...] "We didn't want to take any of the parts out that made Call of Duty so good. But there were a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that we admit could have been done better". A demo of the game showed a more open gameplay style and a better AI for the enemies, who would actively go after the player. There are a set number of enemies set on the map that will begin reacting to the player's presence once the first shot has been fired. Groups of enemies farther away send units up to see what is happening and add to the combat while enemies {{directly in front of the}} player will join in and take cover quickly.|$|E

[...] " [...] 'The Wrath of Con' showcases Veronica’s most salient qualities: her fierce loyalty to friends, her {{commitment}} to fairness and justice, and her wisecracking badassedness." [...] The reviewer went on to state that [...] " [...] 'The Wrath of Con' is illustrative <b>of</b> a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> other <b>things</b> that make the show great. Veronica Mars routinely plumbs emotional depths while avoiding cringey sentimentality. Veronica’s relationship with her dad and her BFF-ship with Wallace are tender but not uncomplicated, and {{the sweetness of the}} moments they share are cut with humor." ...|$|R

500|$|After the Seven Network dropped Neighbours in 1985, rival channel Network Ten {{picked the}} series up. It {{initially}} attracted low ratings and Ten began {{working hard to}} publicise the series. They revamped the show and added several new cast members. Kylie Minogue had had a fairly successful career as a child actress, having appeared in various television dramas, including Skyways and The Henderson Kids, but she was considering giving up acting after failing to find further work. After finishing her school exams in 1985, Minogue then auditioned {{for the role of}} Charlene. She attended the audition dressed as the character and won the role. Of hiring Minogue, Neighbours casting director Jan Russ commented [...] "Kylie had done a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> before I saw her, but she was only 18 and as shy as a mouse. She really hadn't evolved into anything at that stage, but the camera loved her and I knew I had my Charlene." [...] Minogue initially signed up to play Charlene for one week, this was then extended to 13 weeks and then through to mid-1988. She made her debut screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 17 April 1986.|$|E

Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal with a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake {{admitted that he had}} written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry." [...] Timbaland recalled, [...] "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth'".|$|E

He soon moved on to antique furniture."The trouble was I wasn't very good at it, and after a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years <b>things</b> got pretty desperate.

500|$|After the 53rd Grammy Awards, held in February 2011, {{band members}} Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood {{said in a}} {{backstage}} interview that work on the group's third album was almost complete.

In a blog entry on their website, the group said that [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] was among the last songs that were written for the album. Haywood commented, [...] "We were about six songs into recording and someone had this idea, so we sat down to write it." [...] Hillary Scott, Kelley and Haywood wrote the song with Dallas Davidson. Davidson discussed the conception of the song with country music blog Taste of Country: [...] "I {{went out on the}} road with them, and we wrote a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> We recorded one song called 'We Own the Night'. Charles called me as they were about done with the record. He said, 'Man, we want to write again.' So the band came over [...] one morning. We started writing this other song.

Ryan Murphy {{was responsible}} for selecting all of the songs used, and {{has said that he}} strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told him a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E
500|$|The {{division}} of royalties {{was a source}} of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for [...] "Dogs", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part [...] "Pigs on the Wing". Wright commented: [...] "It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> on there." [...] Mason recalled: [...] "Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately." [...] Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. Animals is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: [...] "Animals...wasn't a fun record to make... this was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band... that it was only because of him that [...] were still going... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me." ...|$|E

That picture, rising before my eyes, didn't give me much confidence in the unfortunate goof's ability to woo and win, I must say.

So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E
