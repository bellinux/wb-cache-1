5|$|An {{alternative}} disposal method, transmutation, {{has been}} demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. In this process, the technetium (technetium-99 as a metal target) is bombarded with neutrons to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16seconds) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium-100. If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal, an extremely pure technetium target is needed; if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium {{are present in the}} target, they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target. The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal, which will then require a longer <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.|$|E

However, the Falcon, like its predecessors, was designed to shoot down heavy bombers flying straight and level. Its reliability proved no better than others and its complex firing sequence and limited seeker-head <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> made it virtually useless in combat against agile fighters. The F-4Ds reverted to using Sidewinders under the [...] "Rivet Haste" [...] program in early 1968, and by 1972 the AIM-7E-2 [...] "Dogfight Sparrow" [...] had become the preferred missile for USAF pilots. Like other Vietnam War Phantoms, the F-4Ds were urgently fitted with radar homing and warning (RHAW) antennas to detect the Soviet-built S-75 Dvina SAMs.|$|E

2500|$|In {{physical}} cosmology, {{the age of}} {{the universe}} is the time elapsed since the Big Bang. The current measurement of {{the age of the}} universe is [...] billion (109) years within the Lambda-CDM concordance model. The uncertainty has been narrowed down to 21 million years, based on a number of projects that all give extremely close figures for the age. These include studies of the microwave background radiation, and measurements by the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and other probes. Measurements of the cosmic background radiation give the <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> of the universe since the Big Bang, and measurements of the expansion rate of the universe can be used to calculate its approximate age by extrapolating backwards in time.|$|E
2500|$|A more {{successful}} feedback model was first presented by Andrew King at the University of Leicester in 2003. In King's model, feedback occurs through momentum transfer, rather than energy transfer {{as in the}} case of Silk & Rees's model. [...] A [...] "momentum-driven flow" [...] is one in which the gas <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> is so short that essentially all the energy in the flow is in the form of bulk motion. In such a flow, most of the energy released by the black hole is lost to radiation, and only a few percent is left to affect the gas mechanically. King's model predicts a slope of α=4 for the M–σ relation, and the normalization is exactly correct; it is roughly a factor c/σ ≈ 103 times larger than in Silk & Rees's relation.|$|E

40|$|Radio lobes {{inflated}} by active galactic nuclei at {{the centers}} of clusters are a promising candidate for halting condensation in clusters with short central <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> because they are common in such clusters. In order to test the AGNheating hypothesis, we obtained Chandra observations of two clusters with short central <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> yet no evidence for AGN activity: Abell 1650 and Abell 2244. The cores of these clusters indeed appear systematically different from cores with more prominent radio emission. They do not have significant central temperature gradients, and their central entropy levels are markedly higher than in clusters with stronger radio emission, corresponding to central <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> ∼ 1 Gyr. Also, {{there is no evidence}} for fossil X-ray cavities produced by an earlier episode of AGN heating. We suggest that either (1) the central gas has not yet cooled to the point at which feedback is necessary to prevent it from condensing, possibly because it is conductively stabilized, or (2) the gas experienced a major heating event � 1 Gyr in the past and has not required feedback since then. The fact that these clusters with no evident feedback have higher central entropy and therefore longer central <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> than clusters with obvious AGN feedback strongly suggests that AGNs supply the feedback necessary to suppress condensation in clusters with short central <b>cooling</b> <b>times.</b> – 2...|$|R

40|$|Fourier and Reynolds {{correlations}} {{are presented}} {{for determining the}} values of thermal parameters {{defined in terms of}} the half <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> and seven-eighths <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> for spheres and cylinders being cooled in air or water flows. In this respect, an experimental, modeling and literature-survey investigation was conducted. In the experiments, several spheres and cylinders were cooled in air and water flows, and their centre temperatures measured. In the modeling part, a methodology was used to determine the cooling parameters, and using experimental data, together with some experimental data from the literature, the following Fourier-Reynolds correlations for half and seven-eighths <b>cooling</b> <b>times</b> were developed: Fos = 0 Â· 3693 Re- 0 Â· 11871 and Foz = 1 Â· 2951 Re- 0 Â· 16003 respectively for water-cooling applications; Fos = 42 Â· 465 Re- 0 Â· 54426 and Foz = 125 Â· 21 Re- 0 Â· 53913 respectively for air-cooling applications. The {{results of the present study}} show that there is a strong relationship between the Fourier and Reynolds numbers, and the developed Fourier-Reynolds correlations reasonably determine the cooling thermal parameters for spherical or cylindrical bodies cooled in water and air flows.

50|$|Plasma {{in regions}} of the cluster, with a <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> shorter than {{the age of the}} system, should be cooling due to strong X-ray {{radiation}} where emission is proportional to the density squared. Since the density of the ICM is highest towards the center of the cluster, the radiative <b>cooling</b> <b>time</b> drops a significant amount. The central cooled gas can no longer support the weight of the external hot gas and the pressure gradient drives what is known as a cooling flow where the hot gas from the external regions flows slowly towards the center of the cluster. This inflow would result in regions of cold gas and thus regions of new star formation. Recently however, with the launch of new X-ray telescopes such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, images of galaxy clusters with better spatial resolution have been taken. These new images do not indicate signs of new star formation on the order of what was historically predicted, motivating research into the mechanisms that would prevent the central ICM from cooling.|$|E
