25|$|The 470 (Four-Seventy) is a {{double-handed}} monohull planing dinghy with a <b>centreboard,</b> Bermuda rig, and centre sheeting. Equipped with a spinnaker, trapeze {{and a large}} sail-area-to-weight ratio, it {{is designed}} to plane easily, and good teamwork necessary to sail it well. The name comes from the overall length of the boat in centimetres (i.e., the boat is 4.70 metres long).|$|E
25|$|Trying again, Ashbury {{offered a}} best-of-seven match race {{challenge}} for October 1871, which the NYYC accepted provided a defending yacht could be chosen {{on the morning}} of each race. Ashbury's new yacht Livonia (264 tons) was beaten twice in a row by Osgood's new <b>centreboard</b> schooner Columbia (220 tons), which withdrew in the third race after dismasting. The yacht Sappho then stepped in as defender to win the fourth and fifth races, thereby successfully defending the cup.|$|E

50|$|A catboat (or cat boat), is a sailboat, with {{a single}} sail on a single mast set well forward in {{the bow of the}} boat. Most have a shallow draft, with <b>centreboards,</b> {{although}} some have a keel.|$|R
50|$|To {{make them}} easy to load and {{transport}} by trailer, most {{boats in the}} class have swing keel <b>centreboards</b> or daggerboards. Due to the limitations of trailer capacity, towing vehicle size and weight, as well as highway width limitations, most trailer sailboats are limited in size to about 22 to 26 ft in length.|$|R
25|$|In 1928 Uffa Fox {{introduced}} planing to the English dinghy racing {{world in}} his International 14 boat, the Avenger. He gained 52 first places, two second places and three third places out of 57 race starts that year. Note: Graham Anderson in his 1999 book Fast Light Boats, a Century of Kiwi Innovation argues that planing <b>centreboard</b> sailing boats were introduced into New Zealand {{in the early}} 20th century - well before Uffa Fox popularised the concept.|$|E

50|$|The oldest known one-design {{sailing dinghy}} is the Water Wag. Thomas Middleton {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} one design sailing punts, with <b>centreboards</b> all built and rigged the same in 1887. The first race took place on April 12, 1887, in Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) Harbour. The Water Wag Club still race Water Wag dinghies in Dún Laoghaire every Wednesday during the summer season.|$|R
50|$|As a {{development}} class, the PD Racer specifications allow for builders {{to experiment with}} different configurations. The PD Racer specifications only apply to the hull, allowing for various types of sailing rigs, and either leeboards or <b>centreboards.</b> Although the boats are required to conform to a specific shape for use in class racing, the hull {{can also be used}} for recreational sailing, paddling, and motoring.|$|R
50|$|Sharpies are {{a type of}} hard chined {{sailboat}} with a flat bottom, extremely shallow draft, <b>centreboards</b> and straight, flaring sides. They {{are believed}} to have originated in the New Haven, Connecticut region of Long Island Sound, United States. They were traditional fishing boats used for oystering, and later appeared in other areas. With centerboards and shallow balanced rudders they are well suited to sailing in shallow tidal waters.|$|R

2500|$|All of the {{interior}} liners are overlaid and bonded to the hull and deck and the hull to deck joint is bonded with adhesive and then mechanically fastened with stainless steel bolts through the signature C slotted aluminum toerail. The fixed elliptical fin keel has an eight percent foil at the root with reduced chord and an extended trailing edge-hull fillet for interference drag reduction, and an eleven percent foil at the tip to help lower the centre of gravity (VCG). A keel / <b>centreboard</b> combination is an option. The D/L ratio ranges from 206 to 231, depending on model. The opening transom of the + and XL model is simple to operate and transforms to a walk through transom / swim platform including an integral folding ladder providing {{easy access to the}} water. [...] The R version has an open transom.|$|E
2500|$|Wild Oats XI is a {{state-of-the-art}} maxi yacht designed by Reichel/Pugh and built by Mcconaghy Boats, {{five months after}} her near-sistership Alfa Romeo II, from which she borrowed extensively. She was launched in December 2005 after a 9-month build and won her first Sydney-Hobart the same month. She is distinctively narrow with a [...] beam and originally featured [...] "canting ballast twin foil" [...] appendages enabling her to carry a large sail plan without compromising stability. She has undergone many modifications over time to keep her competitive: In 2009 she was lengthened at bow and stern from 98ft to 100ft to meet the new limit in the Sydney-Hobart. In 2011 her forward balanced spade canard was removed and twin daggerboards were added amidships. In 2012 she received a bow <b>centreboard</b> as well as caudal fin winglets on her torpedo bulb. In 2013 she was equipped with a Dynamic Stability System (DSS) foil, which is a retractable horizontal foil deployed on the leeward side of the boat. In 2015 her stern was shortened by 2m and her 12m forward sections were replaced by a 14m longer, sleeker bow, keeping her midship sections unmodified and in effect moving her entire existing sailplan aft by 2m.|$|E
25|$|Crossfields of Arnside {{were the}} most {{prolific}} builders with two yards working. Later branches of the family started yards at Conway and took over a yard at Hoylake. Many were constructed by Gibson at Fleetwood, later taken over by Liver and Wilding. In particular, William Stoba (1855–1931), a foreman shipwright with Fleetwood builders, developed the design and experimented with <b>centreboards.</b> Other builders were working at Annan, Millom, Crossens and Marshside near Southport.|$|R
50|$|On a {{traditional}} two-leeboard (or non-fixed leeboard) design, the boards are {{designed so that}} the windward board can be retracted, to reduce drag. Unlike <b>centreboards,</b> which are symmetric along the boat's axis, leeboards are often asymmetric, so that they more efficiently provide lift in one direction. Some fast racing scows use bilgeboards, which are mounted between the centreline of the hull and the sides, so they can use a pair of asymmetric foils for maximum lift and minimum drag.|$|R
50|$|The 5.9 is {{designed}} to give Tornado-like performance coupled with smooth predictable handling. In many conditions the 5.9 will actually outpace the classic Tornado. The boat is equipped with kick up rudders and <b>centreboards</b> which ride up on impact, reducing risk of damage. The PET film main sail gives long life and low maintenance with less frequent need for replacement. Now {{with the introduction of}} the SX rig (3 sail) the performance has been enhanced further.|$|R
2500|$|Most small monohull sailboats can {{normally}} be righted by standing or pulling {{down on the}} <b>centreboard,</b> daggerboard (or bilgeboard in a [...] ) to lift the mast clear of the water. Depending {{on the design of}} the hull, the boat's righting moment will normally take effect once the mast is around 30 degrees from horizontal and help pull the boat vertical. Righting a catamaran that is lying on its side involves using a righting line fed over the upper hull. The crew stands on the lower hull and pulls back on the righting line. In small catamarans such as the Hobie 16 it is imperative that at least one crew member assumes this task as soon as possible as there is a chance that the boat will turtle and then become extremely difficult to recover without assistance. Some monohulls and catamarans [...] use a small flotation device mounted {{at the tip of the}} mast or mainsail to ensure that the craft cannot assume an inverted position, or at least that a fully inverted position is not stable (i.e. it would come to a position where the mast is lying on the surface of the water, which would be preferable to fully inverted).|$|E
60|$|Carroll bowed, and Vane, who thrust {{back the}} cabin slide, motioned the others below. The place was brightly lighted by a nickelled lamp, {{though it was}} {{scarcely}} four feet high and the <b>centreboard</b> trunk occupied the middle of it. A wide, cushioned locker ran along each side a foot above the floor, and a swing table, fixed above the trunk, filled {{up most of the}} space between. There was no cloth upon the table, but it was invitingly laid out with canned fruit, coffee, hot flapjacks, and a big lake trout.|$|E
60|$|Nicholas and I {{succeeded in}} {{chartering}} the sloop very cheaply; and between laughs, while getting up sail, {{we agreed that}} she was even crazier and older than she had been described. She was a big, flat-bottomed, square-sterned craft, sloop-rigged, with a sprung mast, slack rigging, dilapidated sails, and rotten running-gear, clumsy to handle and uncertain in bringing about, and she smelled vilely of coal tar, with which strange stuff she had been smeared from stem to stern and from cabin-roof to <b>centreboard.</b> And to cap it all, Coal Tar Maggie was printed in great white letters the whole length of either side.|$|E
50|$|As the club’s yachts grew {{increasingly}} sophisticated, members’ tastes in designs diverged. Early examples hewed {{closely to the}} extreme British plank-on-edge style that relied on ballast, not hull-form, for stability. As the century wore on, Canadian designers such as Alexander Cuthbert and A. Cary Smith began to incorporate more {{of the features of}} American yachts such as form-based stability and <b>centreboards.</b> Members were also looking back to Britain for well-rounded designs from such notables as George Lennox Watson and William Fife.|$|R
50|$|The {{main body}} of the float was {{composed}} of nine balsa tree trunks up to 45 ft long, 2 ft in diameter, lashed together with 1+1/4 in hemp ropes. Cross-pieces of balsa logs 18 ft long and 1 ft in diameter were lashed across the logs at 3 ft intervals to give lateral support. Pine splashboards clad the bow, and lengths of pine 1 in thick and 2 ft wide were wedged between the balsa logs and used as <b>centreboards.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Keels are {{different}} from <b>centreboards</b> {{and other types of}} foils in that keels are made of heavy materials to provide ballast to stabilize the boat. [...] Keels may be fixed, or non-movable, or they may retract to allow sailing in shallower waters. [...] Retracting keels may pivot (a swing keel) or slide upwards to retract, and are usually retracted with a winch due to the weight of the ballast. [...] Since the keel provides far more stability when lowered than when retracted (due to the greater moment arm involved), the amount of sail carried is generally reduced when sailing with the keel retracted.|$|R
60|$|But {{the time}} was rapidly drawing near when I was to begin my second series of bouts with John Barleycorn. When I was fourteen, my head filled with the tales of the old voyagers, my vision with tropic isles and far sea-rims, I was sailing a small <b>centreboard</b> skiff around San Francisco Bay and on the Oakland Estuary. I {{wanted to go to}} sea. I wanted to get away from monotony and the commonplace. I was in the flower of my adolescence, a-thrill with romance and adventure, dreaming of wild life in the wild man-world. Little I guessed how all the warp and woof of that man-world was {{entangled}} with alcohol.|$|E
60|$|The {{tide was}} out. A full hundred yards of soft mud intervened between the boat-wharf and the water. I pulled up my <b>centreboard,</b> ran full tilt into the mud, took in sail, and, {{standing}} in the stern, as I had often done at low tide, I began to shove the skiff with an oar. It was then that my correlations began to break down. I lost my balance and pitched head-foremost into the ooze. Then, {{and for the first}} time, as I floundered to my feet covered with slime, the blood running down my arms from a scrape against a barnacled stake, I knew that I was drunk. But what of it? Across the channel two strong sailormen lay unconscious in their bunks where I had drunk them. I WAS a man. I was still on my legs, if they were knee-deep in mud. I disdained {{to get back into the}} skiff. I waded through the mud, shoving the skiff before me and yammering the chant of my manhood to the world.|$|E

40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of an investigation}} into the flow straightening effects on a ship rudder of an upstram propeller and hull. In order to quantify these effects an experimental investigation was carried out using a 3. 5 m x 2. 5 m wind tunnel. The tests were carried out with an all-movable rudder and a representative propeller for drift angles up to ± 15 °. Three different lengths of <b>centreboards</b> were tested upstream of the rudder-propeller combination, together with a representative hull. Flow straightening effects were found to be dependent on the type of upstream body, drift angle and propeller thrust loading. The effects of the three <b>centreboards</b> upstream of the propeller were found to be significantly greater than the effect of the propeller on its own. The straightening effects of the hull were found to be less than those for the centreline boards. There was an increase in flow straightening with increase in propeller thrust loading at a drift angle of 15 ° but at 7. 5 ° drift this effect was less apparent and sometimes reversed. The overall results provide a better understanding of flow straightening effects and data for improving the prediction of manoeuvring rudder forces. The data for the centreline boards are likely to have applications for vessels with a relatively thin upstream skeg, whilst the data for the rudder plus propeller combination in isolation should be suitable for vessels with open water sterns, such as twin screw vessels...|$|R
50|$|The hulls of the Dart 18 {{are similar}} to most sailing catamarans, but without <b>centreboards.</b> Instead, {{the lower part of}} the hulls have skegs typical for a beach catamaran.The hull {{material}} is glassfibre. Both hulls are filled with flotation inserts to preserve buoyancyin case of damage. The inside of each hull can be reached through a hatch cover locatedat the rear of each hull. The boat is assembled by attaching the main and rear beams to the hulls with spring-loaded retaining clips, and lacing the trampoline to the beams and hulls.The two rudders are removable without tools, retract on impact with the beach, and can be locked in the up position.|$|R
50|$|Designers such as Ian Oughtred have {{produced}} modern versions that incorporate many traditional features while addressing {{some of the}} drawbacks, in particular {{the replacement of the}} shallow, balanced rudder (which had a tendency to lead to wild and erratic steering in big following seas) with a more conventional transom-hung pivoting rudder blade. The Haiku design also has fully battened sails in an effort to improve windward performance. Oughtred offers the Haiku with either twin swinging <b>centreboards,</b> which give more interior room, at the expense of hydrodynamic efficiency, or a single central board, which takes up more space. At 30 feet long the Haiku is set up for a small family to cruise in sheltered waters.|$|R
50|$|The boat has a {{draft of}} 3.83 ft with the <b>centreboard</b> down and 0.58 ft with the <b>centreboard</b> up.|$|E
50|$|The Colleen is a half decked gaff rigged <b>centreboard</b> day {{boat with}} the <b>centreboard</b> case fixed {{externally}} under the boat.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of a <b>centreboard</b> improves with increasing aspect ratio. A long narrow <b>centreboard</b> produces less drag than a short, wide {{one for a}} given amount of lift, resulting in a faster boat that can point closer into the wind. A fore and aft, pivoting <b>centreboard</b> {{can also be used}} to move the centre of lateral resistance aft to match a change in sail plan, such as furling or dropping the jib. A retracting <b>centreboard</b> is more complex than a fixed keel, and most take up space inside the hull of the boat that could otherwise be used for passenger accommodation. Other types feature a casing under the boat, which does not take up space but instead has the problem of increased drag. For this reason, it is not uncommon to find boats with a combination of shallow keel and <b>centreboard</b> (e.g. Randmeer). The keel provides the housing for the <b>centreboard,</b> moving it out of the hull, but adds only a small amount of draft to the boat. The <b>centreboard</b> can then be lowered in deeper waters to increase the amount of lift. Ballast is usually provided in the keel, keeping the <b>centreboard</b> lighter and easier to handle.|$|E
50|$|Leeboards are {{no longer}} common in commercially-built boats, because many people {{consider}} them inelegant and awkward. They are far more common in home-built boats, especially the Puddle Duck Racer and stitch and glue type sailboats. Leeboards simplify construction of the hull, as they {{are attached to the}} outside and do not require holes in the hull, which can leak. Since <b>centreboards</b> are retractable, they require a large, watertight trunk to hold them in place when retracted, and this occupies what otherwise might be useful space in the cabin or cockpit of the boat. Use of leeboards, while it adds complexity to the process of tacking, leaves the floor of the boat unobstructed.|$|R
50|$|Originally an American design, {{also used}} widely in New Zealand, the {{schooner}} rigged scow {{was used for}} coastal and inland transport, colonial days to the early 1900s. Scow schooners had a broad, shallow hull, and used <b>centreboards,</b> bilgeboards or leeboards rather than a deep keel. The broad hull gave them stability, and the retractable foils allowed them to move even heavy loads of cargo in waters far too shallow for keelboats to enter. The squared off bow and stern allowed {{the maximum amount of}} cargo to be carried in the hull. The smallest sailing scows were sloop rigged (making them technically a scow sloop), but otherwise similar in design. The scow sloop eventually evolved into the inland lake scow, a type of fast racing boat.|$|R
5000|$|The 16 is {{the most}} popular Hobie Cat, both for {{recreational}} and racing purposes and as a one-design racer. The boat is 16'7" [...] long, 7'11" [...] wide, and has a mast 26'6" [...] tall, but only weighs 320 pounds. As with the 14, it is intended to be sailed from the beach through the surf, and to be surfed back in on the waves to the beach. Instead of daggerboards or <b>centreboards,</b> the 16 has asymmetrical hulls which act like foils and keep the boat from crabbing, or slipping sideways from the force of the wind. Both jib and main sails are fully battened and total 218 sq ft. A trapeze is usually used by the crew and helmsman.|$|R
