40|$|Abstract. Security {{protocols}} aim at securing communications over pub-lic networks. Their {{design is}} notoriously difficult and error-prone. Formal methods have shown their usefulness for providing a careful security anal-ysis {{in the case}} of standard authentication and confidentiality protocols. However, most current techniques do not apply to protocols that per-form recursive computation e. g. on a list of messages received from the network. While considering general recursive input/output actions very quickly yields undecidability, we focus on protocols that perform recursive tests on received messages but output messages that depend on the inputs in a standard way. This is in particular the case of secured routing proto-cols, distributed right delegation or PKI <b>certification</b> <b>paths.</b> We provide NPTIME decision procedures for protocols with recursive tests and for a bounded number of sessions. We also revisit constraint system solving, providing a complete symbolic representation of the attacker knowledge. ...|$|R

The database was developed by NASA Langley Research Center, {{at the request of the}} Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), to support the industry initiative to certify and produce forward-looking windshear detection equipment. The database contains high-resolution three-dimensional fields for meteorological variables that may be sensed by forward-looking systems. The database is made up of seven case studies that are generated by the Terminal Area Simulation System, a state-of-the-art numerical system for the realistic modeling of windshear phenomena. The selected cases contained in the certification documentation represent a wide spectrum of windshear events. The database will be used with vendor-developed sensor simulation software and vendor-collected ground-clutter data to demonstrate detection performance in a variety of meteorological conditions using NASA/FAA pre-defined path scenarios for each of the certification cases. A brief outline of the contents and sample plots from the database documentation are included.

40|$|What is an EMI Release? What is {{its life}} cycle? How is its quality assured through a {{continuous}} integration and large scale acceptance testing? These {{are the main}} questions that this article will answer, by presenting the EMI release management process with emphasis on {{the role played by}} the Testing Infrastructure in improving the quality of the middleware provided by the project. The European Middleware Initiative (EMI) is a close collaboration of four major European technology providers: ARC, gLite, UNICORE and dCache. Its main objective is to deliver a consolidated set of components for deployment in EGI (as part of the Unified Middleware Distribution, UMD), PRACE and other DCIs. The harmonized set of EMI components thus enables the interoperability and integration between Grids. EMI aims at creating an effective environment that satisfies the requirements of the scientific communities relying on it. The EMI distribution is organized in periodic major releases whose development and maintenance follow a 5 -phase yearly cycle: i) requirements collection and analysis, ii) development and test planning, iii) software development, testing and certification, iv) release certification and validation and v) release and maintenance. In this article we present in detail the implementation of operational and infrastructural resources supporting the certification and validation phase of the release. The main goal of this phase is to harmonize into a single release the strongly inter-dependent products coming from various development teams through parallel <b>certification</b> <b>paths.</b> To achieve this goal the continuous integration and large scale acceptance testing performed on the EMI Testing Infrastructure plays a key role. The purpose of this infrastructure is to provide a system where both the production and the release candidate product versions are deployed. On this system inter-component testing by different product team testers can concurrently take place. The Testing Infrastructure is also continuously monitored through Nagios and exposed both to automatic testing and to usage by volunteer end-users. Furthermore the infrastructure size is increased with resources made available by volunteer end-users that are interested in implementing production-like deployments or specific test scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Trust models {{provide a}} {{framework}} to create and manage trust relationships among the different entities of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). These trust relationships are verified through the <b>certification</b> <b>path</b> validation process, which involves: path discovery, signature verification and revocation status checking. When trust relationships are bidirectional, multiple paths can exist between two entities, which increase the runtime of the path discovery process. In addition, validation of long paths can be difficult, especially when storage and processing capacities of the verifier are limited. In this paper, we propose a protocol to establish a hierarchical trust model from a hybrid PKI. This protocol makes more efficient <b>certification</b> <b>path</b> discovery since in a hierarchical model, trust relationships are unidirectional and paths are easy to find. In addition, our protocol does not require issuing new certificates and allows setting a maximum path length, {{so it can be}} adapted to the features of users ’ terminals.

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business AdministrationThe {{objective}} of this dissertation is to empirically investigate the effect of professional credentials on personal financial planning practitioner’s income in Hong Kong. Financial planning in Hong Kong is relatively new among financial services, dating back only to the early 2000 s. The financial planning industry in Hong Kong is largely unregulated, and professional certification {{is not required to}} act as a financial planner. Regardless, many individuals working in the financial planning field choose to undertake one or more professional certifications, such as a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERCM (the most common and most highly regarded) and others. There are currently over 66, 000 CFPcertified financial planners in Hong Kong, along with an unknown number of other certifications. This study seeks to investigate why individuals undergo certification in the absence of external regulatory requirements. We employ human capital and inequality theories to describe the process of certification as a voluntary investment in knowledge and skill building, and then posit that this would only be justified if there were an expected financial return in the form of higher income. Utilising data from a sample of 5, 019 financial planning professionals from a single Hong Kong insurance firm, we examine the relationship between earnings and certification, human capital factors (education and experience), and demographic factors (age and sex). The empirical results indicate that certification, level of education, experience, gender and age do impact on the earnings of financial planners in Hong Kong. The results also reveal that a cluster of certifications do impact on earnings of financial practitioners with four certifications (CFP, LUTCF, FCHCP, and RFC) all of which are highly associated with higher incomes, while only one, the RFP, was not. The RFP was also the least popular certification among financial planners. These findings, taken together, have two implications. First, <b>certification</b> is a <b>path</b> to increased income. Second, certifications do have different market values, thus offering an insight into why individuals choose one form of certification over another. Finally, company policy makers as well as regulators should take cognizance of the rewards associated with certification in order to determine whether it is worthwhile to mandate professional certification of financial planners in the financial services industry in Hong Kong...|$|R
