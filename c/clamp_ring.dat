40|$|DOT, DOE and NRC Type A and Type B {{radioactive}} material (RAM) transport packages routinely use industrial or military specification drums with conventional <b>clamp</b> <b>ring</b> closures as an overpack. Considerable testing has been performed on these type packages {{over the past}} 30 years. Observations from test data have resulted in various design changes and recommendations to the standard drum specification and use, enhancing {{the reliability of the}} overpack. Recently, performance capability of the 9975 conventional <b>clamp</b> <b>ring</b> closure design was questioned by the Regulatory Authority. This paper highlights the observations of recent 9974 and 9975 package testing that led to redesign of the 9975, replacing the standard <b>clamp</b> <b>ring</b> closure with a bolted ring closure. In the course of this review and redesign effort, 18 package designs and approximately 100 Hypothetical Accident Condition (HAC) drops of various size and weight drum packages were evaluated. A trend was observed with respect to overpack lid failures for packages utilizing conventional ring closure. Based on this trend, a limit on the ratio of the content weight to total package weight was identified, beyond which <b>clamp</b> <b>ring</b> closure failure may be expected...|$|E

40|$|Ring-shaped sliding clamps and {{clamp loader}} ATPases are {{essential}} factors for rapid and accurate DNA replication. The <b>clamp</b> <b>ring</b> is opened and resealed at the primer–template junctions by the ATP-fueled clamp loader function. The processivity of the DNA polymerase is conferred by its attachment to the clamp loaded onto the DNA.

40|$|A {{window for}} a high-sensitivity {{microwave}} receiving system allows microwave radiation {{to pass through}} to a cryogenically cooled microwave feed system in a vacuum chamber, while keeping ambient {{air out of the}} chamber and helping to keep the interior of the chamber cold. The microwave feed system comprises a feed horn and a low-noise amplifier, both of which are required to be cooled to a temperature of 15 K during operation. The window is designed to exhibit very little microwave attenuation in two frequency bands: 8 to 9 GHz and 30 to 40 GHz. The window is 15 cm in diameter. It includes three layers (see figure) : 1) The outer layer is made of a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) film 0. 025 mm thick. This layer serves primarily to reflect and absorb solar ultraviolet radiation to prolong the life of the underlying main window layer, which is made of a polyimide that becomes weakened when exposed to ultraviolet. The poly(tetrafluoroethylene) layer also protects the main window layer against abrasion. Moreover, the inherent hydrophobicity of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) helps to prevent the highly undesirable accumulation of water on the outer surface. 2) The polyimide main window layer is 0. 08 mm thick. This layer provides the vacuum seal for the window. 3) A 20 -mm-thick layer of ethylene/ propylene copolymer foam underlies the main polyimide window layer. This foam layer acts partly as a thermal insulator: it limits radiational heating of the microwave feed horn and, concomitantly, limits radiational cooling of the window. This layer has high compressive strength and provides some mechanical support for the main window layer, reducing the strength required of the main window layer. The ethylene/propylene copolymer foam layer is attached to an aluminum window ring by means of epoxy. The outer poly(tetrafluoroethylene) film and the main polyimide window layer are sandwiched together and pressed against the window ring by use of a bolted <b>clamp</b> <b>ring.</b> The window has been found to introduce a microwave loss of only about 0. 4 percent.

30|$|When the ME-Wheel is {{subjected}} to lateral forces, the mechanical connection (hinge unit, <b>clamping</b> <b>ring)</b> of the ME-Wheel will transmit the lateral force to the flexible tire body, which {{will lead to a}} certain degree of elastic deformation of the flexible tire body in the grounding area.

40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of the out-of-plane buckling strength of rings attached to cone-cylinder intersections. Simple formulae {{which can be}} used to estimate the stiffness of the rotational restraint provided by adjacent shell walls are first developed from a finite element parametric study. These formulae are then combined with an existing closed-form solution based on thin-walled member theory to predict the flexural-torsional buckling strength of rings with an elastic rotational restraint. Numerical results are obtained for angle section rings from the closed-form solution and a finite element shell buckling analysis which is able to model cross-section distortion. Comparisons between the two approaches show that when the restraint stiffness is small, they agree with each other closely. Beyond a certain level of restraint stiffness, the buckling strength predicted by the finite element analysis falls increasingly below that given by the closed-form solution due to cross-section distortion and approaches the strength of an inner edge <b>clamped</b> <b>ring.</b> The paper concludes with suggestions for safely approximating the stiffness of the shell wall rotational restraint for use in design.

Integration of this Ta foam into the neighboring bone requires that osteoprogenitor cells attach to the implant, grow into the scaffold, proliferate and differentiate to osteoblasts. The aim {{of the present study was}} to create an in vitro 3 D model system to investigate the interaction of human osteoblasts with porous Ta in the depth of the corpus. To explore active migration of osteoblasts into the Ta scaffold two porous Ta discs (Zimmer, Poland) were horizontally fixed within a <b>clamping</b> <b>ring.</b> Thereby a 3 D Ta module with 4 levels is generated, which is placed into a cell culture well with the appropriate medium.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effectiveness}} of applying a high-frequency, low-energy, reactive gas plasma {{for the removal}} of hydrocarbon contamination from specimens and components for electron microscopy has been investigated with a variety of analytical techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of specimens that have been plasma cleaned shows an elimination of the carbonaceous contamination from the specimen. With extended cleaning times the removal of existing carbon contamination debris due to previously conducted microanalysis is shown. Following plasma cleaning, specimens may be examined in the electron microscope for several hours without exhibiting evidence of recontamination. The {{effectiveness of}} plasma cleaning is not limited to applications for TEM specimens. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) specimens that have been plasma cleaned likewise show an elimination of carbonaceous contamination.

40|$|Future long-duration {{missions}} to Mars using in situ resource production to obtain oxygen from the Martian atmosphere {{for use as}} a propellant or for life support will require long term oxygen storage facilities. This report describes preliminary analysis of design concepts for lightweight, collapsible liquid oxygen storage tanks to be used on the surface of Mars. With storage at relatively low pressures, an inflatable tank concept in which the cryogen is stored within a fiber-reinforced Teflon FEP bladder is an efficient approach. The technology required for such a tank is well-developed through similar previous applications in positive expulsion bladders for zero-g liquid fuel rocket tanks and inflatable space habitat technology, though the liquid oxygen environment presents unique challenges. The weight of the proposed structure is largely dominated by the support structure needed to hold the tank off the ground and permit a vacuum insulation space to be maintained around the tank. In addition to the inflatable tank concept, telescoping tank concepts are studied. For a telescoping tank, the greatest difficulty is in making effective joints and seals. The use of shape memory alloy to produce a passive <b>clamping</b> <b>ring</b> is evaluated.

40|$|AbstractThe Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding Process is a {{solid state}} joining process {{manufacturing}} excellent mechanical properties of the joint. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the influence of the tool wear on selected quality criteria such as the lap shear strength and the surface quality of the joint as well as the required electric current that is an indicator for the process forces and torques. Based on the result of 22 duration tests with 3, 500 welding points the sleeve can be identified as the most stressed tool part with a maximum wear of 0. 3 mm. The tool wear depends on the gap size between the tool parts that are loaded with plasticized work piece material. The volume of the material influences the required torque of the main spindle and the tool temperature. At reaching 70 % to 80 % of the maximum tool wear the process temperature rapidly increases. Another result is the independence of lap shear strength of the joints on tool wear. But within the duration tests the mechanical characteristics were increased (about 7, 000 N before and 8, 300 N after one duration test in average) by achieving larger temperatures. The surface quality is slightly influenced by the tool wear. The height of the surrounding burr that occurs at the boundary of <b>clamping</b> <b>ring</b> and sleeve is 0. 25 mm for a worn out tool.
