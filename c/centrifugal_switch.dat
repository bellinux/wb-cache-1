2500|$|In {{single phase}} {{squirrel}} cage motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is {{not capable of}} starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary [...] "start" [...] winding has a series non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current. When the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle {{with respect to the}} primary (run) winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted {{to the side of the}} motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, that have relatively high starting torque. Typically they can have up-to four times as much starting torque than a split-phase motor and are used on applications such as compressors, pressure washers and any small device requiring high starting torques.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common use of {{centrifugal}} switches is within single-phase, split-phase induction motors. Here, the switch is used to disconnect the starting winding of the motor once the motor approaches its normal operating speed. In this case, the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> consists of weights mounted to the shaft of the motor and held near the shaft by spring force. At rest, levers attached to the weights press a low-friction, non-conductive plate against a set of electrical contacts mounted to the motor housing, closing the contacts and connecting the starting winding to the power source. When the motor approaches its normal operating speed, centrifugal force overcomes the spring force and the weights swing out, raising the plate away from the electrical contacts. This allows the contacts to open and disconnects the starting winding from the power source; the motor then continues operating solely using its running winding. Motors using such a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> make a distinct clicking noise when starting and stopping as the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> opens and closes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>switches</b> {{were also}} used in early {{electric}} fans, particularly those made in the 1900s and early 1910s.|$|R
50|$|Some higher-end {{units have}} an {{automatic}} reversing jam clearing feature. By using a slightly more-complicated <b>centrifugal</b> starting <b>switch,</b> the split-phase motor rotates {{in the opposite}} direction from the previous run each time it is started. This can clear minor jams, but is claimed to be unnecessary by some manufacturers: Since the late 1970s most disposal units have swivel impellers which make reversing unnecessary.|$|R
50|$|A {{clutch servo}} {{powered by the}} vacuum at the {{induction}} manifold operated the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating <b>centrifugal</b> operation. A <b>switch</b> in the gear lever operated a solenoid valve {{so that when the}} gear lever was moved the clutch was disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> used a changeover contact {{to ensure that the}} auxiliary windings remain in the circuit through a running capacitor. These motors are called two-value or capacitor start capacitor run motors.|$|E
50|$|A <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> is an {{electric}} switch that operates using the centrifugal force created from a rotating shaft, most commonly that of {{an electric}} motor or gasoline engine. The switch is designed to activate or de-activate {{as a function of}} the rotational speed of the shaft.|$|E
50|$|In aircraft, a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> is used {{to control}} the {{starting}} and ignition circuits, the governed speed indication circuit and the overspeed protection circuit of the auxiliary power unit. This switch is mounted inside a rotating body. This can be set to activate or deactivate a circuit as the rpm of device increases or decreases.|$|E
5000|$|The motor {{will not}} work {{properly}} if the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> is broken. If the switch is always [...] "open", the start capacitor {{is not part of}} the circuit thus preventing startup of the motor. If the switch is always [...] "closed", the start capacitor is always enabled, thus likely destroying the capacitor. If a motor does not start, the capacitor is far more likely the problem than the switch.|$|E
50|$|Start {{capacitors}} briefly increase {{motor starting}} torque and allow a motor to be cycled {{on and off}} rapidly. A start capacitor stays in the circuit long enough to rapidly bring the motor up to a predetermined speed, which is usually about 75% of the full speed, and is then {{taken out of the}} circuit, often by a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> that releases at that speed. Afterward the motor works more efficiently with a run capacitor.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{single phase}} motors are {{split-phase}} motors {{and have a}} second stator winding fed with out-of-phase current; such currents may be created by feeding the winding through a capacitor or having it receive different values of inductance and resistance from the main winding. In capacitor-start designs, the second winding is disconnected once the motor is up to speed, usually either by a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> acting on weights on the motor shaft or a thermistor which heats up and increases its resistance, reducing the current through the second winding to an insignificant level. The capacitor-run designs keep the second winding on when running, improving torque. A resistance start design uses a starter inserted in series with the startup winding, creating reactance.|$|E
50|$|In {{single phase}} {{squirrel}} cage motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is {{not capable of}} starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary winding is used in series with a non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lag in the sinusoidal current through the starting winding. When the secondary winding is placed at an angle {{with respect to the}} primary winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted {{to the side of the}} motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, and have relatively high starting torque.|$|E
50|$|Repulsion motors are wound-rotor {{single-phase}} AC motors {{that are}} a type of induction motor. In a repulsion motor, the armature brushes are shorted together rather than connected in series with the field, as is done with universal motors. By transformer action, the stator induces currents in the rotor, which create torque by repulsion instead of attraction as in other motors. Several types of repulsion motors have been manufactured, but the repulsion-start induction-run (RS-IR) motor has been used most frequently. The RS-IR motor has a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> that shorts all segments of the commutator so that the motor operates as an induction motor once it is close to full speed. Some of these motors also lift the brushes out of contact with source voltage regulation. Repulsion motors were developed before suitable motor starting capacitors were available, and few repulsion motors are sold as of 2005.|$|E
50|$|A {{capacitor}} with {{a relatively}} low capacitance, and relatively high voltage rating, is connected in series with the start winding and remains in the circuit during the entire run cycle. Like other split-phase motors, the main winding is used with a smaller start winding, and rotation is changed by reversing {{the connection between the}} main winding and the start circuit. There are significant differences, however; the use of a speed sensitive <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> requires that other split-phase motors must operate at, or very close to, full speed. PSC motors may operate within a wide range of speeds, much lower than the motor's electrical speed. Also, for applications like automatic door openers that require the motor to reverse rotation often, the use of a mechanism requires that a motor must slow to a near stop before contact with the start winding is re-established. The 'permanent' connection to the capacitor in a PSC motor means that changing rotation is instantaneous.|$|E
50|$|A {{split-phase}} motor has {{a secondary}} startup winding that is 90 electrical {{degrees to the}} main winding, always centered directly between the poles of the main winding, and connected to the main winding {{by a set of}} electrical contacts. The coils of this winding are wound with fewer turns of smaller wire than the main winding, so it has a lower inductance and higher resistance. The position of the winding creates a small phase shift between the flux of the main winding and the flux of the starting winding, causing the rotor to rotate. When the speed of the motor is sufficient to overcome the inertia of the load, the contacts are opened automatically by a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> or electric relay. The direction of rotation is determined by the connection between the main winding and the start circuit. In applications where the motor requires a fixed rotation, one end of the start circuit is permanently connected to the main winding, with the contacts making the connection at the other end.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} founded on 1 November 1919 as Pelger in Rotterdam in the Netherlands by Mr. Willem D. Pelger, with a funding capital of 40 Dutch guilders The company {{started at the}} Zwanesteeg 4 in Rotterdam as a direct current electric motor repair shop. In 1920 the first employee was offered a job. Direct current motors were in use in Rotterdam, {{as a result of}} the direct current power supply instead of alternating current supply in these early days of electric grid. In March 1926 the company moved to the Paardenstraat 5 and in May 1929 they moved on to the Van Speykstraat 86-102 in Rotterdam. In 1936 a centrifugal fan, brake motors and small induction motors program from another manufacturer named HSM (short for: Heinke-Schuitema-Musselkanaal) in Musselkanaal was bought and brought to Rotterdam. Mr. K.W. Heinke, one of the former owners and mechanical engineer of HSM also moved to work at the factory in Rotterdam. In the same year 40 off. patents were applied for, with reference to three inventions: the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch,</b> the centrifugal fan housing and the principle of a squirrel-cage rotor. The Pelger repair shop gradually evolved into a factory designing and manufacturing special electric motors and centrifugal fans. After some time the two original company names Pelger and HSM were changed into a variant of the existing names: Holland Special Machines Pelger or HSM-Pelger.|$|E

40|$|A {{scheme for}} fast {{starting}} of three phase induction motors is proposed. This scheme {{is based on}} starting the motor from a single phase supply {{with the help of}} a phase balancer properly selected for achieving maximum starting torque. As the speed reaches a predetermined value, a simple <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> is used to reconnect the motor to the three phase supply.

40|$|The {{single phase}} {{induction}} motors needs two stator windings to produce {{rotating magnetic field}} : one main winding and the other auxiliary winding. The aim of the auxiliary winding is to create the rotating electromagnetic field when the machine is started-up and is afterwards turned off, generally through the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> coupled together with the shaft of the machine rotor. The main purpose of this document is to evaluate the influence that the two windings have on the external characteristics of the single phase induction motor. For this purpose, two different kinds of windings were carried out and simulated, with the proposal to obtain some benefits. The main winding and the auxiliary winding were prepared and mounted on a prototype. The simulation was done via software based FEM, to make the extraction and results analysis possible. This results are shown at the end this document...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} common issues in {{permanent}} magnet motors for automotive applications is to improve their capability of operating over very wide speed ranges. For this purposes, various motor design techniques have been proposed in the literature. After a brief review of these techniques, the paper presents an idea for improving the flux weakening capability of permanent-magnet reluctance-assisted motors. The idea is based on using an auxiliary field circuit embedded in flux barriers and used to partly demagnetize the motor above the base speed. The field circuit is fed by a brushless permanent-magnet exciter and a diode rectifier. While at low speed the field is not energized, it automatically activates above the base speed by means of a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch.</b> As discussed in the paper, the auxiliary field current increases linearly with the speed so as to progressively reduce motor flux with a consequent beneficial reduction in the current to be fed by the inverter for flux regulation...|$|E

40|$|This paper briefly {{reviews the}} {{different}} types of Switched reluctance (SR) motors with different geometries and then presents a new configuration for a two phase SR motor with step shaped rotor poles. This motor has the ability to start and run in a specified direction without any difficulties. In another words the motor will always have starting torque no matter where the rotor position is. It also presents a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>switch</b> mounted on the motor shaft for a sudden advancement of current-pulses relative to rotor position after reaching a preset motor speed in order to develop higher torque at starting. It continues with the analysis of the machine in generator mode. To evaluate the performance of switched reluctance machine in motoring as well as generating mode, two types of analysis, namely numerical technique and experimental study have been utilized. In the numerical analysis, due to highly non-linear nature of the motor, a three dimensional finite element analysis is employed, whereas in the experimental study, a proto-type motor has been built and tested...|$|E
