30|$|Imaging, {{particularly}} MR, {{plays an}} important role in characterisation of hand lesions. We propose a classification of these lesions into benign, intermediate-grade and malignant lesions based on MR features. Together with established classifications based on lesion depth, size and <b>compartment</b> <b>status,</b> we believe our classification will help further management of focal hand lesions in terms surgical planning and, in cases of primary malignancy, local staging and prognosis. A formal prospective study or systematic review would be useful to validate our proposed classification.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} for a poultry compartment by VPI {{and the prospect of}} further ones motivates the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority to raise the following three questions: 1) What are the additional transmission risks that the (specific) VPI compartment poses during an HPAI epidemic, compared to a situation without compartment?; 2) What are the additional transmission risks that a compartment in general poses during an HPAI epidemic, depending on its characteristics?; 3) What are relevant evaluation criteria for granting the <b>compartment</b> <b>status?</b> In this study we addressed these questions by quantitatively assessing the veterinary risks based on mathematical model calculations, and by qualitatively discussing the (socio) economic aspects...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{compartmentalization}} {{of poultry}} industry components has substantial economic implications, {{and is therefore}} a concept with huge significance to poultry industries worldwide, the current requirements for <b>compartment</b> <b>status</b> are generic to all OIE member countries. We examined the consequences for potential outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the British poultry industry using a metapopulation modelling framework. This framework {{was used to assess}} the effectiveness of compartmentalization relative to zoning control, utilizing empirical data to inform the structure of potential epidemiological contacts within the British poultry industry via network links and spatial proximity. Conditions were identified where, despite the efficient isolation of poultry compartments through the removal of network-mediated links, spatially mediated airborne spread enabled spillover of infection with nearby premises making compartmentalization a more ‘risky’ option than zoning control. However, when zoning control did not effectively inhibit long-distance network links, compartmentalization became a relatively more effective control measure than zoning. With better knowledge of likely distance ranges for airborne spread, our approach could help define an appropriate minimum inter-farm distance to provide more specific guidelines for compartmentalization in Great Britain...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of high resolutioncomputed tomography (HRCT) and magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) for assessment of factors whichwould influence the type and success of surgery in patientsundergoing cochlear implantation. Materials and methods: All patients underwent HRCTimaging while MRI was performed in 38 of them. MRIand HRCT images were evaluated for mastoid cell pneumatization,sigmoid sinus localization, aberrant vascularstructures, congenital anomalies, cochlear stenosis, labyrinthossification, infection, internal acoustic canal width,presence of vestibulo-cochlear nerve, semicircular canals,cerebellopontin area, and cochlear and vestibularaquaduct width. Results: Totally 49 patients (29 males and 20 femaleswith a mean age of 12. 3 years (1 - 61 years) were included. Various abnormalities or congenital anomalies werefound in 35 patients by HRCT and MRI. We observedgrade 1 mastoid cell pneumatization in 58 ears (59. 3 %),grade 2 in 23 (23. 4 %) and grade 3 in 17. Furthermorethe position of sigmoid sinus (p< 0. 001) and mastoidwidth (p< 0. 001) were affected by mastoid cell ventilation. HRCT provides knowledge about mastoid and middle earventilation, cortical bone thickness, round window niche,perilymphatic-endolymphatic <b>compartment</b> and <b>status</b> ofinternal acoustic canal. Pathologies such as otosclerosisand Paget disease that involve otic capsule can berevealed by CT. MRI can provide views of intracochlearviscosity and cochlear opening, semicircular canals, cerebellopontinarea, and vestibulocochlear nerve. Conclusions: HRCT and MRI provide information aboutthe etiology of hearing loss, suitable side for cochlearimplantation and detection of abnormalities or anatomicvariations that may cause complications introperatively.

40|$|Sialic acid immunoglobulin–like lectin (Siglec) - 6 is a transmembrane {{receptor}} {{that binds}} sialyl-TN glycans and leptin. Among eutherian mammals, only human placentas express Siglec- 6. Previous work has implicated Siglec- 6 in preeclampsia (PE). Pree-clampsia, a {{leading cause of}} maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, is characterized by placental abnormalities. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of Siglec- 6 protein expression during human pregnancy by disease state (PE), biologic compart-ment (basal plate, chorionic villi, or maternal plasma), gestational age (24 - 41 weeks), and labor status. Siglec- 6 protein was increased in both the basal plate and chorionic villi of preterm PE placentas (P <. 05). However, expression did not differ at term by disease state, <b>compartment,</b> or labor <b>status.</b> Siglec- 6 was not detectable in maternal serum. Overexpression of Siglec- 6 protein in preterm PE placentas may contribute to or represent a response to PE pathogenesis and suggests that preterm PE pathogenesis is distinct from term PE...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To analyse the {{immunological}} {{interactions between}} the gut lymphoid tissue, synovium, and peripheral blood compartments in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS [...] Patients with RA and AS and healthy controls were orally or parenterally immunised with an influenza virus vaccine. Antigen-specific antibody responses were measured at the single cell level by ELISPOT assay using lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood and from enzymatically dispersed synovial tissues. RESULTS [...] Both oral and parenteral immunisations induced antigen-specific antibody-secreting cells in the synovial tissue of patients with RA. Parenterally immunised patients with RA showed significantly decreased antigen-specific antibody responses in peripheral blood compared with patients with AS and with healthy controls. In contrast, oral vaccination evoked comparable peripheral blood antibody responses in all three study groups. CONCLUSIONS [...] Despite a decreased immune responsiveness in the systemic <b>compartment,</b> the functional <b>status</b> of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue in patients with RA is intact. In addition, {{there is evidence that}} the lymphocytes in the inflamed joints are accessible for signals both from the systemic and mucosal compartments. The findings of immunological 'cross-talk' are relevant to future vaccination and tolerization procedures in patients with RA...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} {{deterministic}} compartmental epidemic models. The conventional mass-mixing assumption is replaced with infectious disease contraction occurring within a heterogeneous network. Modeling infectious diseases with a heterogeneous contact network divides disease <b>status</b> <b>compartments</b> into further sub-compartments by degree class and thus {{allows for the}} finite set of contacts of an individual {{to play a role}} in disease transmission. These epidemiological network models are introduced as switched systems, which are systems that combine continuous dynamics with discrete logic. Many models are investi- gated, including SIS, SIR, SIRS, SEIR type models, and multi-city models. We analyze the stability of these switched network models. Particularly, we consider the transmission rate as a piecewise constant that changes value according to a switching signal. We establish threshold criteria for the eradication of a disease or stability of an endemic equilibrium using Lyapunov function techniques. Simulations are also conducted to support our claims and conclude conjectures. We test constant control and pulse control schemes, including vaccination, treatment, and screening processes for the application of these infectious disease models. Necessary critical control values are determined for the eradication of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Contamination {{routes of}} Listeria monocytogenes were {{examined}} in a chilled food processing plant that produced ready-to-eat and ready-to-reheat meals during an 8 -year period by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. A total of 319 L. monocytogenes isolates were recovered from raw materials (n= 18), the environment (n= 77), equipment (n= 193), and products (n= 31), and 18 different AFLP types were identified, five of which were repeatedly found to be persistent types. The three compartments (I to III) of the plant showed markedly different contamination <b>statuses.</b> <b>Compartment</b> I, which produced cooked meals, was heavily contaminated with three persistent AFLP types. AFLP type A 1 dominated, and it comprised 93 % of the isolates of the compartment. Compartment II, which produced uncooked chilled food, was contaminated with four persistent and five nonpersistent AFLP types. The equipment of compartment III, which produced cooked ready-to-reheat meals, was free of contamination. In compartments that produced cooked meals, the cleaning routines, product types, and lack of compartmentalization seemed to predispose production lines to persistent contamination. The most contaminated lines harbored L. monocytogenes in coolers, conveyors, and packing machines. Good compartmentalization limited the flow of L. monocytogenes into the postheat -treatment area and prevented the undesired movement of equipment and personnel, thus protecting the production lines from contamination. In compartment II, grated cheese was shown to cause product contamination. Therefore, special attention should be paid to continuous quality control of raw ingredients when uncooked ready-to-eat foods are produced. In compartment II, reconstruction of the production line resulted in reduced prevalence rates of L. monocytogenes and elimination of two persistent AFLP types.
