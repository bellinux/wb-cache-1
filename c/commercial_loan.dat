The purchase of the two jets, valued at 3,534.36 million Bhutanese ngultrum (BTN), was the biggest single purchase ever made by Bhutan, and was largely responsible for a 250 percent increase in the Bhutanese trade deficit over the previous year for the financial year 2004–2005. The Bhutanese government issued BTN 1,767.18 million in government bonds to pay for one aircraft and for only the second time in Bhutan's history intended to seek a <b>commercial</b> <b>loan</b> for the other aircraft. However, in October 2004 it announced it would instead seek a soft loan for this purpose.|$|E

Had the CBA kept the BankWest <b>Commercial</b> <b>Loan</b> Book, it (the CBA) would have faced a $49 billion increase in, recurring interest costs, and regulatory and capital holding costs.(Calculation estimate).

500|$|On 30 December 1987, a US$25 million {{order was}} placed with British Aerospace for a BAe 146-100 STOL {{regional}} jet. The {{purchase of the}} aircraft was financed by the government, obtaining, {{for the first time}} in the country's history, a <b>commercial</b> <b>loan.</b> In 1988, the airlines' operational base was shifted from Kolkata to Paro Airport and the airline also hired its first seven flight attendants who were trained by Thai Airways International. On 21 November 1988, the BAe 146 was delivered to Paro Airport. With the introduction of the BAe 146, Drukair was able to widen its network to link Paro with Delhi on 26 November 1988, Bangkok on 28 January 1989 and Kathmandu in April 1989. In the first full year of operational service with the BAe 146, the airline achieved an average load factor of 50–60 percent, more than the 40 percent which was expected, carrying 12,732 passengers over the 19891990 period. In 1990, the runway at Paro Airport was lengthened from [...] to [...] and reinforced for heavier aircraft. A hangar was also constructed for the aircraft, which was funded by the Indian government as part of the Paro Airport Development Project.|$|E

2500|$|The {{accounting}} treatment of CDS used for hedging may not parallel the economic effects and instead, increase volatility. [...] For example, GAAP generally require that CDS be {{reported on a}} mark to market basis. [...] In contrast, assets that are held for investment, such as a <b>commercial</b> <b>loan</b> or bonds, are reported at cost, unless a probable and significant loss is expected. Thus, hedging a <b>commercial</b> <b>loan</b> using a CDS can induce considerable volatility into the income statement and balance sheet as the CDS changes value over its life due to market conditions and due to the tendency for shorter dated CDS to sell at lower prices than longer dated CDS. One can try {{to account for the}} CDS as a hedge under FASB 133 but in practice that can prove very difficult unless the risky asset owned by the bank or corporation is exactly the same as the Reference Obligation used for the particular CDS that was bought.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, Huhne {{cancelled}} an £80 {{million loan}} to Sheffield Forgemasters {{which had been}} pledged by the preceding Labour government to build power plant components. He was criticised by Labour Shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband {{who said that the}} money for the loan had been set aside and would have resulted in at least £110 million returning to the Exchequer. On 1 July 2010, Huhne replied to Miliband saying: [...] "The loan to Sheffield Forgemasters was not a <b>commercial</b> <b>loan.</b> If it was a <b>commercial</b> <b>loan</b> it would have been arranged through the banks and not by the government. It was precisely because of the public subsidy element, {{and the fact that the}} public subsidy element was not affordable, that the government decided not to proceed with it."

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{there was a}} dotted {{abbreviation}} form [...] "per cent.", as opposed to [...] "per cent". The form [...] "per cent." [...] is still in use in the highly formal language found in certain documents like <b>commercial</b> <b>loan</b> agreements (particularly those subject to, or inspired by, common law), {{as well as in}} the Hansard transcripts of British Parliamentary proceedings. The term has been attributed to Latin per centum. The concept of considering values as parts of a hundred is originally Greek. The symbol for percent (%) evolved from a symbol abbreviating the Italian per cento. In some other languages, the form procent or prosent is used instead. Some languages use both a word derived from percent and an expression in that language meaning the same thing, e.g. Romanian procent and la sută (thus, 10% can be read or sometimes written ten for [...] hundred, similarly with the English one out of ten). Other abbreviations are rarer, but sometimes seen.|$|E
