2500|$|The game {{features}} a passive form of crafting, known as Crew Skills, {{in which a}} player's companions carry out gathering and crafting tasks asynchronously to the player's adventures out in the world. [...] Each class gets five companions via their storyline. The player can assign up <b>to</b> five <b>companions</b> <b>to</b> perform up to 3 various skills. Crafting skills allow the player's <b>companions</b> <b>to</b> create items, and the player can reverse engineer many items to possibly learn {{to make a better}} version. The item is destroyed in the process, but the player gets some of the materials back. Gathering skills allow the player or their <b>companions</b> <b>to</b> gather resources out in the world. Mission skills allow the player's <b>companions</b> <b>to</b> perform acts on the player's behalf, gaining the player Light or Darkside influence and other rewards, such as medical items or companion gifts.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{obtained}} high-resolution, high-contrast optical imaging in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey i(') {{band with}} the LuckyCam camera {{mounted on the}} 2. 56 m Nordic Optical Telescope, to search for faint stellar <b>companions</b> <b>to</b> 16 stars harbouring transiting exoplanets. The Lucky imaging technique uses very short exposures to obtain near diffraction-limited images yielding sub-arcsecond sensitivity, allowing us to search for faint stellar companions within the seeing disc of the primary planet host. Here, we report the detection of two candidate stellar <b>companions</b> <b>to</b> the planet host TrES- 1 at separations 6. 5 arcsec and we confirm stellar <b>companions</b> <b>to</b> CoRoT- 2, CoRoT- 3, TrES- 2, TrES- 4 and HAT-P- 7 already known in the literature. We do not confirm the candidate <b>companions</b> <b>to</b> HAT-P- 8 found via Lucky imaging by Bergfors et al., however, most probably because HAT-P- 8 was observed in poor seeing conditions. Our detection sensitivity limits allow us to place constraints on the spectral types and masses of the putative bound <b>companions</b> <b>to</b> the planet host stars in our sample. If bound, the stellar companions identified in this work would provide stringent observational constraints to models of planet formation and evolution. In addition, these companions could affect the derived physical properties of the exoplanets in these systems...|$|R
