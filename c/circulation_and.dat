5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic <b>circulation</b> <b>and</b> the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic <b>circulation</b> <b>and</b> the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} 18th century, {{the penny}} was a small silver coin rarely seen in <b>circulation,</b> <b>and</b> that was principally struck {{to be used for}} Maundy money or other royal charity. Beginning in 1787, the chronic {{shortage}} of good money resulted in the wide circulation of private tokens, including large coppers valued at one penny. In 1797 industrialist Matthew Boulton gained a contract to produce official pennies at his Soho Mint in Birmingham; he struck millions of pennies over the next decade. After that, it was not until 1825 that pennies were struck again for <b>circulation,</b> <b>and</b> the copper penny continued to be issued until 1860.|$|E

5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air <b>circulation,</b> <b>and</b> can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E

5|$|From its inception, the Virginia Lottery {{has sold}} instant ({{scratcher}}) games. Originally, all scratch tickets were $1 each; in the mid-1990s, the first Bingo scratcher was introduced; each Bingo ticket cost $2. Eventually, higher-priced scratchers (including $3, $5, and $10) with larger prizes were introduced. Currently, {{the most expensive}} scratchers in common circulation are $30 each. All $20 and up games currently in <b>circulation</b> <b>and</b> most $10 games offer a top prize of at least $1 million (annuitized). Winners of scratcher annuity prizes of at least $1 million can choose cash (just as in the top prizes in Powerball, Mega Millions, or Cash4Life).|$|E
5|$|However, Alexios's {{problems}} were only just beginning. At {{a time when}} the Emperor urgently needed to raise as much revenue as possible from his shattered empire, taxation and the economy were in complete disarray. Inflation was spiralling out of control, the coinage was heavily debased, the fiscal system was confused (there were six different nomismata in <b>circulation),</b> <b>and</b> the imperial treasury was empty. In desperation, Alexios had been forced to finance his campaign against the Normans by using the wealth of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which had been put at his disposal by the Patriarch of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Andres was {{the first}} named storm and {{hurricane}} of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. Forming on June 21, Andres gradually intensified as it tracked along the Mexican coastline. Deep convection developed around the center of <b>circulation</b> <b>and</b> by June23, the storm attained hurricane-status, peaking with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Upon attaining this intensity, the storm featured a developing eyewall within a central dense overcast. Within 36hours, the storm rapidly degenerated, having most of the convection being displaced by high wind shear, becoming a non-tropical trough during the afternoon of June24.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, editor Hugh Hefner began {{publishing}} Playboy and {{the magazine}} became popular {{because of its}} early Playmates, such as Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, and Anita Ekberg. Mansfield posed nude for the February 1955 issue of Playboy, modeling in pajamas raised so that the bottoms of her breasts showed. This increased the magazine's <b>circulation</b> <b>and</b> helped launch Mansfield's career. Beginning in February 1955, she formed a long-standing relationship with Playboy. Shortly afterward, she posed for the Playboy calendar, covering her breasts with her hands. Playboy featured Mansfield every February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.|$|E

On March 3, 1893, Congress duly passed an act authorising the souvenir coin, which was to be to the specifications of the quarter struck for <b>circulation,</b> <b>and</b> with a design to be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the month, an area of convection persisted in association with a broad low-level circulation about 565km (350mi) west-southwest of Diego Garcia. The disturbance tracked west-southwestward, and on March 2 the Météo-France (MFR) declared it as a weak depression. Initially in an area of moderate wind shear, the system at first failed to maintain deep convection. Early on March 4, convection increased and organized around the center of <b>circulation,</b> <b>and</b> the MFR classified it as Tropical Depression Twelve, about 270km (170mi) southwest of the Agaléga Islands. Initially the MFR forecast that the depression would intensify further before striking Madagascar.|$|E

40|$|Mixing and {{transport}} of passive particles are studied {{in a simple}} kinematic model of a meandering jet flow motivated by the problem of lateral mixing {{and transport}} in the Gulf Stream. We briefly discuss a model streamfunction, Hamiltonian advection equations, stationary points, and bifurcations. The phase portrait of the chosen model flow in the moving reference frame consists of a central eastward jet, chains of northern <b>and</b> southern <b>circulations,</b> <b>and</b> peripheral westward currents. Under a periodic perturbation of the meander's amplitude, the topology of the phase space {{is complicated by the}} presence of chaotic layers and chains of oscillatory and ballistic islands with sticky boundaries immersed into a stochastic sea. Typical chaotic trajectories of advected particles are shown to demonstrate a complicated behavior with long flights in both the directions of motion intermittent with trapping in the circulation cells being stuck to the boundaries of vortex cores and resonant islands. Transport is asymmetric in the sense that mixing between the <b>circulations</b> <b>and</b> the peripheral currents is, in general, different from mixing between the <b>circulations</b> <b>and</b> the jet. The transport properties are characterized by probability distribution functions (PDFs) of durations and lengths of flights. Both the PDFs exhibit at their tails power-law decay with different values of exponents...|$|R
