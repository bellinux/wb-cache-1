40|$|Eukaryotic cilia are complex, highly conserved microtubule-based organelles {{with a broad}} phylogenetic distribution. Cilia {{were present}} in the last {{eukaryotic}} common ancestor and many proteins involved in cilia function have been conserved through eukaryotic diversification. The evolution of these <b>ciliary</b> <b>functions</b> may be inferred from the distribution of the molecular components from which these organelles are composed. By linking protein distribution in 45 diverse eukaryotes with organismal biology, I define an ancestral ciliary inventory. Analysis of these core proteins allows the inference that the cenancestor of the eukaryotes possessed a cilium for motility and sensory function. I show that the centriolar basal body function is ancestral, whereas the centrosome is specific to the Holozoa, and I use this information to predict a number of roles for proteins based on their phylogenetic profile. I also show that while remarkably conserved, significant divergence in ciliary protein composition has occurred in many lineages, such as the unusual centriole of Caenorhabditis elegans and the transitional changes throughout the land plants. I exemplify this divergence through ultrastructural studies of the fern Ceratopteris richardii and the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha both of which have cilia that exhibit a number of distinctive morphological features, the most conspicuous of which is a general breakdown of canonical microtubule arrangements. Cilia have also been lost multiple times in different lineages: at least twice within the land plants. During these evolutionary transitions proteins with ancestral <b>ciliary</b> <b>functions</b> may be lost or co-opted into different functions. I have interrogated genomic data to identify proteins that I predict had an ancestral ciliary role, but which have been maintained in non-ciliated land plants. I demonstrate that several of these proteins have a flagellar localisation in protozoan trypanosomes and I use expression data correlation to predict potential non-ciliary plant roles.

50|$|This {{condition}} is genetically inherited.

We present a method that readily captures rapid snapshots of the ciliary proteome by selectively biotinylating ciliary proteins using a cilia-targeted proximity labeling enzyme (cilia-APEX). Besides identifying known ciliary proteins, cilia-APEX uncovered several ciliary signaling molecules. The kinases PKA, AMPK, and LKB 1 were validated as bona fide ciliary proteins and PKA was found to regulate Hedgehog signaling in primary cilia. Furthermore, proteomics profiling of Ift 27 /Bbs 19 mutant cilia correctly detected BBSome accumulation inside Ift 27 −/− cilia and revealed that β-arrestin 2 and the viral receptor CAR are candidate cargoes of the BBSome.

Transmission electron microscopy revealed a variety of axonemal structures, including a 9 + 0 structure similar to vertebrate primary cilia, a 9 + 0 structure with electron-dense materials in the center, a 9 + 2 structure with no dynein arms, and an axoneme with a disorganized structure at the distal end.

50|$|Excess mucus {{production}} in the bronchi and bronchioles, as may occur in asthma, bronchitis or influenza, resuls from chronic airway inflammation, and hence may be treated with anti-inflammatory medications. Impaired mucociliary clearance due to conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia may also result in its accumulation in the bronchi. The dysregulation of mucus homesotasis is the fundamental characteristic of cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes a chloride channel. This defect leads to the altered electrolyte composition of mucus, which triggers its hyperabsorption and dehydration. Such low-volume, viscous, acidic mucus causes has a reduced antimicrobial function, which facilitates bacterial colonisation. The thinning of the mucus layer ultimately affects the PCL, which becomes dehydrated, compromising <b>ciliary</b> <b>function</b> and impairing mucociliary clearance.|$|E

Recent findings link defects in <b>ciliary</b> <b>functions,</b> planar cell polarity pathway, and centrosome integrity in early cystic development. Many of the signals dysregulated during cystogenesis may converge on the centrosome for its central function as a structural support for cilia formation and a coordinator of protein trafficking, polarity, and cell division.

PrP(C) depletion or overexpression alters the proliferation and differentiation properties of various types of stem and progenitor cells in vitro by unknown mechanisms. Such involvement remains uncertain in vivo {{in the absence of}} any drastic phenotype of mice lacking PrP(C). Here, we report PrP(C) enrichment at the base of the primary cilium in stem and progenitor cells from the central nervous system and cardiovascular system of developing mouse embryos. PrP(C) depletion in a neuroepithelial cell line dramatically altered key cilium-dependent processes, such as Sonic hedgehog signalling and α-tubulin post-translational modifications. These processes were also affected over a limited time window in PrP(C) -ablated embryos.

Here we show, using homozygosity mapping, that the LCA 5 gene on chromosome 6 q 14, which encodes the previously unknown ciliary protein lebercilin, is associated with this disease. We detected homozygous nonsense and frameshift mutations in LCA 5 in five families affected with LCA. In a sixth family, the LCA 5 transcript was completely absent. LCA 5 is expressed widely throughout development, although the phenotype in affected individuals is limited to the eye.

30|$|Generally, {{the results}} from <b>ciliary</b> <b>function</b> testing and EM were in good {{concordance}} with results from the PRMC tests and the final clinical diagnoses. However, some discrepancies were seen. Each of these cases has been elaborated further, {{and they are all}} presented in Table  5. In 17 out of the 21 cases (patient No. 1 – 17), the observed discrepancy is thought to be due to SCD causing false positive tests. In 10 out of these 17 cases (patient No. 8 – 17), the patient had a PRMC test not consistent with PCD while the <b>ciliary</b> <b>function</b> testing was abnormal. The fact that SCD could affect the results of <b>ciliary</b> <b>function</b> testing and not PRMC could be explained in two ways: First, the different tests are not necessarily performed at the same point in time, which means that the degree of SCD affecting the patient might differ between the two tests.

TCTN 2 over-expression in cancer cells resulted in an increased ability to form colonies in an anchorage independent way. On the other hand, downregulation of TCTN 2 using targeted epigenetic editing in cancer cells significantly reduced colony formation, cell invasiveness, increased apoptosis and impaired assembly of primary cilia.

Identification of four genes mutated in NPHP subtypes 1 − 4 (refs. 4 − 9) has linked the pathogenesis of NPHP to <b>ciliary</b> <b>functions</b> 9. Ten percent of affected individuals have retinitis pigmentosa, constituting the renal-retinal Senior-Loken syndrome (SLSN).

40|$|The gold {{standard}} for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a dynein deficiency shown with transmission electron microscopy.

When considering <b>ciliary</b> <b>function,</b> there are similar problems of sensitivity in diagnosis {{and there is also}} a major lack of specificity. Based on the normal <b>ciliary</b> <b>function</b> and ultrastructure and the absence of secondary abnormalities after ciliogenesis in sequential monolayer-suspension culture, the diagnostic value of <b>ciliary</b> <b>function</b> analysis after ciliogenesis was investigated in more than 70 PCD and 640 non-PCD cases. In biopsies, ciliary immotility was found in 66 % of PCD cases but was also found in 8 % of non-PCD cases. PCD was later confirmed in 61 % of the biopsies with ciliary immotility. Normal ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was found in 20 % of PCD biopsies. Coordinated ciliary activity was observed in 10 % of PCD cases. After ciliogenesis in culture, ciliary immotility was present in 78 % of the PCD cases but never in non-PCD cases. CBF was normal after ciliogenesis in 7 % of the PCD cases and was always found in non-PCD cases. Absence of coordinated ciliary activity was found in 100 % of PCD cases and 0 % of non-PCD cases. In conclusion, while <b>ciliary</b> <b>function</b> analysis in a biopsy never proves, nor excludes the diagnosis of PCD, after ciliogenesis in culture CBF measurement can be diagnostic for PCD and reaches 100 % specificity and sensitivity when considering coordinated ciliary activity, making it the single 100 % diagnostic parameter for PCD. status: publishe...|$|E

The molecular mechanisms underlining these fundamental processes remain poorly understood. Here, we report that MNS 1, a coiled-coil protein of unknown function, is essential for spermiogenesis. We find that MNS 1 is expressed in the germ cells in the testes and localizes to sperm flagella in a detergent-resistant manner, indicating {{that it is an}} integral component of flagella. MNS 1 -deficient males are sterile, as they exhibit a sharp reduction in sperm production and the remnant sperm are immotile with abnormal short tails.

40|$|Abstract Ciliopathies {{encompass}} a {{broad array}} of clinical findings associated with genetic defects in biogenesis and/or function of the primary cilium, a ubiquitous organelle involved in the transduction of diverse biological signals. Degeneration or dysfunction of retinal photoreceptors is frequently observed in diverse ciliopathies. The sensory cilium in a photoreceptor elaborates into unique outer segment discs that provide extensive surface area for maximal photon capture and efficient visual transduction. The daily renewal of approximately 10 % of outer segments requires a precise control of ciliary transport. Here, we review the ciliopathies with associated retinal degeneration, describe the distinctive structure of the photoreceptor cilium, and discuss mouse models that allow investigations into molecular mechanisms of cilia biogenesis and defects. We have specifically focused on two ciliary proteins – CEP 290 and RPGR – that underlie photoreceptor degeneration and syndromic ciliopathies.
