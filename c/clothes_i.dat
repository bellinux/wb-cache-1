One gave the following account of the tragedy: [...] "I was bending down to get some tools when I heard screaming. The ladle was falling... fell on {{to the ground and}} then spilled onto my body and burnt [...] <b>clothes.</b> <b>I</b> just ran." [...] Another gave this description of being burned by the steel: [...] "When the steel hit, it felt like being beaten by iron bars -- my brain went blank. I would be dead if I had turned my head".|$|E

[...] He {{said that he had}} made two {{unsuccessful}} attempts to flee from custody before succeeding on his third try. While his official monitors were on the phone, Jiyuan fled to a friend's home, where he remained for two days. He removed the sim card and battery from his cell phone to prevent being tracked. [...] "I did not sleep or get any new <b>clothes,</b> <b>I</b> could not risk being arrested," [...] he recalled. They rented a car and drove to Beijing, and Jiyuan recalled that [...] "I assumed there would be government people at the train station." [...] Whenever they neared police officers, he would {{get out of the car}} and walk to prevent being spotted.|$|E
500|$|Divine became {{increasingly}} known for outlandish stunts onstage, each {{time trying to}} outdo {{what he had done}} before. At one performance in London's Hippodrome coinciding with American Independence Day, Divine rose up from the floor on a hydraulic lift, draped in the American flag, and declared: [...] "I'm here representing Freedom, Liberty, Family Values, and the fucking American Way of Life." [...] When he performed at the London Gay Pride parade, he sang on the roof of a hired pleasure boat that floated down the Thames past Jubilee Gardens. At a performance Divine gave at the Hippodrome {{in the last year of}} his life, he appeared onstage riding an infant elephant which had been hired for the occasion. Divine was nevertheless not happy with being known primarily for his drag act, and told an interviewer that [...] "my favorite part of drag is getting out of it. Drag is my work <b>clothes.</b> <b>I</b> only put it on when someone pays me to", a view he echoed to his friends.|$|E

500|$|As he {{was writing}} the film in 1985, John Hughes kept track of his {{progress}} in a spiral-bound logbook. He noted that the basic storyline was developed on February 25. It was successfully pitched the following day to Paramount Studios chief Ned Tanen. Tanen was intrigued by the concept, but wary that the Writers Guild of America was hours away from picketing the studio. Hughes wrote the screenplay {{in less than a}} week. Editor Paul Hirsch explained that Hughes had a trance-like concentration to his script-writing process, working for hours on end, and would later shoot the film on essentially what was his first draft of the script. [...] "The first cut of Ferris Bueller's Day Off ended up at two hours, 45 minutes. The shortening of the script had to come in the cutting room", said Hirsch. [...] "Having the story episodic and taking place in one day...meant the characters were wearing the same <b>clothes.</b> <b>I</b> suspect that Hughes writes his scripts with few, if any costume changes just so he can have that kind of freedom in the editing." ...|$|E
500|$|Bharathiraja wanted Chithra Lakshmanan, {{who was an}} {{assistant}} director with K. Bhagyaraj, to sign Kamal Haasan {{for the role of}} Chappani, expecting to pay Kamal [...] since the actor had received [...] for Aayirathil Oruthi (1975). When Kamal asked for , Lakshmanan suggested that Bharathiraja offer the role to Sivakumar since the production unit could not afford Kamal's request; however, Bharathiraja saw Kamal as the ideal choice and agreed to pay him [...] For his character, the actor grew his curly hair long and wore lungis and khadi high-buttoned shirts. In 2017, Kamal recalled, [...] "Years ago, a man sporting a soiled dhoti and shirt came to my office to narrate a script. Had I turned the offer down {{on the basis of his}} dirty <b>clothes,</b> <b>I</b> wouldn’t have been here talking to you. After listening to the script, I realised that he was such a genius and the movie was the cult classic , and he was none other than ace Bharathiraja sir". Bharathiraja also recalled that he showed a [...] "handsome Kamal Haasan in an ugly way" [...] as he wanted to prove that characters need not always be attractive, and to break this stereotype in the film industry.|$|E
500|$|During this period, he billed {{himself as}} Thomas (or Thos) Stevens, but reorganised {{the name to}} its {{backward}} spelling of Mot Snevets; the name {{did not last long}} and he changed it to Thomas Terry. He soon realised that people were mistaking him as a relative of Dame Ellen Terry, so inverted the name to Terry Thomas. He did not add the hyphen until 1947, and later explained that it was [...] "not for snob reasons but to tie the two names together. They didn't mean much apart; together they made a trade name": the hyphen was also [...] "to match the gap in his front teeth". By now, he was developing a unique sense of style both on and off stage. In order to avoid staining his fingers with smoke, he used a cigarette holder and later purchased [...] "the most irresistible holder in Dunhill's. It was slightly [...] because it was made of lacquered, black whangee... with a gold band twisting neatly round it". Adding to his look were a [...] "monocle, raffish waistcoat and red carnation". He later wrote that [...] "sartorially I was an eccentric. But I knew that underneath the <b>clothes</b> <b>I</b> was very much a conservative Englishman who {{would have loved to have}} been a genuine eccentric".|$|E

2500|$|She {{became a}} writer and lecturer, {{supporting}} such issues as health care, temperance, women's rights, and dress reform for women. She was frequently arrested for wearing men's clothing, and insisted on her right to wear clothing that she thought appropriate. She wrote two books that discussed women's rights and dress. She replied to criticism of her attire: [...] "I don't wear men's <b>clothes,</b> <b>I</b> wear my own clothes." ...|$|E
2500|$|And a {{woman was}} there who had been subject to {{bleeding}} for twelve years.

2500|$|In 1973, {{after her}} split from Elvis, Presley {{set up a}} joint venture with her friend and stylist Olivia Bis. Together they opened a {{clothing}} boutique in Los Angeles called Bis & Beau. Elvis was supportive of Priscilla's venture, and even contacted several friends in public relations to help with promotion for the launch. In a 1973 interview to promote the opening of the store, Priscilla said, [...] "After the separation, I had to make up my mind about what I wanted to do, and since I had worked with Olivia {{for such a long time}} on my own <b>clothes,</b> <b>I</b> decided to try it professionally. We both do the designing for the shop, and have people who sew for us." [...] The shop was a successful venture, with celebrity clients including Cher, Lana Turner, Barbra Streisand, and Natalie Wood shopping there regularly. The shop closed in 1976.|$|E

2500|$|You scold {{me so much}} in {{the nice}} long letter which I have this moment {{received}} from you, that I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together. I can expose myself however, only once more, because he leaves the country soon after next Friday, on which day we are to have a dance at Ashe after all. He is a very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man, I assure you. But as to our having ever met, except at the three last balls, I cannot say much; for he is so excessively laughed at about me at Ashe, that he is ashamed of coming to Steventon, and ran away when we called on Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago.[...] [...]After I had written the above, we received a visit from Mr. Tom Lefroy and his cousin George. The latter is really very well-behaved now; and as for the other, he has but one fault, which time will, I trust, entirely remove — it is that his morning coat is a great deal too light. He is a very great admirer of Tom Jones, and therefore wears the same coloured <b>clothes,</b> <b>I</b> imagine, which he did when he was wounded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was shot on 28 January 2010 by Kostas Kapetanidis, who Tamta had first collaborated with in 2005 for her debut video for [...] "Ftais", {{and has since}} {{directed}} her videos [...] "Den Teleionei Etsi I Agapi", [...] "Agapise Me", and [...] "Agapo", while he has also collaborated with Rouvas on multiple occasions since 1995, including on [...] "Ela Mou", [...] "Mia Fora", [...] "Shake It", both versions of [...] "S'eho Erotefthi", [...] "1000 Milia", [...] "Horis Kardia", and [...] "Irthes". The video was shot at Studio Rapti in Melissia from noon and did not conclude until the next morning. MAD TV crews were on set during shooting and did a photo report that same day. The concept of the video plays on a yin yang-type theme, with the light and darkness, innocence and eroticism continuously altering, thus contrasting with the song's title. Tamta's multiple wardrobe changes, varying between [...] "classy and trendy" [...] were meant {{as a means of}} further highlight these contradictions. MAD TV claimed that the shooting of the video was [...] "demanding". Tamta spoke about the emotions of the video and her image, saying: I feel absolutely sexy and for that are not responsible only the <b>clothes.</b> <b>I</b> feel sexy even without needing to wear something provocative. However, I am sure, as my collaborators are that this video clip will be the sexiest thing that I have done up until now.|$|E
