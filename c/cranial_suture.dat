5000|$|His {{patients}} had microcephaly from craniosynostosis and {{were thought to}} be imbeciles. These patients accordingly underwent craniectomy to remove the involved suture line and to [...] "release the brain". Soon after, in 1891, linear craniectomy was introduced. As with any new procedure, this one met with much resistance. However, the resistance to a surgical intervention was slowly put to rest with mounting evidence. Several studies indicated that craniosynostectomy was the treatment of choice for the release of fused suture lines in the skull. Studies showed that, over time, <b>cranial</b> <b>suture</b> areas excised during strip craniectomy still became fused and led to an abnormal cranial contour.|$|E
40|$|About the Book Both {{a memoir}} and a medical study, this unique work explores the {{extensive}} and tragic reach of craniosynostosis, the premature fusing of the <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures</b> in infants. The author—born with craniosynostosis in 1975 —documents {{his and his}} family’s struggles, weaving his story into a broader view of this birth defect. Included are interviews with respected craniofacial surgeons, neurosurgeons and pediatric anesthesiologists, {{an explanation of the}} major types of craniosynostosis, and a summary of the modern medical history of <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures,</b> as well as ancient treatments dating to the time of Hippocrates. The experiences of 11 American families affected by craniosynostosis are chronicled, demonstrating the uniqueness of each case and each treatment. Their stories illustrate the surgical techniques now being used to release <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures,</b> allowing the brain to grow naturally—though not every story ends this way.

50|$|The age {{at death}} of an {{individual}} can be determined from several skeletal markers, including <b>cranial</b> <b>suture</b> closure, tooth eruption rates, rates of epiphyseal fusion on long bones, and others. Cranial bones fuse together along suture lines throughout the life of every human, {{and can be used}} to estimate the {{age at death}} of human remains. The small size and lack of suture closure of Anzick-1's crania revealed that the individual was 1-2 years old. The metopic suture is also present in the frontal bone of Anzick-1. This suture is present in most human infants but closes well before adulthood. The presence of a frontal suture in Anzick-1's remains corroborates the age estimation of 1-2 years old.|$|E
50|$|Metopism is the {{condition}} of having a persistent metopic suture, or persistence of the frontal metopic suture in the adult human skull. The premature fusion of cranial sutures named craniosynostosis, it is “simple” when only one <b>cranial</b> <b>suture</b> is involved and “compound” when two or more cranial sutures are involved. Metopism {{is a kind of}} craniosynostosis. The main factor of metopic synostosis is to increase the volume of the anterior cranial fossa. The frontal bone includes the forehead, and the roofs of the orbits (bony sockets) of the eyes. The frontal bone has vertical portion (squama) and horizontal portion (orbital part). Some adults have a metopic or frontal suture in the vertical portion. In uterine period in right and left half of frontal region of the fetus there is a membrane tissue. On each half a primary ossification center appears {{about the end of the}} second month of the fetus. Primary ossification center extends to form the corresponding half of the vertical part (squama) and horizontal part (orbital part) of the frontal bone.At birth the frontal bone contains two portions, separated by the metopic (frontal) suture. Metopism is {{the condition}} of having a persistent metopic suture. Metopic suture is regularly obliterated, except at its lower part, by the eighth year, but infrequently persists throughout life. There is no single proven cause of metopism. The occurrence is from mild to serious situations. Visional, learning, and behavioral problems may happen in serious metopism. Some don't need any medical treatment. Surgery is a successful approach for those who need it. Treatment teams include: neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, neurologists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, audiologists, neuroscience nursing professionals, speech therapists, physical therapists, dentist, otolaryngologists, ophthalmologists, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers.|$|E

50|$|The word pansynostosis is also Greek derived {{and can be}} {{translated}} as 'all one bone', indicating {{that all of the}} sutures are closed. In general practice, the term is used to describe the children with three or more <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures</b> closed.|$|R
40|$|Pycnodysostosis {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive skeletal dysplasia caused {{by the absence of}} active cathepsin K, which is a lysosomal cysteine protease that plays a role in degrading the organic matrix of bones, acting in bone resorption and bone remodeling. The disease is primarily characterized by osteosclerosis, bone fragility, short stature, acro-osteolysis, and delayed closure of the <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures.</b> A differing feature, cranial synostosis, has occasionally been described in this disorder. We reviewed six unrelated patients with pycnodysostosis (mean age of 10 years and 4 months) in order to evaluate the presence of craniosynostosis. In addition to the typical findings of the condition, they all presented premature fusion of the corona! suture. Although none of them showed signs of cranial hypertension, one patient had had the craniosynostosis surgically corrected previously. These data suggest that the <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures</b> in pycnodysostosis can display contradictory features: wide <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures,</b> which are commonly described, and craniosynostosis. The clinical impact of this latter finding still remains to be elucidated. Further studies are necessary to address more precisely the role of cathepsin K in suture patency.

40|$|During craniofacial development, the Hedgehog (HH) {{signaling}} pathway is essential for mesodermal tissue patterning and differentiation. The Hedgehog family consists of three protein ligands: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Indian Hedgehog (IHH), and Desert Hedgehog (DHH), of which two are expressed in the craniofacial complex (IHH and SHH). Dysregulations in HH signaling are well documented {{to result in a}} wide range of craniofacial abnormalities, including holoprosencephaly, hypotelorism, and cleft lip/palate. Furthermore, mutations in HH effectors, co-receptors, and ciliary proteins result in skeletal and craniofacial deformities. <b>Cranial</b> <b>suture</b> morphogenesis is a delicate developmental process that requires control of cell commitment, proliferation and differentiation. This review focuses on both what is known and what remains unknown regarding HH signaling in <b>cranial</b> <b>suture</b> morphogenesis and intramembranous ossification. As demonstrated from murine studies, expression of both SHH and IHH is critical to the formation and fusion of the cranial sutures and calvarial ossification. SHH expression has been observed in the <b>cranial</b> <b>suture</b> mesenchyme and its precise function is not fully defined, although some postulate SHH to delay <b>cranial</b> <b>suture</b> fusion. IHH expression is mainly found on the osteogenic fronts of the calvarial bones, and functions to induce cell proliferation and differentiation. Unfortunately, neonatal lethality of deficient mice precludes a detailed examination of their postnatal calvarial phenotype. In summary, a number of basic questions are yet to be answered regarding domains of expression, developmental role, and functional overlap of HH morphogens in the calvaria. Nevertheless, SHH and IHH ligands are integral to <b>cranial</b> <b>suture</b> development and regulation of calvarial ossification. When HH signaling goes awry, the resultant suite of morphologic abnormalities highlights the important roles of HH signaling in cranial development...|$|E
40|$|Craniosynostosis, the {{premature}} {{fusion of}} one or more cranial sutures of the skull, provides a paradigm for investigating the interplay of genetic and environmental factors leading to malformation. Over the past 20 years molecular genetic techniques have provided a new approach to dissect the underlying causes; success has mostly come from investigation of clinical samples, and recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing have dramatically enhanced the study of the human as the preferred "model organism. " In parallel, however, we need a pathogenetic classification to describe the pathways and processes that lead to <b>cranial</b> <b>suture</b> fusion. Given the prenatal onset of most craniosynostosis, investigation of mechanisms requires more conventional model organisms; principally the mouse, because of similarities in <b>cranial</b> <b>suture</b> development. We present a framework for classifying genetic causes of craniosynostosis based on current understanding of <b>cranial</b> <b>suture</b> biology and molecular and developmental pathogenesis. Of note, few pathologies result from complete loss of gene function. Instead, biochemical mechanisms involving haploinsufficiency, dominant gain-of-function and recessive hypomorphic mutations, and an unusual X-linked cellular interference process have all been implicated. Although few of the genes involved could have been predicted based on expression patterns alone (because the genes play much wider roles in embryonic development or cellular homeostasis), we argue that they fit into a limited number of functional modules active at different stages of <b>cranial</b> <b>suture</b> development. This provides a useful approach both when defining the potential role of new candidate genes in craniosynostosis and, potentially, for devising pharmacological approaches to therapy...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cranial</b> <b>sutures</b> are {{specialized}} structures {{composed of}} the sutural mesenchyme, the overlying scalp, the dura and osteogenic fronts. Each one of these structures express important proteins for osteogenic maturation, membranous ossification of skull bones, and homeostasis of <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures</b> in a differential, spatial and temporal manner. These proteins include fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its receptors (FGFR), the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), as well as transcription factors TWIST and MSX 2, among others. The alteration in the expression {{of one or more}} of these proteins causes multiple pathological conditions; one of them is the premature closure of one or more <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures,</b> known as craniosynostosis. This malformation is commonly treated with surgery. However, advances in the fields of molecular and cellular biology have allowed to conduct research on some proteins involved in the development of craniosynostosis. The results of these studies can lead to future preventive therapeutic strategies that may be used as a complement to the surgical treatment of craniosynostosis. Possible strategies include the use of specific drugs that can regulate the expression and activation of FGF signaling pathways, TGF-β or BMPs, to prevent or avoid craniosynostosis or re-synostosis after a surgery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Closure of <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures</b> {{progresses}} with age; therefore, macroscopic {{assessment of}} <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures</b> {{has been used}} as one method of age estimation. Postmortem computed tomography (PMCT), which many forensic medical depart-ments and institutes have begun to adopt, has the potential to simplify the gathering of information from <b>cranial</b> <b>sutures</b> for both surface and cross-sectional evaluation. To examine the feasibility of age estimation by cross-sectional multidetector computed tomography images of the sagittal suture, PMCT findings of 125 subjects of known age and sex were retro-spectively reviewed. The sagittal suture was divided into four segments, and 20 cross-sectional slices from each segment were analyzed. These slices were each categorized by visual evaluation into one of the seven stages defined by Harth et al. according to the degree of closure. The mean stage value of 20 slices was calculated for each segment. We were able to evaluate cross-sectional images of the sagittal suture by PMCT, and a positive correlation between age and closure degree was observed. Despite the prediction interval achieved with this method not being superior to traditional macroscopic or flat-panel CT assessment, multidetector CT is a potentially useful tool, in conjunction with other methods, for age esti-mation, particularly in adult females and in cases where only a skull is the sole remain...|$|R
