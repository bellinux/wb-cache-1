5|$|Fluorine {{reacts with}} lead at room temperature, forming lead(II) fluoride.

5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to cerium(III) oxide with {{hydrogen}} gas. Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it is ground or scratched, the resulting shavings catch fire. This reactivity conforms to periodic trends, since cerium {{is one of the}} first and hence one of the largest lanthanides. Cerium(IV) oxide has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium. Many nonstoichiometric <b>chalcogenides</b> are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) <b>chalcogenides</b> remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|The thallium(I) halides are stable.

Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium-oxide–nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium–cadmium <b>chalcogenides</b> are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage applications, such as in hard disks. Dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the permanent magnets used in electric car motors and wind turbine generators.|$|E
5|$|Samarium forms {{trivalent}} sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent <b>chalcogenides</b> SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt {{crystal structure}} are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state {{at room temperature}} upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, {{but there is a}} sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the sensor}} field, <b>chalcogenide</b> glasses are well {{established}} membranes or thin film materials for potentiometric sensors which select heavy metal ions in various liquid media. Besides these potentiometric sensors, <b>chalcogenide</b> glasses have also specific optical {{characteristics such as}} a wide transmission window (0. 4 - 20 µm) and which makes them easy {{to be used as}} optical fibers or in integrated optical devices for sensitive detection of chemical, biological or environmental variations.

That is why the <b>chalcogenide</b> glasses must be synthesized in the tubes from special conditioned quartz for to avoid the quartz will {{be the source of}} oxygen impurities.

25|$|Glass {{optical fibers}} {{are almost always}} made from silica, but some other materials, such as fluorozirconate, fluoroaluminate, and chalcogenide glasses as well as {{crystalline}} materials like sapphire, are used for longer-wavelength infrared or other specialized applications. Silica and fluoride glasses usually have refractive indices of about 1.5, but some materials such as the <b>chalcogenides</b> can have indices as high as 3. Typically the index difference between core and cladding is less than one percent.|$|E
25|$|Thallium is a soft, {{reactive}} metal (MH 1.0), {{so much so}} that it has no structural uses. It has a close-packed crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) but an abnormally large interatomic distance that has been attributed to partial ionisation of the thallium atoms. Although compounds in the +1 (mostly ionic) oxidation state are the more numerous, thallium has an appreciable chemistry in the +3 (largely covalent) oxidation state, as seen in its <b>chalcogenides</b> and trihalides. It {{is the only one of}} the Group 13 elements to react with air at room temperature, slowly forming the amphoteric oxide Tl2O3. It forms anionic thallates such as Tl3TlO3, Na3Tl(OH)6, NaTlO2, and KTlO2, and is present as the Tl− thallide anion in the compound CsTl. Thallium forms Zintl phases, such as Na2Tl, Na2K21Tl19, CsTl and Sr5Tl3H.|$|E
25|$|The heavier chalcogens sulfur, selenium, and {{tellurium}} {{are known}} to form thorium <b>chalcogenides,</b> {{many of which have}} more complex structure than the oxides. Apart from several binary compounds, the oxychalcogenides ThOS (yellow), ThOSe, and ThOTe are also known. The five binary thorium sulfides – ThS (lustrous metallic), Th2S3 (brown metallic), Th7S12 (black), ThS2 (purple-brown), and Th2S5 (orange-brown) – may be produced by reacting hydrogen sulfide with thorium, its halides, or thoria (the last if carbon is present): they all hydrolyse in acidic solutions. The six selenides are analogous to the sulfides, with the addition of ThSe3. The five tellurides are also similar to the sulfides and selenides (although Th2Te5 is unknown), but have slightly different crystal structures: for example, ThS has the sodium chloride structure, but ThTe has the caesium chloride structure, since the Th4+ and Te2− ions are similar in size while the S2− ions are much smaller.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chalcogenide</b> glass {{materials}} as membranes for potentiometric sensors for chemical analysis in solutions, e. g., ion-selective electrodes, {{have been studied}} {{for more than three}} decades. Already in the 1970 's, first papers dealt with the ion-sensing properties of <b>chalcogenide</b> glasses, followed by systematic investigations of their solid-state chemistry, the sensing mechanism and their analytical characteristics. Combining the analytical performance of <b>chalcogenide</b> glass membranes with techniques originally invented for semiconductor processing, a new generation of silicon-based thin-film sensors with <b>chalcogenide</b> glass materials for heavy metal detection has been created. In the beginning, co-sputtering of Cu and As 2 Se 3 resulted in a Cu 2 +-selective field-effect sensor, while in recent years, a variety of <b>chalcogenide</b> glass materials have been stoichiometrically deposited onto ISFETs (ion-sensitive field-effect transistor), EIS (electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor), LAPS (light-addressable potentiometric sensor) and RISE structures, respectively, serving as miniaturized chemical sensors.

40|$|We {{computationally}} study fiber loss {{in negative}} curvature fibers made with silica, As 2 S 3 <b>chalcogenide,</b> and As 2 Se 3 <b>chalcogenide</b> glasses with a fixed core-diameter-to-wavelength ratio of 30. We consider both simple and nested geometries as the transmission wavelength varies. At wavelengths shorter than 4. 5 µm, silica negative curvature fibers have a loss that is around or below 0. 1 dB/m and are preferable to <b>chalcogenide</b> fibers. At wavelengths longer than 4. 5 µm, it {{is preferable to}} use As 2 S 3 <b>chalcogenide</b> or As 2 Se 3 <b>chalcogenide</b> negative curvature fibers since their loss is one or more orders of magnitude lower than the loss of silica negative curvature fibers. With nested negative curvature fibers, <b>chalcogenide</b> fibers have losses that are {{lower than those of}} silica fibers at wavelengths larger than 2 µm. However, it is still preferable to use silica nested negative curvature fibers at wavelengths less than 4. 5 µm and with a loss around or lower than 0. 1 dB/m due to the fabrication advantages of silica fibers...|$|R
30|$|Here, it is {{necessary}} to mention that the doping of <b>chalcogenide</b> glasses by transitional metals and rare-earth element changes besides optical, structural, and magnetic properties also changes thermal and luminescent properties of <b>chalcogenide</b> glasses [15].|$|R

40|$|The opto-mechanical effect {{observed}} in amorphous <b>chalcogenide</b> films deposited onto clamped STM cantilevers [1] has been investigated. In this, bandgap light, incident on the <b>chalcogenide</b> film and linearly polarized either parallel or {{perpendicular to the}} cantilever axis, reversibly causes respectively either a contraction or {{an expansion of the}} <b>chalcogenide</b> layer, resulting in an optically-actuated displacement of the free end of the clamped cantilever. This effect is electronic, not thermal, in origin, and is believed to be caused by the same photo-induced structural rearrangements that are responsible for the optically induced optical anisotropy {{observed in}} <b>chalcogenide</b> glasses. Possible applications of this new all-optical actuation for optical switching will be discussed...|$|R
30|$|Photostimulated {{structural}} changes in vacuum-deposited films of <b>chalcogenide</b> glass have three components: reversible, irreversible, and transient (which occurs only during {{exposure of the}} photoresist and rapidly relax after switching off the light) [14, 15]. Using of <b>chalcogenide</b> films as photoresist traditionally was associated exactly with irreversible changes in their solubility.

For example, sodium can react with sulfur to form the sulfide (Na2S) and various polysulfides with the formula Na2Sx (x from 2 to 6), containing the [...] ions. Due to the basicity of the Se2− and Te2− ions, the alkali metal selenides and tellurides are alkaline in solution; when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium, alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the [...] and [...] ions. They may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present, and are colourless, water-soluble compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium or tellurium. The alkali metal polonides are all ionic compounds containing the Po2− ion; they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around 300–400°C.|$|E
