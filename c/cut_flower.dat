40|$|Ornamental {{plants such}} as <b>cut</b> <b>flowers</b> are {{protected}} from pests {{through the application of}} plant protection products. This brings up the question of whether residues of active sub-stances in plant protection products pose a hazard to the health of florists as well as con-sumers. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has reviewed literature and data of other institutions in order to assess the potential health risks of <b>cut</b> <b>flowers</b> from European production and the main export countries of such products. After reviewing available data, the Institute has reached the conclusion that <b>cut</b> <b>flowers</b> available on the German market pose no health risk to consumers.

5|$|B. sceptrum is principally {{used in the}} <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> industry, {{with the}} {{immature}} spikes being commonly sold in florists around Australia. It is occasionally grown in gardens as its bright flower spikes are prominent, but requires a Mediterranean (dry summer) climate and good drainage as it is sensitive to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 26 to 47 days to germinate. A dwarf form is in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its high}} {{resistance}} to P.cinnamomi dieback, the feasibility of using B.integrifolia as a rootstock for susceptible Banksia species in the <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> trade is under investigation. Presently, the success rate for grafting is only 30–40%, and even with successful grafts {{there is a tendency}} for the union to fail under stress.

Ramularia vallisumbrosae is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, Phoma narcissi (leaf tip blight). Aecidium narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.|$|E
5|$|The {{floral emblem}} for its {{home state of}} New South Wales, Telopea speciosissima has {{featured}} prominently in art, architecture, and advertising, particularly since Australian federation. Commercially grown in several countries as a <b>cut</b> <b>flower,</b> it is also cultivated in home gardens, requiring good drainage yet adequate moisture, but is vulnerable to various fungal diseases and pests. A number of cultivars with various shades of red, pink and even white flowers are available. Horticulturists have also developed hybrids with T.oreades and T.mongaensis which are more tolerant of cold, shade, and heavier soils.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant is}} {{fairly easy to}} grow in a {{mediterranean}} climate with good drainage and a light (sandy) soil; however, with medium to high susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, it is unreliable in conditions that favour {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mould, such as summer humidity or poor drainage. The use of phosphite fungicides does reduce the spread of Phytophthora. It generally does poorly in eastern Australia, although it is grown commercially in southeastern South Australia as a <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> crop. It is also grown in California and Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|The shrub {{grows on}} sandy soils in {{seasonally}} wet lowland {{areas as well}} as hills and dunes. It regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its underground lignotuber. Pollinators include honeyeaters, particularly the western spinebill, which can access the nectar with its long curved bill, and the silvereye, which punctures the flower tube. The most commonly cultivated Adenanthos species in Australia, it has a long flowering period and attracts honeyeaters to the garden. It is harvested for the <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum can {{be grown}} in large pots or window boxes, and is a good pioneer plant in the garden until other plants become more established. Lower-growing cultivars are {{suitable}} for hanging baskets and border plantings. The flowers attract butterflies to the garden. Dried flowers are long lasting—up to some years—and are used in floral arrangements and the <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> industry. More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers. The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the wilting of stems, so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements. Immersing flowers in glycerol or polyethylene glycol also lengthens lifespan.|$|E
5|$|A fast-growing and {{attractive}} plant, Banksia speciosa grows readily {{in a sunny}} location in dry climates on well-drained soil, but does poorly in areas of humid summer climate, such as Australia's east coast. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia serrata and B.integrifolia to enable cultivation in these areas. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 41 days to germinate. A specimen flowered in a greenhouse in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1830. Banksia speciosa is an important <b>cut</b> <b>flower</b> crop. It {{was one of several}} species considered for commercial cropping in Tenerife, and trials showed that seedlings were moderately tolerant to salinity.|$|E
40|$|Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum indicum) {{as one of}} horticultural {{commodities}} has a good prospect to {{be developed}} as source of country revenue. The export of <b>cut</b> <b>flowers</b> of chrysanthemum from Indonesia tends to increase year by year. However, Thrips parvispinus Karny (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) which is major insect pest of chrysanthemum often attacks this flower in the field until postharvest causing the decrease of quality of flowers. The poor quality of <b>cut</b> <b>flowers</b> of chrysanthemum including the presence of T. parvispinus will be rejected by foreign businesses. Therefore, control measures of this insect pest by quarantine officers are important. Treatment can be done using liquified formulation phosphine fumigant. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the concentration of liquified formulation phosphine and exposure time which will were effectively kill T. parvispinus and to evaluate the quality of <b>cut</b> <b>flowers</b> of chrysanthemums treated with phosphine fumigant. T. parvispinus was exposed to liquied formulation phosphine at 9 concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200 ppm) with 3 exposure times (1, 3, and 6 hours).
