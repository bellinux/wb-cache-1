25|$|Cremation {{of bodies}} {{containing}} amalgam restorations results in near-complete emission of the mercury into the atmosphere, {{as the temperature}} in cremation is far greater than the boiling point of mercury. In countries with high cremation rates (such as the UK), mercury has become a great concern. Proposals to remedy the situation have ranged from removing amalgam-containing teeth prior to cremation to installing activated <b>carbon</b> <b>adsorption</b> or other post-combustion mercury capture technology in the flue gas stream. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, {{it is estimated that}} globally about 3.6 tonnes of mercury vapor was emitted into the air through cremation in 2010, or about 1% of total global emissions. Mercury emissions from cremation are growing in the US, both because cremation rates are increasing and because the number of teeth in the deceased are increasing due to better dental care. Since amalgam restorations are very durable and relatively inexpensive, many of the older deceased have amalgam restorations. According to work done in Great Britain, mercury emissions from cremation are expected to increase until at least 2020.|$|E

50|$|Low-temperature thermal {{desorption}} (LTTD), {{also known as}} low-temperature thermal volatilization, thermal stripping, and soil roasting, is an ex-situ remedial technology that uses heat to physically separate petroleum hydrocarbons from excavated soils. Thermal desorbers are designed to heat soils to temperatures sufficient to cause constituents to volatilize and desorb (physically separate) from the soil. Although they are not designed to decompose organic constituents, thermal desorbers can, depending upon the specific organics present and {{the temperature of the}} desorber system, cause some organic constituents to completely or partially decompose. The vaporized hydrocarbons are generally treated in a secondary treatment unit (e.g., an afterburner, catalytic oxidation chamber, condenser, or <b>carbon</b> <b>adsorption</b> unit) prior to discharge to the atmosphere. Afterburners and oxidizers destroy the organic constituents. Condensers and <b>carbon</b> <b>adsorption</b> units trap organic compounds for subsequent treatment or disposal.|$|E
30|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of hydrogen}} sulphide on rhodium {{has only been}} studied sparingly [5, 7, 9, 10]. Nevertheless, there is good agreement about what is expected from hydrogen sulphide adsorption at room temperature over highly dispersed Rh/silica catalysts. Our value of 0.6 : 1 S:Rh is typical for sulphur adsorption on Rh/silica [7, 9], as is the ~ 1 : 1 correspondence between hydrogen sulphide <b>adsorption</b> and <b>carbon</b> monoxide <b>adsorption.</b> <b>Carbon</b> monoxide <b>adsorption</b> over rhodium can be described by three adsorbed states, linear Rh–CO, bridge-bonded Rh 2 –CO, and gem-dicarbonyl RhI(CO) 2. The ratio of CO:Rh obtained with the silica catalyst suggests principally bridged and linear sites, which implies a similar bonding model for sulphur. This is {{in accordance with the}} work of Sachtler et al. [10]. Over Rh/alumina, a S:Rh ratio of ~ 1 : 1 is obtained, which is higher than that observed with the silica catalyst. This is the opposite of what is found with <b>carbon</b> monoxide <b>adsorption</b> and hydrogen sulphide adsorption over Pt/alumina, where the alumina-supported catalyst gave a lower ratio [8]. The greater than 1 : 1 CO:Rh ratio was expected over the alumina supported catalyst, as it is known that the gem-dicarbonyl RhI(CO) 2 species can be formed leading to a greater than 1 : 1 ratio. Interestingly, the hydrogen sulphide adsorption follows the same trend as the <b>carbon</b> monoxide <b>adsorption.</b> It is normally assumed that sulphur occupies a multiply bonded site such as a threefold hollow [10] on a Rh(111) face, but the commonality in <b>adsorption</b> ratios between <b>carbon</b> monoxide and hydrogen sulphide suggests that on highly dispersed supported metals there may be a number of adsorption modes.|$|R

Among main methods that are being developed for CO 2 capture and separation, <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>adsorption</b> is of great interest due to its low energy consumption, low equipment cost and easiness for application. In this work, a new simple-to-use correlation, which is easier than current available models involving a large number of parameters, requiring more complicated and longer computations, is presented to predict accurately the <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>adsorption</b> isotherms for a molecular sieve as a function of temperature and carbon dioxide partial pressure. This correlation predicts the <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>adsorption</b> isotherms for <b>carbon</b> dioxide partial pressures and temperatures up to 120 kPa and 470 K respectively. The promising method to develop correlation for accurate prediction of <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>adsorption</b> isotherms could be extended for CO 2 capture and separation for the wide range of adsorbents including various molecular sieves just by readjusting the tuned coefficients. The average absolute deviation between reported data and the proposed correlation is around 4 %. Simple-to-use approach can be of immense practical value for the Engineers and Scientists to have a quick check on adsorption capacities of a given adsorbent at various temperatures and pressures without performing any experimental measurements. In particular, personnel dealing with regulatory bodies of greenhouse gas abatement, process industries would find the proposed approach to be user friendly involving no complex expressions with transparent calculations...|$|R
