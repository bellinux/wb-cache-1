2500|$|Winer started DaveNet, [...] "a stream-of-consciousness {{newsletter}} {{distributed by}} e-mail" [...] in November 1994 and maintained Web {{archives of the}} [...] "goofy and informative" [...] 800-word essays since January 1995, which earned him a <b>Cool</b> <b>Site</b> of the Day award in March 1995. From the start, the [...] "Internet newsletter" [...] DaveNet was widely read among industry leaders and analysts, who experienced it as a [...] "real community." [...] Dissatisfied {{with the quality of}} the coverage that the Mac and, especially, his own Frontier software received in the trade press, Winer saw DaveNet as an opportunity to [...] "bypass" [...] the conventional news channels of the software business. Satisfied with his success, he [...] "reveled in the new direct email line he had established with his colleagues and peers, and in his ability to circumvent the media." [...] In the early years, Winer often used DaveNet to vent his grievances against Apple's management, and as a consequence of his strident criticism came to be seen as [...] "the most notorious of the disgruntled Apple developers." [...] Redacted DaveNet columns were published weekly by the web magazine HotWired between June 1995 and May 1996. DaveNet was discontinued in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{peculiar}} tracks on the album include [...] "Bonsai People", which is a Red Hot Chili Peppers type funk metal song. The lyrics compare childlike people to bonsai trees {{in a way that}} they are tiny (humble, God-fearing) but as a strong breed they can endure the rending of wind (temptation) since their roots are deeply entrenched into soil (word of God). [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] on the other hand is a dark, melodic black metal type song which begins with oppressive clean guitaring. With a haunting voice a person whispers the words [...] "Hell is a totally <b>cool</b> <b>site,</b> so let's get there, all right?". This sentence is probably an attempt to describe the attitude of some of the black metal fans; the lyrics tell that those who say things like that are under the 'spell of hell' which the devil uses to mislead people. Consecutively, it can be said that [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] was Deuteronomium's way of expressing their stance on the black metal movement which had at that time become very popular, with Emperor and likes being played on the Finnish metal radio program 'Metalliliitto', as the band members recall in an interview. [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] became Deuteronomium's best known song. The songs [...] "III" [...] and [...] "Northern Praise" [...] are also black metal influenced and present more worshipful lyrics, the forementioned is vocalized in Finnish and refers to the trinity of God. The latter is also a somewhat popular song as it is noted for being one of their best known songs. The self-titled song [...] "Street Corner Queen" [...] is a punk rock influenced death metal song about a prostitute, the lyrics tell that she sells love though deep inside she knows that it's not love at all, and that she seeks comfort from wrong ways. [...] "Druglord" [...] is another punk rock influenced death metal track. The lyrics are written from the perspective of a young person who suffers from drug addiction.|$|E

40|$|To {{identify}} the structures to be rapidly transported through the axons, {{we developed a}} new method to permit local cooling of mouse saphenous nerves in situ without exposing them. By this method, both anterograde and retrograde transport were successfully interrupted, while the structural integrity of the nerves was well preserved. Using radioactive tracers, anterogradely transported proteins were shown to accumulate just proximal to the <b>cooled</b> <b>site,</b> and retrogradely transported proteins just distal to the <b>cooled</b> <b>site.</b> Where the anterogradely transported proteins accumulated, the vesiculotubular membranous structures increased in amount inside both myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Such accumulated membranous structures showed a relatively uniform diameter of 50 - 80 nm, {{and some of them}} seemed to be continuous with the axonal smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Thick sections of nerves selectively stained for the axonal membranous structures revealed that the network of the axonal SER was also packed inside axons proximal to the <b>cooled</b> <b>site.</b> In contrast, large membranou...|$|R
40|$|Predicted warmer climates {{are likely}} to {{negatively}} affect production systems and expose smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, whose adaptive capacity is limited mainly due to poverty, to food insecurity. We studied the performance of selected varieties representing short, medium and long duration growth periods of four crops (maize (Zea mays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) at two pairs (wet and dry) of 2050 s climate analogue sites. Climate analogues, based on 30 years metereological data, were identified in smallholder areas of Zimbabwe. The sites were Kadoma (722 mm annual mean rainfall; 21. 8 oC annual mean temperature) which was the higher-temperature analogue site for Mazowe (842 mm annual mean rainfall; 18. 2 oC annual mean temperature) for wetter areas, and Chiredzi (541 mm annual mean rainfall; 21. 3 oC annual mean temperature) which was the higher-temperature analogue site for Matobo (567 mm annual mean rainfall: 18. 4 oC annual mean temperature) for drier areas. First season (2011 / 12) results showed that for the wetter pair, maize and groundnut grain yields were significantly higher at the <b>cooler</b> <b>site</b> (Mazowe). Sorghum yields {{were not significantly different}} between the sites and there was no grain yield for cowpea at the <b>cooler</b> <b>site</b> due to a fungal disease. Varietal yield differences were only significantly higher (P< 0. 05) at the <b>cooler</b> <b>site</b> for groundnut where the short duration variety had the highest yield (3809 kg/ha) and the medium duration variety the lowest yield (1420 kg/ha), compared with 140 - 355 kg/ha at the hotter site where growth was poor for all varieties. For the drier sites, maize, sorghum and cowpea grain yields were higher at the <b>cooler</b> <b>site</b> (Matobo) compared with the hotter sites (Chiredzi) but varietal differences were not significant.
