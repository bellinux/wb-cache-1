5|$|The {{preferred}} breeding {{habitat in}} Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird. The clutch {{of four or}} five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup-shaped nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 11–12days. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10days after hatching. Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year. The garden warbler is strongly migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but <b>closed</b> <b>forest</b> and treeless Sahel are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration, figs being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds.|$|E

40|$|In this study, two {{different}} change detection techniques were applied {{in order to}} assess land cover changes in El Rawashda forest, Sudan: comparison of classification and multivariate alteration detection. Firstly, two satellite imagery, acquired in 2003 by Landsat ETM+ and by ASTER in 2006, were classified into four main land cover classes namely grass land, <b>close</b> <b>forest,</b> open forest and bare land. A change matrix was created in order to map the land cover changes from 2003 to 2006. Generally, the results show a noticeable increase in area on both <b>close</b> <b>forest</b> and open forest areas with decrease in grass lands within the period 2003 - 2006. More than one third of grassland (36 %) was converted to <b>close</b> <b>forest,</b> one fourth (24 %) to open forest areas. In the three-year period, 9079 hectares of open forest, (8 % of the investigation area), were transformed to <b>close</b> <b>forest.</b> Secondly, we perform linear transformation by applying the multivariate alteration detection (MAD), the MAD components were then examined to identify the quality of changes. 1...|$|R

The coastal lowlands were extensively vegetated with Melaleuca woodlands in low lying, poorly drained coastal areas.

25|$|The <b>closed</b> <b>forest</b> types such as {{broadleaf}} {{forests and}} rainforests {{are usually not}} grazed owing to the closed structure precluding grass growth, and hence offering little opportunity for grazing. In contrast the open structure of savannas allows {{the growth of a}} herbaceous layer and are commonly used for grazing domestic livestock. As a result, much of the world's savannas have undergone change as a result of grazing by sheep, goats and cattle, ranging from changes in pasture composition to woody weed encroachment.|$|E

40|$|The {{association}} between {{land use and}} land cover changes between 1979 - 2004 in a 2. 26 -million-hectare area south of the Gran Chaco region and Trypanosoma cruzi infection in rural communities was analysed. The extent of cultural land, open and <b>closed</b> <b>forests</b> and shrubland up to 3, 000 m around rural communities in the north, northwest and west of the province of Córdoba was estimated using Landsat satellite imagery. The T. cruzi prevalence was estimated with a cross-sectional serological survey conducted in the rural communities. The land cover showed the same patterns in the 1979, 1999 and 2004 satellite imagery in both the northwest and west regions, with shrinking regions of cultured land and expanding <b>closed</b> <b>forests</b> away from the community. The <b>closed</b> <b>forests</b> and agricultural land coverage in the north region showed the same trend as in the northwest and west regions in 1979 but not in 1999 or 2004. In the latter two years, the coverage remote from the communities was either constant or changed in opposite ways {{from that of the}} northwest and west regions. The changes in <b>closed</b> <b>forests</b> and cultured vegetation alone did not have a significant, direct relationship with the occurrence of rural communities with at least one person infected by T. cruzi. This study suggests that the overall decrease in the prevalence of T. cruzi is a consequence of a combined effect of vector control activities and changes in land use and land cover...|$|R
500|$|A. rubrum {{is one of}} {{the first}} plants to flower in spring. A crop of seeds is {{generally}} produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year. A single tree between [...] in diameter can produce between 12,000 and 91,000 seeds in a season. A tree [...] in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds. Red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples. [...] Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application. The seeds are epigeal and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released, assuming a small amount of light, moisture, and sufficient temperatures are present. If the seeds are densely shaded, then germination commonly does not occur until the next spring. Most seedlings do not survive in <b>closed</b> <b>forest</b> canopy situations. However, one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy and though they eventually die if no light reaches them, they serve as a reservoir, waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above. Trees growing in a Zone 9 or 10 area such as Florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north, Canada, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples. Due to their wide range, genetically the trees have adapted to the climatic differences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Our {{research}} {{illustrates how}} a landscape mosaic changes {{in association with}} a mixed natural-anthropogenic disturbance history. Our study area is the Northwest Wisconsin (USA) Sand Plain (NWSP), a region with a rich disturbance history including fire, insects and clearcut forestry. We integrated historic airphotos from 1938, 1960, 1980 and 1998 within a GIS to describe change among four landcover classes describing a canopy-closure gradient: <b>closed</b> <b>forests,</b> woodlands, savannas and ‘‘open barrens’’. Our work addresses two literature needs: empirical studies of mixed-disturbance landscapes, and nonforest habitats within a forest matrix. Our analysis shows that: the area of open barrens fluctuated, woodlands and savannas declined severely and <b>closed</b> <b>forests</b> in-creased through time. Falling median patch sizes and other landscape metrics suggest that the woodlands are becoming more fragmented. The landcover transitions driving this change vary according to time and place. The dominant transitions are toward <b>closed</b> <b>forests</b> from all classes, and transitions toward open barrens are also consistently important. The woodlands, savannas and open barrens habitats are mostly comprised of transient patches, persisting for less than 20 years. This contrasts with <b>closed</b> <b>forests</b> that often persist for 40 plus years. These changes {{are consistent with the}} disturbance regime that is shifting from fire- to forestry-dominance. Our results show a trend towards landscape simplification, manifest as losses of intermediate-density habitats (woodland and savanna) and shrinking patch sizes. The transient nature of the nonforest habitats shows that distur-bance resulting in total or partial canopy removal will be vital for their conservation at a landscape scale...|$|R

Indiana bats foraged under the dense oak-hickory forest canopy along ridges and hillsides in eastern Missouri, but rarely over streams. Indiana bats {{have been detected}} foraging in upland forest [...] in addition to riparian areas such as floodplain forest edges. Romme and others [...] also suggested that foraging habitat would ideally have 50% to 70% canopy closure. Indiana bats rarely utilize open agricultural fields and pastures, upland hedgerows, open water, and deforested creeks for traveling or foraging.|$|E
2500|$|In eastern Vichada, Colombia, the white-fronted {{capuchin}} {{is found}} in large groups of around 35 individuals, while to the south in <b>closed</b> <b>forest</b> (perhaps {{as a result of}} competition with the tufted capuchin) it has an average group size of 8–15 individuals. A group in Vichada used a home range of about , while Terborgh found a home range of more than [...] and Matthews calculated [...] Near the type locality in gallery forest and islands of forest in Vichada, the species has an ecological density of around 30 individuals/km2. In forests with closed-canopy in Colombia and in southern Vichada, many areas have very low densities.

Low densities in many parts of the Colombian Amazon make it difficult to detect the presence of the species in many parts.|$|E
