In 2013 researchers at the Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database {{to ensure that the}} scores were comparable over time. Several <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> removed since 2008 {{due to the fact that}} the compilers agreed that the GPI would include nations, but not micro-states.

5|$|Some {{parts of}} Western Europe, {{especially}} Scandinavian <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> creating family friendly {{policies that have}} aided them in equalizing the gender difference in {{participation in the work}} force.

Government aid in providing care to the elderly and the young have enabled women in Scandinavia {{to be a part of}} the working population in nearly a high rate as men. Examples of government aid include paid parental leave and benefits and post maternity re-entry programs. Such programs have led to a greater participation of women in the workforce, as well as a higher birth rate, and a robust economy.|$|E

5|$|America's Asian {{conflicts}} against Japan, North Korea, and North Vietnam brought Sun Tzu to {{the attention}} of American military leaders. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the continuing education of personnel in the art of war. The Art of War is mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings. Similarly, Sun Tzu's Art of War is listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program. During the Gulf War in the 1990s, both Generals Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Colin Powell employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points. However, the United States and other Western <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> criticised for not truly understanding Sun Tzu's work and not appreciating The Art of War within the wider context of Chinese society.|$|E
