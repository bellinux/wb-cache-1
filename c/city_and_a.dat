5|$|As a result, a {{bill was}} {{proposed}} in the House of Commons that sought to punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city. Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and eventually whittled down the bill so much {{that by the time}} it was voted on, it simply proposed to fine the city and disqualify the Provost. In exchange for his work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the Freedom of the <b>City</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> diamond, which is still in the possession of his family. Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.|$|E
5|$|As the war {{turned against}} the Austrians, the {{garrison}} in Bologna left {{early in the morning}} on 12 June 1859. By the end of the same day the papal colours flying in the squares had been replaced with the Italian green, white and red, the cardinal legate had left the <b>city,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> group styling itself Bologna's provisional government had proclaimed its desire to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. Bologna was promptly incorporated as part of the province of Romagna. The Archbishop Michele Viale-Prelà attempted to persuade the citizenry not to co-operate with the new civil authorities, but had little success. One of the new order's first official acts was to introduce freedom of religion and make all citizens equal before the law. In November 1859 the governor Luigi Carlo Farini issued a proclamation abolishing the inquisition.|$|E

In 1954, according to the Soviet file on him in From Russia, With Love, Bond is made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.|$|E
5|$|Bolton {{were playing}} {{in their second}} League Cup Final, having lost the 1995 edition 2–1 to Liverpool. Middlesbrough too had never {{previously}} won the competition: in 1997 they lost the final after extra time in a replay against Leicester <b>City,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> year later they lost 2–0 to Chelsea after extra time. In 1997, they also lost the FA Cup final to Chelsea, and were relegated from the Premier League. Although Middlesbrough, founded in 1876, were without a major trophy, Bolton had 4 FA Cups from 7 finals between 1894 and 1958.|$|E

On 1 April 1974, Bristol became a local government district of the county of Avon. The city regained its independence and county status on 1 April 1996, when Avon was abolished and Bristol became a unitary authority.|$|E

5|$|Coventry is {{an ancient}} <b>city</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{metropolitan}} borough in the West Midlands of England. The city's history dates back to at least the 11thcentury (CE), and by the 14thcentury, it was a thriving centre of commerce. Like several of the other monuments in the city, Coventry's city walls were erected {{towards the end of}} the 14th and the beginning of the 15thcenturies, though city walls served little defensive purpose by that time and were largely a status symbol.|$|E
5|$|Dramatic changes {{began in}} Odense in the 18th century to modernise the <b>city</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> great plan was drawn up for development. In 1720, Frederick IV ordered the {{rebuilding}} of Odense Palace, partly on {{the foundations of the}} 13th century St. Hans’s Monastery, and the construction of St Hans’s Church by the Knights Hospitallers. An 8 kilometre (5.0mi) long, 7.5 metre (25ft) deep canal from Odense Harbour to Odense Fjord was built between 1796 and 1806 to facilitate the growth of Odense as a port city, radically increasing its level of trade and population. Founded in 1796, Odense Teater is the first provincial theatre in Denmark and the country's second oldest. Odense Central Library was established in 1924 and removed to Odense station in 1995. The Odense Music Library contains Denmark's largest collection of phonograms.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, various freeway {{projects}} in the Detroit area were cancelled or scaled back in scope. The route of I-96 along Grand River Avenue was cancelled in response to freeway revolts in the <b>city,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> new routing along the C Railroad right-of-way in Livonia was used instead. Plans to transfer the Davison Freeway in the 1970s to state control and extend it west to I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) and east to a Van Dyke Freeway (extended M-53) were dropped. Another freeway project near Lansing, the Van Atta Connector, was proposed in 1961 to provide an eastern freeway beltway around East Lansing, but by 1981 the highway's impact to neighboring elementary schools along with larger economic impacts led to the project's cancellation.|$|E

Other tourists reportedly stayed in the homes of some Okinawa residents, while some residents in landslide-prone areas evacuated to higher ground. Seven people were injured in Nanjo from a fallen signboard, while an elderly woman in Nago <b>City</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> young girl in Yaese suffered wind-related injuries.|$|E

5|$|Libraries in Denmark {{are also}} {{cultural}} and community centres. They {{play an active}} role in the cultural life and host many events, exhibitions, discussion groups, workshops, educational courses and facilitate everyday cultural activities for and by the citizens. In June 2015, the large central library and cultural centre of Dokk1 opened at the harbour front. Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services, commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park and aims to be a landmark for the <b>city</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> public meeting place. The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and streetscape is also collectively known as Urban Mediaspace Aarhus and it is the largest construction project Aarhus municipality has ever undertaken. Apart from this large main library, some neighbourhoods in Aarhus have a local library engaged in similar cultural and educational activities, but on a more local scale.|$|E
