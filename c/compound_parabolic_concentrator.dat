40|$|Abstract. For medium range {{temperature}} applications, focusing type collectors like <b>Compound</b> <b>Parabolic</b> <b>Concentrator</b> (CPC) {{are most}} commonly used. Consi-derable research {{work has been}} carried out to improve the performance of the two-dimensional <b>compound</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>concentrator</b> (2 D CPC). The three-dimensional <b>compound</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>concentrator</b> (3 D CPC) was found to be more efficient than 2 D CPC because of the higher concentration ratio. In the present work a 3 D CPC was fabricated with a half acceptance angle of 4 ◦ for a spherical absorber of radius 100 mm. UV stabilized aluminized polyester foil having high reflectivity (0 · 85) was pasted on the reflector for a total height of 441 mm and an aperture width of 540 mm. The optical efficiency was estimated theoretically and compared with the experimental value. Experimentally determined values of optical and thermal efficiencies were in good agreement with theoretically predicted value. The exper-imental results shown that the optical efficiency obtained from the 3 D CPC (0 · 626) was significantly higher than that of the 2 D CPC (0 · 570) of similar dimensions. Since the optical efficiency of the 3 D CPC was increased, the thermal efficiency of the collector was also increased. In addition to that, time constant of the concen-trator was also calculated. The time constant of the 3 D CPC (431 s) was fairly high when compared with the 2 D CPC (110 s). An attempt was made to generate low pressure steam using 3 D CPC in the in situ steam generation mode.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{cost-effective}} concentrating photovoltaic system {{composed of a}} prism and a <b>compound</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>concentrator</b> (P-CPC). In this approach, the primary collector consists of a prism, a solid <b>compound</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>concentrator</b> (CPC), and a slab waveguide. The prism, which {{is placed on the}} input aperture of CPC, directs the incoming sunlight beam to be parallel with the main axes of parabolic rims of CPC.

Simulation results show that the optical efficiency of a P-CPC can achieve up to 89 %. when the concentration ratio of the P-CPC is fixed at 50. We also determine an optimal geometric structure of P-CPC based on simulation. Because of the simplicity of the P-CPC structure, a lower-cost mass production process is possible.
