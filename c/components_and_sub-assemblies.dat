40|$|Tolerances {{within an}} {{assembly}} are defined during {{the setting of}} engineering specifications in the design phase. However, during assembly process execution, certain assembly variations arise from the individual components, manufacturing imperfections, material compliance, {{the means by which}} they are fastened and the assembly sequence used. The implementation work reported in this article utilises in-process assembly measurement information for predicting dimensional variation of the aero structure assembly process. A framework is exploited in the case study for predicting the dimensional influence of (1) designed tolerances, (2) designed assembly processes <b>and</b> (3) <b>component</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-assembly</b> level measurement data for revising the assembly sequence if any concessions were issued on manufactured components. Considerable learnings are achieved while managing dimensional variation of in-process aerospace assembly structure. Dimensional variation simulation is found to be overestimating variation spread even after considering compliance of non-rigid components. Thus, in-process measurement data (<b>component</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-assembly</b> level) has to be integrated in the variation analysis in order to reduce variation spectrum. Case-based scenarios are discussed where design and measurement data can be utilised for estimating dimensional variation of the in-process assembly...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade an {{important}} body of work has noted several factors determining {{the ability of a}} firm to ?green? or account for ecological factors within its supply chain, most notably the willingness of a focal firm to engage in collaboration with its suppliers. Limited research has, however, focused exclusively on the impact of regulatory instruments to achieve this. Since 1 January 2006, EU End of Life Vehicle (ELV) Directive has demanded that all automobiles manufactured in the EU for domestic use have a recyclable content of 85 per cent (moving to 95 per cent by 2015), so that each can be reclaimed, dismantled and recycled {{at the end of its}} useful life. This has the effect of forcing automotive OEMs to green their supply chain as they must ensure that all <b>component</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-assembly</b> manufacturers alter or redesign their products to comply with the regulation. Qualitative research undertaken with 38 automotive component manufacturers in the UK is utilized to examine the impact of the EU ELV Directive and its ability to instigate greener supply chain practices within such firms. It is found that pressure to comply with the EU ELV Directive alone was insufficient to encourage greening. Instead, factors witnessed within existing research, particularly customer?supplier collaboration, were necessary for greener practices to be adopted. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Mixed-model {{production}} is {{the production of}} a wide range of product models using a certain degree of shared resources and common material. It is commonly accepted that modern manufacturing places a greater pressure on producers for more choice in the product offering. Products are increasingly assembled from standard <b>components</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-assemblies,</b> using machines and automated systems as well as manual labour. DFT is designed to handle this mix and provide a way to establish mixed-model production lines.|$|E
50|$|During {{the decades}} {{following}} the war, while other mainstream automakers increasingly used components bought in from specialist suppliers, Peugeot stood out {{on account of}} the extent to which they manufactured in-house their own <b>components</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-assemblies,</b> with the result that Peugeot’s Sochaux facility performed an unusually broad range of manufacturing activities. However, at the end of the 1990s, at the instigation of the then chairman Jean-Martin Folz, there was an acceptance that manufacturing all your own components was not the most cost-effective approach to auto-making, and several departments were closed down, including the central tool production facility, the seating factory and the foundry.|$|E
50|$|It {{does not}} apply to fixed {{industrial}} plant and tools. Compliance {{is the responsibility of the}} company that puts the product on the market, as defined in the Directive; <b>components</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-assemblies</b> are not responsible for product compliance. Of course, given the fact that the regulation is applied at the homogeneous material level, data on substance concentrations needs to be transferred through the supply chain to the final producer. An IPC standard has recently been developed and published to facilitate this data exchange, IPC-1752. It is enabled through two PDF forms that are free to use.|$|E
40|$|Dimensioning and {{tolerancing}} (D&T) is {{a multidisciplinary}} problem which requires {{the fulfillment of}} a large number of dimensional requirements. However, almost all of the currently available D&T tools are only intended for use by the designer. In addition, they typically provide solutions for the requirements one at time. This paper presents a methodology for determining the dimensional specifications of the <b>component</b> parts <b>and</b> <b>sub-assemblies</b> of a product by satisfying all of its requirements. The comprehensive solution strategy presented here includes: a strategy for separating D&T problems into groups, the determination of an optimum solution order for coupled functional equations, a generic tolerance allocation strategy, and strategies for solving different types of D&T problems. A number of commonly used cost minimization strategies, such as the use of standard parts, preferred sizes, preferred fits, and preferred tolerances, have also been incorporated into the proposed methodology. The methodology is interactive and intended for use in a concurrent engineering environment by members of a product development team...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first of two which present a {{methodology}} for determining the dimensional specifications of all the <b>component</b> parts <b>and</b> <b>sub-assemblies</b> of a product according to their dimensional requirements. To achieve this goal, two major steps are followed, each of which is described in a paper. In the first paper, all relationships necessary for finding the values of dimensions and tolerances are represented in a matrix form, known as a Dimensional Requirements/Dimensions (DR/D) matrix. In the second paper, the values of individual dimensions and tolerances are determined by applying a comprehensive solution strategy to satisfy all the relationships represented in the DR/D matrix. The methodology is interactive and suitable for use in a concurrent engineering (CE) environment. The graphical tool presented in this paper will assist a CE team in visualizing the overall D&T problem and foreseeing the ramifications of decisions regarding the selection of dimensions and tolerances. This will assist the CE team to systematically determine all the controllable variables, such as dimensions, tolerances, and manufacturing processes...|$|R

50|$|Nevertheless, the {{economics}} of auto-production were changing, as increases in wage levels and employment taxes encouraged greater standardisation of <b>components</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-assemblies</b> and {{the beginnings of the}} accelerating automation revolution that transformed manufacturing in the final decades of the twentieth century. These developments involved capital investment on a scale that the volumes available to a firm like Deutsch could never justify, and the continuing labour-intensive nature of the cabriolet conversion business created an ever-widening cost gap between the standard cars and the cabriolet versions with which, apart from the roof and some body strengthening inserts, they shared virtually all their components. The prices necessary to accommodate those cost differences became too high to be passed on to car buyers. Growing public debate about the perceived lack of secondary safety available from open topped cars further reduced demand for Deutsch cabriolet conversions. Operations came to an end in 1971.|$|E

[...] His brother Emil, now aged 74, took on sole responsibility for the company, but the financial difficulties persisted and in 1934, with the business undergoing an extensive restructuring {{at the direction of}} the Dresdner Bank, Emil also died.On 12 June 1933 Gläserkarosserie G.m.b.H was founded, effectively a new company formed from the remnants of the bankrupt old one. Leadership passed to Willy Bachmann, by training a plumber, who had married Heuer's daughter, Johanna, in 1929. Dresdner Bank was the principal banker of Gläserkarosserie G.m.b.H and also of Auto Union, another Saxony based auto-business that underwent a major restructuring in order to survive the aftermath of the Great Depression. During the remained of the 1930s Gläserkarosserie produced cabriolet and other bespoke bodies for Auto Union brands, notably luxury bodies for Horch cars, but they were also producing bodies for use with chassis from other mainstream German car makers including Opel and BMW. [...] From 1935 the factory was also supporting German rearmament with special bodies for [...] "commando/staff cars" [...] based on Steyr and Skoda chassis, and specialist conversions of Ford and Opel commercial vehicles.

50|$|In much of industry, {{including}} the auto-industry, the immediate post-war years were characterised by industrial unrest, and Ford’s Poissy plant was badly affected. Nevertheless, in October 1948 the North American designed Ford Vedette, still {{powered by the}} company’s familiar V8 2158cc engine, made its first appearance at a Paris Motor Show: this quickly became Poissy’s principal model and during the early 1950s it certainly sold better than the aged Ford F-472A had. Nevertheless, François Lehideux who took over from Maurice Dollfus in January 1950 {{was known to be}} dissatisfied with aspects of the new car. Sales volumes were disappointing, and although the engine was produced in-house and final assembly took place at the Poissy plant, other <b>components</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-assemblies</b> were bought in which was believed to make production vulnerable to supplier problems. Scope for improvement was limited by shortage of investment cash and the limited market for cars with engines above 2 litre in size {{in a country where the}} tax regime heavily penalised larger engines. Nevertheless, a new V8 model for Ford of France was pencilled in for 1954.In the late 1940s politics in Europe had become highly polarised and Henry Ford will have been aware of the continuing popularity of the French Communist Party, routinely winning 25% of the votes in national elections till the mid-1950s, buoyed both by the delicate state of the French economy and by the prominent role played by communists in the French Resistance. The strikes that afflicted Ford’s Poissy plant, and the poor industrial relations tradition of Renault’s plant at nearby Boulogne-Billancourt will have done nothing to reassure Ford about the future direction of the French economy, and it became known that Ford were looking to sell their French manufacturing business, of which the Poissy plant was the principal fixed asset. Henri Pigozzi, the Turin born boss of Simca must have taken a more positive view of the outlook for the French auto-industry, and in 1954 Ford sold their French manufacturing business to Simca along with rights to the new model that it was about to launch. Poissy’s new model would be sold with a wide range of names, and in many export markets it would be badged as a Ford during its first few years, but in retrospect it is remembered as the Simca Vedette, and in France it came with a Simca badge from the start.|$|E
