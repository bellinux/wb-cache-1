40|$|Abstract. The {{finite element}} method is adopted to analyze the pre-loaded <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> {{according}} {{to the theory of}} contact mechanics. The effects of hollow ratio on the radial stiffness of bearings, the maximum contact stress of rollers, and the maximum radial load of bearing are analyzed. The analysis results show that the smaller the hollowness is, the larger the radial stiffness of pre-loaded <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> the maximum contact stress of the rollers, and the maximum radial load of the bearing would be. Under different magnitude loads, the reasonable combination of interference magnitude with the hollowness can not only increase the stiffness of roller bearings, but also decrease the maximum stress of rollers, which provides a reference for the design and manufacture of pre-loaded <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings...</b>|$|E

In {{view of the fact}} that the nonload area is ubiquitous in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> there is a method for prolonging the fatigue life design by adjusting the working clearance of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> In this article, optimization model of fatigue life of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is developed with a quasi-dynamic method and calculated method of bearing life based on micro-area contact, considering the effect of assembly interference, temperature rise, and high-speed centrifugation.

The results show that the optimum fatigue life of roller bearings is achieved at negative working clearance with the loads distributed evenly within half ring. The optimum working clearance of roller bearings is not influenced by radial load.

40|$|In this work, a {{three-dimensional}} dynamic simulation model for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is developed based on multi-body-simulation software SIMPACK and programming language FORTRAN. The {{aim of this}} work {{is to build a}} universal program to calculate the dynamic behavior of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> This simulation model integrates major part of the functionalities according to {{the state of the art}} of existing programs which are: the slice model, the mutual influences of neighboring slices, the basic three-dimensional model, the calculation of lubricant film thickness and damping forces, the radial clearance, the roller-pocket clearance, the centrifugal forces and the hysteresis damping forces. The extended functionalities in this work can be summarized as follows: 1) Roller-pocket contact stiffness is taken into account and calculated with the help of finite element analysis. 2) The three types of cage guidance are modeled in details which are roller guidance, inner ring guidance and outer ring guidance. 3) The geometry of cage pocket is modeled for contact detection. 4) The elasticity of cage is built through importing the reduced finite element models. This extended model of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is validated with the measurements and shows good agreement.

40|$|AbstractBearings are key {{components}} of cone bit, thus its rapid failure is {{a major cause of}} leading to lower life of the bit. To improve the bearing performance and prolong working life, contact mechanics of hollow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> of cone bit was simulated. Effects of hollow size, drilling pressure, friction coefficient and fitting clearance on mechanics performance of the bearing were studied. The results show that the maximum equivalent stress of the hollow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> appears on the claw journal, and the maximum contact stress appears on the contact pair of the hollow roller. Besides, hollow sizes have a greater impact on the equivalent stress and contact stress of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller,</b> while the influence on the stress of the cone and claw journal is relatively small. With the increasing of the drilling pressure and fitting clearance, equivalent stress and contact stress of bearing parts increase. The friction coefficient has little impact on mechanical performance of the bearing. As the 121 / 4 SWPI 517 type hollow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> of cone bit an example, the optimal hollow size is 55 %, the drilling pressure is 140 Â kN and the fitting clearance is 0 â€“ 0. 02 Â mm...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to numerically {{investigate}} one source of acoustic noise in roller bearings, that which results from the motion of the rollers in the bearing under zero exter-nal load. For the sake of simplification, it was assumed that the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are infinitely long. Furthermore, the effects of the following on the noise of the bearing were also examined: the radial clearance of the bearing, the viscosity of the lubricant, and the number of rollers. The results of the study show that the fundamental frequency of the noise components of the cylindrical roller bearing corresponds to the multiplica-tion of the number of rollers and the whirling frequency of the roller center. The acoustical frequency spectra of the cylindrical roller bearing are pure tone spectra, containing the fundamental frequency of the roller bearing and its superharmonics.
