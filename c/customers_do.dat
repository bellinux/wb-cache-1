25|$|There was a {{controversy}} with moving broadcasts to Fox Sports Florida since Orlando's largest cable TV provider, Bright House Networks, did not carry the network. Pressure increased for the cable provider {{to pick up}} FS Florida {{in time for the}} 2007–08 NBA season but this did not happen. The Magic persisted with airing games on FS Florida into the 2008–09 season despite Bright House's refusal to pick up the channel in all of its affiliates. Recently, Bright House and FS Florida came to an agreement on January 1, 2009 and have begun airing the channel as part of its standard cable package. However, Bright House airs the channel using a digital signal that only allows customers who own the Digital cable box to receive the channel. The <b>customers</b> <b>do</b> not have to pay any additional costs to get the channel with their Digital cable box.|$|E

2500|$|On April 27, 2016, Comcast {{announced}} that it would raise its data cap in trial markets to 1 TB by June 2016; the company stated that [...] "more than 99 percent of our <b>customers</b> <b>do</b> not come close to using a terabyte." [...] The decision to raise the cap came following an implication of increased scrutiny surrounding them by the FCC: in its approval of Charter Communications' purchase of Time Warner Cable, the Commission stipulated that Charter must not implement caps. As previously, a $10 overage fee is charged for every 50GB above the limit, and customers can purchase an add-on for [...] "unlimited" [...] data, but its price was increased to $50.
