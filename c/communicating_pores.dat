40|$|Utilization of {{biocompatible}} hydrogels {{based on}} 2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate {{to bridge the}} spinal cord lesion MUDr. Petr Lesný Biocompatible hydrogels based on copolymers of 2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate are suitable for implantation into a central nervous tissue lesion. Our prepared hydrogels were macroporous with predominantly <b>communicating</b> <b>pores,</b> and their mechanical properties {{were similar to those}} of spinal cord tissue. After we confirmed their biocompatibility by the growth of mesenchymal stem cells and determined the hydrogel diffusion properties, we implanted the prepared hydrogels into acute spinal cord injury in laboratory rats and studied the process of spinal cord tissue regeneration within the implants. When the hydrogels were implanted in subacute phase of spinal cord injury, we observed favorable impact on the spinal cord tissue regeneration and reduction of pseudocyst formation. Using histological and immunohistochemical methods, we observed the ingrowth of central nervous tissue elements (connective tissue, vessels, neurofilaments, Schwann cells, astrocyte processes) into the hydrogels implanted into the spinal cord hemisections. We have found that copolymerization with a positively charged ammonium salt increases the adhesion of the cells to the hydrogels in vitro and the ingrowth of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Deux types de {{membranes}} peuvent être utilisés pour la séparation des gaz. Les unes sont poreuses et séparent les gaz sur la base de leur masse moléculaire selon un mécanisme de diffusion de Knudsen dans des micropores. Les facteurs de séparation obtenus sont généralement trop faibles pour présenter un intérêt industriel. Les autres, appelées membranes non poreuses, mettent en oeuvre un mécanisme de dissolution-diffusion des gaz dans une fine couche de polymère dénuée de toute porosité. C'est de ces dernières que nous allons parler. Commencé il y a une vingtaine d'années, le développement de ce type de membranes {{a conduit}} aux premières applications industrielles en 1979 avec l'introduction par Monsanto des séparateurs PRISM pour la récupération d'hydrogène à partir de différents gaz de raffinerie et de pétrochimie. Après des débuts modestes par suite de la compétition avec des technologies éprouvées comme la cryogénie, l'adsorption et l'absorption, la perméation gazeuse est en train de conquérir sa place parmi les techniques de séparation de gaz. Elle est aujourd'hui l'une des techniques membranaires présentant le plus fort taux de progression (30 % par an). Après un rappel des principes de base de la perméation gazeuse on abordera successivement les points suivants : - le choix du polymère constituant la couche séparatrice, - l'élaboration des membranes à structure asymétrique présentant une peau dense et fine, - les principales applications industrielles. Cela permettra de mettre en évidence les avantages et les limitations actuelles de la perméation gazeuse et de souligner les différents domaines où les efforts de R et D peuvent amener des progrès significatifs. Principle of Gas permeation - Gas permeation {{is a technique}} for fractionating gas mixtures by using nonporous polymer membranes having a selective permeability to gas according to a dissolution-diffusion mechanism. Gas is made {{to pass through the}} membrane by applying a pressure difference {{on either side of the}} membrane. This pressure difference causes a difference in dissolved gas concentration between the two faces of the membrane and hence a diffusional gas flow through the membrane. Choice of Polymer - The gas sorption capacity of the polymer depends on its free volume and its physical affinity for the gas. For a gas mixture, differences in affinity are selectivity factors. The mobility of sorbed molecules depends on the free volume of the polymer and on the degree of rigidity of the chains. Vitreous polymers are more selective in this respect than rubbery polymers. This is why they are generally chosen for manufacturing gas permeation membranes. Permeability and selectivity are somewhat antinomic properties, especially when the selectivity is of a diffusional type, i. e. when the polymer acts as a molecular sieve. The definition of new polymers providing a better compromise between permeability and selectivity thus goes via research on the relationships between structure and the permeability to the gas to be separated. In polymers in a vitreous state, the chains are fixed overall, but small local movements, for example such as the rotation of an aromatic nucleus around bonds in the para position, remain possible. It seems that such small movements are beneficial for permeability, while not detracting very much from the selectivity. Structures of chains that are unfavorable for compact piling increase permeability in general to the detriment of selectivity. This is true for chains having non-coplanar aromatic nuclei or ones having bulky groups. Tables 2, 3 and 4 give some structural and permeability data for various polyimides. Figures 4 and 5 show the performances for hydrogen/ methane and carbon-dioxide/methane separations of various polyimides synthesized in our laboratories. Asymmetric MembranesThe membranes used in practice have a particular structure that is called asymmetric, which combines high permeability and good mechanical strength. This structure has a thin dense and selective skin (0. 1 to 1 µm thick) supported by a thick microporous substructure (50 to 200 µm). Such membranes come either in a flat shape or in the form of hollow fibers with their skin outside. The asymmetric structure is obtained by the so-called phase inversiontechnique, which consists in transforming a homogeneous polymer solution into a two-phase medium made up of a polymer-rich phase and a polymer-poor phase. The continuous rich phase prefigures the pore walls of the substructure. Once the poor phase becomes continuous, it will make up a network of <b>communicating</b> <b>pores.</b> Phase inversion can be caused in several ways: (a) solvent departure by evaporation (dry process) (b) introduction of a nonsolvent (wet process) (c) dry-wet process (d) temperature reduction (thermal process). The dense skin is formed on the side where evaporation takes place or where contact is made with the nonsolvent, or again on the cooled side (with the other side being in contact with the support for a flat membrane and a more or less coagulating liquid with a hollow fiber). A dense skin is formed by the superficial polymer overconcentration resulting from solvent evaporation or from its extraction by the nonsolvent before phase inversion. Figure 6 shows a ternary polymer-solvent-nonsolvent isothermal phase diagram on which arrows indicate how the homogeneous polymer solution (I) evolves toward a liquidliquid phase separation (II) or toward a gel structure (III). Industrial Development -Industrial permeators have large membrane surface areas in a compact form. These areas can be up to 500 m²/m³ for the flat version and up to 8000 m²/m³ for the hollow-fiber version. This compactness is obtained by the spiral winding of flat membranes or by the grouping of hollow fibers in bundles. Fig. 7 shows both types of permeators. The advantages of gas permeation lie in the small investment required, low energy consumption, great flexibility of implementation because of the modular nature and the possibility of the great automation of permeators, and the moderate size and weight of the installation. Limitations are linked to the difficulty in obtaining both good purity and high yield for a product with a membrane surface area that is economically acceptable. Likewise, the pressure drop undergone by the permeate may be a disadvantage. Gas permeation can be associated with other separation techniques such as pressure swing adsorption, freeze drying or absorption. The principal applications of gas permeation at present are as follows: (a) Hydrogen recovery from drain effluents from ammonia synthesis units in which hydrogen has to be separated from nitrogen, methane and argon. (b) Hydrogen recovery from refinery gas in which the hydrogen is mixed with hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide and water vapor. (c) Adjustment of the hydrogen/carbon-monoxide ratio of alcohol synthesis gas. (d) Air fractionating from the production of blanketing nitrogen. (e) Natural-gas dehydration and sweetening with a view to its transportation by pipeline, especially in offshore production.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} pulse test {{is widely}} used to estimate the hydraulic properties of low-permeability porous media. For the test to be valid, and for Darcy’s law to be applicable, the <b>communicating</b> <b>pore</b> space must be saturated. It is also customary to saturate the sample by inducing a steady flow rate through the sample and to neglect any residual hydraulic gradients that may {{be present in the}} porous solid due to the saturation process. This paper examines the influence of residual hydraulic gradients on the response of the 1 -D hydraulic pulse tests by analytically considering several transient states pertaining to pulse testing in the presence of residual hydraulic gradients that can be present immediately following saturation. Typical numerical results illustrate the effects of residual hydraulic gradients that materialize for certain nondimensional times governed by a variety of factors, most notably the permeability of the porous medium...|$|R

The testing road, established after finishing {{the developing}} in laboratory, consisting of four layers with <b>communicating</b> <b>pore</b> system and 45 cm over all thickness, showed voids content between 20 to 25 Vol. -% and received the name 'Hohlraumreicher Asphaltoberbau in Karlsruher Bauweise'. The testing road was loaded by heavy vehicle. Measurements of motor, rolling and driving noise compared with an asphalt concrete of 0 / 11 mm were carried out. In summary the following properties should be mentioned: - the technical expectations for reaching stability, resistance to strian and wear and especially security were fulfilled - wide absorbation of road traffic noise already beginning at very low frequency below 250 Hz - high or very high reduction of the - motor noise, more than 4 dB(A), - driving noise, about 6 dB(A) - rolling noise, nearly 7 dB(A) already at 60 km/h. The attempt in reaching the expectations of acoustical pilot investigations was suceeded. The road construction called 'Hohlraumreicher Asphaltoberbau in Karlsruher Bauweise' is a useful multi-layer road structure, that offers clear reducing of environment nuisance of road traffic noise as an alternative inside of places.

40|$|The {{unidirectional}} porous hydroxyapatite HAp (UDPHAp) is a scaffold with continuous <b>communicated</b> <b>pore</b> {{structure in}} the axial direction. We evaluated and compared {{the ability of the}} UDPHAp as a three-dimensional (3 D) bone tissue engineering scaffold to the interconnected calcium porous HAp ceramic (IP-CHA). To achieve this, we evaluated in vitro the compressive strength, controlled rhBMP- 2 release behavior, adherent cell morphology, cell adhesion manner, and cell attachment of UDPHAp. As a further in vivo experiment, UDPHAp and IP-CHA with rhBMP- 2 were transplanted into mouse calvarial defects to evaluate their bone-forming ability. The Results demonstrated that the maximum compressive strengths of the UDPHAp was 7. 89 ± 1. 23 MPa and higher than that of IP-CHA (1. 92 ± 0. 53 MPa) (p = 0. 0039). However, the breaking energies were similar (8. 99 ± 2. 72 vs. 13. 95 ± 5. 69 mJ, p = 0. 055). The UDPHAp released rhBMP- 2 more gradually in vivo. Cells on the UDPHAp adhered tightly to the surface, which had grown deeply into the scaffolds. A significant increase in cell number on the UDPHAp was observed compared to the IP-CHA on day 8 (102, 479 ± 34, 391 vs. 32, 372 ± 29, 061 estimated cells per scaffold, p = 0. 0495). In a mouse calvarial defect model, the percentages of new bone area (mature bone + trabecular bone) in the 2 x field were 2. 514 % ± 1. 224 % for the IP-CHA group and 7. 045 % ± 2. 055 % for the UDPHAp group, and the percentage was significantly higher in the UDPHAp group (p = 0. 0209). While maintaining the same strength as the IP-CHA, the UDPHAp with 84 % porosity showed a high cell number, high cell invasiveness, and excellent bone formation.

The capillary vessels transport oil to abundant tiny circular pores that are surrounded by denticles. The oil is distributed from the pores over the front part of the head.

40|$|Chronic erosive {{dermatopathy}} (CED) is {{a disease}} of intensively farmed Murray cod in Australia that {{has been reported in}} association with the use of groundwater (mechanically extracted from shallow boreholes) supplies. CED results in focal ulceration of the skin overlying sensory canals of the head and flanks. Trials were conducted at an affected fish farm to study the development of the condition, both in Murray cod and in goldfish, and also to assess the reported recovery of lesions when affected fish were transferred to river water. Grossly, lesions began after 2 - 3 weeks with degeneration of tissue at the periphery of <b>pores</b> <b>communicating</b> with the sensory canals. Widening of these pores along the axis of the canals resulted from a loss of tissue covering the canal. Histopathologically, hyperplasia of the canal epithelial lining was seen after 3 weeks in borehole water and subsequent necrosis and sloughing of this tissue resulted in the loss of the canal roof. Canal regeneration occurred when fish were transferred from borehole water into river water.

40|$|Voltage-gated ion {{channels}} are transmembrane proteins that undergo complex conformational changes during their gating transitions. Both functional and structural data from K+ channels suggest that extracellular and intracellular {{parts of the}} <b>pore</b> <b>communicate</b> with each other via a trajectory of interacting amino acids. No crystal structures are available for voltage-gated Na+ channels, but functional data suggest a similar intramolecular communication involving {{the inner and outer}} vestibules. However, the mechanism of such communication is unknown. Here, we report that amino acid Ile- 1575 in the middle of transmembrane segment 6 of domain IV (DIV-S 6) in the adult rat skeletal muscle isoform of the voltage-gated sodium channel (rNaV 1. 4) may act as molecular switch allowing for interaction between outer and inner vestibules. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis of the internal part of DIV-S 6 revealed that only mutations at site 1575 rescued the channel from a unique kinetic state (“ultra-slow inactivation,” IUS) produced by the mutation K 1237 E in the selectivity filter. A similar effect was seen with I 1575 A. Previously, we reported that conformational changes of both the internal and the external vestibule are involved in the generation of IUS. The fact that mutations at site 1575 modulate IUS produced by K 1237 E strongly suggests an interaction between these sites. Our data confirm a previously published molecular model in which Ile- 1575 of DIV-S 6 is in close proximity to Lys- 1237 of the selectivity filter. Furthermore, these functional data define the position of the selectivity filter relative to the adjacent DIV-S 6 segment within the ionic permeation pathway...|$|R
40|$|The {{features}} of sandstones in productive horizons of the Permian bituminous deposits of Tatarstan (Russia) have been considered. The composition and internal structure of sandstones {{have been studied}} by optical microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and electron microscopy, as well as using a number of physical and chemical methods to solve special problems. The investigated sandstones belong to the greywacke group. The clastic material of sandstones contains grains of feldspar, quartz, mica, and particles of volcanic rocks. The nature and composition of cement are important parameters that determine the filtration-capacity properties of sedimentary rocks. Bituminous deposits are characterized by vertical zoning, which is expressed in the alternation of sites {{with varying degrees of}} cementation of rocks. Atten-tion has been also paid to post-sedimentation processes, such as pyritization and calcification. Pyrite forms rare xenomorphic isometric grains. The formation of pyrite occurs in diagenesis and is associated with the processes of biogenic sulfate reduction. The source of calcium for the crystallization of dispersed cal-cite in the porous space of sandstones is the underground waters of red-colored Ufimian deposits characterized by the alkaline properties favorable for calcium migration. According to the data of X-ray computed tomography, the internal space of the studied rocks is not homogeneous and represented by a system of <b>communicated</b> and isolated <b>pores.</b> In the studied samples, two types of organic matter differing in organic radicals have been detected.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, drug {{delivery}} systems have become a subject of major interest in the pharmaceutical industry {{for the treatment of}} different diseases, such as cancer, viral infections, and genetic disorders. A wide range of compounds show high binding affinity and great potential in in vitro non-cellular assays through direct interacting with molecular targets. However, many compounds show low potency in cell-based assays due to their limited delivery across the cell membrane. The physicochemical properties of several compounds, such as size, poor water solubility, hydrophobic nature, and negative charge, limit their cellular uptake significantly. Thus, there is an urgent need in design and synthesis of novel molecular transporters for efficient delivery of effective compounds to cellular targets. The recent growth of nanotechnology products will expand the current resources of therapeutics for the pharmaceutical industry in the next few years. The use of nanotechnology in drug delivery is widely expected to change the future of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The application of nanotechnology in drug delivery has led to the discovery of nano Drug Delivery Systems (nano-DDS). Nanocarriers exhibit unique properties and take advantage of specific physiochemical behavior of nanoparticles. Properties such as, magnetism, conductivity, melting and boiling points, and chemical and biological reactivity become different at nano scale due to the quantum mechanical behavior of extremely small structures at molecular dimensions. Furthermore, nanoparticles behave differently since they take advantage of extraordinary high surface area to mass ratio, leading to increased surface interactions and distinct biological performance. Nanoparticles have the potential to be manipulated through changing their size, electronic, and hydrophobic nature. Employing nano-sized carriers offer several advantages, including enhanced intracellular delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs, targeted delivery, transporting relatively large biologically important molecules across the cell membrane, delivery of a combination of drugs to overcome drug resistance, and transporting drugs through challenging epithelial and endothelial barriers. Thus, design and development of nano-sized pharmaceutical carriers has become attractive for chemists, biologists, and physicists. Functionalized Nano-DDS are designed to deliver and release cargo drugs intracellularly more efficiently than the currently available systems, leading to the enhanced drug tissue bioavailability and eventually therapeutics efficacy. Among all nano-DDS, Cell-Penetrating Peptide (CPP) -mediated intracellular DDS has been widely used for the enhanced delivery of water insoluble drugs, negatively charged molecules (e. g., DNA, siRNA, phosphopeptides), and proteins. However, the application of (CPP) mediated intracellular DDS in in vivo models has been challenging due to their inherent toxicity to normal cells and organs. Several studies have been performed to facilitate the intracellular delivery {{of a wide range of}} low-molecular weight and macromolecular drugs using carriers through the cell cytoplasm bypassing the endocytic pathway to avoid lysosomal degradation. In this process, although the drug is delivered into cytoplasm protected, it still needs to be transported to a certain organelles, such as mitochondria or nuclei, where therapeutic function occurs. Several CPPs promote the delivery of drugs through receptor-mediated endocytosis. However, this mechanism requires high affinity between the drug-carrier complex and the target in the cell membrane for endocytosis. This process will be followed by energy-dependant formation of endosomes. However, this method suffers from entrapment and release challenges. After delivery of the molecular cargo into cells through endocytic pathway, and its entrapment in endosome, the cargo molecules or drug may end up in lysosome and degraded by the lysosomal enzymes. Thus, a limited amount of the drug can reach the cytoplasm because of inadequate endosomal escape and lysosomal degradation. As a result, although numerous CPPs exhibit promising results in in vitro assays, they fail in vivo because of the poor bioavailability. Furthermore, the nuclear delivery of cargo drugs with known CPPs has been unsuccessful. The nucleus of a cell is an important target for drug delivery systems, due to presence of the genetic information and transcription machinery. An efficient cellular uptake of the drug is highly desired in nucleus where it can interact with nucleic acids. The nuclear targeting delivery is challenging. The designed drug-CPP complex must meet several requirements for nuclear delivery including efficient cell internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME), escaping endosomal/lysosomal pathways, acquiring a nuclear localization signal to <b>communicate</b> with nuclear <b>pore</b> complexes, and eventually, being sufficiently small to enter the nuclear membrane. Not many CPPs have been found efficient for the nuclear delivery applications. CPPs can be classified into two major classes, linear and cyclic CPPs. Most reported CPPs are linear peptides that are flexible in solution and contain up to 10 amino acids. However, cyclization of peptides has been employed as a strategy to generate constrained structures. The rigidity imposed by cyclization reduces the flexibility and causes the system to adopt a restricted numbers of molecular conformations. Peptide cyclization has become a unique approach to generate conformations not available to linear peptides. Cyclic and linear peptides containing an equal number of similar amino acids create different geometries leading to different affinities for similar targets. Furthermore, cyclic CPPs containing specific amino acids have shown to have a different cellular uptake mechanism compared to linear CPPs. While most of the linear CPPs undergo endocytosis pathways in cellular uptake, some of the cyclic CPPs have endocytosis-independent uptake and target nucleus. Thus, cyclic peptides can be designed to be used as nuclear delivery vehicles of anticancer compounds targeting DNA. Functionalizing cyclic peptides with tumor targeting moieties can be used as a strategy for selective cancer cell targeting and improving nuclear targeting of anticancer drugs. Cyclic CPPs can be also covalently conjugated to active drug cargos to generate prodrugs. Prodrugs are chemically modified analogs of an active metabolite that can improve pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) properties of the drug. Prodrug strategy could offer several advantageous, such as enhancing water solubility, drug delivery, and chemical stability, and reducing toxicity. However, chemical transformation to the active drug is required in the presence of different intracellular enzymes to convert prodrugs to their corresponding pharmacologically potent moieties in in vivo systems. Cyclic peptide-drug conjugates can be used as alternative prodrug approach for improving delivery of compounds with limited cellular uptake. This dissertation focuses on a class of cyclic peptides as intracellular molecular transporters that can be used as prodrugs or peptide-capped gold nanoparticles. We hypothesized that the combination of alternate hydrophobic tryptophan and positively charged arginine or lysine residues in the sequence of the cell-penetrating cyclic peptide was critical for improving the cell-penetrating properties of the system. Furthermore, the presence of arginine and tryptophan facilitated the formation of gold nanoparticles. The molecular transporting efficiency of the peptide alone and peptide-capped gold nanoparticles was evaluated for a broad range of molecular cargos including anti-HIV drugs, anticancer agents, and negatively charged phosphopeptides. The cyclic peptides containing alternate tryptophan and arginine residues and their corresponding peptide-capped gold nanoparticles enhanced the delivery of water insoluble drugs and negatively charged biologically important molecules. A broad range of parameters including concentration, toxicity, time, and different sequences of amino acids were explored to optimize the cellular uptake. Several characterization methods were used to determine the interaction between drugs and carrier through the formation of the complex. Different methods were also used to investigate the mechanism of the cellular uptake. This work presents examples where prodrugs containing linear peptides are compared with their corresponding cyclic peptides in terms of biological properties and in delivery of different drugs. For example, cyclic peptides containing certain amino acids generated gold nanoparticles more efficiently compared to their corresponding linear peptides. Moreover, cyclic peptide capped gold nanoparticles exhibited higher molecular transporting potency when compared with the linear counterparts. This dissertation will be discussed in four manuscripts: The objective of Manuscript І (published in Molecular Pharmaceutics 2013, 10 (5), 2008 - 2020) was to evaluate a cyclic octapeptide containing arginine and tryptophan for their ability to transport negatively charged phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptides are important compounds for studying protein-protein interactions. Phosphopeptides suffer from their limited cellular uptake due to the presence of negatively charged phosphate group in their structure. The hypothesis of this manuscript is that cyclic peptide [WR] 4 containing positively charged arginine can interact with negatively charged cell-impermeable phosphopeptides and improve their cellular uptake. Furthermore, the positively charged arginine and hydrophobic tryptophan can interact with negatively charged and hydrophobic residues in the cell membrane phospholipids and improve cell permeability of phosphopeptides.
