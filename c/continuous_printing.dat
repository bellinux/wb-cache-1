This study presents the feasibility of a conceptual 3 D printing method that enables a hydrostatic condition and eventually achieves support-free fabrication, named hydrostatic 3 D printing (H 3 P).

40|$|Since its {{invention}} {{in ancient}} times, relief printing, commonly called flexography, {{has been used}} to mass-produce artifacts ranging from decorative graphics to printed media. Now, higher-resolution flexography is essential to manufacturing low-cost, large-area printed electronics. However, because of contact-mediated liquid instabilities and spreading, the resolution of flexographic printing using elastomeric stamps is limited to tens of micrometers. We introduce engineered nanoporous microstructures, comprising polymer-coated aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as a next-generation stamp material. We design and engineer the highly porous microstructures to be wetted by colloidal inks and to transfer a thin layer to a target substrate upon brief contact. We demonstrate printing of diverse micrometer-scale patterns of a variety of functional nanoparticle inks, including Ag, ZnO, WO[subscript 3], and CdSe/ZnS, onto both rigid and compliant substrates. The printed patterns have highly uniform nanoscale thickness (5 to 50 nm) and match the stamp features with high fidelity (edge roughness, ~ 0. 2 μm). We derive conditions for uniform printing based on nanoscale contact mechanics, characterize printed Ag lines and transparent conductors, and achieve <b>continuous</b> <b>printing</b> at a speed of 0. 2 m/s.

40|$|The {{globally}} increasing use {{of electricity}} {{goes hand in hand}} with climate change and the gradual depletion of fossil sources of fuel. To address these challenges renewable sources of energy are in high demand. Solution-processable organic solar cells receive particular attention because they promise to combine a set of highly attractive features including low manufacturing cost through large-area and <b>continuous</b> <b>printing,</b> as well as low weight, flexibility and semitransparency. The stability of the light-harvesting organic photovoltaic materials, which typically consist of a finely mixed blend of an electron donor and acceptor, plays a key role in the development of efficient and durable organic solar cells. One essential condition for both high-yield production and a long lifetime is excellent thermal stability. The organic photovoltaic material must be able to withstand high fabrication and operation temperatures. The aim of this thesis is to explore the use of ternary blends as a tool to improve the often insufficient thermal stability of organic photovoltaic materials. Ternary blends are a relatively new concept within the field of organic photovoltaics. This thesis focuses on blends of a donor polymer and a mixture of the two most common neat fullerenes, C 60 and C 70. Processing of the neat fullerene alloy is facilitated through a highly advantageous increase in solubility, which is found to correlate with the increase in entropy upon mixing. As a result, solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 6 % are realized, a record for devices based on neat fullerenes. A high tendency for glass formation of polymer:C 60 :C 70 ternary blends is found to induce a high degree of thermal stability due to a glass transition temperature in excess of 200 °C. Vitrification of ternary blends is discussed in terms of the entropy of mixing, which reduces the rate of both crystal nucleation and growth. Finally, this thesis provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art, discussing both fullerene as well as fullerene-free ternary blends...|$|E
30|$|The {{synthesis}} of pure MOF crystals was first {{investigated by the}} ink-jet printing method, loading inks containing Zn 2 + and 2 -MeIM in C and M cartridges and printing the ink on substrate according to predesigned patterns. Patterns designed by computer can easily be generated by the in situ formed ZIF- 8 particles on surface by the ink-jet printing. Figure  1 a, b shows the photos of printed badges of Tsinghua University produced by in situ formed ZIF- 8 particles. Figure  1 c–g shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of printed MOF crystals on different substrates including filter paper, PVC film, PET film, and hydrophilic printing film. ZIF- 8 crystals with regular shapes similar as that produced in solution (Lyu et al. 2014; He et al. 2016) were in situ formed on substrate surface, as exemplified in Fig.  1 d. Surface powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1) suggests that the printed ZIF- 8 has the same crystalline structure as that synthesized in solution (Lyu et al. 2014; He et al. 2016). Systematic studies revealed that inks with an appropriate surface tension and viscosity {{in the range of}} 30 – 50 mN/m and 2 – 5  mPa s are ideal for <b>continuous</b> <b>printing</b> (Additional file 1 : Table S 1). A combination of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethanol, and ethylene glycol (at a volume ratio of 4 : 9 : 6) was the best solvent among others to print precursors of ZIF- 8, and an optimized Zn 2 +/ 2 -MeIM printing molar ratio of 1 / 8 produced more ZIF- 8 particles (Additional file 1 : Figures S 2, S 3). In addition, each substrate can be repeatedly printed for several times to increase the productivity of ZIF- 8 particles on substrate surface (Additional file 1 : Figure S 4). As shown in Fig.  1 c–f, the average size of the crystals formed on filter paper, PVC, and PET was 100, 70, and 30  nm, respectively. In addition, denser particles were formed on filter paper than on PVC and PET films. According to the mechanism of a color ink-jet printer, droplets of inks in different cartridges are separately sprayed on surface and droplets are merged together once deposited on surface. Therefore, it is possible that more hydrophilic surface (for example, filter paper made of cellulose fibers) can facilitate the merging of different droplets containing Zn 2 + or 2 -MeIM to generate more ZIF- 8 particles with larger particle size. To further demonstrate this hypothesis, we printed ZIF- 8 particles on hydrophilic printing film by only one time and a high density of ZIF- 8 particles was readily achieved (Fig.  1 g). Here, with the above results, we can conclude that MOF crystals can be readily formed on the surface of substrate by ink-jet printing and a hydrophilic environment is helpful for the formation of MOF crystals.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityPanoramic {{photography}} is quite old, but {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{in the field of}} aerial photography. Due to increased efficiency of aircraft warning facilities and accuracy of anti-aircraft missles the problem of obtaining photographs for aerial reconnaissance and mapping and charting becomes extremely hazardous. The obvious solution is to fly higher and further away and to take oblique photographs. This doesn't seem to be difficult, at first glance, but the object to camera distance becomes extremely long, thereby reducing the scale of the photograph. Decreasing the scale of a photograph decreases its usability. The only way to keep a proper scale then, is to increase the focal length. Increasing the focal length increases the format size and the overall camera dimensions, and more important weight. Weight and size are at a premium in an aircraft and to combat this a folded optical system is coupled to a slit scan device which utilizes moving film. This reduces weight and size, but introduces other technical problems, which are presently being solved by the U. S. Air Force. Assuming that the panoramic camera is built and is operational suitable. A method of rectification must be devised in order to effectively utilize the photography. Three methods of rectification are discussed. First, a pancratic lens coupled to a slit scanning device. Second, a mechanical rectifier, utilizing moving film and paper. Third, a mathematical Solution. The pancratic lens-slit scan system tends to recreate the conditions in existence at the time of exposure. The Scheimpflug condition is neglected by selecting a slit width so small that the image remains within the focal range. During the exposure the images were in perfect focus from nadir to horizon, as the distances involved are considered to be infinity. But in rectifier the object to image distance varies from 4 feet at the nadir to 6 feet at 0 = 60 °. Therefore a lens system had to be designed to keep proper focus for all object to image distances and the proper magnification, (to insure the correct scale). These two variables are a function of the angle of scan (0). The basic design for this pancratic lens starts with selecting 2 lenses of 22 inch focal length and computing the movements necessary to accomplish the required magnifications and focal distances. It was found that this could be easily accomplished, but the final lens system would have to be designed by a competent lens designer and would be much more complicated, due to a aberration corrections. For proper illumination the filament of the light source has to move as a function of 0 in order to keep imaged onto the aperture. The effective f/no very nicely stayed approximately the same, 14. 75 to 17. 25, throughout all the lens movements. For overall illumination the speed of the scan has to vary to compensate for loss due to the inverse square law, due to tilting of the image plane, and due to increased density of negative toward the horizon. The second system, the mechanical system, consists of either a pancratic or a fixed lens system, with the negative moving past a slit and the image being projected down on a table onto moving paper. The moving parts that have to be calibrated are: the negative, printing paper, light source filament, 1 st projection lens, 2 nd projection lens, rotation of lens system, image to object distance, and tilt of easel. Most of these relationships are easy to compute and control, but the paper speed when determined will be difficult to control. As has been observed in the field, <b>continuous</b> <b>printing</b> devices do not operate efficiently in operational organizations. The third system, the mathematical solution, uses surfaces which were derived by trial and error after extensive mathematical research. This system can be proved, mathematically, not to be perfect. In fact the distortion has not been reduced less than 14 per cent. This is too much for reconnaissance and charting purposes. In view of the limitations of the various rectifiers it is felt that the pancratic lens-slit scan system would be the most practical rectifier for field use. If accepted for field use this pancratic lens system could eventually replace the current tri-metrago method of charting. The panoramic rectification system would eliminate many operations and specialized techniques and save money by reducing man-power requirements per chart...|$|E
