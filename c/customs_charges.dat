It is part of a series of studies that analyse various types of non-tariff measures and the objective {{of this paper is to}} contribute to discussions in the Negotiating Group on Market Access (NAMA), the Council on Trade in Goods and elsewhere in the trade policy community. The analysis draws on data collected from WTO Trade Policy Reviews, non-tariff barrier notifications to NAMA, and the UNCTAD TRAINS database and country notes. The study reveals that most types of <b>customs</b> fees and <b>charges</b> on imports are applied ad valorem rather than with regard to the underlying costs of the services rendered. The use of <b>customs</b> fees and <b>charges</b> has also evolved over time: the use of both customs surcharges and consular invoice fees has markedly declined over the last two decades while more countries nowadays charge importers fees for the use of various customs-related services. custom fees, GATT article VIII, non-tariff measures, <b>custom</b> <b>charges,</b> non-tariff barriers...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the economic implications of Belarus' {{participation in the}} newly created EURASEC Customs Union. The results of the calculations show that after {{the introduction of a}} common external tariff (CET) the level of tariff protection in Belarus has not increased noticeably. The reduction in the volume of imports from non-CIS countries equal to USD 1. 1 bn (8 % of Belarusian non-CIS import in 2008) will be mainly brought about by cancellation of used cars imports from non-member countries. The analyses revealed that Belarusian budget can benefit from participation in the Customs Union (CU). The amount of possible gain will be about 28. 3 % of total budget revenues from customs duties and <b>customs</b> <b>charges</b> in 2008 {{due to the fact that}} approximately 40 % of Russian imports may go through customs clearance in Belarus owning to less bureaucracy at the border with respect to Russia, and the revenues from <b>customs</b> <b>charges,</b> which is not planned to be distributed among member countries, will be transferred to Belarusian budget. However, it is unlikely that CU membership will increase foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow to Belarus, since in the case of South-South regional trade agreements (the type of EURASEC countries CU) FDI usually goes to the bigger country, i. e. to the bigger market. Therefore, most probably that in the regional arrangement in question Russia followed by Kazakhstan will be the main beneficiaries of foreign direct investments.

This paper explores the various alternative routes for laptop exports from Chongqing, China to Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It selects seven available routes for laptop transportation from Chongqing to Rotterdam. The multimodal model was adopted to demonstrate alternative routes using various factors such as transport cost, transfer cost, transit time, transport distance, document charge, port congestion surcharge, <b>customs</b> <b>charge,</b> confidence index and so on. Among possible alternative routes, the results indicate that the route 6 was the fastest routes except for the air transport (route 7), while the route 1 was the cheapest and safest way.
