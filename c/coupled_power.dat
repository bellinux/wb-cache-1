50|$|The company's {{technology}} {{is based upon}} Inductively <b>Coupled</b> <b>Power</b> Transfer. As the block diagram shows, within a Transmitter (Tx) - by varying the current in the primary induction coil - an alternating magnetic field is generated from within a charging spot. The receiver (Rx) is a second induction coil in the handheld device that takes power from the magnetic field and converts it back into electric current to charge the device battery. An additional part of the {{technology is}} the System Control Communication:Data over Coil (DoC) - the Rx sends feedback to Tx by changing the load seen by the Tx coil. The protocol is frequency based signaling, thus enables fast response of the transmitter.Each receiver {{is equipped with a}} unique ID (RxID), enabling the system, when installed in public venues, to recognize users and communicate with them. The RxID is communicated as part of the data over coil to the Tx.|$|E
