40|$|Self-healing microcapsules were {{synthesized}} by in situ polymerization with a melamine {{urea-formaldehyde resin}} shell and an epoxy resin adhesive. The {{effects of the}} key factors, i. e., <b>core–wall</b> ratio, reaction temperature, pH and stirring rate, were investigated by characterizing microcapsule morphology, shell thickness, particle size distribution, mechanical properties and chemical nature. Microcapsule healing mechanisms in cement paste were evaluated based on recovery strength and healing microstructure. The {{results showed that the}} encapsulation ability, the elasticity modulus and hardness of the capsule increased with an increase of the proportion of shell material. Increased polymerization temperatures were beneficial to the higher degree of shell condensation polymerization, higher resin particles deposition on microcapsule surfaces and enhanced mechanical properties. For relatively low pH values, the less porous three-dimensional structure led to the increased elastic modulus of shell and the more stable chemical structure. Optimized microcapsules were produced at a temperature of 60 °C, a <b>core-wall</b> ratio of 1 : 1, at pH 2 ~ 3 and at a stirring rate of 300 ~ 400 r/min.

Here we study {{the effect of}} this dispersion change on the nonlinear propagation and dynamics of ultrashort pulses. We find that it causes emission of narrow spectral peaks through a combination of four-wave mixing and dispersive wave emission. We further investigate the influence of the anti-crossings on nonlinear pulse propagation and show that their impact can be minimized by adjusting the <b>core-wall</b> thickness {{in such a way that}} the anti-crossings lie spectrally distant from the pump wavelength.

30|$|In conclusion, {{there are}} two kinds of {{transverse}} SPR in Au–Ag bimetallic nanowire. One is resulted from the outer surface of wall metal and is similar to that of pure metallic particle, the other is resulted from the interface between the core and wall metals and is similar to that of alloy particle. Quasi-static calculations show that, for Ag-Au core-shell structure nanowire, increasing the Au wall leads to the interface SPR red shifts obviously and decreases, whereas the outer surface SPR red shifts slightly and increases. For Au–Ag core–shell structure nanowire, increasing the Ag wall leads to the interface SPR blue shifts obviously and decreases, whereas the outer surface SPR red shifts slightly and increases. The shift fashion of SPR from bimetallic <b>core–wall</b> interface is different from alloy particles. The net charges and extra coulombic force in metallic wall affect the energy of SPR and leads the nonlinear shifting.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{analysis}} is presented for coupled vibration of asymmetric core structures in tall buildings. The governing equation of free vibration and its corresponding eigenvalue problem, that {{is a set of}} equations for laterally flexural vibrations in two principal directions coupled by a warping-St. Venant torsional vibration, have been developed. The Galerkin approach is used in the method of solution of the eigenvalue problem for determining the natural frequencies and associated mode shapes of the coupled vibration. Results of the proposed analysis for the example structure show very good agreement with those of the finite element analysis. The proposed method has been shown to provide a simple and accurate means for dynamic analysis of asymmetric <b>core-walls</b> in tall buildings...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the results of}} experimental tests on two post-tensioned timber <b>core-walls,</b> tested under bi-directional quasi-static seismic loading. The half-scale two-storey test specimens included a stair with half-flight landings. Multi-storey timber structures are becoming increasingly desirable for architects and building owners due to their aesthetic and environmental benefits. In addition, there is increasing public pressure to have low damage structural systems with minimal business interruption after a moderate to severe seismic event. Timber has been used extensively for low-rise residential structures in the past, but has been utilised much less for multi-storey structures, traditionally limited to residential type building layouts which use light timber framing and include many walls to form a lateral load resisting system. This is undesirable for multi-storey commercial buildings which need large open spaces providing building owners with versatility in their desired floor plan. The use of Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) panels for multi-storey timber buildings is gaining popularity throughout the world, especially for residential construction. Previous experimental testing {{has been done on}} the in-plane behaviour of single and coupled post-tensioned timber walls at the University of Canterbury and elsewhere. However, there has been very little research done on the 3 D behaviour of timber walls that are orthogonal to each other and no research to date into post-tensioned CLT walls. The “high seismic option” consisted of full height post-tensioned CLT walls coupled with energy dissipating U-shaped Flexural Plates (UFPs) attached at the vertical joints between coupled wall panels and between wall panels and the steel corner columns. An alternative “low seismic option” consisted of post-tensioned CLT panels connected by screws, to provide a semi-rigid connection, allowing relative movement between the panels, producing some level of frictional energy dissipation...|$|R
40|$|Flexural {{concrete}} walls (i. e., walls the yield in flexural prior to failure) are used commonly as the lateral load resisting system for mid‐ and high‐rise {{buildings on the}} West Coast. They are relatively stiff under service‐level loading, can take on various configurations to accommodate architectural constraints, and are generally assumed to exhibit ductile response under severe earthquake loading. Despite heavy reliance on {{concrete walls}}, relatively {{little research has been}} done to investigate the earthquake performance of walls with modern design details. Few data exist characterizing the performance of modern walls under variable levels of earthquake loading or the impact of various design parameters on this performance. Few data exist to support evaluation and validation of numerical models for modern walls. In 2004 a research study funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), through the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Research (NEESR) program, was initiated to investigate the earthquake performance of slender modern walls. This study is being conducted primarily by faculty and graduate students at the Universities of Washington and Illinois, with experimental testing conducted using the NSF‐funded NEES laboratory at the University of Illinois, Urbana‐Champaign (UIUC). The objectives of this study are to generate experimental data characterizing the seismic response and performance of modern concrete walls, develop numerical models for simulating wall response to support design and research, and develop recommendations for performance‐based seismic design of these systems. The NSF‐funded study included experimental testing of planar rectangular walls, a planar coupled wall, and a C‐shaped wall, with experimental testing limited to unidirectional lateral loading and constant axial loading. In 2009 the Charles Pankow Foundation (CPF) provided supplemental funding to expand the scope of this study to include investigation of the impact of bidirectional loading on the earthquake performance of isolated C‐shaped walls and C‐shaped walls in coupled <b>core‐wall</b> systems. This document presents the results of the three C‐shaped wall tests conducted as part of the NSF and CPF funded study. All three specimens had nominally the same design. The specimens were designed to represent C‐shaped walls in a coupled <b>core‐wall</b> system in a modern mid‐rise building. Specifically, specimens represented the bottom three stories of a C‐shaped wall in a ten‐story <b>core‐wall</b> building; loads were applied {{to the top of the}} specimen to achieve a load pattern at the base of the specimen representative of that which would develop in the ten‐story building. All three specimens were subjected to quasi‐static cyclic lateral loading in combination with axial loading. The first specimen, identified as Wall 6 of the NSF‐CPF project, was subjected to unidirectional lateral loading in the direction of the web of the C‐shaped wall and a constant axial load. The second specimen, Wall 7, was subjected to a cruciform lateral load pattern (i. e. loading in the direction of the web of the wall followed by loading in the direction of the wall flanges) as well as bidirectional lateral loading and a constant axial load. The third specimen, Wall 8, was subjected to a cruciform lateral load pattern, bidirectional loading and varying axial load. For Wall 8, a constant axial load was applied when the wall was subject to lateral loading in the direction of the web of the wall; a varying axial load was applied when the wall was subjected to lateral loading in the direction of the wall flanges to simulate the variation in axial load resulting from coupling action in the <b>core‐wall</b> system. The response of test specimens was monitored using multiple instrumentation systems. Multiple fixed and roaming still cameras were used to document damage. A close range photogrammetric system and 2 a Nikon metrology / Krypton system were used to generate displacement field data. Displacement transducers were used to measure specimen deformation and specimen displacement. External concrete strain gages and embedded steel strain gages were used to monitor local strains. Load cells were used to monitor applied loads. This report employs data from load cells and displacement transducers as well as still camera images to characterize wall behavior and provide a preliminary assessment of performance. In the future, data from other instrumentation systems will be employed to refine the preliminary characterization and performance assessment. All data will be archived and made available to the public via NEEShub ([URL] The presentation of the C‐shaped wall tests is organized as follows.

40|$|Abstract. According to ASCE 7 - 05, {{response}} spectrum analysis (RSA) procedure {{can be used}} to determine the seismic demands of the structures for the seismic design of any type of structures. However, this design procedure {{has been found to be}} inappropriate for medium-rise and high-rise buildings. This paper is aimed at verifying the RSA procedure prescribed in the current Thai seismic design code which is based on ASCE 7 - 05 and proposing appropriate modification to the design shear force from RSA procedure. A 16 -story medium-rise reinforced-concrete <b>core-wall</b> case-study building was first designed based on RSA procedure and then the non-linear response history analysis (NLRHA) was performed to determine the more accurate seismic demands of the structure. The results show that seismic shear demand of the shear wall from non-linear analysis is about 2 times the shear capacity of the wall designed by RSA procedure. This could lead to shear failure in the shear walls designed by RSA procedure. To avoid shear failure in the shear wall elements, the shear demands in the wall elements designed by RSA procedure needs to be amplified by a factor of 2, which is equivalent to reducing the response modification factor R = 5. 5 in ASCE 7 - 05 to R = 2. 75 (for shear force in the shear wall only) ...|$|E
40|$|Particle {{control is}} playing an {{increasingly}} important role in tokamak plasma performance. The present paper discusses particle control of hydrogen/deuterium by wall pumping on graphite or carbonized surfaces, {{as well as by}} external exhaust with pumped limiters and pumped divertors. Wall pumping is ultimately a transient effect and by itself not suitable for steady state particle exhaust. Therefore, external exhaust techniques with pumped divertors and limiters are being developed. How wall pumping phenomena interact and correlate with these inherently steady state, external exhaust techniques, is not well known to date. In the present paper, the processes involved in wall pumping and in external pumping are investigated in an attempt to evaluate the effect of external exhaust on wall pumping. Some of the key elements of this analysis are: (1) charge-exchange fluxes to the wall {{play a crucial role in}} the <b>core-wall</b> particle dynamics, (2) the recycling fluxes of thermal molecules have a high probability of ionization in the scrape-off layer, (3) thermal particles originating from the wall, which are ionized within the scrape-off layer, can be directly exhausted, thus providing a direct path between wall and exhaust which can be used to control the wall inventory. This way, the wall can be kept in a continuous pumping state in the sense that it continuously absorbs energetic particles and releases thermal molecules which are then removed by the external exhaust mechanism. While most of the ingredients of this analysis have been observed individually before, the present evaluation is an attempt to correlate effects of wall recycling and external exhaust...|$|E
40|$|Concrete core-walls are {{penetrated}} by vertical {{families of}} openings for doors to stairs, lifts and other spaces. These openings separate the core {{as a whole}} {{into a number of}} sub-cores linked by coupling-beams being the residual strips of concrete <b>core-wall</b> above and below openings. The (span/depth) ratio of these beams is determined by non-structural considerations and usually well into the ‘deep beam’ range prone to brittle behavior. This paper presents the results of tests of three coupling beam specimens in which the influence of three types of shear reinforcement were studied. All specimens were of the same dimensions and provided with different types of shear reinforcement. In order to investigate the contribution of various types of shear reinforcement, one specimen was provided with diagonal bars confined by spiral stirrups, and the second one provided with diagonal bars without stirrups, and the third one provided with the steel plate. All fixed vertically from one side and let the second side free to the top and the load was applied to the top portion of coupling beam. The performances of coupling beam were measured in terms of crack development and drifts, failure mode and ultimate load. The results of the coupling beam reinforced with diagonal bars and spiral stirrups showed high resisting of shear capacity comparing with other specimens, and coupling beam with diagonal reinforcement only showed high performance same as to that with spiral stirrups, and the third specimen of coupling beam with steel plate showed weak performance to dissipate the shear stresses...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVertical {{development}} is the ideal solution {{to meet the demand}} of land for the fast growing urban population in India. It is the construction of tall structures such as high-rise buildings, sky scrapers and sky towers etc., rather than constructing laterally to accommodate large population in quiet a lesser area. However the construction of high-rise buildings are highly complex and requires advanced construction techniques and equipment. One of the most important requirements is the advancement in forming technology. Though the conventional or traditional method of forming high-rise building is economical, it suffers seriously on the time, quality, safety and sustainability factors. Therefore, the advanced systems known as climbing formwork was introduced later. The climbing formwork is relatively new technology developed from the slipform in late 1960 s. Unlike the developed countries, the practice of climbing formwork is adopted only in the specialized construction projects in India. The reason being, lack of awareness about the climbing formwork among many construction personnel and misconception about the erection and operation processes. Thus to reinforce the importance of climbing formwork in the Indian construction, a firm research is carried out on the selection and operation of different climbing formwork using constructability survey. A valid comparison of different climbing formwork with the conventional formwork is done for the lift <b>core-wall</b> in the 20 storey high-rise building model using Building Information Modeling (BIM). From the developed 3 D BIM model, the cost, time, quality, safety and sustainability factors of both conventional and climbing formwork are explored in detail by quantitative and qualitative indices. The constructability factors associated with the conventional and different climbing formwork systems are generated...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a one-dimensional, semi-empirical dynamic {{model for the}} simulation and analysis of a calcium looping process for post-combustion CO 2 capture. Reduction of greenhouse emissions from fossil fuel power production requires rapid actions including the development of efficient carbon capture and sequestration technologies. The development of new carbon capture technologies can be expedited by using modelling tools. Techno-economical evaluation of new capture processes can be done quickly and cost-effectively with computational models before building expensive pilot plants. Post-combustion calcium looping is a developing carbon capture process which utilizes fluidized bed technology with lime as a sorbent. The main objective of this work was to analyse the technological feasibility of the calcium looping process at different scales with a computational model. A one-dimensional dynamic model {{was applied to the}} calcium looping process, simulating the behaviour of the interconnected circulating fluidized bed reactors. The model incorporates fundamental mass and energy balance solvers to semi-empirical models describing solid behaviour in a circulating fluidized bed and chemical reactions occurring in the calcium loop. In addition, fluidized bed combustion, heat transfer and <b>core-wall</b> layer effects were modelled. The calcium looping model framework was successfully applied to a 30 kWth laboratory scale and a pilot scale unit 1. 7 MWth and used to design a conceptual 250 MWth industrial scale unit. Valuable information was gathered from the behaviour of a small scale laboratory device. In addition, the interconnected behaviour of pilot plant reactors and the effect of solid fluidization on the thermal and carbon dioxide balances of the system were analysed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} pursues {{three main}} objectives: (1) {{to investigate the}} seismic response of tall reinforced concrete core wall buildings, designed following current building codes, subjected to pulse type near-fault ground motion, with special focus on {{the relation between the}} characteristics of the ground motion and the higher-modes of response; (2) to determine the characteristics of a base isolation system that results in nominally elastic response of the superstructure of a tall reinforced concrete core wall building at the maximum considered earthquake level of shaking; and (3) to demonstrate that the seismic performance, cost, and constructability of a base-isolated tall reinforced concrete core wall building can be significantly improved by incorporating a rocking <b>core-wall</b> in the design. First, this dissertation investigates the seismic response of tall cantilever wall buildings subjected to pulse type ground motion, with special focus on the relation between the characteristics of ground motion and the higher-modes of response. Buildings 10, 20, and 40 stories high were designed such that inelastic deformation was concentrated at a single flexural plastic hinge at their base. Using nonlinear response history analysis, the buildings were subjected to near-fault seismic ground motions as well as simple close-form pulses, which represented distinct pulses within the ground motions. Euler-Bernoulli beam models with lumped mass and lumped plasticity were used to model the buildings. The response of the buildings to the close-form pulses fairly matched that of the near-fault records. Subsequently, a parametric study was conducted for the buildings subjected to three types of close-form pulses with a broad range of periods and amplitudes. The results of the parametric study demonstrate the importance of the ratio of the fundamental period of the structure to the period of the pulse to the excitation of higher modes. The study shows that if the modal response spectrum analysis approach is used [...] considering the first four modes with a uniform yield reduction factor for all modes and with the square root of sum of squares modal combination rule [...] it significantly underestimates bending moment and shear force responses. A response spectrum analysis method that uses different yield reduction factors for the first and the higher modes is presented. Next, this dissertation investigates numerically the seismic response of six seismically base-isolated (BI) 20 -story reinforced concrete buildings and compares their response to that of a fixed-base (FB) building with a similar structural system above ground. Located in Berkeley, California, 2 km from the Hayward fault, the buildings are designed with a core wall that provides most of the lateral force resistance above ground. For the BI buildings, the following are investigated: two isolation systems (both implemented below a three-story basement), isolation periods equal to 4, 5, and 6 s, and two levels of flexural strength of the wall. The first isolation system combines tension-resistant friction pendulum bearings and nonlinear fluid viscous dampers (NFVDs); the second combines low-friction tension-resistant cross-linear bearings, lead-rubber bearings, and NFVDs. The designs of all buildings satisfy ASCE 7 - 10 requirements, except that one component of horizontal excitation is used in the two-dimensional nonlinear response history analysis. Analysis is performed for a set of ground motions scaled to the design earthquake (DE) and to the maximum considered earthquake (MCE). At both the DE and the MCE, the FB building develops large inelastic deformations and shear forces in the wall and large floor accelerations. At the MCE, four of the BI buildings experience nominally elastic response of the wall, with floor accelerations and shear forces being 0. 25 to 0. 55 times those experienced by the FB building. The response of the FB and four of the BI buildings to four unscaled historical pulse-like near-fault ground motions is also studied. Finally, this dissertation investigates the seismic response of four 20 -story buildings hypothetically located in the San Francisco Bay Area, 0. 5 km from the San Andreas fault. One of the four studied buildings is fixed-base (FB), two are base-isolated (BI), and one uses a combination of base isolation and a rocking core wall (BIRW). Above the ground level, a reinforced concrete core wall provides the majority of the lateral force resistance in all four buildings. The FB and BI buildings satisfy requirements of ASCE 7 - 10. The BI and BIRW buildings use the same isolation system, which combines tension-resistant friction pendulum bearings and nonlinear fluid viscous dampers. The rocking <b>core-wall</b> includes post-tensioning steel, buckling-restrained devices, and at its base is encased in a steel shell to maximize confinement of the concrete core. The total amount of longitudinal steel in the wall of the BIRW building is 0. 71 to 0. 87 times that used in the BI buildings. Response history two-dimensional analysis is performed, including the vertical components of excitation, for a set of ground motions scaled to the design earthquake and to the maximum considered earthquake (MCE). While the FB building at MCE level of shaking develops inelastic deformations and shear stresses in the wall that may correspond to irreparable damage, the BI and the BIRW buildings experience nominally elastic response of the wall, with floor accelerations and shear forces which are 0. 36 to 0. 55 times those experienced by the FB building. The response of the four buildings to two historical and two simulated near-fault ground motions is also studied, demonstrating that the BIRW building has the largest deformation capacity at the onset of structural damage...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{approaches the}} subject of three-dimensional (3 D) seismic analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) wall buildings at near-fault sites by first studying two main problems separately: (1) the characterization of base excitation for buildings located at near-fault sites, and (2) modeling the behavior of RC buildings accurately including inelastic behavior and the failure mode. The dissertation culminates with the 3 D response history analysis of two 20 -story RC core wall buildings models, including the slabs and columns, subject to a strong near-fault ground motion record. First, the presence and characteristics of multiple pulses [with dominant period TP between 0. 5 and 12 s] in historical near-fault ground motion records is studied. An iterative method for extracting multiple strong pulses imbedded in a ground motion is presented. The method is used to extract multiple strong velocity pulses from the fault-normal horizontal component of 40 pulse-like ground motion records from 17 historical earthquakes, with magnitudes ranging from MW 6. 3 to MW 7. 9, recorded at a distance less than 10 km from the fault rupture with a peak ground velocity greater than 0. 6 m / s. The relationships between the dominant period of the extracted pulses, associated amplitudes, and earthquake magnitude are presented, indicating that the amplitude of the strongest pulses with 1. 5 s &# 8804; TP &# 8804; 5 s, does not depend significantly on the earthquake magnitude. Next, the effect of soil-foundation-structure interaction (SFSI) for a 20 -story core wall building with a caisson foundation subject to single pulse motions is investigated using two-dimensional (2 D) nonlinear finite-elements and fiber beam-column elements; nonlinear site effects on the free-field motion and structural response is discussed. The nonlinear site effects for free-field motions result in a de-amplification of peak surface acceleration due to soil yielding, and a maximum of 64 % amplification of peak acceleration and velocity of at specific pulse periods for deep soils. SFSI, after removing the nonlinear site effect, has a negligible effect on the maximum value of peak roof acceleration and peak roof drift ratio over the pulse periods considered; however, {{the effect of the}} increased flexibility due to SFSI is observed in the peak drift ratio and peak base shear response. A couple of chapters of this dissertation are dedicated to the development and verification of a three-dimensional nonlinear cyclic modelling method for non-planar reinforced concrete walls and slabs. This modeling approached - called the beam-truss model (BTM) - consists of (i) nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli fiber-section beam elements representing the steel and concrete in the vertical and horizontal direction, and (ii) nonlinear trusses representing the concrete in the diagonal directions. The model represents the effects of flexure-shear interaction (FSI) by computing the stress and strains in the horizontal and vertical directions and by considering biaxial effects on the behavior of concrete diagonals. In addition, the BTM explicitly models diagonal compression and tension failures (shear failures) under cyclic or dynamic loading. The BTM is first validated by comparing the experimentally measured and numerically computed response of eight RC walls subjected to static cyclic loading, including two non-planar RC walls under biaxial cyclic loading. Then, the BTM is extended to modeling slabs and validated with a two-bay slab-column specimen. Finally, the BTM is validated by comparing the experimentally measured and numerically computed response and failure mode of a 5 -story coupled wall RC building under seismic base excitation. The final chapter presents the 3 D response history analysis of two 20 -story RC core wall buildings subject to a strong near-fault ground motion record. The 20 -story building model includes the RC core wall, post-tensioned slabs, and columns; the core wall and slabs are modeled using the developed BTM while the columns are modeled with fiber-section beam-column elements. The two 20 -story RC core wall buildings considered have similar geometry: one is conventionally designed to develop plastic hinging {{at the base of the}} <b>core-wall,</b> and the second is designed with a damage resistant structural system that combines two seismic isolation planes. Analysis is conducted using the two horizontal components of the historical TCU 52 ground motion recorded 0. 7 km from the fault plane of the MW 7. 6 1999 Chi-chi, Taiwan earthquake. The seismic response and damage of the two buildings is discussed...|$|E
