5000|$|In Caracas, {{the term}} merengue rucaneao {{designated}} {{a way of}} dancing with couples holding and often featuring exaggerated hip movements (which added to the craze and subsequent controversy). Dances were paid affairs, with popular prices being “a locha” (12.5 cents) or “a medio” (25 cents) in dance halls known then as mabiles. Live accompaniment consisted of four solo instruments: trumpet, trombone, saxophone and clarinet and rhythm instruments such as the cuatro, bass and percussion (which, {{depending on the size}} of the ensemble, could be as simple as a scraper, or incorporate maracas and even a snare drum) [...] Travelling groups known as cañoneros walked around the neighborhoods staging impromptu performances for tips. The name [...] "cañoneros" [...] comes from their marketing approach, which included firing a <b>carbide</b> <b>charge</b> from a blank cannon made of a thick, hollowed-out bamboo cane.|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} work {{studied the}} response of new generation armored steel plates PROTAC 500 to the ballistic testing with armored piercing bullets with a core of tungsten <b>carbide,</b> <b>charge</b> 7, 62 mm, and interactions between the piercing bullets and the armored steel plate were also investigated. The most obvious and significant phenomena in penetrating of the piercing bullets Nammo AP 8 in steel target PROTAC 500 are strain hardening of steels, the appearance of cracks and local failure, adiabatic shear bands (ASB) with related phase transformations, and melting as well as alloying at {{the border of the}} bullet / the steel plate...|$|E

He returned to the US in 1914 and worked at the Mellon Institute, funded by the Prest-O-Lite company, which was absorbed into Union Carbide in 1917. He became a Union <b>Carbide</b> VP in <b>charge</b> of chemical research in 1944. He died in 1976 in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts.|$|R
30|$|An {{effective}} interionic potential calculation {{with long}} range Coulomb, charge transfer interaction, covalency effect, short range overlap repulsion extended, van der Waals interaction, and zero point energy effect is implemented {{to investigate the}} pressure dependent structural phase transition (ZnS-type (B 3) to NaCl-type (B 1) structure), and mechanical, elastic, and thermodynamic properties of silicon <b>carbide</b> (SiC). Both <b>charge</b> transfer interaction and covalency effect are important in revealing the pressure induced structural stability, Cauchy discrepancy, anisotropy factor, melting temperature, shear modulus, Young’s modulus, and Grüneisen parameter. We also present {{the results for the}} temperature dependent behaviors of normalized volume, hardness, heat capacity, and thermal expansion coefficient. SiC is mechanically stiffened and thermally softened as inferred from pressure (temperature) dependent elastic constant’s behavior. The Pugh’s ratio ∅ = B T / G H, the Poisson’s ratio v, and the Cauchy’s pressure C 12 –C 44 for SiC ceramic confirm its brittle nature.|$|R
40|$|Boron carbide (B 4 C) added {{manganese}} dioxide (MnO 2) {{used as a}} cathode material for a Zn–MnO 2 battery using aqueous lithium hydroxide (LiOH) as the electrolyte {{is known to have}} higher discharge capacity but with a lower average discharge voltage than pure MnO 2 (additive free). The performance is reversed when using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the electrolyte. Herein, the MnO 2 was mixed with 0, 5, 7 and 10 wt. % of boron carbide during the electrode preparation. The discharge performance of the Zn|LiOH|MnO 2 battery was improved by the addition of 5 – 7 wt. % boron carbide in MnO 2 cathode as compared with the pure MnO 2. However, increasing the additive to 10 wt. % causes a decrease in the discharge capacity. The performance of the Zn|KOH|MnO 2 battery was retarded by the boron carbide additive. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (EDS) results show evidence of crystalline MnO 2 particles during discharging in LiOH electrolyte, whereas, manganese oxide particles with different oxygen and manganese counts leading to mixture of phases is observed for KOH electrolyte which is in agreement with X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. The enhanced discharge capacity indicates that boron atoms promote lithium intercalation during the electrochemical process and improved the performance of the Zn|LiOH|MnO 2 battery. This observed improvement may be a consequence of B 4 C suppressing the formation of undesirable Mn(III) phases, which in turn leads to enhanced lithium intercalation. Too much boron <b>carbide</b> hinders the <b>charge</b> carrier which inhibits the discharge capacity. © 2009, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Grid-enabled plug-in {{electrified}} vehicles (PEVs) {{are deemed}} {{as one of}} the most sustainable solutions to profoundly reduce both oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most important realities, which will facilitate the adoption of PEVs is the method by which these vehicles will be charged. This dissertation focuses on the research of highly efficient onboard charging solutions for next generation PEVs. This dissertation designs a two-stage onboard battery charger to charge a 360 V lithium-ion battery pack. An interleaved boost topology is employed in the first stage for power factor correction (PFC) and to reduce total harmonic distortion (THD). In the second stage, a full bridge inductor-inductor-capacitor (LLC) multi-resonant converter is adopted for galvanic isolation and dc/dc conversion. Design considerations focusing on reducing the charger volume, and optimizing the conversion efficiency over the wide battery pack voltage range are investigated. The designed 1 kW Silicon based charger prototype is able to charge the battery with an output voltage range of 320 V to 420 V from 110 V, 60 Hz single-phase grid. Unity power factor, low THD, and high peak conversion efficiency have been demonstrated experimentally. This dissertation proposes a new technique to track the maximum efficiency point of LLC converter over a wide battery state-of-charge range. With the proposed variable dc link control approach, dc link voltage follows the battery pack voltage. The operating point of the LLC converter is always constrained to the proximity of the primary resonant frequency, so that the circulating losses and the turning off losses are minimized. The proposed variable dc link voltage methodology, demonstrates efficiency improvement across the wide state-of-charge range. An efficiency improvement of 2. 1 % at the heaviest load condition and 9. 1 % at the lightest load condition for LLC conversion stage are demonstrated experimentally. This dissertation proposes a novel PEV charger based on single-ended primary-inductor converter (SEPIC) and the maximum efficiency point tracking technique of an LLC converter. The proposed charger architecture demonstrates attracting features such as (1) compatible with universal grid inputs; (2) able to charge the fully depleted battery pack; (3) pulse width modulation and simplified control algorithm; and (4) the advantages of Silicon Carbide MOSFETs can be fully manifested. A 3. 3 kW all Silicon <b>Carbide</b> based PEV <b>charger</b> prototype is designed to validate the proposed idea...|$|R
