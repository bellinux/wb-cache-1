40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{maximize}} the biodegradation of the commercial chlorinated paraffin Cereclor S 52 using an axenic culture of Pseudomonas sp. 273. Tests of the adherence of growing cultures to hydrocarbon substrates showed differences between Cereclor S 52 and a readily degradable <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkane,</b> 1, 10 -dichlorodecane (DCD). In the bioreactor, Cereclor S 52 was degraded by up to 73 % by means of multiple additions of DCD. This is indicative of an upper limit for the degradation of Cereclor S 52 in this system. The degradative enzymes in Pseudomonas sp. 273 {{did not appear to}} be induced by Cereclor itself, by yeast extract, or by hexadecane.

40|$|Biofiltration {{systems can}} be used to treat {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs); however, the systems are poorly understood and are currently operated as black boxes. Common operational problems associated with biofilters include fouling, deactivation, and overgrowth, all of which make biofilters ineffective for continuous, long-term use. The objective of this investigation is to develop generic methods for long-term stable operation, in particular by using selective limitation of supplemental nutrients while maintaining high activity and the ability to regenerate biofilter activity. As part of this effort, the authors will provide a deeper fundamental understanding of the important biological and transport mechanisms in biodestruction of sparingly soluble VOCs and will extend this engineering approach and developed mathematical models to two additional systems of high-priority environmental management (EM) relevance-direct degradation and cometabolic degradation of priority pollutants such as BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) and TCE (trichioroethylene), respectively. Preliminary results indicate that the author can control overgrowth of the biofilm while sustaining high degradation rates and develop basic predictive models that elucidate mass transfer and kinetic limitations in this system for alkanes. The alkanes are degraded into CO, and waterwith minimal biomass (due to the methodology proposed). This system will be used to test and model additional supplemental nutrient feeding strategies as well as methods to increase the fundamental driving forces by modification of the system. Models will be extended to non-steady-state, long-term operation. The author will examine the nature of the mixed microbial community in the VOC-degrading biofilm and test for new degradative activities. He will use cosolvents with surfactant properties to enhance hydrocarbon solubility in the biofilm and evaluate their impact on mass transfer and reaction rate in an operating biofilter. These results will point to further potential improvements in systems of EM priority. Constructed and acclimated three trickling-bed biofilters. Measured kinetic activity and mass transfer in biofilters under study. Demonstrated extended activity of biofilters in absence of supplemental nutrient.

These contained <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> in relatively large quantities as solvents for chloramine T from 1914 to 1918. The Sharpless Solvents Corporation commissioned the first industrial photochloration plant for the chlorination of pentane in 1929.

In 1950, the United States produced more than 800,000 tons of chlorinated paraffin hydrocarbons. The major products were ethyl chloride, tetrachlorocarbon and dichloromethane. Because of concerns about health and environmentally relevant problems such as the ozone depletion behavior of light volatile chlorine compounds, the chemical industry developed alternative procedures that did not require chlorinated compounds. As a result of the following replacement of chlorinated by non-chlorinated products, worldwide production volumes have declined considerably over the years.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} <b>chlorinated</b> low-molecular-weight <b>alkanes</b> and alkenes was {{transformed}} electrolytically at metal cathodes at potentials from - 0. 3 to - 1. 4 V (vs. SHE). Products included nonchlorinated hydrocarbons and less chlorinated intermediates. Product distributions are {{highly dependent on}} cathode material and applied cathode potential. Kinetics was first-order in the concentration of the halogenated targets. The specific first-order rate constants are function of cathode potential, cathode material, solution characteristics, and reactant identify. When transformation kinetics was governed by polarization resistance, rate constants were correlated with degree of halogenation and standard reduction potential for the predominant transformation reaction (as indicated by product analysis). Log-transformed reaction rate constants for reduction of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkanes,</b> derived via experiments at the same cathode potential (E(c) = - 1. 0 or - 1. 2 V vs. SHE), were linearly related to carbon-halogen bond dissociation energies. A physical model for the observed correlation was developed from transition-state theory. The chlorinated ethenes reacted much faster than predicted from bond enthalpy calculations, suggesting that alkenes are not transformed via the same mechanism as the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkanes.</b> Polarographic study demonstrated that the shift of E₁/₂ of CCl₄ reduction was correlated with water concentration in solvent-predominated mixtures. Successful interpretation of these findings with a physical model suggested that solvents involved the rate-determining step of CCl₄ electrolysis both kinetically and mechanistically. The capture of trichloromethyl radicals with a spin trap (PBN) in an electrochemical system provided direct evidence supporting the free radical mechanism in electrolytic reduction of CCl₄.

Â To date, very little compatibility testing of residual MWF in refrigeration lubes and refrigerants has been investigated.

A QSAR {{is based on the assumption}} that the biological activity of a new or untested chemical can be inferred from the molecular structure, or properties of similar compounds whose activities have already been assessed. Therefore, using the chemical structure of chemical compounds as the sole input, one can build a toxicity prediction model based on parameters that define the physico-chemical properties and relative reactivity of the compounds. The objective of this thesis was to apply OECD guidelines in the development of validated QSAR models that describe acute toxicity of selected groups of EINECS chemicals to various organisms. In addition, an estimate was made of the total number of EINECS chemicals that could be possibly evaluated using (Q) SAR approaches. Based on experimental toxicity data from literature and in silico calculated log Kow (a measure of hydrophobicity) values, a QSAR advisory tool was developed that directs users to the appropriate QSAR model to apply for predicting toxicity of substituted mononitrobenzenes to five types of organisms within specified log Kow ranges. In a next study, QSAR models were developed to predict in vivo acute toxicity of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> to fish based on data from in vitro experiments, and even based on in silico log Kow data only. Furthermore, using toxicity data from acute immobilization experiments with daphnids, an interspecies QSAR model was developed to predict toxicity of organothiophosphate pesticides to fish based on these data for daphnids and in silico log Kow values. The QSAR models for the mononitrobenzenes, <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkanes,</b> and organothiophosphates covered in total 0. 7 % of the 100 196 EINECS chemicals. In a final step, using chemical classification software, 54 % of the EINECS chemicals were grouped into specific classes that can in theory be subject to QSAR modeling. The safety assessment of one group of compounds that could not be classified e. g. botanical extracts might be done by further development of a method recently reported for the safety assessment of natural flavour complexes used as ingredients in food. This would result in an additional 3 % of the EINECS chemicals that could potentially be covered by SAR approaches, bringing the total percentage of EINECS compounds that can be covered by (Q) SAR approaches to 57. In conclusion, the results of this thesis reveal that, (i) in vitro experiments and even in silico calculations can help to reduce or replace animals used for experimental toxicity testing and (ii) despite the fact that individual QSARs may often each cover only limited, i. e. less than 1 %, of the EINECS compounds, (Q) SAR approaches have the potential to cover about 57 % of the EINECS compounds...|$|R
40|$|The {{inducible}} {{nature of}} the alkene oxidation system of Xanthobacter strain Py 2 has been investigated. Cultures grown with glucose as the carbon source did not contain detectable levels of alkene monooxygenase or epoxidase, two key enzymes of alkene and epoxide metabolism. Upon addition of propylene to glucose-grown cultures, alkene monooxygenase and epoxidase activities increased and after an 11 -h induction period reached levels of specific activity comparable to those in propylene-grown cells. Addition of chloramphenicol or rifampin prevented {{the increase in the}} enzyme activities. Comparison of the banding patterns of proteins present in cell extracts revealed that polypeptides with molecular masses of 43, 53, and 57 kDa accumulate in propylene-grown but not glucose-grown cells. Pulse-labeling of glucose-grown cells with [35 S]methionine and [35 S]cysteine revealed that the 43 -, 53 -, and 57 -kDa proteins, as well as two additional polypeptides with molecular masses of 12 and 21 kDa, were newly synthesized upon exposure of cells to propylene or propylene oxide. The addition to glucose-grown cells of a variety of other aliphatic and chlorinated alkenes and epoxides, including ethylene, vinyl chloride (1 -chloroethylene), cis- and trans- 1, 2 -dichloroethylene, 1 -chloropropylene, 1, 3 -dichloropropylene, 1 -butylene, trans- 2 -butylene, isobutylene, ethylene oxide, epichlorohydrin (3 -chloro- 1, 2 -epoxypropane), 1, 2 -epoxybutane, cis- and trans- 2, 3 -epoxybutane, and isobutylene oxide stimulated the synthesis of the five propylene-inducible polypeptides as well as increases in alkene monooxygenase and epoxidase activities. In contrast, acetylene, and a range of aliphatic and <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkanes,</b> did not stimulate the synthesis of the propylene-inducible polypeptides or the increase in alkene monooxygenase and epoxidase activities...|$|R
40|$|Purge-and-trap {{combined}} with high-resolution gas chromatography and detection by mass spectrometry was evaluated {{for the analysis}} of 27 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in marine water samples down to ng l - 1 concentration levels. The target compounds included <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> and alkenes, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and covered a wide range of VOCs of environmental interest. Limits of detection ranged from 0. 15 ng l - 1 to 6. 57 ng l - 1 for all VOCs, except for dichloromethane (41. 07 ng l - 1), chloroform (19. 74 ng l - 1), benzene (22. 05 ng l - 1) and 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene (20. 43 ng l - 1), Precision and accuracy were determined at a concentration level of 25. 97 to 66. 68 ng l - 1. Besides method validation, emphasis was put on quality control and assessment during routine determination of VOCs in marine water samples. Analytical quality control charts were plotted for all VOCs and a standard addition test was performed, as proposed by the QUASIMEME (Quality Assurance of Information in Marine Environmental Monitoring Programmes in Europe) working group. The analytical charts were incorporated in a working scheme containing guidelines to be applied during routine determinations, ensuring the long time reliability of the analytical method. Results yielded by the QUASIMEME interlaboratory exercise on organohalogen measurements in seawater are presented. The exercise was attended by seven out of eight laboratories who agreed to participate. Samples taken along the Scheldt estuary, from Breskens (The Netherlands) to Temse (Antwerp, Belgium) were analysed according to the developed technique. Concentrations as low as 0. 33 ng l - 1 (1, 2 -dichloropropane) were detected near the mouth of the river Scheldt, while concentrations up to 326 ng l - 1 for tetrachloroethene and 461 ng l - 1 for cyclohexane were found in the vicinity of Antwerp...|$|R
40|$|Different {{cryogenic}} and {{a heated}} GCxGC modulator(s) were evaluated and compared {{for the analysis}} of high-boiling halogenated compounds. The cryogenic modulators investigated were: (i) the longitudinally modulated cryogenic system; (ii) the liquid-nitrogen-cooled jet modulator (KT 2001); (iii) a dual-jet CO 2 modulator (made in-house); (iv) a semi-rotating cryogenic modulator (made in-house) and (v) a CO 2 loop modulator (KT 2003); the heated modulator was the slotted heater system (sweeper). Each modulator was optimised with respect to analyte peak widths at half height in the second-dimension. n-Alkanes, <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkanes,</b> polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and fluorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (F-PAHs) were used as test analytes. The flow rate of the coolant was found to be an important parameter, i. e. the flow rate of the gaseous nitrogen in the KT 2001, and of the liquid CO 2 in the other cryogenic modulators. For the slotted heater the stroke velocity and pause time were important parameters. This modulator had a limited application range in terms of temperature due to a necessary 100 °C difference between sweeper and oven temperature. All cryogenic modulators were found to be suitable for the GCxGC analysis of high-boiling compounds, but the CO 2 modulators are to be preferred to the KT 2001 due to a wider application range and slightly narrower peaks. As regards the performance of three commercially available electron-capture detectors (ECDs), the aim was to obtain narrow peak widths in GCxGC, i. e. to avoid band broadening caused by the cell volume. The most important parameters were the flow rate of the make-up gas and the detector temperature which both should be as high as possible. Comparison of analyte peak widths obtained with ECD mode and flame ionisation detection (FID) showed that all ECDs exhibited band broadening compared to the FID. The narrowest peaks were obtained with the Agilent micro-ECD, which has a cell volume of only 150 ?...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In 1994, a {{hazardous}} waste site, polluted by the dumping of solvents {{from a former}} electronics factory, was discovered in Taoyuan, Taiwan. This subsequently emerged as a serious case of contamination through chlorinated hydrocarbons with suspected occupational cancer. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if there was any increased risk of breast cancer among female workers in a 23 -year follow-up period. Methods A total of 63, 982 female workers were retrospectively recruited from the database of the Bureau of Labor Insurance (BLI) covering the period 1973 – 1997; the data were then linked with data, up to 2001, from the National Cancer Registry at the Taiwanese Department of Health, from which standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for different types of cancer were calculated as compared to the general population. Results There were a total of 286 cases of breast cancer, and after adjustment for calendar year and age, the SIR was close to 1. When stratified by the year 1974 (the year in which the regulations on solvent use were promulgated), the SIR of the cohort of workers who were first employed prior to 1974 increased to 1. 38 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 11 – 1. 70). No such trend was discernible for workers employed after 1974. When 10 years of employment was considered, there was a further increase in the SIR for breast cancer, to 1. 62. Those workers with breast cancer who were first employed prior to 1974 were employed at a younger age and for a longer period. Previous qualitative studies of interviews with the workers, corroborated by inspection records, showed a short-term high exposure to <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> and alkenes, particularly trichloroethylene before 1974. There were no similar findings on other types of cancer. Conclusion Female workers with exposure to trichloroethylene and/or mixture of solvents, first employed prior to 1974, may have an excess risk of breast cancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Great deal of {{research}} has shown that catalytic and non-catalytic thermal decomposition (pyrolysis and oxidation) of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> and alkenes results in the formation of heavier cyclic chlorinated pollutants. Central to these processes is the Diels-Alder addition/cyclisation of small chlorinated carbon chains and the successive replacement of hydrogen atoms in cyclic compounds by chlorine atoms at high temperatures. Polychlorinated benzenes, dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) are formed during the heterogeneous reactions of propene on fly-ash in the presence of air and HCl between 623 - 673 K. Formation of PCDD/F from thermal oxidation of polychlorinated phenol has been demonstrated to proceed at a rate 100 times faster than the competing de novo pathway. High temperature pyrolysis of 1, 3 -hexachlorobutadiene concludes in the production of hexachlorobenzene (C 6 Cl 6) and other highly chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons. Along the same line of enquiry, experimental results have explained that unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as acetylene are readily converted to hexachlorobenzene, hexachlorobutadiene and other heavier perchlorinated species in the presence of cupric oxide and HCl under post combustion conditions. Taylor et al. observed the pyrolysis of hexachloropropene to occur readily, even at temperatures as low as 700 K to yield CCl 4, C 2 Cl 4, C 2 Cl 6 and C 3 Cl 4 (tetrachloroallene). At higher temperatures (up to 1223 K), distinct molecular growth was observed with reaction products including C 4 Cl 6 (1, 3 -hexachlorobutadiene), C 6 Cl 6 (hexachlorobenzene), C 6 Cl 8 (1, 3, 5 -octachlorohexatriene), C 8 Cl 8 (octachlorostyrene), possible other isomers of C 6 Cl 8, C 8 Cl 8 and four isomers of C 12 Cl 8. Cl displacement of CCl 3 radicals was observed to be the overriding origination pathway for conversion of C 3 Cl 6 into C 2 Cl 4, CCl 4 and C 2 Cl 6. At higher temperatures, C 3 Cl 3 recombination accounted for about 80...|$|R
40|$|The {{major concern}} for the {{halogenated}} compounds is their widespread distribution, in addition to occupational exposures. Several <b>chlorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> and alkenes were found to induce toxic effects. In this study, we investigated the genotoxic potential of 1, 1 -dichloroethane in the bone marrow cells obtained from Swiss-Webster mice, using chromosomal aberrations (CA), mitotic index (MI), and micronuclei (MN) formation as toxicological endpoints. Five groups of three male mice each, weighing an average of 24 + 2 g, were injected intraperitoneally, once with doses of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 mg/kg body weight (BW) of 1, 1 -dichloroethane dissolved in ethanol. A control group was also made of three animals injected with ethanol (1 %) without the chemical. All animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the treatment. Chromosome and micronuclei preparations were obtained from bone marrow cells following standard protocols. Chromatid and chromosome aberrations were investigated in 100 metaphase cells per animal and percent micronuclei frequencies were investigated in 1, 000 metaphase cells per animal. 1, 1 -dichloroethane exposures significantly {{increased the number of}} chromosomal aberrations and the frequency of micronucleated cells in the bone marrow cells of Swiss-Webster mice. Percent chromosomal aberrations of 2. 67 + 0. 577, 7. 66 + 2. 89, 8. 33 + 2. 08, 14. 67 + 2. 51, 20. 3 + 3. 21, 28 + 3. 61; mitotic index of 9. 4 %, 7. 9 %, 6. 2 %, 4. 3 %, 3. 0 %, 2. 6 % and micronuclei frequencies of 3. 33 + 0. 7, 7. 33 + 0. 9, 8. 00 + 1. 0, 11. 67 + 1. 2, 15. 33 + 0. 7, 18. 00 + 1. 7 were recorded for the control, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg/kg BW respectively; indicating a gradual increase in number of chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei formation, with increasing dose of 1, 1,-dichloroethane.

40|$|One {{requirement}} {{regarding the}} transportation of transuranic (TRU) radioactive waste containers currently limits the total concentration of potentially flammable {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) and flammable gases in the headspace of the waste container.
