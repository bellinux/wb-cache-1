Nevertheless, William and Ann did their best to ensure that their children were educated and prepared for life. Margaret was a clever <b>child,</b> <b>whose</b> skills at reciting poetry or playing piano pieces were often displayed at town events and Sunday School outings. Until the age of 13 she attended the local elementary school; she then worked for a year as a pupil-teacher (she was paid three shillings a week) in the school's boys' department. Local employment opportunities being scarce, she left Chard in 1887, at the age of 14, to begin an apprenticeship at a draper's shop in Hove, near Brighton.|$|E
5|$|Makoto first appears {{when the}} cast is in sixth grade, though is in a {{different}} class. Known as Mako for short, though mostly only to Shuichi, Makoto was also assigned male at birth, but wishes {{to be a girl}} and shares Shuichi's interest in cross-dressing; it is this that spurs Makoto to become Shuichi's closest friend. Due to facial freckles and round glasses, Makoto is not able to appear as cute as Shuichi when wearing feminine clothes. Makoto's primary reason for wanting to be a girl may be due to an attraction to men, something Shuichi cannot relate to; Makoto is a romantic who wants to be in a relationship with a cool, adult man. Makoto is unusually mature and is able to think calmly and objectively while providing advice to friends. Makoto also gets along well with boys and girls of the same age, because of good listening skills; Makoto often becomes an onlooker to {{what is going on in}} other characters' lives. Makoto is an only <b>child</b> <b>whose</b> parents run a bakery.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Adam becomes {{friends with}} Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), who {{continuously}} hears a baby crying and finds things supposedly left for her by Sabrina, who is dead. The housekeeper Estella Munoz (Anne Betancourt) is blamed and arrested; however, Adam was secretly gaslighting Ashley. Adam dresses as Sabrina, scares Ashley and she falls down a staircase, {{causing her to}} miscarry her <b>child,</b> <b>whose</b> father is Victor. Adam then blackmails her doctor, Charles Taylor, into telling her that her child was still alive. Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman) is appointed to investigate Adam, who seduces him to divert his attention from Adam's criminal activity. Heather discovers Adam's affair with Rafe and ends her relationship with Adam. Ashley is admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where a pregnant Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) is also staying. Sharon goes into labor and Adam steals her daughter, Faith, and passes her off as Ashley’s child. Sharon believes her child had died, and guilt-ridden, Adam pursues a relationship with Sharon and they elope, but she leaves him when she remembers elements that contradict her losing her child. A note from a dying Charles Taylor saying that Ashley had miscarried and Faith is really Sharon and Nicholas’ daughter is found. Adam is jailed again, but gets the insane Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk) to help him escape to attend a masquerade ball, where he unsuccessfully begs Sharon for forgiveness. An explosion at the ball occurs and a burned corpse is positively identified as Adam. Nicholas is arrested for Adam's murder. The corpse is actually that of Richard Hightower, to whom Adam had donated bone marrow and carries Adam's DNA. Adam meets up with Skye Lockhart (Laura Stone) and they plot a confidence trick together, but Adam still dreams of Sharon.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{examines}} the influence of maternal status, socioeconomic status of the household, and household composition on the mobility of children aged 0 – 14 in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, from 1999 to 2008. Using data from the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System, we found that <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> mothers were temporary migrants, living elsewhere, or dead had higher odds of moving than <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> mothers were coresident. Older children and children living in richer households faced lower odds of mobility. For <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> mothers were coresident, there was no effect of maternal substitutes on child mobility. However, among <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> mothers were temporary migrants or living else-where, the presence of prime-aged and elderly females lowered the odds of mobility. For maternal orphans, the presence of elderly women in the household lowered their odds of mobility. The results underscore the importance of examining {{the conditions under which}} children move in order to strengthen service delivery targeted at safeguarding children’s well-being...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} rate of epilepsy {{is between}} 4 - 10 / 1000 {{people in general}} population. It is a well-known fact that antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used during pregnancy increase the rate of congenital malformations. However, {{there is not enough}} information about the electrophysiological effects of AEDs. In this study, 127 <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> mothers have epilepsy and 33 <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> mothers are healthy, were included. Twenty nine mothers did not use AEDs whereas 98 patients used AEDs during their pregnancy. Demographic features of both mothers and children, as well as epilepsy characteristics of mothers are recorded. The EEG examinations were done awake and/or during sleep. The <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> mothers have epilepsy had higher rate of EEG abnormalities and the ratio was statistically significant. EEG abnormalities were higher in the <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> mothers had polytherapy (% 50) than in the group with monotherapy (% 31, 7). EEG abnormalities were mostly seen (% 47) in <b>children</b> <b>whose</b> mothers used VPA. Children born of patients with epilepsy who did not use folic acid with AEDs had a higher rate of EEG abnormalities and this ratio was statistically significant. It was also observed that <b>children,</b> <b>whose</b> mothers have generalized EEG abnormalities, have generalized EEG abnormalities more frequently. It is necessary to examine patients who used AEDs during pregnancy {{not only in terms of}} congenital malformations but also electrophysiological effects and to advise taking folic acid. Examining children who are born under the effect of AEDs electrophysiologically in the years following their birth may provide predictions about whether the effects of AEDs...|$|R

Birth defects in a <b>child</b> <b>whose</b> father was taking azathioprine have also been reported. Although no adequate and well-controlled studies have taken place in humans, when given to animals in doses equivalent to human dosages, teratogenesis was observed.

25|$|Having a {{last name}} of Levi or a related term does not {{necessarily}} mean a person is a Levite, and some Levites do not have such last names. Levitical status is passed down in families from parent to child, as part of a family's genealogical tradition. Tribal status of Levite is determined by patrilineal descent, so a <b>child</b> <b>whose</b> biological father is a Levite (in cases of adoption or artificial insemination, status is determined by the genetic father), is also considered a Levite. Jewish status is determined by matrilineal descent, thus conferring levitical status onto children requires both biological parents to be Israelites and the biological father to be a Levite.|$|E
