40|$|A {{systematic}} {{sequence of}} prompt and probe trials {{was used to}} teach picture names to three severely retarded children. On prompt trials the experimenter presented a picture and said the picture name {{for the child to}} imitate; on probe trials the experimenter did not name the picture. A procedure whereby <b>correct</b> responses to prompts and probes were nondifferentially reinforced was compared with procedures whereby <b>correct</b> responses to prompts and probes were differentially reinforced according to separate and independent schedules of primary reinforcement. In Phase 1, <b>correct</b> responses to prompts and probes were reinforced nondifferentially on a fixed ratio (FR) 6 or 8 schedule; in Phase 2, <b>correct</b> responses to prompts were reinforced on the FR schedule and <b>correct</b> responses to probes were reinforced on an FR schedule of the same value; in Phase 3, <b>correct</b> responses to prompts were reinforced on the FR schedule and <b>correct</b> responses to probes were reinforced on a continuous reinforcement (CRF; every <b>correct</b> response reinforced) schedule; in Phase 4, <b>correct</b> responses to prompts were reinforced on a CRF schedule and <b>correct</b> responses to probes were reinforced on the FR schedule; in Phase 5, a reversal to the conditions of Phase 3 was conducted. For all three children, the FR schedule for <b>correct</b> responses to prompts combined with the CRF schedule for <b>correct</b> responses to probes (Phases 3 and 5) generated the highest number of <b>correct</b> responses to probes, the highest accuracy (<b>correct</b> responses relative to <b>correct</b> responses plus errors) on probe trials, and the highest rate of learning to name pictures...|$|R

30|$|In {{our study}} “Number of <b>correct</b> answers” {{indicates}} {{the number of}} <b>correct</b> choices for a given question. For instance, if {{the total number of}} answer choices is 15 for a given question and 5 out of the 15 are <b>correct,</b> the “number of <b>correct</b> answers” is 5. In our study, the performance and number of <b>correct</b> answers was found to be negatively correlated for legitimate users. In other words, questions with more <b>correct</b> answers were answered less correctly by legitimate users. Interestingly, while increasing the “number of <b>correct</b> answers” negatively affects accuracy score of legitimate users, there is no significant effect on accuracy score of adversaries.|$|R
