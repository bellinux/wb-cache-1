40|$|Seventeen {{subjects}} {{with more than}} 3 x 10 (5) mutans streptococci per millilitre of saliva completed this randomised, cross-over study. Four different <b>chewing-gums,</b> containing: (1) 70 % xylitol, (2) 35 % xylitol + 35 % sorbitol, (3) 17. 5 % xylitol + 52. 5 % sorbitol, and (4) 70 % sorbitol, were tested. The participants used 12 pieces of each gum per day for 25 days. During the four experimental periods, they wore a removable palatinal plate containing two demineralised enamel samples, and brushed their teeth with a non-fluoridated toothpaste. The results showed that an increased concentration of xylitol in the gum resulted in a lower number of mutans streptococci in both saliva and dental plaque, although the decreases were only significant in the saliva samples (p < 0. 01). The pH drop in plaque, measured in vivo after a 1 -min mouthrinse with a 10 % sorbitol solution, was least pronounced after the 70 % xylitol gum and most pronounced after the 70 % sorbitol gum period (p < 0. 01). No {{significant differences were found}} after a mouthrinse with a 10 % sucrose solution. All demineralised enamel samples lost mineral during the experimental periods. However, the lesion depth as well as the mineral loss values, assessed microradiographically, did not differ significantly between the four <b>chewing-gums...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to present {{chemical}} structure and basic characteristics of some active substances in medical plants which are used in stomatology. Considering their chemical content and pharmacological effects, all active substances of herbal origin are divided in four groups tannins, flavonoids, aetheric oils and the group of herbal species which show immunostimulating effect. Tannins are active substances of medical plants whose function are primarily based on precipitation of proteins and are used for disinfection of skin and oral mucose {{as well as for}} haemostatic purposes. Flavonoids are herbal pigments. They work as diuretics, and in dentistry they could be used as antiinflammatory agents. Essential oils are part of herbal species and are used as korigens of taste and smell. For their antiseptic and disinfective effects, essential oils are used in dentistry as preparations like toothpastes, mouth wash and <b>chewing-gums.</b> Immunostimulators of herbal origin are especially interesting in the decreasing immunity treatment for their slight toxic characteristics...|$|E
30|$|In {{line with}} the expectation, the {{comparison}} of the absorbed doses per activity between the lemon-juice and <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation groups yielded, on average, a significantly lower value for the <b>chewing-gum</b> than for the lemon-juice stimulation group (Table  2 and Figure  4). The absorbed dose per activity was approximately 30 % to 40 % lower when chewing tasteless gum. The above findings demonstrate that the increased blood flow {{appears to be a}} decisive factor causing the increased absorbed doses in the lemon-juice stimulation group. However, {{no significant difference in the}} absorbed doses per activity (P[*]≥[*] 0.60) was observed between the <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation and non-stimulation groups (Figure  4); the percentage difference of the mean absorbed dose was − 8 % for the submandibular gland and 5 % for the parotid gland. Contrary to the expectation, <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation and non-stimulation yielded similar absorbed doses per activity. Thus, the assumed washout effect was not large enough to alter significantly the absorbed dose between the <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation and non-stimulation groups.|$|R
30|$|The sonograms in {{the three}} test persons showed that glandular blood {{perfusion}} by lemon-juice stimulation was clearly increased compared with non-stimulation or chewing of gum base. The sonogram comparison between the <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation and non-stimulation demonstrated a minor increase of blood flow for the gum base-stimulated salivary glands. The mean[*]±[*]standard deviation of the absorbed dose per activity under <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation for the submandibular and parotid glands (within parentheses) was 0.22 [*]±[*] 0.09  Gy/GBq (0.22 [*]±[*] 0.08  Gy/GBq). Compared with the absorbed doses of the non-stimulation group, 0.24 [*]±[*] 0.08  Gy/GBq (0.21 [*]±[*] 0.05  Gy/GBq), those of the <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation group showed no significant change (P[*]>[*] 0.60), but the absorbed doses of the lemon-juice stimulation group, 0.35 [*]±[*] 0.14  Gy/GBq (0.33 [*]±[*] 0.09  Gy/GBq), were significantly higher (P[*]<[*] 0.04) {{than those of the}} <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation group.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research program was to determine a new way in caries and erosion prevention. To achieve this target was analyzed the more effective anti-caries and anti-erosive bio-active molecules of natural origin, in order to elaborate a new novel chewing gum device. The under discussion molecules were plant polyphenols and casein-phosphopeptides. The research project has been divided in three parts: initially, was analyzed in vitro, through SEM inspection and pH analysis, the remineralizing effect of casein-phosphopeptides against cola drink dental erosion. In the second part, a microbiological assay of effects of Plantago lanceolata tea on oral bacteria was assessed: initially, the P. lanceolata tea was chemical analyzed for its polyphenolic content; then, the MIC and MBC were determined for P. lanceolata extracts against cariogenic bacteria; subsequently, a controlled random clinical study was conducted on 44 volunteers to evaluate a P. lanceolata-based mouth rinse on cariogenic bacteria content in saliva. In the third part, in vitro experiments were performed using a specifically designed chewing apparatus to test the release in artificial saliva of Calcium (derived from CPP) and Quercetin included in gums, during the chewing time; while the in vivo experiments required a two sessions clinical trial, performed by 10 volunteers, in order to analyze the in vivo performance of the experimental <b>chewing-gums...</b>|$|E

30|$|The inter-group {{comparison}} {{showed that}} the mean absorbed doses averaged over both gland types in the <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation group were reduced by approximately 35 % (0.22  Gy/GBq) compared {{with those in the}} lemon-juice stimulation group; this observed difference was statistically significant (P[*]<[*] 0.001, Figure  4 a). The inter-group comparison, however, yielded {{no significant difference in the}} absorbed doses between the <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation and non-stimulation groups (P[*]=[*] 0.99, Figure  4 a). Separate inter-group comparisons for the parotid or submandibular glands exhibited a significant difference in the absorbed doses between the <b>chewing-gum</b> and lemon-juice stimulation groups for both the submandibular (P[*]=[*] 0.04, Figure  4 b) and parotid glands (P[*]<[*] 0.001, Figure  4 c).|$|R
30|$|This study {{provided}} evidence, on {{the basis}} of 124 I PET/CT imaging, that <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation immediately after 131 I administration did not significantly decrease the absorbed dose to the salivary glands in radioiodine therapy compared with the non-stimulated salivary glands. We suggest that the increased glandular blood flow overcompensates the washout effect in the lemon-juice stimulation group and, to a lesser extent, also in the <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation group.|$|R

30|$|This finding {{allows the}} {{following}} conjecture: If the lemon-juice stimulation is actually {{associated with an}} increase of the absorbed dose per activity primarily caused by an increased glandular blood flow, {{the results of the}} sonography investigations suggest that the absorbed doses should be lower for the non-stimulation and <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation groups. In addition, because Dawes and Macpherson [15] demonstrated that the salivary flow was higher while chewing gum base than for non-stimulation, it is expected that the absorbed doses will be lower for the <b>chewing-gum</b> stimulation group than for the non-stimulation and lemon-juice stimulation groups. Thus, the washout effect may dominate over the rebound effect when chewing gum base. These suggestions were partially confirmed in this study.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} using {{nicotine}} <b>chewing-gum</b> to treat dependent smokers attending a withdrawal clinic {{were compared with}} the results of psychological treatment. At one-year follow-up 26 (38 %) out of 69 people who received nicotine gum were abstinent compared with seven (14 %) out of 49 who received psychological treatment (p < 0. 01). Abstinence was confirmed by the measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin concentrations or expired air carbon monoxide. Blood nicotine concentrations when patients used the gum averaged half the smoking values, and side effects were few. Addiction occurred in only two subjects. Thus nicotine <b>chewing-gum</b> is a useful aid to giving up smoking and is probably acceptable even for people with cardiovascular disease...|$|R
