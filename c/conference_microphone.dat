The mian frequencey range of wireless <b>conference</b> <b>microphone</b> is various, the mostly applied one is 2.4 GHz based on Wifi. 5.8Ghz is also applied in the wireless <b>conference</b> <b>microphone</b> communication system.The traditional <b>conference</b> <b>microphone</b> is connencted to the control unit or PC with some cables to modularize the signal or encrypt the signal. The encryption technology of wireless conference system is various.

50|$|Wireless {{conference system}} is the conference system that the {{communication}} between <b>conference</b> <b>microphones</b> and system control unit {{does not depend on}} by various cables but by modulating wireless signal. The development history of wireless conference system is as below:Firstly, the communication system is based on the digital modulating signal based on infrared ray,which is evloved from IR interpreation system.Secondly, the technique applied in wireless conference system is 2.4 GHz modulating signal, which support more stable communication and avoid environment interference cased by buildings, sun lights and others.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a <b>conference</b> <b>microphone</b> system designed around a TMS 320 C 44, floating point, {{digital signal processor}} (DSP). The <b>conference</b> <b>microphone</b> is a real time audio processor designed to perform two primary functions; acoustic beamforming and automatic sound source localization. Although the system was designed specifically as a front end for assistive listening systems, it has many practical applications requiring high quality, speech band audio such as remote transcription services and video-conferencing. The Direction Finding, Beam Forming (DFBF) <b>conference</b> <b>microphone</b> consists of a tabletop unit containing a 16 microphone array and amplification electronics. This unit is connected to a PCI plug-in DSP card and 16 channel analog to digital (A/D) converter via a 37 pin ‘D ’ type cable. The tabletop unit has a single line level output which can be connected {{to a variety of}} transmission and/or amplification systems. While the current implementation uses a personal computer (PC) and a floating point DSP, it is expected that a commercially viable solution would contain a fixed point DSP board and would be completely housed in the tabletop unit. The acoustic beamformer is a two-band superdirective system using fixed coefficients and 8 microphones. There are two identical arrays arranged at right angles to each other. The geometry of the arrays allows the system to generate four directional patterns, each covering 90 degrees in the horizontal plane. Sound source localization is performed using a modified cross-correlation algorithm which uses periodic features of voiced speech to obtain accurat...|$|E

30|$|Nowadays, the {{flexibility}} provided by hands-free communication devices has revolutionized the way humans communicate. Nonetheless, when one deals with hands-free systems {{there are several}} issues to face and problems to solve. The most relevant one is the echo presence, due to the acoustic coupling between microphones and loudspeakers located in the same room. Thus, an acoustic echo canceler is needed and several algorithmic solutions have been proposed in the literature {{in the last two}} decades [1]. More recently, the academic and technology market interest has been attracted by the chance to employ spatial audio techniques to enhance the sound realism in teleconferencing systems. Thus, many solutions have been proposed for multiparty <b>conferencing</b> where more <b>microphones</b> and loudspeakers are involved in each room. As a consequence of this, suitable multichannel AEC algorithms have been developed to deal with the echo problem in presence of multiple audio paths, where the task to be solved is tougher than in the single-channel case study, as rigorously illustrated in [2]. Indeed, the “non-uniqueness problem” occurs in the multichannel scenario, due to the high correlation degree between recorded signals: a very popular involved technique involves the addition of a decorrelation module to allow multichannel adaptive filtering working properly [2 – 5].|$|R
40|$|During lectures {{with many}} {{students}} and conferences with large audiences {{there is often}} a wish to establish a two-way communication between the speaker and the audience. Discussions, questions and audience participation normally enhance the value of a lecture or presentation. One barrier for a good two-way communication is that large auditoriums make it difficult for the whole audience to hear a random audience member speak. Today, some <b>conferences</b> support handout <b>microphones</b> or those who wish to speak may queue {{up in front of a}} stationary microphone, but this is not usually found at lectures in large auditoriums. In this thesis, a proposal for a design and a prototype system that simplify the interaction between the lecturer and the audience is described. Today, almost everyone have access to a smart phone, tablet or other handheld device. The design presents a system where these handheld devices act as both microphones and clients to a server which is connected to any auditorium's speakers. The system is a type of interaction system, which focuses on the use of voice from clients to server. A lecturer can use his or her personal computer, connect it to a speaker and run the server side of the system. Every student may use their own handheld device, connect it to the running server, and speak into the device as microphone for the auditorium. With this system, audience members are able to speak with a normal voice whether they are seated in the front or in the back of the auditorium. As the voice is transmitted through speakers, everyone are able to hear what is said without any need of repetition. Today, almost all handheld devices support both WiFi and Bluetooth. The thesis gives an overview of the two technologies, and gives a reasoning for WiFi as the chosen the prototype solution. Other covered topics are range and connections. Testing of the prototype reveals a few challenges that should be further looked into. A complete system may improve the overall collaboration inside the auditorium...|$|R
