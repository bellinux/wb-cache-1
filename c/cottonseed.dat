40|$|<b>Cottonseeds</b> {{are rich}} in various {{essential}} amino acids. However, the inheritance of them at molecular level are still not defined across various genetic systems. In the present study, using a newly developed mapping model that can analyze the embryo and maternal main effects as well as QTL × environment interaction effects on quantitative quality trait loci (QTLs) in <b>cottonseeds,</b> a study on QTL located in the tetraploid embryo and tetraploid maternal plant genomes for essential amino acid contents in <b>cottonseeds</b> under different environments was carried out, using the immortal F 2 (IF 2) populations from a set of 188 recombinant inbred lines derived from an intraspecific hybrid cross of two upland cotton germplasms HS 46 and MARKCBUCAG 8 US- 1 - 88 as experimental materials. The results showed a total of 35 QTLs associated with these quality traits in <b>cottonseeds.</b> Nineteen QTLs were subsequently mapped on chromosome 5, 6 and 8 in sub-A genome and chromosome 15, 18, 22 and 23 in sub-D genome. Eighteen QTLs were also found having QTL × environment (QE) interaction effects. The genetic main effects from QTLs located on chromosomes in the embryo and maternal plant genomes and their QE effects in different environments were all important for these essential amino acids in <b>cottonseeds.</b> The results suggested that the influence of environmental factors on the expression of some QTLs located in different genetic systems should be considered when improving for these amino acids. This study can serve {{as the foundation for}} the improvement of these essential amino acids in <b>cottonseeds...</b>|$|R

5|$|Between 1848 and 1905, {{traffic on}} Beverley Beck more than trebled, from 33,498 tons to 101,540 tons. Coal and other {{minerals}} accounted for around {{one quarter of}} the traffic in 1905, while goods carried in 1906 included fertiliser, burnt ore, flour and scrap metal. Commercial traffic continued into the 1970s, when tolls of £2,365 were collected on 28,169 tons of cargo. Traffic on the Driffield Navigation was relatively steady between 1871 and 1905, falling slightly from 35,654 to 32,666 tons. Goods carried included coal, linseed, <b>cottonseed,</b> wheat, flour and artificial manures. In 1922, £7 of income was received from pleasure craft using the navigation. Traffic declined during the 1930s, with commercial traffic finally ceasing in 1944. The Leven Canal carried 4,242 tons in 1888 and 4,546 in 1905, but then succumbed to road competition, and closed in 1935.|$|E

40|$|As {{a part of}} an {{investigation}} of aflatoxins and other mycotoxins in <b>cottonseeds</b> at harvest, samples of seeds collected from the 1971 crop at locations across the U. S. Cotton Belt were examined to determine the kinds of microorganisms causing internal or seed-coat infection in the field. Aspergillus flavus infection was absent from all seeds examined from most areas but was present in some samples from Arizona, California, and Texas. Fusarium spp., Alternaria sp., and A. niger caused internal infection at many locations; Colletotrichum gossypii and Rhizopus stolonifer were present in seeds from some areas but were generally much less common. Many of the infections with A. niger were in the seed coat. Bacterial infections were fairly frequent. In a series of commerical samples from Arizona. A. flavus infection was found in 61 % of seeds, with fiber showing the bright, greenish-yellow (BGY) fluorescence that is diagnostic for A. flavus boll rot. Aflatoxin contamination was also concentration in the same seeds. The above findings agree with previous data showing that aflatoxin contamination of <b>cottonseeds</b> before harvest occurs rarely, if at all, {{in most parts of}} the U. S.

25|$|Secondly, oils can be {{heated and}} used to cook other foods. Oils {{suitable}} for this objective must have a high flash point. Such oils include the major cooking oils – soybean, rapeseed, canola, sunflower, safflower, peanut, <b>cottonseed,</b> etc. Tropical oils, such as coconut, palm, and rice bran oils, are particularly valued in Asian cultures for high-temperature cooking, because of their unusually high flash points.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, corn, sunflower, soy, and <b>cottonseed</b> oils.|$|E

50|$|Oil-palm tree fruits, soybeans, <b>cottonseeds,</b> {{and sesame}} seeds {{are the main}} sources of Colombian {{vegetable}} oils.

Palm-oil production was highly protected in the 1980s, but less so thereafter. An import tariff and a price band have remained as protection mechanisms. The way the oil-palm tree industry operates is {{closely tied to the}} existence of a price-stabilization fund, which equalizes the higher domestic price with the lower export price, as a tool to promote palm-oil exports.|$|R
40|$|N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) were {{quantified}} in {{seeds of}} several plant species and several cultivated varieties {{of a single}} species (cotton [Gossypium hirstutum]) by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The total NAE content of dry seeds ranged from 490 ± 89 ng g− 1 fresh weight in pea (Pisum sativum cv early Alaska) to 1, 608 ± 309 ng g− 1 fresh weight in cotton (cv Stoneville 7 A glandless). Molecular species of NAEs in all seeds contained predominantly 16 C and 18 C fatty acids, with N-linoleoylethanolamine (NAE 18 : 2) being the most abundant (approaching 1, 000 ng g− 1 fresh weight in <b>cottonseeds).</b> Total NAE levels dropped drastically following 4 h of imbibition in seeds of pea, cotton, and peanut (Arachis hypogea cv Virginia), and this decline was most pronounced for NAE 18 : 2. A novel enzyme activity was identified in cytosolic fractions of imbibed <b>cottonseeds</b> that hydrolyzed NAE 18 : 2 in vitro. NAE degradation was optimal at 35 °C in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6. 5, and was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5, 5 ′-dithio-bis(2 -nitrobenzoic acid), which is typical of other amide hydrolases. Amidohydrolase activity in cytosolic fractions exhibited saturation kinetics toward the NAE 18 : 2 substrate, with an apparent Km of 65 μm and a Vmax of 83 nmol min− 1 mg− 1 protein. Total NAE amidohydrolase activity increased during seed imbibition, with the highest levels (about four times that in dry seeds) measured 2 h after commencing hydration. NAEs belong {{to the family of}} “endocannabinoids,” which have been identified as potent lipid mediators in other types of eukaryotic cells.

The US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute urged saturated fats be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, listing olive and canola oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of polyunsaturated fats. One study showed that consumption of non-hydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean and sunflower are preferable to the consumption of palm oil for lowering the risk of heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel is {{made from}} animal fats or {{vegetable}} oils, renewable resources that come from plants such as jatropha, soybean, sunflowers, corn, olive, peanut, palm, coconut, safflower, canola, sesame, <b>cottonseed,</b> etc. Once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol, biodiesel is brought to life from this chemical reaction. These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions, or used alone. Despite one’s mixture preference, biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants (carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons) than conventional diesel, because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently. Even with regular diesel’s reduced quantity of sulfur from the ULSD (ultra-low sulfur diesel) invention, biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free.|$|E
