2500|$|Stonehouse {{wrote that}} wreck of [...] " [...] the Mather {{is one of}} the best known {{examples}} a wooden freighter still available for examination." [...] The Mather is a popular wreck site for scuba diving as she sits upright with an intact deck and mostly intact stern superstructure.

[...] Although the Mather is not the deepest dive in the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve, she claimed the life of three scuba divers, one in 1998 and one in 1999, and the third in 2012.

2500|$|Most food in Alaska is transported {{into the}} state from [...] "Outside", and {{shipping}} costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Though most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>at</b> all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a [...] of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely 20–30¢ higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.|$|E

The {{view of the}} bay {{and town}} from the stone tower {{at the top of}} Cerro Caprón make it worth the hike up the [...] hill. Thirty-six miles of trails and ten miles (16km) of undeveloped coastline, with {{peculiar}} limestone caves along the western side of the harbor make it a special place. Highway route 325 leads west to Point Jorobado and good snorkeling. Route 333 leads east by a small but beautifully situated park {{at the base of a}} cliff, and past the [...] Guánica Lighthouse, now in disrepair with restoration plans ahead. Route 333 follows the coast, bordered with mangroves, to Balneario Caña Gorda, by the Copamarina Beach Resort. There are several good seafood restaurants in town and at the end of this road; the end of the road is also a favorite bird watching area. Nearby are several mountain biking trails, fantastic beaches, and the Ballena Bay refuge for turtles, birds, and other wildlife. This refuge narrowly escaped Club Med's development plans. Its peculiar though precarious natural state makes the region a place of great beauty and scientific importance.|$|E

It may {{be noted}} in passing, that this wall which with its regular fosse defends the Riffelhorn on its western side, {{and a similar}} one on its eastern side, though neither of them of any {{considerable}} height, are curious instances of trenchant precipice, formed, I suppose, by slight slips or faults of the serpentine rock. The summit of the horn, a, Fig. 78, {{seems to have been}} pushed up in a mass beyond the rest of the ridge, or else the rest of the ridge to have dropped from it on each side, at b c, leaving the two troublesome faces of cliff right across the crag, hard, green as a sea wave, and polished like the inside of a seashell, where the weather has not effaced the surface produced by the slip. It is only by getting past the eastern cliff that the summit <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>at</b> all, for on its two lateral escarpments the mountain seems quite inaccessible, being in its whole mass nothing else than the top of a narrow wall with a raised battlement, as rudely shown in perspective at e d; the flanks of the wall falling towards the glacier on one side, and to the lower Riffel on the other, four or five hundred feet, not, indeed, in unbroken precipice, but in a form quite incapable of being scaled.[84] ...|$|E
