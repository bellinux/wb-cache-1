40|$|Abstract. Sleeve {{structure}} {{is used to}} joint component parts of aerocraft or other product design and manufacture. It is an incompletely rigid joint. The <b>contact</b> stiffness of <b>sleeve</b> {{structure is}} non-linear {{and it must be}} taken into account for static or dynamic analysis. The assembling technology of sleeve structure is influenceable on the natural attributes of the structure. In this paper, nonlinear finite element method with the gap element of MSN/NASTRAN is combined with hammering test to simulate the nonlinear <b>contact</b> problem of <b>sleeve</b> structure design and manufacture. A novel method is used to define the close stiffness of gap element. Effect of assembling technologic parameters on inherent characteristic of sleeve structure are studied, such as diameter, quantity, arrangement mode of joint bolts and the prestressing force on bolts. Processes of sleeve structure assembling are proposed through theoretically analysis and simulating calculation...|$|R
50|$|Many {{vehicles}} {{were described as}} being fault-prone due to lubrication of the cylinder and <b>sleeve</b> <b>contact</b> faces. Often, proper lubrication could not be guaranteed with the lubricants available at the time, especially with inadequate maintenance. This problem increased with engine speeds over 1600 rpm, {{at which point the}} sleeve-valve engine ceased to provide superior output. With a maximum attainable engine speed of about 1750 rpm, the long-term development potential for the engine was limited.|$|R
50|$|A {{standard}} stereo jack {{is used on}} most battery-powered guitar effects pedals {{to eliminate}} the need for a separate power switch. In this configuration, the internal battery has its negative terminal wired to the <b>sleeve</b> <b>contact</b> of the jack. When the user plugs in a two-conductor (mono) guitar or microphone lead, the resulting short-circuit between sleeve and ring connects an internal battery to the unit's circuitry, ensuring that it powers up or down automatically whenever a signal lead is inserted or removed. A drawback of this design is the risk of inadvertently discharging the battery if the lead is not removed after use, such as if the equipment is left plugged in overnight.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{standardization}} in {{the past}} regarding the dimensions (length) given to the ring conductor and the insulating portions on either side of it in 6.35 mm ( [...] in) phone connectors and the width of the conductors in different brands and generations of sockets there are occasional issues with compatibility between differing brands of plug and socket. This can result in a contact in the socket bridging (shorting) the ring and <b>sleeve</b> <b>contacts</b> on a phone connector, or where a phone plug is inserted into a two-conductor TS socket in some cases the intended 'sleeve' contact in the socket making contact with only the 'ring' portion of the plug.|$|R

40|$|A pair of {{substantially}} opposed {{mating surfaces}} are joined {{to each other}} and sealed in place by means of an electrically-conductive member which is placed in proximity to the mating surfaces. The electrically-conductive member has at least one element secured thereto which is positioned to contact the mating surfaces, and which softens when the electrically-conductive member is heated by passing an electric current therethrough. The softened element conforms to the mating surfaces, and upon cooling of the softened element the mating surfaces are joined together in an effective seal. Of particular significance is an embodiment of the electrically-conductive member which is a gasket having an electrically-conductive gasket base and a pair of the elements secured to opposite sides of the gasket base. This embodiment is positioned between the opposed mating surfaces to be joined to each other. Also significant is an embodiment of the electrically-conductive member which is an electrically-conductive sleeve having an element secured to its inner surface. This embodiment surrounds cylindrical members the bases of which are the substantially opposed mating surfaces to be joined, and the element on the inner surface of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>contacts</b> the outer surfaces of the cylindrical members...|$|R
40|$|AbstractF 1 -ATPase is an ATP-driven rotary {{molecular}} motor {{in which the}} central γ-subunit rotates inside a cylinder made of α 3 β 3 subunits. The amino and carboxyl termini of the γ rotor form a coiled coil of α-helices that penetrates the stator cylinder {{to serve as an}} axle. Crystal structures indicate that the axle is supported by the stator at two positions, at the orifice and by the hydrophobic sleeve surrounding the axle tip. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>contacts</b> are almost exclusively to the longer carboxyl-terminal helix, whereas nearly half the orifice contacts are to the amino-terminal helix. Here, we truncated the amino-terminal helix stepwise up to 50 residues, removing one half of the axle all the way up and far beyond the orifice. The half-sliced axle still rotated with an unloaded speed a quarter of the wild-type speed, with torque nearly half the wild-type torque. The truncations were made in a construct where the rotor tip was connected to a β-subunit via a short peptide linker. Linking alone did not change the rotational characteristics significantly. These and previous results show that nearly half the normal torque is generated if rotor-stator interactions either at the orifice or at the sleeve are preserved, suggesting that the make of the motor is quite robust...|$|R
40|$|Abdominal aortic aneurysms are a focal {{dilation}} of the aorta {{which can}} be potentially life threatening if left untreated. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a noninvasive treatment that can reduce the mortality rate {{when compared to the}} standard open repair. Yet, EVAR is associated with other complications that can arise such as migration, endoleaks, or device related failures. These complications drive the need for reinterventions which have been shown to occur more frequently with EVAR than with open repair. The long term fixation and sealing characteristics of these devices is likely related to the nature of its apposition to the aortic wall. Currently there is little understanding of these mechanics and factors in how the device performs at the time of deployment. A computational model that reflects the compressive nature of an endovascular graft is beneficial in investigating these mechanics. The aims of the study are; 1) formulate an experimental methodology that captures the radial compressive nature of the stent graft, 2) develop a parameterized finite element model of the stent structure, and 3) compare the compressive behavior this model against the acquired experimental data. A 2 mil polyethylene sleeve was used to transfer a compressive vacuum pressure from the sleeve onto 10 independent stent grafts. The loading-unloading pressure was cycled from 0 to - 50 mmHg (complete collapse) over 5 minutes. A pressure transducer and optical micrometer were used to capture the vacuum pressure and diameter relationship. All ten grafts compressed in a similar elliptical shape configuration. Commercial software was leveraged to construct a parameterized model of the stent geometry. All crest and trough vertex locations of the sinusoidal stent structure were validated within 1 mm of a measured value. A dynamic quasi-static computational simulation was completed that included large deformations and <b>contact</b> between the <b>sleeve</b> and stent as well as self-contact in the sleeve. Our results show that the model is representative of the experiments and can be used to interrogate how a stent graft will perform during certain stages of deployment and immediately after deployment with some caution in regard to the stated limitations...|$|R
6000|$|Why, however, should I pick up {{so small}} a crumb from that mere brief first course at a banquet of {{initiation}} {{which was in}} the event to prolong itself through years and years?--unless indeed as a scrap of a specimen, chosen at hazard, of the prompt activity of a process by which my intelligence afterwards came to find itself more fed, I think, than from any other source at all, or, for that matter, from all other sources put together. A hundred more suchlike modest memories breathe upon me, each with its own dim little plea, as I turn to face them, but my idea is to deal somehow more conveniently with the whole gathered mass of my subsequent impressions in this order, a fruitage that I feel to have been only too abundantly stored. Half a dozen of those of a larger and more immediate dignity, incidents more particularly of the rather invidiously so-called social <b>contact,</b> pull my <b>sleeve</b> as I pass; but the long, backward-drawn train of the later life drags them along with it, lost and smothered in its spread--only one of them stands out or remains over, insisting on its place and hour, its felt distinguishability. To this day I feel again that roused emotion, my unsurpassably prized admission to the presence of the great George Eliot, whom I was taken to see, by one of the kind door-opening Norton ladies, by whom Mrs. Lewes's guarded portal at North Bank appeared especially penetrable, on a Sunday afternoon of April '69. Later occasions, after a considerable lapse, were not to overlay the absolute face-value, as I may call it, of all the appearances then and there presented me--which were taken home by a young spirit almost abjectly grateful, at any rate all devoutly prepared, for them. I find it idle even to wonder what [...] "place" [...] the author of Silas Marner and Middlemarch may be conceived to have in the pride of our literature--so settled and consecrated in the individual range of view is many such a case free at last to find itself, free after ups and downs, after fluctuations of fame or whatever, which have divested judgment of any relevance that isn't most of all the relevance of a living and recorded relation. It has ceased then to know itself in any degree as an estimate, has shaken off the anxieties of circumspection and comparison and just grown happy to act as an attachment pure and simple, an effect of life's own logic, but in the ashes of which the wonted fires of youth need but to be blown upon for betrayal of a glow. Reflective appreciation may have originally been concerned, whether at its most or at its least, but it is well over, to our infinite relief--yes, to our immortal comfort, I think; the interval back cannot again be bridged. We simply sit with our enjoyed gain, our residual rounded possession in our lap; a safe old treasure, which has ceased to shrink, if indeed also perhaps greatly to swell, and all that further touches it is the fine vibration set up if the name we know it all by is called into question--perhaps however little.|$|R
