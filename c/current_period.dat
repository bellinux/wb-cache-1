No club outside the Old Firm has won the title since the 1984–85 season, when the Aberdeen side managed by Alex Ferguson won the Premier Division.

500|$|The {{official}} Congress communique set 2020 as a date {{on which}} Vietnam would reach {{the status of}} a modern, industrial society. To reach this goal, the targeted growth for gross domestic product (GDP) was set at 7.5–8 percent for 2006–2011. The congress promised to renew the socialist-oriented market economy, and step up its fight against political corruption. The communique emphasized the party's goal of a future society without exploitation, based on the ideology of Marxism–Leninism. The Political Report, the Eighth Five-Year Plan (2006–2010)officially titled the Five Year Socio-economic Development Plan, the report on Party building and the amendment and revision to the Party's charter, were approved. Mạnh said that the approval of these documents were [...] "the results of the intellect and the will of our entire Party and people, the in-depth practical and theoretical summation of 20 years of Renovation [...] and the improvement and development of the policy and philosophy of renovations in the <b>current</b> <b>period</b> of our country's revolution." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first serious}} {{attempts}} {{to formulate a}} geologic time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth {{were made in the}} late 18th century. The most influential of those early attempts (championed by Werner, among others) divided the rocks of Earth's crust into four types: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Each type of rock, according to the theory, formed during a specific period in Earth history. It was thus possible to speak of a [...] "Tertiary Period" [...] as well as of [...] "Tertiary Rocks." [...] Indeed, [...] "Tertiary" [...] (now Paleogene and Neogene) remained in use as the name of a geological period well into the 20th century and [...] "Quaternary" [...] remains in formal use as the name of the <b>current</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Most Hindus {{believe that}} the <b>current</b> <b>period</b> is the Kali Yuga, the last of four Yuga {{that make up the}} current age.

Each kalpa lasts 4.1 – 8.2 billion years, which is a period of one full day and night for Brahma, who in turn will live for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. The cycle of birth, growth, decay, and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by vagaries of divine intervention in Vaishnavite belief. Some Shaivites hold the view that Shiva is incessantly destroying and creating the world.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, the {{development}} of Cockburn's position on global warming seemed more consistent with views usually held by those on the Right. He believed the phenomenon has not been proven {{to be caused by}} humans. In 2008 Cockburn wrote A Short History of Fear in which he went after the subject of anthropogenic global warming and later writing in Spiked that [...] "you can account for the current warming by a number of well-known factors - to do with the elliptical course of the Earth in its relationship to the sun, the axis of the Earth in the <b>current</b> <b>period,</b> and possibly the influence of solar flares." [...] He cited the statements of Martin Hertzberg that rising CO2 levels are a symptom, not a cause, of global warming, which Hertzberg asserts is the result of natural, predictable changes in the Earth's elliptic orbit. Hertzberg is a semi-retired explosives expert who does not claim to be a climatologist. The arguments given by Hertzberg and Cockburn are the famous Milankovitch cycles.|$|E
2500|$|Lisa Shalett, chief {{investment}} officer at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management noted that, [...] "for {{the last two decades}} and especially in the <b>current</b> <b>period,</b> ... productivity soared ...

So where have the benefits of technology-driven productivity cycle gone? Almost exclusively to corporations and their very top executives." [...] In addition to the technological side of it, the affected functionality emanates from the perceived unfairness and the reduced trust of people towards the state. The study by Kristal and Cohen showed that rising wage inequality has brought about an unhealthy competition between institutions and technology. [...] The technological changes, with computerization of the workplace, seem to give an upper hand to the high-skilled workers as the primary cause of inequality in America. The qualified will always be considered to be in a better position as compared to those dealing with hand work leading to replacements and unequal distribution of resources.|$|E
