In conjunction with eliminating the Brielle <b>Circle,</b> Route 70 was also widened between the intersection with Jack Martin Boulevard in Brick Township and the former <b>circle.</b> In July 2004, floods caused by heavy rain washed away a bridge along the route in Southampton Township, leading for it to be replaced. The New Jersey Department of Transportation replaced the September 11th Memorial Bridge over the Manasquan River in a $52 million project that increased capacity on the bridge and added monumental decorations and increased pedestrian access.

Through proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In Measurement of a <b>Circle</b> he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a <b>circle</b> and a smaller regular hexagon inside the <b>circle,</b> and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a <b>circle.</b> After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he {{was able to}} determine that the value of π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the area of a <b>circle</b> was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the <b>circle</b> (πr2). In On the Sphere and Cylinder, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the Archimedean property of real numbers.|$|E
