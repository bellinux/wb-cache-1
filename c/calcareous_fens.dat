Multivariate analyses were used to describe these wetland systems. The second objective of this study included investigating whether or not the disjunct Betula glandulosa (dwarf birch) population was restricted to its current site. B. glandulosa is a habitat generalist in its known range; however, it is found in only one location within the Alexander Archipelago. Germination and seedling transplant experiments were conducted that tested for the effects of site, competition, and the interaction between site and competition.

50|$|Cypripedium reginae {{grows in}} {{wetlands}} such as fens and open wooded swamps that are sometimes populated by tamarack and black spruce.7 Cyp. reginae thrives in neutral to basic soils {{but can be}} found in slightly acidic conditions. The plants often form in clumps by branching of the underground rhizomes. Its roots are typically within a few inches of the top of the soil. It prefers very loose soils and when growing in fens it will most often be found in mossy hummocks. This photo, taken in a forested, <b>calcareous</b> <b>fen</b> in Williamstown, MA, is only one of 14 occurrences currently documented in the state (1984 to the present 2016). The increasing rarity of this plant is attributable to destruction of a suitable alkaline habitat - and an exploding deer population whose browsing stunts or eliminates its growth.It can tolerate full sun but prefers partial shade for some part of the day. When exposed to full sun, the flower lip is somewhat bleached and less deeply colored. It is occasionally eaten by white-tailed deer.8 Cypripedium reginae {{can be found in}} Canada from Saskatchewan east to Atlantic Canada, and the eastern United States south to Arkansas and Tennessee.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} and occurrence of plant species {{within a given}} region provides insight into the many environmental properties of that region. Although much {{research has been conducted}} on plant communities and associated environmental properties, few studies have been conducted on the characteristics of individual plants within those communities. <b>Calcareous</b> <b>fens</b> are wetlands formed by the upwelling of mineral-rich groundwater and often are associated with many unique plant communities and rare species of flora and fauna. Although many studies have documented the vegetation patterns and associated environmental gradients of these fens, none have isolated the specific hydrogeochemical conditions associated with individual species, nor have any studies attempted to document and compare the individual physiological response of species to elevated environmental calcium levels. This research was conducted to estimate environmental calcium requirements for rare as well as common indicator species of <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens</b> of Massachusetts and {{to examine the relationship between}} the accumulation of calcium in the tissues of these species to calcium availability in their environment. These factors will be important when determining required conditions for fen restoration and will further the understanding of why these species often only occur in <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens.</b> Eight calcareous fen study sites at three different locations were established where calciphiles occur in western Massachusetts. In each site, data were collected on the vegetation patterns and associated soil chemistry, water chemistry, and hydrology. In addition, plant tissues were collected and analyzed for calcium. Species distributions were evaluated as to whether they increased in abundance as environmental calcium did or whether they appeared to occur only once a specific calcium threshold was met. In addition, the concentrations of calcium in the tissues were used to determine the extent to which those plants accumulated calcium and how those levels related to levels of calcium in the substrate environment and to their overall distributions. It was found that certain calciphiles are calcium specialists, i. e. they are more abundant when environmental calcium levels are elevated, absorb greater quantities of calcium and those quantities correlate to the available environmental supply. These species include Parnassia glauca, Packera aurea, Geum rivale and Carex granularis. Of these, Geum rivale and Carex granularis, as well as Carex sterilis, did not occur below calcium concentrations of 48 mg. L- 1. However, other calciphiles are calcium generalists, i. e. they are tolerant of elevated calcium levels but show no other relationship with respect to growth or accumulation. These species include Carex flava, Carex hystericina, Juncus nodosus, Solidago patula, Solidago uliginosa, and Symphyotrichum puniceum. In addition, some wetland generalists maintain elevated calcium levels (Symplocarpus foetidus and Mentha arvensis) whereas most others do not (Thelypteris palustris and Fragaria vesca). Of the calciphile and wetland generalist species, some appear to increase in abundance in <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens</b> in relation to increases in accessory benefits (Dasiphora fruticosa and Juncus brachycephalus with pH; Thelypteris palustris and Carex flava with magnesium and possibly Equisetum fluviatile with iron). Combined, these findings characterize the growth habits and calcium accumulation of species that grow in <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens</b> and indicate that calciphiles have varying degrees of dependence on calcium...|$|E
40|$|The minute snail Pupilla alpicola (Stylommatophora: Pupillidae) {{is known}} as a {{threatened}} glacial relict restricted to treeless <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens</b> with Holocene continuity, mainly in the Alpine and Carpathian regions. We summarize all available data on the distribution of P. alpicola and analyse its ecological requirements in the Western Carpathians both at a larger, regional scale (162 sites) and at a smaller, within-site scale (10 sites). Viable populations of Pupilla alpicola occurred in 31 sites out of the 162 fens studied. Water conductivity, Ellenberg’s indicator values for soil reaction, light and nutrients were the main ecological variables that explained these occurrences. The species preferred sites with extremely high calcium carbonate precipitation, low nutrients and sparse herb vegetation cover. Its present distribution in the Western Carpathians is strongly related to a spatial–temporal continuum of <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens</b> throughout the Holocene; none of the modern populations was located further than 40 km from the known palaeorefugium.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} dealt with carbon (C) {{concentrations}} in Histosols, {{but there are no}} studies quantifying the relative importance of all individual C components in pore waters. For this study, measurements were made of all the carbon components (i. e., particulate organic carbon, POC; dissolved organic carbon, DOC; dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC; dissolved methane, CH 4 ) in the soil pore water of a <b>calcareous</b> <b>fen</b> under three different water management regimes (re-wetted, deeply and moderately drained). Pore water was collected weekly or biweekly (April 2004 to April 2006) at depths between 10 and 150 cm. The main results obtained were: (1) DIC (94 &ndash; 280 mg C l&minus; 1 ) was the main C-component. (2) POC and DOC concentrations in the pore water (14 &ndash; 125 mg C l&minus; 1 vs. 41 &ndash; 95 mg C l&minus; 1 ) were pari passu. (3) Dissolved CH 4 was the smallest C component (0. 005 &ndash; 0. 9 mg C l&minus; 1 ). Interestingly, about 30 % of the POM particles were colonized by microbes indicating that they are active in the internal C transfer in the soil profile ("C-Shuttles"). Consequently, it was concluded that POC is at least as important as DOC for internal soil C turnover. There is no reason to assume significant biochemical differences between POC and DOC as they only differ in size. Therefore, both POC and DOC fractions are essential components of C budgets of peatlands. Furthermore dissolved CO 2 in all forms of DIC apparently {{is an important part of}} peatland C-balances...|$|R
40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} por el sistema de Compendio de PublicacionesMountain <b>calcareous</b> spring <b>fens</b> are floristically diverse wetlands fed by carbonate-rich groundwater. This thesis studies their seed ecology, {{focusing on}} the interaction between environmental temperature and germination. To this end we conduct laboratory germination experiments with <b>calcareous</b> spring <b>fen</b> species to characterize the temperature dimension of the germination niche and identify specific germination strategies. We explore the special thermal characteristics of fen soils and their consequences on germination. Using the Cantabrian endemic Centaurium somedanum as a study species, we investigate the germination ecology of spring specialists and perform a common garden experiment supported by ISSR fingerprinting to determine the genetic and environmental influences on seed dormancy variation. Based on our results, we propose two germination strategies. Fen species generally follow a warm strategy, characterized by a heat response capable of overriding dormancy during episodes of unusual heat. Spring species lack the heat response and germinate only at cool temperatures. Fen soils have a buffer effect that makes their temperature less extreme than predicted, especially during the night and in winter. However, the germination niche breadth of fen species shows plasticity and is narrower in regions with harsher winters. The germination ecology of the spring specialist C. somedanum departs from the general germination patterns of its genus, showing morphophysiological dormancy and cool germination. This species has a local dormancy cline that {{is related to the}} genetic composition of the populations and to site climate, but that also responds in the short term to the seed maturation environment. These results highlight the potential of germination traits to react to climate changes at different spatial and temporal scales...|$|R
40|$|<b>Calcareous</b> <b>fens</b> are {{considered}} to be among the most threatened ecosystems of Europe. They are {{also one of the most}} diverse habitats as they support an incredibly rich and diverse range of plant and animal species. However, in spite of their diversity, <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens</b> are still poorly investigated, especially when referring to fen invertebrates, such as spiders. Because spiders are good bioindicators, knowledge of their ecology in rare and threatened habitats is of interest. The aim of this study was to document the composition and diversity of spider species, families and foraging guilds in the ground– and grass–layers of the Apšuciems calcareous fen, and to evaluate the influence of vegetation structure on spider community organization. In summer 2012, we collected ground–dwelling spiders using pitfall traps and grass–dwelling spiders using sweep–netting. A total of 2, 937 spider individuals belonging to 19 families and 80 species was collected in the Apšuciems fen. Our results indicate that spider species and families tend to be stratified across the vertical structure of the habitat; the spider composition in the ground stratum differed from that in the grass stratum. On the contrary, however, the spider foraging guild structure between the ground–layer and the grass–layer was similar. Each of the two studied strata presented similar guilds in similar proportions. Our results also showed that spider composition differed considerably between fen parts and that much of this variability could be explained by the architectural properties of the habitat. More diverse vegetation generally supported a higher number of spider species...|$|E

40|$|Aims: Phytosociological {{classification}} of fen vegetation (Scheuchzerio palustris-Caricetea fuscae class) differs among European countries. Here we propose a unified vegetation {{classification of}} European fens at the alliance level, provide unequivocal assignment rules for individual vegetation plots, identify diagnostic species of fen alliances, and map their distribution. Location: Europe, western Siberia and SE Greenland. Methods: 29 049 vegetation-plot records of fens {{were selected from}} databases using a list of specialist fen species. Formal definitions of alliances were created using the presence, absence and abundance of Cocktail-based species groups and indicator species. DCA visualized the similarities among the alliances in an ordination space. The ISOPAM classification algorithm was applied to regional subsets with homogeneous plot size to check whether the classification based on formal definitions matches the results of unsupervised classifications. Results: The following alliances were defined: Caricion viridulo-trinervis (sub-halophytic Atlantic dune-slack fens), Caricion davallianae (temperate <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens),</b> Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis (arcto-alpine <b>calcareous</b> <b>fens),</b> Stygio-Caricion limosae (boreal topogenic brown-moss fens), Sphagno warnstorfii-Tomentypnion nitentis (Sphagnum-brown-moss rich fens), Saxifrago-Tomentypnion (continental to boreo-continental nitrogen-limited brown-moss rich fens), Narthecion scardici (alpine fens with Balkan endemics), Caricion stantis (arctic brown-moss rich fens), Anagallido tenellae-Juncion bulbosi (Ibero-Atlantic moderately rich fens), Drepanocladion exannulati (arcto-boreal-alpine non-calcareous fens), Caricion fuscae (temperate moderately rich fens), Sphagno-Caricion canescentis (poor fens) and Scheuchzerion palustris (dystrophic hollows). The main variation in the species composition of European fens reflected site chemistry (pH, mineral richness) and sorted the plots from calcareous and extremely rich fens, through rich and moderately rich fens, to poor fens and dystrophic hollows. ISOPAM classified regional subsets according to this gradient, supporting the ecological meaningfulness of this classification concept on both the regional and continental scale. Geographic/macroclimatic variation {{was reflected in the}} second most important gradient. Conclusions: The pan-European classification of fen vegetation was proposed and supported by the data for the first time.

40|$|Question: Why do similar fen meadow {{communities}} {{occur in}} different landscapes? How does the hydrological system sustain base-rich fen mires and fen meadows? Location: Interdunal wetlands and heathland pools in The Netherlands, percolation mires in Germany, Poland, and Siberia, and <b>calcareous</b> spring <b>fens</b> in the High Tatra, Slovakia. Methods: This review presents {{an overview of}} the hydrological conditions of fen mires and fen meadows that are highly valued in nature conservation due to their high biodiversity and the occurrence of many Red List species. Fen types covered in this review include: (1) small hydrological systems in young calcareous dune areas, and (2) small hydrological systems in decalcified old cover sand areas in The Netherlands; (3) large hydrological systems in river valleys in Central-Europe and western-Siberia, and (4) large hydrological systems of small <b>calcareous</b> spring <b>fens</b> with active precipitation of travertine in mountain areas of Slovakia. Results: Different landscape types can sustain similar nutrient poor and base-rich habitats required by endangered fen meadow species. The hydrological systems of these landscapes are very different in size, but their groundwater flow pattern is remarkably similar. Paleo-ecological research showed that travertine forming fen vegetation types persisted in German lowland percolation mires from 6000 to 3000 BP. Similar vegetation types can still be found in small mountain mires in the Slovak Republic. Small pools in such mires form a cascade of surface water bodies that stimulate travertine formation in various ways. Travertine deposition prevents acidification of the mire and sustains populations of basiphilous species that elsewhere in Europe are highly endangered. Conclusion: Very different hydrological landscape settings can maintain a regular flow of groundwater through the top soil generating similar base-rich site conditions. This is why some fen species occur in very different landscape types, ranging from mineral interdunal wetlands to mountain mires. ...|$|R

Our expedition showed that Peninsula Mitre hosts a wide variety of habitats across two exciting ecological gradients: (i) a regional west-east gradient from Sphagnum magellanicum dominated mires in the west to Astelia pumila dominated mires in the east; and (ii) a gradient from extremely acid to extremely carbonate rich mire types induced by local bedrock. The large variety of hydromorphological mire types comprises raised bogs, blanket bogs, sloping fens, string fens, flat <b>fens</b> and <b>calcareous</b> spring <b>fens.</b> In the Atlantic coastal area, the abundance of Sphagnum magellanicum in the ombrogenic systems decreases conspicuously from west to east with the species being almost absent in the east. However, the fossil record shows thick layers of Sphagnum peat close beneath mire surfaces everywhere, indicating that substantial hydrological and ecological changes have taken place in the recent past. We observed large scale erosion in the mires along the Atlantic coast. Locally, well-developed fen systems are present, including <b>calcareous</b> spring <b>fens</b> with active travertine (tufa) deposition.
