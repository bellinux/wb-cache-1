40|$|Propellant {{densification}} {{has been}} identified as a critical technology in the development of single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicles. Technology to create supercooled high-density liquid oxygen (LO 2) and liquid hydrogen (LH 2) is a key means to lowering launch vehicle costs. The densification of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellants</b> through subcooling allows 8 to 10 percent more propellant mass to be stored in a given unit volume, thereby improving the launch vehicle's overall performance. This allows for higher propellant mass fractions than would be possible with conventional normal boiling point <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellants,</b> considering the normal boiling point of LO 2 and LH 2...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cryogenic</b> <b>propellants</b> (liquid oxygen oxidizer, {{and liquid}} {{hydrogen}} fuel) {{need to be}} continuously topped off (i.e., boil-off replaced) during the launch sequence (countdown), as the vehicle awaits liftoff.

50|$|First {{put into}} active service in 1964, the R-9 carried a 1.65 to 5 Mt warhead. Though the last Soviet missile to use <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellant,</b> this design {{is one of}} the most widely {{deployed}} ICBMs to use cryogenic fuel. OKB-456 (later renamed to NPO Energomash) developed the initial stage of the two-stage missile, a four-chambered closed cycle design. The second stage, connected by trusses to the first stage (much like the modern Soyuz rocket) was also four-chambered, but utilized open combustion chambers more suited to very high altitudes. This rocket engine was a product of the OKB-154 design team. Guidance of the warhead, like most ICBMs before and after it, was totally inertial save the final ten seconds before detonation of the warhead, which was controlled by a radio-altimeter correction system.|$|E
40|$|Fundamentally, {{the volumes}} of the {{oxidizer}} and fuel propellant scavenged from the orbiter and external tank determine the size and weight of the scavenging system. The optimization of system dimensions and weights is stimulated by the requirement to minimize the use of partial length of the orbiter payload bay. Thus, the cost estimates begin with weights established for the optimum design. Both the design, development, test, and evaluation and theoretical first unit hardware production costs are estimated from parametric cost weight scaling relations for four subsystems. For <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellants,</b> the widely differing characteristics of the oxidizer and the fuel lead to two separate tank subsystems, {{in addition to the}} electrical and instrumentation subsystems. Hardwares costs also involve quantity, as an independent variable, since the number of production scavenging systems is not firm. For storable propellants, since the tankage volume of the oxidizer and fuel are equal, the hardware production costs for developing these systems are lower than for <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellants...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Boil-off of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellants</b> {{in space}} may be mitigated by both {{technological}} solutions {{as well as}} system-level planning and design.From a technical perspective: for a propellant depot with passive insulation system to effectively store cryogenic fluids, boil-off caused by heating from solar and other sources must be mitigated, eliminated, or used for economic purposes. [...] For non-cryogenic propellants, boil-off is not a significant design problem.|$|R
5000|$|The {{program had}} {{technical}} achievements as well, such as developing high-strength fibers, and carbide coatings for Carbon-Carbon composites. The hot-section design evolved {{to use all}} Carbon-Carbon to maximize turbine inlet temperature and minimize weight. Carbon-Carbon has much lower nuclear heating than other candidate materials, so thermal stresses were minimized as well. Prototype turbine components employing a 2-D polar reinforcement weave were fabricated {{for use in the}} corrosive, high-temperature hydrogen environment found in the proposed particle bed reactor (PBR)-powered engine. The particle bed reactor concept required significant radiation shielding, not only for the payload, electronics and structure of the vehicle, but also to prevent unacceptable boil-off of the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellant.</b> A propellant-cooled, composite shield of Tungsten, which attenuates gamma rays and absorbs thermal neutrons, and Lithium Hydride, which has a large scattering cross section for fast and thermal neutrons was found to perform well with low mass compared to older Boron Aluminum Titanium Hydride (BATH) shields.|$|E
5000|$|During the Buran {{programme}} initial {{development of}} the 11D77 [...] - the launch vehicle later known as Zenit - , KBKhA had been assigned the {{development of the}} second stage engine, as they had done for the Proton and Soyuz vehicles. But given the difficulties for NPO Energomash in developing the RD-123 (which would later be known as the RD-170), they ceded the hydrogen / oxygen sustainer engine development to KBKhA. This project, the analog of the SSME, was project RD-130 within NPO Energomash. But when KBKhA tackled the development, named it RD-0120, a name that is always a source of confusion with the engine of the current article. In exchange for them tackling the difficult development of the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellant</b> engine, Energomash assumed the responsibility of developing the second stage engine of the 11D77, which would eventually be known as the RD-120. The fact that the RD-120 and the RD-0120 had this intertwined conception, within the same program, and with a swap of designer bureaus, does not help to avoid the confusion.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve zero boil-off (ZBO) with <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellant</b> storage using an active thermal control system. Tests conducted at the NASA Lewis Research Center's Supplemental Multilayer Insulation Research Facility (SMIRF) over the summer of 1998 demonstrated that a hybrid thermal control system could eliminate boiloff of cryogenic propellants. The hardware consisted of a pressurized 50-ft³ (ca. 1416 litres) tank insulated with 34 layers of multi-layer insulation (MLI), a condenser, and a Gifford-McMahon (GM) cryocooler that has a cooling capacity of 15 to 17.5 watt (W). Liquid hydrogen was the test fluid. The test tank was installed into a vacuum chamber, simulating space vacuum.In 2001, a cooperative effort by NASA's Ames Research Center, Glenn Research Center, and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was implemented to develop zero-boiloff concepts for in-space cryogenic storage. Main program element was a large-scale, zero-boiloff demonstration using the MSFC multipurpose hydrogen test bed (MHTB) - 18.10 m3 LH2 tank (about 1300 kg of H2). A commercial cryocooler was interfaced with an existing MHTB spray bar mixer and insulation system {{in a manner that}} enabled a balance between incoming and extracted thermal energy.|$|E

40|$|The non-stationary flow of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellants</b> in rocket engines {{is treated}} as quasi one-dimensional. Since <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellants</b> {{evaporate}} {{when they come in}} contact with the walls of those rocket engine components that are initially at ambient temperature, all phase regimes from liquid to gaseous are taken into account. The conservation equations are solved by a method of characteristics and also through use of a Riemann-solver. The practical applicability of the simulation-model is shown with the following examples: Cool-down of a tube when filling it with liquid hydrogen, start-up of a gasgenerator rocket engine and closing of a valve in a liquid oxygen feed line. The results of numerical simulations for a gasgenerator rocket engine give an indication of the difficulties in finding a valve sequence for the start-up procedure in case the pump characteristics have an unstable region. Results from numerical simulations help in explaining effects of valve sequences of the feed system. (orig.)

50|$|For {{storable}} ICBMs {{and most}} spacecraft, including crewed vehicles, planetary probes, and satellites, storing <b>cryogenic</b> <b>propellants</b> over extended periods is unfeasible. Because of this, mixtures of hydrazine or its derivatives {{in combination with}} nitrogen oxides are generally used for such applications, but are toxic and carcinogenic. Consequently, to improve handling, some crew vehicles such as Dream Chaser and Space Ship Two plan to use hybrid rockets with non-toxic fuel and oxidizer combinations.|$|R
