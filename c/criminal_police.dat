25|$|With the {{exception}} of traffic police in some local departments, all police officers carry small firearms and batons.

25|$|On 17 May 2017 the Interior Ministry of Berlin {{stated that}} already in November 2016 {{intelligence}} was given that Anis Amri {{was involved in}} criminal offenses concerning drug trafficking.

An investigation was launched trying to find out to what extent these informations were withhold by the State <b>Criminal</b> <b>Police</b> Office of Berlin after the attack happened. Several days later, while the investigation for obstruction of justice was still going on, a speaker of the Interior Ministry said that manipulations of the file of Amri have been carried out by officers of the criminal investigation department after the attack. On 22 May 2017 a commission of inquiry was initiated starting in July. Meanwhile a special prosecuter was appointed to the case. In addition to the ongoing investigation concerning manipulations of the file and withholding of information, national TV reported on 1 June, that officers who were ordered by an investigating judge in Berlin to observe Amri until October 2016 for criminal offenses and possible terrorist links did not do so and instead included untrue records regarding observating actions in his file.|$|E
