40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that <b>concentric</b> <b>contact</b> lenses (CLs) can be a way to control the progression of myopia. The purpose of the current study was to compare vision-related quality-of-life measures in children wearing distance single-vision (SV) spectacles versus MiSight CLs, a specific concentric design for myopia control. Subjects aged 8 to 12 with myopia from - 0. 75 to - 4. 00 diopters (D) of sphere and astigmatism less than 1. 00 D of cylinder were allocated to the lenses study group (MiSight) or control group (SV). A Pediatric Refractive Error Profile (PREP) questionnaire was administered at 12 - and 24 -month intervals to evaluate children's perceptions in overall vision, near vision, far distance vision, symptoms, appearance, satisfaction, activities, academic performance, handling, and peer perceptions. The mean score of all items was calculated as the overall score. In total, 74 children completed the study: n= 41 in the MiSight group and n= 33 in the SV group. In the MiSight group, the ratings at 12 and 24 months for appearance, satisfaction, effect on activities, handling, and peer perceptions were significantly better than those given by children in the SV group (P< 0. 001), as was the overall score. However, near vision was significantly better in the SV group at both 12 and 24 months (P< 0. 001). MiSight CL wear for controlling myopia improves vision-related quality of life in children when compared with spectacle wear.

I–V characteristics performed on the material using <b>concentric</b> <b>contacts</b> showed 4 orders of magnitude of greater dark current for the Al 0. 1 Ga 0. 9 N than for the GaN. Subsequently, interdigitated metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) photodetectors were successfully fabricated on GaN.

The unbiased diodes showed a difference of 3 orders of magnitude between dark and photocurrent levels on exposure to UV. The responsivity for diodes with 25 and 100 µm source finger separation operated in unbiased mode was around 100 mA/W and was flat over the bandgap.

40|$|Jumping drills {{that include}} several {{successive}} take-offs are popular in many sports events. An {{understanding of the}} effects of fatigue on biomechanical parameters during continuous jumping drills is important when selecting drills and their durations for sports training. In the present study, effects of continuous hurdle jumping on myoelectrical (EMG) activity, ground reaction forces, vertical movements of the body's centre of mass and knee joint angle kinematics were studied among eight male volleyball players (age 20 - 26 years). The subjects jumped hurdles (height 0. 65 m) continuously for 45 s with bilateral foot contacts. All of the take-offs were performed from force-platforms which registered the three components of ground reaction force. The two middle take-offs in both directions were used for further analysis. Knee angular data were recorded by an electrical goniometer for determination of angular displacement and velocity. The jumping was videotaped sagittally to determine the location of the centre of mass at different phases of contact and flight, as well as to calculate the movement amplitude for the centre of mass. The EMG activity was monitored using surface electrodes, full-wave rectified and averaged for a pre-contact period of 55 ms {{as well as for the}} eccentric and <b>concentric</b> phases of <b>contact</b> for the M. rectus femoris, vastus lateralis and vastus medialis.

40|$|A new two-contact {{system with}} double-transversal {{magnetic}} field (TMF) structure is investigated regarding {{its potential for}} high current interruption. It consists of two <b>concentric</b> TMF <b>contacts,</b> in which the inner contact has a disk-shaped structure (spiral contact) and the outer contact a cup-shaped structure. This contact assembly gives several advantages {{over the use of}} single-TMF contacts, as the constricted high-current arc might either split between both inner and outer contacts or commute from the inner to the outer contact and continue its rotation. In both scenarios, we expect a better distribution of the arc energy over a larger contact surface. B-field simulation and Lorentz force calculation are carried out to investigate whether two constricted arcs, with one burning on the inner contact and the other on the outer contact, can coexist given their mutual attraction. Single-phase high current interruption tests were carried out to compare the performance of this new double-TMF contact system with that of a standard spiral-type single-TMF one. These tests have revealed superior performance of the new double-TMF contact system, which could interrupt current amplitude at least 20 % higher than the one interrupted by the single-TMF contact system...|$|R

This study sought {{to examine the relationship}} between maximal squat strength (1 repetition maximum [RM]) and DJ performance in 15 female rugby players (n = 15). The subjects were tested for 1 RM, countermovement jump, squat jump, and DJs from 0. 24, 0. 36, 0. 48, 0. 60, 0. 72, and 0. 84 m. Jump height (JH) was calculated for all jumps and relative peak eccentric force, relative peak <b>concentric</b> force, ground <b>contact</b> time (GCT), and reactive strength index were also calculated for DJs. Pearson correlations were used {{to examine the relationship between}} 1 RM relative to body mass (BM) (1 RM/BM) and JHs, reactive strength index, and GCT during DJs. The subjects were placed in a high strength (HS) or low strength (LS) group depending on whether or not their 1 RM/BM was 1. The T-tests and 2 -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare the groups. A Fishers post hoc test was used for the ANOVA with significance set at p 3 ̆c 0. 05. A large correlation between JH and 1 RM/ BM was shown at the 0. 84 -m dropping height (r = 0. 56). A significant overall difference was found between the HS and LS groups for DJ JH with a post hoc analysis revealing a significant difference at the 0. 84 -m drop height (p = 0. 029).

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Thermally induced reactions between a sputter-deposited Re, Pt or Ta film {{and a single}} crystalline (001) [beta]-SiC substrate in vacuum at temperatures from 300 to 1200 °C for 30 min or 1 h are investigated by MeV [ [...] . ] backscattering spectrometry, x-ray diffraction, secondary ion mass spectrometry, transmission and scanning electron microscopies. The contact resistivities of the as-deposited and the annealed Pt, Re, and Ta contacts to [beta]-SiC are characterized using circular transmission line. No reaction between Re and SiC is observed for all annealing conditions. The average grain size of the as-deposited Re film is 220 nm and increases to 280 nm after annealing at 1100 °C for 30 min. A strong 0001 [ [...] . ] fiber texture is also observed after annealing. The chemical stability of Re thin films on SiC is consistent with an earlier study in the ternary Re-Si-C system which shows that Re and its silicides have tie lines with SiC at 1600 °C. This finding also coincides with our calculations of the free energy of reactions from critically assessed thermodynamic data for rhenium silicides and SiC. Backscattering spectrometry shows that Pt reacts with SiC at 500 °C. The product phase identified by x-ray diffraction is Pt 3 Si. At 600 - 900 °C, the main reaction product is Pt 2 Si but the depth distribution of the Pt atoms changes with annealing temperature. Samples annealed at 500 - 900 °C have a double-layer structure with a silicide surface layer and a carbon-silicide mixed layer below. At 900 °C, the phases in the mixed layer become stratified, with a continuous carbon layer {{in direct contact with}} the substrate. When the sample is annealed at 1000 °C, the surface morphology deteriorates with the formation of some dendrite-like hillocks; both Pt 2 Si and PtSi are detected by x-ray diffraction. The SiC-Pt interaction is resolved at an atomic scale with high-resolution electron microscopy. It is found that the grains of the sputtered Pt film first align themselves preferentially along an orientation of 111 [ [...] . ]// 001 [ [...] . ] without reaction between Pt and SiC. A thin amorphous interlayer then forms at 400 °C. At 450 °C, a new crystalline phase nucleates discretely at the Pt-interlayer interface and projects into or across the amorphous interlayer towards the SiC, while the undisturbed amorphous interlayer between the newly-formed crystallites maintains its thickness. These nuclei grow extensively down into the substrate region at 500 °C {{and the rest of the}} Pt film is converted to Pt 3 Si. No significant reaction between Ta and SiC is observed at 800 °C or below. At 900 °C, the main product phases are Ta 2 C and carbon-stabilized Ta 5 Si 3. A minor amount of unreacted Ta is also present. After annealing at 1000 °C, all the tantalum has reacted; the reaction zone possesses a multilayered structure of [beta]-SiC/TaC/carbon-stabilized Ta 5 Si 3 /[alpha]-Ta 5 Si 3 /Ta 2 /C. At 1100 °C, the reacted layer has an interface with the SiC substrate that is still quite flat, but has a rough surface due to the formation of macroscopic voids within the reacted layer. The equilibrium products predicted by the phase diagram are TaC and [TaSi 2. This final state is reached upon annealing at 1200 °C for 1 h. At that point, the reacted layer has a laterally very uneven structure and morphology. Contact resistivities of the as-deposited and annealed Pt, Re, and Ta films on n-type, single-crystalline (001) [beta]-SiC are determined using a circular contact pattern and the method of the circular transmission line. The [beta]-SiC substrates used in the experiment are n-type doped either non-intentionally to a carrier concentration of [ [...] . ], or by nitrogen implantation and annealing to a concentration of [ [...] . ]. A resistance-network model is developed to derive an analytic expression for the angular dependence of the voltage distribution along the rings when they have a non-negligible resistance. By applying this model, the resistance between two <b>concentric</b> <b>contacts</b> can be extracted and will yield the correct contact resistivity when one uses the formulae of the circular transmission line model that ignores the finite resistance of the rings. On the non-intentionally doped [beta]-SiC substrates, Pt contacts are non-ohmic regardless of the heat treatment. The as-deposited Ta and Re contacts are ohmic with contact resistivities of [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ], respectively. Upon annealing at 500 °C for 30 min, the resistivity of Ta increases slightly while that of Re decreases slightly. Both Ta and Re contacts become non-ohmic by annealing at 900 °C for 30 min. The as-deposited Ta, Pt, and Re contacts are all ohmic on the nitrogen-implanted [beta]-SiC substrate. The contact resistivity of the as-deposited Ta contact is the lowest and in the order of high [ [...] . ], stays about the same at 500 °C and degrades to [ [...] . ] at 1000 °C. The as-deposited Re contact has the highest contact resistivity of [ [...] . ] but it improves to [ [...] . ] upon annealing at 900 °C. The contact resistivity of the as-deposited Pt contacts is [ [...] . ] and increases to [ [...] . ] at 500 °C. After annealing at 900 °C for 30 min, the Pt contact on the nitrogen-implanted [beta]-SiC is no longer ohmic. The results are compared with the reactions that take place in those systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Myopia or {{nearsightedness}} is {{a condition}} in which the axial length of the eye is too long relative to its optical focal length. This condition is reaching epidemic levels worldwide, and has become a tremendous public health burden. Myopia {{is one of the leading}} causes of vision loss and high myopia significantly increases the risk of permanent blindness. Consequently, myopia cannot be considered as a benign condition and early interventions aimed at slowing down or even stopping the progression of myopia rather than merely correcting the associated optical focusing error is of great importance. The consistent evidence from animal model studies showing that imposed hyperopic defocus, if sustained, comprises an effective myopogenic stimulus, accelerating eye growth, while imposed myopic defocus slows ocular elongation, has motivated clinical studies using bifocal and progressive addition spectacles for myopia control. While these studies, reviewed in Chapter 2 of this dissertation, failed to provide convincing evidence for a clinically significant treatment effect, i. e., slowed myopia progression; smaller scale, non-randomized studies using multifocal soft contact lenses and orthokeratology lenses have shown much more promising effects in terms of slowing myopia progression. However, the mechanism(s) underlying the latter anti-myopia treatment effects are poorly understood, thereby limiting their further refinement. In addition to the aforementioned systematic review of relevant clinical evidence for optical interventions for myopia control, this dissertation described 3 other studies using chick model, representing efforts to further understand how multifocal optical environments affect normal ocular development, specifically the process of emmetropization. These manipulations have also been used as a tool to investigate the mechanism underlying the myopia controlling effect of the novel contact lens applications referred above. Chapter 2 describes a systematic review and meta-analysis performed on randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of three traditional optical interventions, bifocal and progressive addition spectacles, and rigid contact lenses, all believed to control myopia progression, based on anecdotal evidence. The overall treatment effect was estimated to be only small and clinically insignificant. A number of reasons were proposed to explain the discrepancy between the results of related animal studies and these clinical trials - strong support for optical control of myopia from the former studies and inconclusive results from the latter studies. Poor compliance to the spectacle corrections in clinical studies, inaccurate measurement of adherence to the treatments, inadequate and potentially, ambiguous classification systems for clinical myopia, and potential flaws in the optical designs are likely to have contributed to the discouraging results from the clinical trials. Chapter 3 describes the first of three studies in which the chick model was used to test the effects on ocular growth of a series of custom-designed 2 -zone multifocal "spectacle" lenses. This and the two follow-up studies using this model have the following merits; they made use of standardized experimental paradigms and objective methods of measurement to track ocular changes. The first study applied the lenses in a simple experimental paradigm, in which monocular lenses were attached to the normal eyes of young chickens. The 2 -zone lenses included a plano zone, either in the center or peripheral surround, with either positive or negative power (+ 5 or - 5 D) incorporated into the other zone. The size of the central zone was also allowed to vary, to control the size of the unifocal central and peripheral retinal areas, and intermediate multifocal zone, as was the placement of the powered zone, i. e. in the center or periphery of the lenses. Single vision lenses were included as a control treatment. Two important observations from this study were that 1) peripheral optical defocus can influence both peripheral (off-axis) and central (on-axis) refractive error development and 2) the inhibitory effect on axial ocular growth of myopic defocus imposed using 2 -zone lenses (positive zones) could exceed that induced by single vision lenses of the same power. These results suggested complex interactions between adjacent retinal regions, with the peripheral retina apparently able to decode optical defocus, as well as complex interactions between the eyes own optical aberrations and those of the 2 -zone lenses, which introduced large amounts of spherical aberration. Chapter 4 described a closely related study in which subsets of the same 2 -zone lenses were tested on eyes that had undergone surgical manipulations (sectioning of the ciliary nerve, CNX or iridectomy, ID) to investigate the influence of the pupil size of the eye as well as accommodation on the effects of the 2 -zone lenses. Both were uncontrolled in the first study; yet create a dynamic optical system on which the multifocal optical environment was imposed. The ID surgery produced a fixed dilated pupil without any effect on accommodation (confirmed in another study, reported in Appendix I), while the CNX surgery produced a similarly enlarged pupil while also eliminating accommodation. This study revealed pupil size to be a critical factor in the treatment effects of 2 -zone lenses, likely to reflect at least in part, its influence on the optical experience of various retinal zones (center to periphery), and also suggested a significant role of accommodation in the decoding of imposed optical defocus stimuli, in this case, complex multifocal optical stimuli. Chapter 5 described a third study which attempted to develop a clinically more relevant scenario; specifically, 2 -zone lenses that incorporated two different negative powers (- 5 & - 10 D) in two optical zones (center & periphery or vice versa), were tested on both normal eyes and eyes made myopic before being fitted with one of the 2 -zone lenses. The latter combination was intended to simulate the ocular conditions created when <b>concentric</b> multifocal <b>contact</b> lenses, i. e. with a near addition, are prescribed to human myopes, one of the novel, myopia control treatments currently being explored. When the 2 -zone lenses were fitted to normal eyes, they induced myopia, of a magnitude falling between the values expected, had single vision lenses of the same powers been used. However, on myopic eyes, the lenses had a strong myopia inhibiting effect with the already induced myopia undergoing substantial regression. This result supports the further investigation of appropriately designed <b>concentric</b> multifocal <b>contact</b> lenses for the control of myopia progression. In summary, the studies reported in this dissertation indicate complex interactions between central and peripheral retinal regions in decoding and responding to complex defocus signals as well as critical influences of pupil size and accommodation on these processes. The strong and consistent inhibitory effects on ocular growth of concentric 2 -zone lenses incorporating a zone of either positive power or a near addition, 2 -zone designs lend plausibility to the notion of using custom-designed novel optical treatments for the control of myopia progression...|$|R
