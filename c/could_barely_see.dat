Hardwick scored a technical knock {{out in the}} sixth round of their 15-round bout. He had devastated Jones in the third with a right to his jaw and opened a cut over Sonny's left eye with another right.

25|$|The south {{church is}} a square room surmounted by a dome, and {{surrounded}} by two deambulatoria, an esonarthex and a parekklesion (added later). The north deambulatorium is the south parekklesion of the north church. This multiplication of spaces around {{the central part of}} the church is typical of the late Palaiologian architecture: the reason of that was the need for more space for tombs, monuments erected to benefactors of the church, etc. The central room is divided from the aisles by a triple arcade. During the mass the believers were confined in the deambulatoria, which were shallow and dark, and <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> what happened in {{the central part of the}} church.|$|E

50|$|Long Lake is a lake {{situated}} at {{the confluence of the}} Forest River and the northern reaches of the Celduin south of the Lonely Mountain. The lake gets its name from being longer north-south than it was wide east-west (standing on the west shore where the Forest River emptied into the lake the east <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> be <b>seen,</b> but the north and south could not). The lake emptied out over waterfalls on the southern edge into the River Running that led {{all the way to the}} great Sea of Rhûn. The town of Esgaroth was built entirely upon the lake itself, which thus formed a natural moat. It was built very near to the Forest River outlet, but protected from the stream by a promontory of rock. The water in the Lake itself was calm.|$|R

5000|$|Zorio {{has used}} text as image {{throughout}} his career. He uses many different {{materials in the}} creation of these works. Examples of these are in pieces such as: Odio hate, Confine border, and Fluidità Radicale fluidity. Three different versions of Confine were created. In one the word confine was written in incandescent wire and hung in a room. Another version was created by photographer Paolo Mussat Sartor in 1971. Sartor used long exposure to photograph the artist sitting in Sartor studio with the word [...] "confine" [...] written in the air from the smoke of a cigarette. The smoke made it so that the artist <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> be <b>seen.</b> Another version was created by Zorio in 1971 when Zorio wrote [...] "confine" [...] on a gallery wall with luminous ink which was visible only when the lights were off. Every four minutes the lights would turn off for a few seconds to reveal the hidden ink before the lights turned on again.|$|R
60|$|Once {{the hero}} was thrown headlong on a rock, and so {{severely}} bruised {{that he lost}} hold of the rope, and when swept off again was left foundering in the foam. His comrades <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> that {{something had happened to}} him, and a loud cry of consternation arose when they felt the line run light and slack.

60|$|Bad though things looked {{when there}} was light enough {{to enable them to}} see the rush of the black clouds overhead, the bursts of the driving spray and the tumultuous heavings of the wild sea, it was inconceivably worse when the {{darkness}} settled down so thick that they <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> each other's faces, and the steering had to be done more by feeling, as it were, than sight. Gaff took the helm during the greater part of the night, and the other two baled incessantly; but the gale increased so much that the water at last came in faster than it could be thrown out, and they expected to be swamped every instant.|$|E
60|$|At this Charley cast off, and Yellow Handkerchief sent {{one of his}} men {{forward to}} haul in the line.

The Reindeer was fully five minutes astern, and we continued to leave her astern as we beat up the narrow, winding channel. With Charley behind us, it seemed I had little to fear from my five prisoners; but the darkness prevented my keeping a sharp eye on them, so I transferred my revolver from my trousers pocket to the side pocket of my coat, where I could more quickly put my hand on it.|$|E
60|$|At last, however, he {{did find}} a spot to lie down on, and, {{with a sigh of}} relief, lay back to indulge in repose. Alas! the spot was a myth--he merely dreamed it; the next moment he dropt, like a huge {{over-ripe}} pear, to the ground. Fortunately a bush broke the violence of his fall, and, springing up with a cry of consternation, he rushed towards the tree, expecting each instant to feel the terrible hug of his ursine enemy. The very marrow in his back-bone seemed to shrink, for he fancied that he actually felt the dreaded claws sinking into his flesh. In his haste he missed the branch, and fell violently forward, scratching himself terribly among the bushes. Again he rose, and a cold perspiration broke out upon him as he uttered an involuntary howl of terror, and once more leaped up at the limb of the oak, which he <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> <b>see.</b> He caught it; despair nerved him, and in another moment he was safe, and panting violently among the branches.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The mucosa of {{the small}} {{intestine}} of clinically normal piglets and of piglets with white scours was investigated, using a scanning electron microscope. No new findings on the rough villous pattern {{of the small}} intestinal mucosa could be added to those obtained with the stereomicroscope.

The appearance of the intestinal mucosa of some of these piglets was also investigated with the scanning electron microscope [6, 131.

60|$|As {{the night}} {{advanced}} the darkness deepened, {{and the poor}} captive began to entertain serious misgivings as to his prospects. Would the girl try {{to carry out the}} plan, whatever it was? Yes, he had not the slightest doubt on that head, because, somehow, she had inspired him with a confidence that he had never felt in woman before. But would she be able to carry out her plan? That was quite another question.

Long hours he sat in his chair looking at the light with an indescribably charming smile hovering on his lips.|$|E

On 10 March 2015, [...] "Rhythm Inside", his entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015, was presented (co-written by his Voice mentor). The song went to number one on both the Flanders and Wallonia Ultratop charts. Performing in the first semi final of the competition, Nottet was successful in progressing to the final, coming second in his semi final with 149 points. During the Jury Final (following Australia), he <b>could</b> be <b>barely</b> <b>seen</b> on stage due to heavy use of smoke machines and pyrotechnics from the Australian Act. His delegation was rumoured to have lodged a complaint about this, saying that it would affect part of their final score. While they requested to perform again, this was apparently denied, instead telling juries to disregard the smoke. In the Grand Final, the Belgian entry scored a total of 217 points leaving [...] "Rhythm Inside" [...] in fourth position overall, giving Belgium its first top five placement since 2003. It received the maximum 12 points from three countries; Netherlands, France and Hungary. The song was certified Platinum for selling 30,000 copies in Belgium. Nottet has released three different music videos for Rhythm Inside (including one called the [...] "Alice in Wonderland" [...] version). After the contest, [...] "Rhythm Inside" [...] reached the top ten in the Austrian, Lithuanian and Russian Music Charts, achieving top 20 in Finland, Iceland and Sweden and also charting in Australia, UK, France, Switzerland and many more European countries.|$|R
60|$|I never clearly {{knew why}} I visited the old {{cemetery}} that night. Perhaps {{it was to}} see how the work of removing the bodies was getting on, for they were all being taken up and carted away to a more comfortable place where land was less valuable. It was well enough; nobody had buried himself there for years, and the skeletons that were now exposed were old mouldy affairs for which it was difficult to feel any respect. However, I put a few bones in my pocket as souvenirs. The night was one of those black, gusty ones in March, with great inky clouds driving rapidly across the sky, spilling down sudden showers of rain which as suddenly would cease. I <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>see</b> my way between the empty graves, and in blundering about among the coffins I tripped and fell headlong.

60|$|But {{there was}} no time for congratulations. The sea which had before been agitated, now heaved in wild waves, though {{there was no}} wind. It was then seen that Big Island was {{actually}} crumbling--sinking into the water! The continuous rumbling of the volcano was terrible. Intermittent explosions were frequent. To add to the horrors of the scene the darkness deepened. As the island went down the sea rushed tumultuously in to overwhelm it. Then it was that the stout cable, under God, saved them from immediate destruction. The ship was hurled from side to side like a cork on the boiling flood. But no cable could long withstand such a strain. The chain snapped at last, and they seemed to be rushing with railway speed to their fate amid surrounding fire and overwhelming water, and roaring thunders, and raining ashes, when, suddenly, there was a perceptible diminution in the turmoil, and, gradually, the waves calmed down.
