50|$|The <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> are {{courts of}} general jurisdiction, {{meaning that they}} can hear all manner of civil and {{criminal}} matters, with limited exceptions. The original jurisdiction of the <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> over civil matters extends only to those matters valued at over $4,500. For actions alleging a lower amount in controversy, jurisdiction lies with the Virginia General District Court (GDC).

The <b>Circuit</b> <b>Courts</b> do not, however, have jurisdiction over rate cases or workers' compensation cases.

5|$|In 1867, United States Supreme Court justice Stephen Johnson Field {{assigned}} Deady {{to serve}} as a <b>circuit</b> <b>court</b> judge for the United States <b>circuit</b> <b>court</b> located in San Francisco, California. Deady did the same in 1868 and 1869 since there was no <b>circuit</b> <b>court</b> judge assigned to the West Coast at that time, spending three months in San Francisco each year. This was a common practice during this period, as United States Supreme Court justices still rode circuit, and often assigned federal district court judges to serve on the appellate level circuit courts. The Judiciary Act of 1869 reduced much of this process, as did the Judiciary Act of 1891 that established the current United States courts of appeals with Oregon in the Ninth Circuit. While serving on the district court, Deady {{served as president of the}} Board of Regents of the State University (later University of Oregon) from 1873 to 1893. He also designed the university’s seal, which is still used by the school.|$|E

5|$|In Marbury, the Supreme Court {{held that}} Madison's failure {{to deliver the}} {{commission}} to Marbury was illegal, but did not grant Marbury a writ of mandamus {{on the ground that}} § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the Court to issue such writs under its original jurisdiction. Stuart v. Lairdinvolving a civil judgment rendered by a <b>circuit</b> <b>court</b> constituted under the Midnight Judges Act and enforced by a <b>circuit</b> <b>court</b> constituted under the Judiciary Act of 1802challenged the constitutionality both of abolishing the circuit judgeships and of requiring the Supreme Court justices to ride circuit.
