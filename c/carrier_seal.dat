40|$|Improved {{blade tip}} sealing {{in the high}} {{pressure}} compressor and high pressure turbine can provide dramatic improvements in specific fuel consumption, time-on-wing, compressor stall margin and engine efficiency as well as increased payload and mission range capabilities of both military and commercial gas turbine engines. The preliminary design of a mechanically actuated active clearance control (ACC) system for turbine blade tip clearance management is presented along with {{the design of a}} bench top test rig in which the system is to be evaluated. The ACC system utilizes mechanically actuated <b>seal</b> <b>carrier</b> segments and clearance measurement feedback to provide fast and precise active clearance control throughout engine operation. The purpose of this active clearance control system is to improve upon current case cooling methods. These systems have relatively slow response and do not use clearance measurement, thereby forcing cold build clearances to set the minimum clearances at extreme operating conditions (e. g., takeoff, re-burst) and not allowing cruise clearances to be minimized due to the possibility of throttle transients (e. g., step change in altitude). The active turbine blade tip clearance control system design presented herein will be evaluated to ensure that proper response and positional accuracy is achievable under simulated high-pressure turbine conditions. The test rig will simulate proper <b>seal</b> <b>carrier</b> pressure and temperature loading as well as the magnitudes and rates of blade tip clearance changes of an actual gas turbine engine. The results of these evaluations will be presented in future works...|$|R
40|$|The {{first attempt}} to launch the STS- 133 Space Shuttle mission {{in the fall of}} 2010 was halted due to {{indications}} of a gaseous hydrogen leak at the External Tank ground umbilical <b>carrier</b> plate <b>seal.</b> Subsequent inspection of the external tank (figure 1) hardware and recorded video footage revealed that the foam insulation covering the forward end of the intertank near the liquid oxygen tank had cracked severely enough to have been cause for halting the launch attempt on its own (figure 2). An investigation into the cause of the insulation crack revealed that two adjacent hat-section sheet metal stringers (figure 3) had cracks up to nine inches long in the forward ends of the stringer flanges, or feet, near the fasteners that attach the stringer to the skin of the intertank (figure 4). A repair of those two stringers was implemented and the investigation effort widened to understand the root cause of the stringer cracks and to determine whether there was sufficient flight rationale to launch with the repairs and the other installed stringers...|$|R

Mitya, however, died within sight of Constantinople and was buried at Galata (a Genoese possession north of the Golden Horn), and Pimen was consecrated in his place, although this was done without the knowledge of the Grand Prince and the Patriarch was said to have been tricked (perhaps to exonerate him later for any complicity he may have had in the deception), as Pimen had apparently used forged grand princely letters to get Patriarch Nilus of Constantinople to consecrate him. Donskoy was angry upon hearing the news of Pimen's consecration and swore not to accept Pimen upon his return. Thus Pimen's metropolitanate was contested from the start, and he accomplished little as a result.|$|R
40|$|A sample return {{container}} {{is being}} developed by Honeybee Robotics to receive samples from a derivative of the Champollion/ST 4 Sample Acquisition and Transfer Mechanism or other samplers and then hermetically seal samples for a sample return mission. The container is enclosed in a phase change material (PCM) chamber to prevent phase change during return and re-entry to earth. This container is designed to operate passively with no motors and actuators. Using the sampler's featured drill tip for interfacing, transfer-ring and sealing samples, the container consumes no electrical power and therefore minimizes sample temperature change. The circular container houses a few isolated canisters, which will be sealed individually for samples acquired from different sites or depths. The drill based sampler indexes each canister to the sample transfer position, below the index interface for sample transfer. After sample transfer is completed, the sampler indexes a <b>seal</b> <b>carrier,</b> which lines up seals with the openings of the canisters. The sampler moves to the sealing interface and seals the sample canisters one by one. The sealing interface can be designed to work with C-seals, knife edge seals and cup seals. Again, the sampler provides all sealing actuation. This sample return container and co-engineered sample acquisition system are being developed by Honeybee Robotics {{in collaboration with the}} JPL Exploration Technology program...|$|R
40|$|This {{investment}} project {{was dedicated to}} the development of models for low-noise garbage truck retrofitting in accordance with the acoustic requirements established through guideline RAL-UZ 59 for the award of environmental quality <b>seals.</b> <b>Carrier</b> trucks (MB 1613 KO) were retrofitted to meet low-noise chassis requirements in accordance with annex XXI, section 49, paragraph 3 of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The noise of a newly designed low-noise lifting and tipping unit was reduced by 16 dB (A) as compared to the conventional ones. New covers were designed for bulk garbage containers. Noise reduction was 6 dB (A) during simulated lifting and tipping and 9 dB (A) during the transport phases. The cylinders of the presss plate were provided with position switches to slow the cylinders down before reaching the final position. The dumping body was noise-insulated for a noise reduction of 3 dB (A). The overall sound level A of garbage trucks operating state B was reduced by 5 dB (A) to 97 dB (A) in accordance with RAL-UZ 59. The guideline's acoustic requirements were fulfilled. New garbage trucks are manufactured meanwhile considering the developed noise reduction model. Trucks bearing the environmental quality seal for low-noise, low-emission vehicles are available on the market. (orig.)

40|$|Reducing {{blade tip}} {{clearances}} through active {{tip clearance control}} in the high pressure turbine can lead to significant reductions in emissions and specific fuel consumption as well as dramatic improvements in operating efficiency and increased service life. Current engines employ scheduled cooling of the outer case flanges to reduce high pressure turbine tip clearances during cruise conditions. These systems have relatively slow response and do not use clearance measurement, thereby forcing cold build clearances to set the minimum clearances at extreme operating conditions (e. g., takeoff, reburst) and not allowing cruise clearances to be minimized due {{to the possibility of}} throttle transients (e. g., step change in altitude). In an effort to improve upon current thermal methods, a first generation mechanically-actuated active clearance control (ACC) system has been designed and fabricated. The system utilizes independent actuators, a segmented shroud structure, and clearance measurement feedback to provide fast and precise active clearance control throughout engine operation. Ambient temperature performance tests of this first generation ACC system assessed individual seal component leakage rates and both static and dynamic overall system leakage rates. The ability of the nine electric stepper motors to control the position of the <b>seal</b> <b>carriers</b> in both open- and closed-loop control modes for single and multiple cycles was investigated. The ability of the system to follow simulated engine clearance transients in closed-loop mode showed the system was able to track clearances to within a tight tolerance (0. 001 in. error) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the glyptic {{material}} unearthed from the Neo-Assyrian and Late Babylonian levels in the Lower Town II of Tell Sheikh Hamad (NE-Syria) between 1978 and 2008. The site being identified with the Assyrian provincial center of Dur-Katlimmu is testified in the 7 th century B. C. also under the Aramaic name of Magdalu. The entire corpus consists of more than 1500 glyptic objects (seals, sealed texts, sealings) with more than 500 different motifs. Ranging from the 10 th/ 9 th to the 6 th c. BC the continuous stratigraphic sequence of the Middle Lower Town II comprises three phases of full occupation. Unique Assyrian cuneiform documents dating to the years 2 / 3 and 5 {{of the reign of}} the Babylonian king Nebukadnezar II, and the archaeological record prove that the city survived the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire unscathed and continued to function fully under the governance of the former Assyrian elites during the Late Babylonian Empire. Since the large scale excavation has recorded all the soil deposits, e. g. all the find contexts, systematically, the primary aim of {{the first part of the}} study was to assess the glyptic materials within their stratigraphical contexts and to analyse the reliability of their functional and chronological significance. In a second part glyptic imagery and individual motifs are examined. The results of both parts are synthesized in a third section. After an outline of the state of research of Neo-Assyrian glyptic the site and its glyptic material are presented in chapters 2 - 3. The study of the context localization pertaining to their functional and chronological significance occurs in chapter 4. Chapter 5 is devoted to economical and administrative aspects of the use of seals in the excavated households. As a most relevant result it is for the first time verified that seals were used for administering commodities in the private households of the Lower Town II, a practice so far thought to be restricted to the Assyrian palaces. The spatial distribution of their impressions even makes certain areas of responsibility visible. By embedding the glyptics into the stratigraphic sequence it is demonstrated that stamp seals were commonly used already in the late 9 th c. B. C., thus reassessing the common opinion that the stamp seals were ‘reintroduced’ during the second half of the 8 th c. B. C. On the basis of the assessed stratigraphical position and of the chronologically fixed <b>carriers</b> of <b>seal</b> impressions the time ranges of themes of glyptic imagery are analysed and compared to former classifications. Using the criteria material and engraving techniques the corpus is rearranged in ‘Gestaltungsgruppen’ which prove to have coexisted over more than two centuries in a kind of ‘Stilpluralismus’. Resulting divergences concerning the common division of the Neo-Assyrian glyptic into style groups (‘Stilgruppen’) are discussed. The relation between seals and their owners is accentuated. The corpus is compared to the glyptic of Central Assyria and interactions to other cultural regions are examined. In conclusion it has to be emphasized that the glyptic evidence from the households inhabited during the 3 rd phase of full occupation of Dur-Katlimmu/Magdalu hardly mirrors the severe political change from the Neo-Assyrian to the Late Babylonian Empire. The social structure was characterized by members of the Assyrian elite and officialdom as before...|$|R
