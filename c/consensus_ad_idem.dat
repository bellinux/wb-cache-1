2500|$|In {{a number}} of instances, the courts avoid {{enforcement}} of contracts where, {{although there is a}} formal offer and acceptance, little objective agreement exists otherwise. In Hartog v Colin & Shields, where the seller of some Argentine hare skins quoted his prices far below what previous negotiations had suggested, the buyer could not enforce the agreement because any reasonable person would have known the offer was not serious, but a mistake. Moreover, if two parties think they reach an agreement, but their offer and acceptance concerns two entirely different things, the court will not enforce a contract. In Raffles v Wichelhaus, Raffles thought he was selling cotton aboard one ship called The Peerless, which would arrive from Bombay in Liverpool in December, but Wichelhaus thought he was buying cotton aboard another ship called The Peerless that would arrive in September. The court held there was never <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> (Latin: [...] "agreement to the [...] thing"). Where agreements totally fail, but one party has performed work at another's request, relying on the idea {{that there will be a}} contract, that party may make a claim for the value of the work done, or quantum meruit. Such a restitution claim allows recovery for the expense the claimant goes to, but will not cover her expectation of potential profits, because there is no agreement to be enforced.|$|E

50|$|The English {{contracts}} scholar Richard Austen-Baker {{has suggested}} that the perpetuation of the concept into current times is based on a confusion of it with the concept of a <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> ("agreement to the same thing") which is an undoubted requirement of synallagmatic contracting, and that this confusion {{may be the result of}} recent ignorance of Latin.|$|E

5000|$|Acceptance {{should be}} {{absolute}} and unqualified. If {{the parties are}} not in <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> on all matters concerning the offer and acceptance, there is no valid contract. For example, [...] "A" [...] says to [...] "B" [...] "I offer to sell my car for Rs.50,000/-. [...] "B" [...] replies [...] "I will purchase it for Rs.45,000/-". This is not acceptance and hence it amounts to a counter offer.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the parties}} are shown to have been <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> as to the {{material}} conditions of a contract, the onus of proving an agreement that legal validity shall be postponed until the due execution of a written document lies upon the party who alleges it. Damages claimed {{as an alternative to}} a decree of specific performance of a contract must be proved and ascertained in the ordinary way; they should not be assessed by the court as a punishment for contumacity.|$|R
5000|$|The English {{common law}} {{established}} {{the concepts of}} <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem,</b> offer, acceptance and counter-offer. The leading case on counter-offer is Hyde v Wrench 1840.

50|$|Richard Austen-Baker has {{suggested}} that the perpetuation of the idea of 'meeting of minds' may come from a misunderstanding of the Latin term <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem,</b> which actually means 'agreement to the same thing'. There must be evidence that the parties had each, from an objective perspective, engaged in conduct manifesting their assent, and a contract will be formed when the parties have met such a requirement.|$|E
50|$|Meeting of {{the minds}} (also {{referred}} to as mutual agreement, mutual assent or <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem)</b> is a phrase in contract law {{used to describe the}} intentions of the parties forming the contract. In particular, it refers to the situation where there is a common understanding {{in the formation of the}} contract. Formation of a contract is initiated with a proposal or offer. This condition or element is considered a requirement to the formation of a contract in some jurisdictions.|$|E

5000|$|Where such an ouster clause occurs, it is {{pertinent}} {{to see whether}} there is ouster of jurisdiction of other Courts. When the clause is clear, unambiguous and specific accepted notions of contract would bind the parties and unless the absence of <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> can be shown, the other Courts should avoid exercising jurisdiction. As regards construction of the ouster clause when words like 'alone', 'only', 'exclusive' and the like have been used {{there may be no}} difficulty. ... In such a case mention of one thing may imply exclusion of another.|$|R
50|$|Purchase {{and sale}} (emptio venditio) is a mutual {{contract}} for the transfer of possession of a thing {{in exchange for a}} price. It has three essentials: consent (<b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> idem); a thing sold (merx); and a price (pretium).|$|R
50|$|Although the Romans {{first came}} to Britain in 55BC, Roman Law has had {{negligible}} influence on English common law. Latin phrases are used in English only because latin was the lingua franca of the medieval period. Although in legal circles some phrases are in common use, (such as res ipsa loquitur, novus actus interveniens, talem qualem, de minimis non curat lex, & <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem)</b> the common law does not rely on civil law principles, {{and the use of}} Latinisms is declining while vernacular phrases are increasing.|$|E
50|$|The Court of the Queen's Bench {{found that}} the jury had been {{misdirected}} and ordered a retrial. Leaning in Mr Smith's favour, they held that the question was not merely whether the parties were at <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem,</b> but what they had communicated by their conduct and words to one another. Mr Smith was held to be under no duty to inform Mr Hughes of his possible mistake {{about the kind of}} oats, reaffirming the old idea of caveat emptor (buyer beware). A unilateral mistake is therefore in principle no ground for rescission of a contract. Cockburn CJ gave the first judgment.|$|E
50|$|The {{basis of}} {{contractual}} liability, where {{the parties to}} a contract do not misunderstand each other, is <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> animo contrahendi. In those exceptional {{cases in which the}} parties misunderstand each other and only apparent consent exists, liability appears to rest on the reasonable reliance by the contracting party on the existence of consensus. This is known in contract law as the reliance theory. Such consent may be termed “constructive consent.” Of course, there is always room also for the application of the doctrine of estoppel, if a litigant can satisfy its more stringent requirements, and if he wishes to avail himself of this remedy in order to hold a party bound to the appearance of consensus he has created. For a contract as such to exist, however, actual or constructive consent must be achieved. This is brought about by offer and acceptance.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} policy operating here is ignorantia juris non excusat, i.e. {{the state}} cannot allow {{ignorance of the}} law to be a defense. This would unduly encourage the lazy and the deceitful to trade on their ignorance (real or otherwise). Thus, only mistakes relating to the factual basis {{of what is being}} attempted can form this defense and, in the majority of situations, it will only offer limited benefit to a defendant of ordinary capacity since the state owes no general duty to save citizens from the effects of their own ignorance or stupidity. Nevertheless, there may be limited circumstances in which people may honestly believe things that either prevent them from forming the requisite mens rea or from reaching an <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> agreement.|$|R
50|$|A legal {{instrument}} that incorrectly records the contract between two parties may be rectified {{to conform to}} the common intention. In such a case, there is <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> idem; what is rectified is not the contract itself as a juristic act (negotium), but rather the instrument (instrumentum) in question, because it does not embody what the parties intended to be the content of their agreement.|$|R
40|$|The {{fixed-term}} contract {{has been used}} as a legal instrument by parties who wish to engage in an employment relationship within the framework of predictability and freedom to control the duration of their contractual relationship. Consensus between both parties on the contents and the specific limitations of this kind of atypical employment contract is vital to avoid any misunderstanding and unreasonable expectations on the part of the employee. At the conclusion of the contract, the parties need to be <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> that employment would start at the time of the conclusion of their contract, or at a specific date or event stipulated therein, and would inevitably terminate automatically at such time as the parties have agreed upon. It should have been the mutual intention of the parties that the purpose of this type of contract is linked to a limited duration, unlike that of the traditional contract of indefinite employment, which is likely to continue for an indefinite period...|$|R
50|$|Roman law {{recognised}} {{a number}} of distinct contract types (e.g. contracts consensu, re, verbis and litteris) which were binding only if they were ‘clothed’ in special forms and formulas; in other words, Roman law had ‘a law of contracts, rather than of contract’. This distinguishes it from the modern practice of regarding any obligationary agreement meeting certain general requirements as an enforceable contract. Only for contracts consensu (e.g. sale, lease, partnership and mandate) was mutual assent (<b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem)</b> ‘clothed’ in solemnities sufficient to make the agreement enforceable. Any agreement that did not rigidly conform to the four types {{was referred to as}} a nudum pactum and was not actionable unless there had been part performance. The development of contracts consensu was prompted by the commercial needs of the growing Roman state, but Roman law never reached the point of enforcing all serious and deliberate agreements as contracts.|$|E
5000|$|According to the European {{version of}} history and terms of Treaty Making, the First Nations people gave up their {{customary}} title to the land under common law in exchange for provisions from the government. The First Nations understanding is radically different from the British version; {{due to the nature}} of oral histories, translations (for example there is no concept of [...] "land ownership" [...] or [...] "cede", which follows from the concept of land ownership, in the Cree language), and British customs, there continues to be a controversy as to possible different understanding of the terms as they were used at the time of the Treaty signings creating no <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> and subsequently leading to an invalid contract.

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of quasi-mutual assent is undoubtedly {{part of our}} South African law and has been affirmed and applied {{in a number of}} leading decisions. The purpose of this note is to offer a critical analysis of the application of the doctrine in the case of Pillay v Shaik 2009 4 SA 74 (SCA). It is argued that the primary basis of contractual liability in South Africa has always been and still remains <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> as determined in terms of the rules relating to offer and acceptance It is also argued that the doctrine is not an answer to failure by the parties to comply with self-imposed formalities and/or the prescribed manner of acceptance of an offer for the valid formation of contracts. Based on the aim of the incorporation of the doctrine in our law, coupled with its application in previous court decisions, it is concluded that its application in the case of Pillay v Shaik was wrong and sets a bad precedent...|$|E
40|$|Contrary to {{the general}} view of non-lawyers and laymen; not all {{promises}} or agreements can be accepted or are enforceable at law. An agreement is enforceable if an aggrieved party whose rights have been breached by the other party to the agreement can enforce those rights or get his remedies from the courts of law. In order for a contract to be enforceable, a promise or agreement must be valid and binding between the parties; meaning {{that they must be}} capable to be legally construed as contracts that are valid and binding at law. The elements of an enforceable contract is judicially explained by VC George in the case of Kajang Sri Rock Products Sdn Bhd v Maybank Finance Bhd & Ors 1 in that “To constitute a valid contract there must be separate and definite parties thereto; those parties must be in agreement, that there must be <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem,</b> those parties must intend to create legal relations {{in the sense that the}} promise to each side are to be enforceable simply because thay are contractual promises and the promises of each party must be supported by consideration. ’ This paper seeks to explain what is ‘intention to create legal relations,’ for abject failure to understand this most basic of a contractual element apart from the classic ‘offer’ and ‘acceptance’ requirements, will render a promise or agreement unenforceable at law thereby throwing many precious business relationships and business ventures into the floors of the courts with very lengthy and expensive court battles therein...|$|E
40|$|No single {{group has}} the right to ignore a {{consensus}} of thoughtful opinion. Mollie Hunter (1922 – 2012) In this issue, we publish a consensus report from the Clinical Practice Committee of the Canadian Association of General Surgeons regarding Clostridium difficile. Medical use of the word “consensus” is evolving. Its 19 th century meaning — the harmony between physiologic sys- tems — has faded in most areas of medicine, with the possi- ble exception of the field of genetics in which consensus may refer to conserved sequences of DNA. The specific physiologic term has been replaced in medicine by a vaguer popular meaning, often used to confer authority upon a statement or process — authority that it might not otherwise possess. Popular use is derived from the legal term <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem,</b> which originated in Roman law as an informal contract based on mutual consent. The element of consent has persisted in its legal use, but the emphasis has changed in popular and medical use to denote agreement not just between parties, but general acceptance. While we have become increasingly precise about grades of medical evidence, interpretation of these units of evi- dence in complex pathophysiological systems remains less structured. The outcome is more often decided by regula- tors and insurers than by agreement among practitioners. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) distinguishes con- sensus statements from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) as the synthesis of new information from recent research. Standardization policies by jurisdictions such as the Euro- pean Union are vague with respect to methods of consensus development, but they are prescriptive with respect to CPGs, stating they may be used in litigation as a standard of practice. 2 This is particularly true of cancer care in Canada. 3 The NIH Consensus Development Program attempts to address some of these issues, but topic selection is very restrictive and the conference approach is limiting. 4 The Delphi procedure for deriving consensus is said to have originated as a method used by the military after World War II to brainstorm about the capabilities and future actions of the enemy. Developed later for public policy cre- ation, the procedure attempted to include and protect all points of view in iterative cycles of facilitated refinement. The nominal group method assigns fundamental aspects of complex problems to groups using techniques intended to prevent domination by a single opinion, with voting to determine priorities. The nominal group method was used recently to determine waiting time targets for pediatric surgery in Canada. 5 The Delphi procedure is more often used for distant communication, and the nominal group method is favoured by consensus conferences. With modern communication systems, these procedures may be blended. <b>Consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> implies agreement not only about the answer, but also about the question. CJS protocol for pub- lishing consensus-based articles will require the authors to be selected by a representative group or society. The sub- ject, topic or question addressed by the statement should be validated by a committee of that group. Composition of the report should use the procedures outlined here so that research tasks are shared productively among sub- groups and opinions, including a patient perspective if possible, are debated. The initial draft should be circulated among the general membership of the society, whose comments should be considered in revisions before confir- mation by a committee or executive of the sponsoring society. When the final draft is submitted to the journal, it will undergo independent peer review. Those accepted for publication will include a footnote confirming compliance with CJS protocol for consensus development. In the end, the weight accorded to a consensus report will depend on the validity of the process it uses to distill the thoughtful opinion it appraises...|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} of party autonomy is recognized internationally {{when it comes}} to the conflict of laws. The parties are free to insert the governing law clause in their respective contract. Shamil Bank of Bahrain v. Beximco Pharmaceuticals sent repercussion to the Islamic finance industry when the court of England applied English law instead of what has been written in the contract i. e. “Subject to the principles of the Glorious Shariah, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. ” Under the party autonomy rule, it is clear that the contracting parties are allowed to nominate one legal system to govern the contract and to specify that another system be used to interpret it and in Re Helbert Wagg it was held that ‘the parties may well contemplate that different parts of their contract shall be governed by different law’. Is there any justification to exclude the intended terms of the agreeing parties in the contract and merely apply English law for the execution of the contract and to be considered as valid and name it as a proper law. In the absence of any specific laws governing Shariah laws in Islamic finance for international contract, the proper law is the law which is more convenient to both parties and adherence of Shariah principles. The purpose of this short article is to determine whether the concept of party autonomy rule is being upheld seriously by the English court. It also examines if the parties are free to choose a system of law unconnected with the transaction in the light of the Rome Convention and whether it is proper for the court to apply English law when the parties have <b>consensus</b> <b>ad</b> <b>idem</b> agreed to the terms of the contract. In addition to this, there is no generally applicable connecting factor that can be used in English law to determine the proper law of the contract. It conceptualizes the reality of the challenge when it reaches the Islamic finance business fraternity across borders...|$|E

40|$|Despite a vast {{literature}} examining semantic {{impairment in}} Alzheimer's disease (<b>AD),</b> <b>consensus</b> regarding {{the nature of}} the deficit remains elusive. We re-considered this issue {{in the context of a}} framework that assumes semantic cognition can break down in two ways: (1) core semantic representations can degrade or (2) cognitive control mechanisms can become impaired [1]. We hypothesised and confirmed that the nature of semantic impairment in AD changes with disease severity. Patients at mild or severe stages of the disorder exhibited impairment across various semantic tasks but the nature of those deficits differed qualitatively for the two groups. Commensurate with early dysfunction of the cognitive control, temporoparietal-frontal-cingulate network, characteristics of deregulated semantic cognition were exhibited by the mild AD cases. In contrast, the severe AD group reproduced features of additional degradation of core semantic representations. These results suggest that spread of pathology into lateral anterior temporal lobes in later stage AD produces degradation of semantic representations, exacerbating the already deregulated system. Moreover, the dual nature of severe patients’ impairment was highlighted by disproportionately poor performance on tasks placing high demand on both conceptual knowledge and control processes–e. g., category fluency...|$|R
