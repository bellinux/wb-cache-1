50|$|On 5 January 1956, {{the second}} YH-16 test {{aircraft}} crashed while returning to Philadelphia from a test flight over New Jersey. The {{cause of the}} crash was later determined to be the aft slip ring, which <b>carried</b> <b>flight</b> data from the instrumented rotor blades to the data recorders in the cabin. The slip ring bearings seized, and the resultant torque load severed the instrumentation standpipe inside the aft rotor shaft. A segment of this steel standpipe tilted over and {{came into contact with}} the interior of the aluminum rotor shaft, scribing a deepening groove into it. The rotor shaft eventually failed in flight, which in turn led to the aft blades and forward blades desynchronizing and colliding.|$|E
50|$|The T-840 was {{powered by}} two 420 hp (313 kW) Wright R-975 9-cylinder radial engines, mounted well forward {{and above the}} wing leading edge and {{enclosed}} in wide chord NACA cowlings. Behind them, fairings extended almost to {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. Between the fuselage and engines the wings had steel tube frames and were aluminium covered. Outboard of the engines the wings had two wooden spars, spruce and plywood ribs and were fabric covered. A pair of faired, parallel struts on each side ran {{from the bottom of the}} fuselage to the wing close to the engine. The slotted flaps had stressed aluminium skins and the slats were also metal, moving on rollers, but the ailerons had fabric covering over metal frames. The tail surfaces were conventional, with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage; like the fin, the tailplane was a plywood covered wooden structure. The control surfaces had metal structures and fabric covering; both elevators and rudder <b>carried</b> <b>flight</b> adjustable trim tabs.|$|E

40|$|Methods for {{evaluating}} and implementing {{air traffic management}} tools and approaches for managing and avoiding an air traffic incident before the incident occurs. A first system receives parameters for flight plan configurations (e. g., initial fuel <b>carried,</b> <b>flight</b> route, flight route segments followed, flight altitude for a given flight route segment, aircraft velocity for each flight route segment, flight route ascent rate, flight route descent route, flight departure site, flight departure time, flight arrival time, flight destination site and/or alternate flight destination site), flight plan schedule, expected weather along each flight route segment, aircraft specifics, airspace (altitude) bounds for each flight route segment, navigational aids available. The invention provides flight plan routing and direct routing or wind optimal routing, using great circle navigation and spherical Earth geometry. The invention provides for aircraft dynamics effects, such as wind effects at each altitude, altitude changes, airspeed changes and aircraft turns to provide predictions of aircraft trajectory (and, optionally, aircraft fuel use). A second system provides several aviation applications using the first system. Several classes of potential incidents are analyzed and averted, by appropriate change en route {{of one or more}} parameters in the flight plan configuration, as provided by a conflict detection and resolution module and/or traffic flow management modules. These applications include conflict detection and resolution, miles-in trail or minutes-in-trail aircraft separation, flight arrival management, flight re-routing, weather prediction and analysis and interpolation of weather variables based upon sparse measurements. The invention combines these features to provide an aircraft monitoring system and an aircraft user system that interact and negotiate changes with each other...|$|E

50|$|In a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft, the spar {{is often}} the main structural member of the wing, running spanwise at right angles (or thereabouts depending on wing sweep) to the fuselage. The spar <b>carries</b> <b>flight</b> loads {{and the weight of}} the wings while on the ground. Other structural and forming members such as ribs may be attached to the spar or spars, with stressed skin construction also sharing the loads where it is used. There may be more than one spar in a wing or none at all. However, where a single spar carries the majority of the forces on it, it is known as the main spar.|$|R

The test flights are {{expected}} to be fewer, as Enterprise has already tested the design's responses under numerous conditions. For each flight test, the White Knight Two aircraft carries Unity to altitude. Testing began with captive <b>carry</b> <b>flights,</b> in which Unity was not released from its carrier aircraft. Testing then progressed to free-flight glide testing, and will continue with powered test flights. It is possible that only 2-3 flights under each regime previously tested will be performed, instead of the 5 or 10 that Enterprise performed.|$|R
