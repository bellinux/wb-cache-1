In addition, it will typically conduct several inquiries into pieces of legislation being considered by the parliament. A references committee will conduct inquiries into policy issues referred to it by the Senate. Each of these inquiries will usually result in a report tabled in the Senate (there may be exceptions if an election intervenes during the committee's deliberations).

50|$|Abraham was {{the first}} member of a {{military}} panel to challenge the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hearings.</b> He said the panels were strongly pressured to rule that detainees were enemy combatants. His panel resisted pressure to change their determination and continued to find the detainee was not an enemy combatant. He was never asked to sit on another panel. His affidavit is believed to have contributed to the Supreme Court's decision to accept the consolidated cases of Boumediene v. Bush and Al-Odah v. United States for its 2007-2008 docket. It had originally declined to hear this case. In Boumediene v. Bush (2008), the Supreme Court found that detainees had the habeas corpus right for access to federal courts. It found that provisions of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 restricting them to the military system were unconstitutional. In addition, since the CSRTs had been completed in 2005, most detainees were still being held without charges; their cases had not progressed.|$|R

Noble received other offers, including one from CBS founder William S.

Goldenson and Noble reached a tentative agreement in the late spring of 1951 in which UPT would acquire ABC {{and turn it into}} a subsidiary of the company that would retain autonomy in its management. On June 6, 1951, the tentative agreement was approved by UPT's board of directors.

The committee also has a broad jurisdiction over matters relating to federal criminal law, as well as human rights, immigration law, intellectual property rights, antitrust law, and Internet privacy. It is also Senate procedure that all proposed Constitutional Amendments pass through the Judiciary Committee.|$|R

Parliamentary oversight aims to check whether the activity of the Foreign Intelligence Service is consistent with the Constitution of Romania and the policies of the Romanian state.

40|$|Videoconferencing has {{generated}} ambivalence {{in the legal}} community. Some have heralded its promise of unprecedented access to justice, expecialy for geographicaly remote communities. Others, however, have questioned whether videoconferencing undermines fairness. The authors explore the impl 2 ̆ 7 cations of videoconferencing through the case study of the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Tribunal, {{which is one of}} the busiest adjudicative bodies in Canada. This anaysis hig hghts concerns both with videoconferendng in princp 4 and in practice. While such concerns traditionally have been the province of public administration, the authors argue that a tribunals allocation of resources and the suffidengy of its budget are also core concerns of administrative law. Administrative law reaches beyond conventional doctrines of procedural fairness on the one hand and substantive rationakit on the other. How the legislature structures andfunds decision-making bodies is notjust a matter of poiticalpreference but also of legal sufficeny. The common law, the Chartero f Rights, and unwritten constitutionalprincipless uch as the rule of law and access to justice allprovide potential constraints both on governments and tribunals as to the organization and <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> adjudicative <b>hearings,</b> espedaly in settings like the Landlord and Tenant Tribunal, where the nghts of vulnerable people are at stake, While a challenge to the videoconferencing practices of the Landlord and Tenant Tribunal has yet to be brought, the authors conclude that eventually the intersection of tribunal resources with the fairness and reasonableness of that tribunal 2 ̆ 7 s decision-making will reach the courts. How the courts resolve these challenges may represent the next frontier of administrative law...|$|R
