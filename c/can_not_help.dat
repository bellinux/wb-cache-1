25|$|A {{finding of}} lesser {{importance}} {{is that the}} Younger Lady has a double-pierced ear. Pierced ears were rather common for women of the New Kingdom of Egypt, including royals and nonroyal women. The Lady's pierced ear <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> researchers determine her identity or social position. Similarly inconclusive for identification purposes was {{the discovery of a}} wig in KV35, which could have belonged to the Younger Lady. Supporters of the theory identifying the Lady with Nefertiti, pointed to the wig's perceived similarities with the type of wigs used by Nefertiti. They are fashion items used by Egyptian women of the same era, they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> us identify the wig's user with the Queen.|$|E
25|$|Even with {{cooperation}} of the human element of the equation, reconciliation ecology <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> every species. Some animals, such as several species of waterfowl, show strong avoidance behaviors toward humans and any form of human disturbance. No matter how nice an urban park is built, the proximity of humans will scare away some birds. Other species must maintain large territories, and barriers that abound in human habitats, such as roads, will stop them from coexisting with humans. These animals will require undisturbed land set aside for them.|$|E

However, despite McCreight’s considerable efforts, David spent almost a year in county jails. The impact on David’s family was catastrophic, and without his help, Felix’s farm failed. Felix wrote McCreight. [...] “And they make spoil my family no farm on this year, because my son David was in jail and nobody <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> to work on our farm, and also David's sister, age 20 years, she was dead on May 15, 1927, for I am sorry everythings.” McCreight reported that, “My investigation shows that {{he was charged with}} stealing ponies, two having come into his possession in a trade in which he sold to some horse buyers without having changed the brands. [...] It is only one more of the many examples of persecution of the poor red man by the grafting, cowardly, agency officials. [...] There seems little or no legal remedy for it.” David Flying Hawk later became Treaty Chairman of the South Dakota and Seven Camp Fires, pursuing the United States Government for broken treaty obligations.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} {{expression}} can help, meaning ‘can refrain/avoid’. It focuses on the polarity and the fixedness of this expression andon its complex complementation. A diachronic corpus study shows that this item is no longer best described as a negative polarity item and that it hasundergone a process of lexicalization. The second half of this article deals with the complex complementation of <b>can</b> (-ed) <b>not</b> <b>help</b> and, more specifically, with the <b>can</b> (-ed) <b>not</b> <b>help</b> but V-structure. This structure is extragrammatical because there exists no similar construction in contemporaryEnglish. However, as will be shown, its use has recently increased at the expense of <b>can</b> (-ed) <b>not</b> <b>help</b> + gerund. This paper will demonstrate that acombination of sociolinguistic, semantic and pragmatic factors, coupled with criteria related to processing ease, may have played a decisive part inthis somewhat paradoxical success.
