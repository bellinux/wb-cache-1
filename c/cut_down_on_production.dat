Allowing {{for the use of}} engines and powertrains from a variety of suppliers, Blue Bird also redesigned the All American for the first time. [...] The roof was extended further forward, expanding the entryway, entry door, and allowing for a much larger windshield. In the chassis redesign, Blue Bird expanded the overall capacity of the All American, with some versions seating up to 72 passengers.|$|E

The interior of the second generation Korando was unique because it had a steering wheel arch on either side. This was to make converting to right-hand-drive easier and to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>production</b> costs. On the passenger's side, a handle was fitted in the arch. This generation was sold as the Daewoo Korando from 1999 to 2001, as Daewoo bought a majority stake in SsangYong, but was later forced to sell its shares.|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} {{system is a}} system that is used to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. The biggest benefit of automation is that it saves labor. However, it is also used to save energy and materials and to improve quality, accuracy and precision. Automation system {{can be applied to the}} greenhouse irrigation system because of many reasons. With automation system everything can be done systematically, efficiently while saving a lot of cost' factor such as money, energy and time. The use of microcontroller in the automation system has been broad nowadays because of it capability. Arduino is a one good microcontroller to use in the Greenhouse Autoduino because of the many good reason it provides. On the other hand, Microcontroller is a highly integrated chip that contains all the components comprising a controller. Typically this includes a CPU, RAM, some form of ROM, I/O ports, and timers. Unlike a general-purpose computer, which also includes all of these components, a microcontroller is designed for a very specific task such as to control a particular system. As a result, the parts can be simplified and reduced, which <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>production</b> costs as mention earlier...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} stylized model that captures the {{phenomena}} of decoupling and recoupling {{in an environment}} where heterogeneous entrepreneurial sectors face financial constraints in their relationship with a common set of lenders. In response to adverse shocks, a financially constrained sector must reduce its borrowing and <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>production.</b> In particular, as the constrained sector absorbs less and less capital, the real interest rate in the economy declines. Other sectors that compete for the same inputs (including capital) thus experience lower costs, which boosts investment, output, and profits, reflecting the phenomenon of "decoupling. " As long as the shock is small, the entrepreneurial sector repays what is owed and the lenders' ability to supply funds is unaffected. For large shocks, however, the constrained sector is no longer able to honor its debts in full and lenders experience losses that erode their lending base. This induces them to cut their supply of credit {{to the rest of the}} economy, which reduces output and profit for all other entrepreneurial sectors, capturing the phenomenon of "recoupling" or contagion. ...|$|E
40|$|The nancial {{crisis that}} has engulfed {{the world over}} the past three years started out in a {{relatively}} small set of sectors in a select number of countries, with a particularly important contribution from the real estate sector in the United States. At rst (February 2007 to May 2008), nancial problems seemed to stay conned to their sectors and countries of origin, with little repercussion on other sectors in the United States or on emerging countries. In fact, policymakers in the developing world would brag about this “decoupling” from the United States as a sign of the economic maturity reached by their domestic economies. 1 Starting around May 2008, however – and particularly after the collapse of Lehman (September 15, 2008) – the nancial crisis began to spread like wild re, affecting countries all around the world, with asset and stock prices collapsing in unison. 2 This paper develops a stylized model of decoupling and recoupling that captures these phenomena in an environment where heterogeneous entrepreneurial sectors face nancial constraints in their relationship with a common set of lenders. In response to adverse shocks, a nancially constrained sector must reduce its borrowing and <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>production.</b> In particular, as the constrained sector can absorb less and less capital, the interest rate in the economy declines.

30|$|Growing {{awareness}} regarding greenhouse {{emissions and}} rising demand for energy savings are major factors boosting {{growth of the}} global high-performance insulation materials market. High-performance insulation processes are in high demand in the industrial sector, mainly due to its natural ability to regulate temperature. This {{is a very important}} attribute, as this helps avoid costs related to artificial thermal regulators such as air conditioners and heaters. Energy usage during insulation processes is minimal, which helps to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> associated <b>production</b> costs. However, some of the disadvantages associated with the usage of high-performance insulation processes are high set up and maintenance costs and relatively low service life. High-performance insulation materials need periodic maintenance, as majority of the materials are made of aerogel and ceramic fiber (Yurkov 2005; Skalkin 2006).|$|R

5000|$|In 1970 Reksten {{signed the}} {{shipping}} contract of all times, when Libya <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> oil <b>production,</b> while Nigeria was in chaos, and Syria closed the oil pipeline from the Middle East to the Mediterranean. Twelve of his supertankers were now hired out to British Petroleum under a contract providing Reksten {{with a net}} profit of 500 million kroner. The later [...] "Reksten-case" [...] originated in this giant sum, which was illegally transferred from Norway and hidden in secret [...] "mailbox companies" [...] abroad. To him, the profit was his, and his alone, and privately he had also ventilated the opinion that the tax policy of the Norwegian Labour party made it necessary to remove funds from Norway. Due to this action however, the Reksten empire had few funds to rely on when the freight rates dropped dramatically from 1971 onwards. The market was so slow that five of Reksten's supertankers were laid up, while {{he was forced to}} sell out another two. He still had considerable orders placed at Akers mekaniske. This firm was worried {{to such a degree that}} it was suggested to declare Reksten bankrupt; but in the winter of 1972/73, freight rates went up again, helped by an increase in the import to USA, as well as fear of rising oil prices.|$|R
40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Because of a {{continuous}} {{increase in the}} demand for electricity in South Africa the country’s largest electricity utility (Eskom) has been under strain to provide electricity. An expansion programme to generate more electricity has caused {{a continuous}} increase in utility costs. Steep electricity tariff increases have forced large electricity consumers, such as the mining industry, to focus on energy efficiency and demand side management (DSM). More recently, large industrial action has affected the marginality of the mining industry {{in such a way}} that mining groups were forced to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>production</b> cost and even sell mining shafts. A solution has to be found to improve the marginality of these mines. DSM intervention on mine water reticulation systems has shown great promise in the past and has been implemented on many South African mines with great success. Many mines with smaller systems have not been optimised because the priority of DSM intervention was to achieve the largest saving; therefore, larger systems enjoyed priority over smaller systems. This only added to the increased financial pressure on already marginal mines. In this study the operation of a mine water reticulation system will be studied to identify the most efficient DSM interventions to implement. DSM intervention on dewatering-, refrigeration- and water distribution systems will be investigated to get a better understanding of the functions of these operations. Previous project data will be analysed to create tools that would assist in the decision-making process for DSM intervention regarding saving potential, cost benefit and cost implication. This data would ultimately assist in determining a project’s payback period that is used to prioritise DSM intervention applications. A mining group will be analysed to identify possible DSM intervention potential. The systems will be investigated and the best strategy for DSM intervention will be selected. This study will conclude that it is financially feasible to implement DSM interventions on marginal mines’ dewatering systems. Master...|$|E
5000|$|Spanish New Year's Eve (Nochevieja or Fin de Año) {{celebrations}} usually {{begin with}} a family dinner, traditionally including shrimp or prawns, and lamb or capon. The actual countdown is primarily followed from the clock {{on top of the}} Casa de Correos building in Puerta del Sol Square in Madrid. It is traditional to eat Twelve Grapes, one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909, when grape growers in Alicante thought of {{it as a way to}} <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the large <b>production</b> surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet each other and toast with sparkling wine such as cava or champagne, or with cider. The song [...] "Un año más," [...] by the Spanish group Mecano, is frequently played.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1944, {{in order}} to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{tailoring}} and <b>production</b> costs, the Wehrmacht introduced the M44 pattern uniform. Similar in appearance to the British Battle Dress or the related US [...] "Ike" [...] jacket, the M44 was unlike any other German pattern uniform, and the first major deviation in uniform design since 1936. The tunic skirt was shortened to waist length, an internal belt was added, and the tunic could be worn with an open or closed collar. The color was the new [...] "Feldgrau 44", a drab greenish-brown. The rarely used and complicated internal suspension system was finally dropped. German insignia was still worn (breast eagle, collar Litzen and shoulder boards). [...] Except for the elite Panzer-Lehr-Division, which field-tested the new uniform in summer 1944 before its approval for general issue, the M44 was usually seen at the front only in the war's last months and generally on the greenest of troops: new replacements, teenage Flakhelfer, and Hitlerjugend and Volkssturm militia.|$|R
40|$|Harder {{regulations}} regarding dearomatization and desulphurization of fuels {{in addition}} to increased yield of valuable products are making hydrogen scarce in the refinery process. Hydrogen demands not covered with gas from reforming of naphtha must be met by steam reforming. Hydrogen production from steam reforming is both costly and energy intensive, and refineries therefore aims at avoiding this. In this thesis a relatively new tool, hydrogen pinch analysis, is used to review the hydrogen distribution system of two refineries: Preemraff Göteborg and Preemraff Lysekil. The reasons for the two refineries {{to participate in the}} project have been different, but the goal on both has been to identify shortcomings of the hydrogen distribution system. Preemraff Göteborg {{wants to be able to}} run their refinery at design capacity for all units, even after a revamp has been made in order to produce renewable based diesel. Preemraff Lysekil wants to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> their <b>production</b> of hydrogen from the steam reformer. The analysis of the hydrogen distribution systems in Göteborg and Lysekil resulted in two respectively three suggestions for better hydrogen economy. This has mostly been achieved through redirection of off gases from the fuel gas net to an upgrading facility. The suggestions are all independent of each other, and have therefore been combined into a larger case covering all suggestions. At Preemraff Göteborg, fresh hydrogen to the unit not working at maximum capacity was increased by 23 % with a payback time of 1. 4 years. This could be achieved via one of the presented cases, which included purchase of a new compressor. At Preemraff Lysekil, hydrogen production in the steam reformer could be lowered with 19 %, from approximately 70 100 Nm 3 /h to 55 600 Nm 3 /h. The suggestion achieving this also included a new compressor, since off gases with high purity but low pressure was found to be the most promising hydrogen source...|$|R
