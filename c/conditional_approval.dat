5|$|Before {{his death}} in 1107, Richard the abbot of Ely had {{attempted}} to secure from the papacy the elevation of his abbey into a bishopric. After Richard's death, Hervey was appointed to oversee the abbey during the vacancy. He convinced the monks of Ely to support Richard's project, which received the <b>conditional</b> <b>approval</b> of Archbishop Anselm, contingent on papal approval. Paschal signalled his approval, and in 1109 the monastery became a bishopric. Ely still remained a monastic house, as the abbey itself became the cathedral and the monks of the abbey became the monks of the cathedral chapter. Also in 1109, the pope approved Hervey's translation to a new see, and he was made Bishop of Ely. He was enthroned at Ely in October 1109.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route, including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and the noise and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were not acceptable due to the potential impact on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's <b>conditional</b> <b>approval</b> on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Jarre {{released}} Revolutions. The album spans several genres, including symphonic industrial, Arabian inspired, light guitar pop {{and ethnic}} electro jazz. A two-hour concert called Destination Docklands was planned for September 1988, {{to be held}} at the Royal Victoria Dock in east London. Close to the heart of London, the location was chosen in part for its desolate environment, but also because Jarre thought the architecture was ideally suited for his music. Early in 1988 Jarre met with local officials and members of the community, but Newham Borough Council expressed their fears about the event's safety and delayed their decision on whether to allow the concert to proceed until 12 September eventually rejecting the licence application. The local fire service were also concerned about access {{in the event of a}} fire. Site work continued as Jarre's team searched for alternative locations in which to stage the concert, but following improvements to both on and off-site safety Jarre eventually won <b>conditional</b> <b>approval</b> on 28 September to stage two separate performances, on the 8 and 9 October.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} fast drug {{innovation}} {{and the public}} demand for risk-free drugs creates a dilemma for regulatory authorities: less restrictive procedures involve uncertainties about benefit/risk profiles of new drugs. The European Union has introduced two instruments that regulate early market access: <b>conditional</b> <b>approvals</b> (CAs) and approvals under exceptional circumstances (ECs). We have studied whether these instruments compromise the safety of new drugs and whether they lead to earlier access to innovative drugs. Our study shows that neither of these regulatory pathways accelerates the approval process for innovative drugs. However, the CA pathway shortens the clinical development period. Approvals under ECs are associated with longer clinical development periods, but this regulatory pathway may open up opportunities for specific drugs to be admitted into the market because less comprehensive data are required. Despite {{the fact that these}} advanced approvals are based on limited safety databases, there are no special safety issues associated with using these pathways...|$|R
500|$|For about a decade, {{there was}} a plan to extend the {{designation}} of I-195 to the west in concurrence with the rerouting of I-95 planned {{after the completion of}} the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project in 2019. Beginning in 2005, plans were made to extend I-195 west from its present-day western terminus along I-295 and I-95, continuing counterclockwise to the north, west and south around Trenton to the new interchange. I-295 would have been truncated to the current interchange with I-195. Officials from New Jersey and Pennsylvania had agreed to submit the I-195 request to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, as no route designation is official until approved by them. Had it been approved, approximately [...] would have been added to I-195. Interchange renumbering would have also taken place in concert with the future I-195 designation in Pennsylvania and both the planned and current I-195 designation in New Jersey. This proposal had received <b>conditional</b> <b>approval</b> from AASHTO. However, on May 20, 2015, the original plan of extending I-295 west and south into Pennsylvania to the new interchange was approved instead, leaving the western terminus of I-195 at its current location.|$|E

2500|$|Rather than {{go through}} the {{time-consuming}} process to add the route to the STAA system, the state decided to get it approved as an Interstate. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) informed the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) {{that it would not}} approve the addition until a construction contract to correct a [...] "high accident wet weather location" [...] on the US264 portion was underway. Immediately after the response from the FHWA, NCDOT added the project (W-5007) to the state Transportation Improvement Plan, but AASHTO denied the I-795 numbering at their May 4, 2007, meeting, citing concerns about the south end not being at another Interstate and the lack of FHWA approval. However, AASHTO decided at their September 28 meeting to give <b>conditional</b> <b>approval,</b> pending FHWA concurrence. The North Carolina Highway Patrol, which had begun ticketing overlength truckers on US117 in mid-2007, stopped enforcing the ban on October 3, due to the AASHTO decision. The first I-795 signs were posted on November 28, 2007, replacing US117 signs along the whole route. Most, but not all signage at the interchange on-ramps was updated at the same time. Other changes, including shifting US117 back to the old route and changing exit numbers and mileposts, were to be completed by early 2008, but complications with the road surface and approval of moving US117 delayed those plans to December 2009.|$|E

40|$|Background: Most Canadian {{provinces and}} territories {{rely on the}} pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) to provide {{recommendations}} regarding public reimbursement of cancer drugs. The pCODR review process considers four dimensions of value—clinical benefit, economic evaluation, patient-based values and adoption feasibility—but they do not define weights for individual decision criteria or an acceptable threshold {{for any of the}} criteria. Given this implicit review process, it is of interest to understand which factors appear to carry the most weight in pCODR recommendations using a revealed preferences approach. Methods: Using publicly available decision summaries (n = 91) describing submissions and resulting recommendations 2011 – 2017, we extracted ten attributes that characterized each submission. Using logistic regression, we identified statistically significant attributes and estimated their relative impact in final recommendations. Results: Clinical aspects appear to carry the greatest weight in the decision to reject or not reject, along with aspects of patient value (treatments with no alternatives {{were less likely to be}} rejected). Cost effectiveness does not appear to play a role in the initial decision to reject or not reject but is critical in full versus <b>conditional</b> <b>approvals.</b> There is evidence of a maximum acceptable threshold of around $Can 140, 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Conclusion: A set of factors driving pCODR recommendations is identifiable, supporting the consistency of the review process. However, the implicit nature of the review process and the difficulty of extracting and interpreting some of the attribute levels used in the analysis suggests that the process may still lack full transparency...|$|R
