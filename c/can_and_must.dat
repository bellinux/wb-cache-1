But states <b>can,</b> <b>and</b> <b>must,</b> regulate behaviors, including various sexual behaviors. Throughout the world, there is a consensus between societies that certain kinds of sexual behaviors must be forbidden by law. Pedophilia and incest are two examples."

2500|$|Recently, the Church {{has been}} criticized for its {{teaching}} that embryonic stem cell research is a form of experimentation on human beings, and results in the killing of a human person. Much criticism of this position has been {{on the grounds that the}} doctrine hinders scientific research; even some conservatives, taking a utilitarian position, have pointed out that most embryos from which stem cells are harvested are [...] "leftover" [...] from in vitro fertilization, and would soon be discarded whether used for such research or not. [...] The Church, by contrast, has consistently upheld its ideal of the dignity of each individual human life, and argues that it is as wrong to destroy an embryo as it would be to kill an adult human being; and that therefore advances in medicine <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>must</b> come without the destruction of human embryos, for example by using adult or umbilical stem cells in place of embryonic stem cells.|$|E

Chamberlain went on to write that Wilhelm was [...] "in fact the first German Kaiser" [...] who knew his mission was [...] "ennoble" [...] the world by spreading [...] "German knowledge, German philosophy, German art and-if God wills-German religion. Only a Kaiser who undertakes this task is a true Kaiser of the German people." [...] To allow Germany to become a world power, Chamberlain called for the Reich to become the world's greatest sea power as Chamberlain asserted that whatever power rules the seas also rules the world. Chamberlain wrote that [...] "without a fleet nothing can be done. But equipped with a great fleet, Germany is embarking on the course to which Cromwell showed England the way, and she <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>must</b> steer resolutely towards the goal of becoming the first power in the world.

2500|$|The {{failure of}} {{revolutions}} in Germany and Hungary ended Bolshevik hopes for an imminent world revolution {{and led to}} promotion of [...] "Socialism in One Country" [...] by Joseph Stalin. In {{the first edition of}} the book Osnovy Leninizma (Foundations of Leninism, 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient. But {{by the end of that}} year, in the second edition of the book, he argued that the [...] "proletariat <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>must</b> build the socialist society in one country". In April 1925, Nikolai Bukharin elaborated the issue in his brochure Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?, whose position was adopted as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article On the Issues of Leninism (К вопросам ленинизма). This idea was opposed by Leon Trotsky and his followers who declared the need for an international [...] "permanent revolution". Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition, while Maoist China supported Socialism in One Country.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} stages of his innings, he was ably {{assisted}} by Akash Chopra, who made a solid 36, but after Chopra's dismissal, VVS Laxman walked out to bat with the scorecard reading 127/4. He started to play some sumptuous shots off back foot, a few flicks with a delectable roll of the wrists, and a characteristic swivel-pull, which signalled {{that he was going to}} get a hundred as well. Peter Roebuck wrote of his innings: [...] "Laxman's innings was astonishing. In his hands, a bat becomes a wand...Laxman does not play any ugly shots but he is no mere stylist, for his beauty is innate. He hits the ball hard and with plenty of control and scores quickly because he <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>must.</b> He is hard to contain, for he has a wide range of strokes at his disposal and an appetite for big scores. Opponents fear his reach towards the extraordinary." [...] For a man who had been under needless pressure, Laxman's innings was quite soothing and he dominated almost every bowler except Gillespie and MacGill, against whom he scored 7 runs off 24 balls and 14 runs off 40 balls respectively. His end came unexpectedly and almost against the run of play, as he was out slicing a short and wide delivery of MacGill's to Simon Katich, leaving India at a healthy stage of 273/5.|$|E

He added that [...] "whether what he mentioned can be defined as a state is a subject of some debate". France praised the speech but called on Israel to cease building settlements in the West Bank. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner stated that [...] "I can only welcome the prospect of a Palestinian state outlined by the Israeli Prime Minister."
