Furthermore, a CO2-H2O greenhouse atmosphere to warm the climate should have left extensive deposits of carbonate rocks, which have not been found. Problems also exist with sustaining such an atmosphere for long enough to allow the valleys to form, as the unweathered basalts so prevalent on Mars should form extremely effective <b>carbon</b> <b>sinks,</b> especially if the surface is wet, and continuing impacts from space in Mars' early history should quickly strip any atmosphere away.|$|E

For the 1980 s, the sink is between 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 PgC y – 1, and is split approximately evenly between forest and non-forest sectors. The nonforest sink is caused by fire suppression on non-forested lands, sediment burial in resevoirs, alluvium and colluvium, and agriculturual practices. The forest sink has been attributed to changes in land use and the enhancement of plant growth by CO 2 fertilization, N deposition and climate change. To estimate the relative contribution of land use and growth enhancement in forest ecosystems, we use forest inventory data from five states spanning a latitudinal gradient in the eastern U. S. Land use is the dominant factor governing the rate of carbon accumulation in forests in these states, with growth enhancement contributing far less than previously reported. The estimated fraction of aboveground net ecosystem production due to growth enhancement is 2. 0 +/ – 4. 4 %, with the remainder due to land use. To forecast the future of the U.
