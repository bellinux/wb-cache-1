5|$|Bahrain {{participated in}} the Second World War on the Allied side, joining on 10 September 1939. On 19 October 1940, four Italian SM.82s bombers bombed Bahrain {{alongside}} Dhahran oilfields in Saudi Arabia, targeting Allied-operated oil refineries. Although minimal damage was <b>caused</b> <b>in</b> both locations, the attack forced the Allies to upgrade Bahrain's defences, an action which further stretched Allied military resources.|$|E
5|$|In 1027, the Persian naturalist, Ibn Sina (known as Avicenna in Europe), {{proposed}} {{an explanation of}} how the stoniness of fossils was <b>caused</b> <b>in</b> The Book of Healing. He modified an idea of Aristotle's, which explained {{it in terms of}} vaporous exhalations. Ibn Sina modified this into the theory of petrifying fluids (succus lapidificatus), which was elaborated on by Albert of Saxony in the 14th century and was accepted in some form by most naturalists by the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, the {{expansion}} of the southern suburbs of Washington, D.C. into Northern Virginia has introduced an urban heat island primarily caused by increased absorption of solar radiation in more densely populated areas. In the American Lung Association's 2011 report, 11 counties received failing grades for air quality, with Fairfax County having the worst in the state, due to automobile pollution.

5|$|<b>Caused</b> <b>in</b> {{part by a}} drought, the Russian famine of 1921 was {{the most}} severe that the country had {{experienced}} since that of 1891, resulting in around five million deaths. The famine was exacerbated by government requisitioning, {{as well as the}} export of large quantities of Russian grain. To aid the famine victims, the US government established an American Relief Administration to distribute food; Lenin was suspicious of this aid and had it closely monitored. During the famine, Patriarch Tikhon called on Orthodox churches to sell unnecessary items to help feed the starving, an action endorsed by the government. In February 1922 Sovnarkom went further by calling on all valuables belonging to religious institutions to be forcibly appropriated and sold. Tikhon opposed the sale of items used within the Eucharist and many clergy resisted the appropriations, resulting in violence.|$|E
5|$|Harmonia {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world {{sometime}} in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, <b>caused</b> <b>in</b> part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first two generations, they were afterwards developed to be powered by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them highly desirable, leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled the human population {{at a time when the}} birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting nuclear fallout killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in dark clouds and ash blocking out sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life. Some people were placed in cryogenic facilities in an attempt to sleep long enough until the environment improved even a little bit.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, Beebe and Barton's Bathysphere dives were {{interrupted}} {{for a year}} due to technical problems and uncooperative weather. An additional difficulty in 1931 was the death of Beebe's father, and Beebe left Nonsuch Island for a week in order to attend his father's funeral. A second year-long interruption occurred in 1933, and was <b>caused</b> <b>in</b> part {{by a lack of}} funds due to the Great Depression. Although Beebe and Barton performed no dives in 1933, their work gathered a large amount of publicity when the Bathysphere was displayed in a special exhibit for the American Museum of Natural History, and later at the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago, where they shared the fair's Hall of Science with Auguste Piccard. Beebe and Barton also obtained publicity for their dives from several articles Beebe wrote describing them for National Geographic, and from an NBC radio broadcast in which Beebe's voice transmitted up the phone line from inside the Bathysphere was broadcast nationally over the radio.|$|E
5|$|In Sicily, the {{decision}} was taken not just for fashion and appearance {{but also because it}} would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be <b>caused</b> <b>in</b> future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can step back and actually see the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.|$|E

This occurred when neither Terceira nor Nisbett qualified for an Olympic {{spot at the}} equestrian finals in Hong Kong, <b>caused</b> <b>in</b> part by the injury of Terceira's horse, Navantus. Because Bermuda was allowed only one horse rider, the Bermuda Equestrian Federation awarded their one reserved Olympic spot to Nisbett because Terceira's horse had been injured {{during the course of}} the event.|$|E

5|$|Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and {{governor}} of Taiyuan during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was <b>caused</b> <b>in</b> {{part by the}} Sui failure to conquer {{the northern part of}} the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Emperor Gong of Sui. On the news of Emperor Yang's murder by General Yuwen Huaji on June 18, 618, Li Yuan declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, the Tang.|$|E
5|$|Maiden Castle has {{provided}} inspiration for composer John Ireland and authors Thomas Hardy and John Cowper Powys. The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. In the 1930s, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler undertook the first archaeological excavations at Maiden Castle, raising its profile among the public. Further excavations {{were carried out}} under Niall Sharples, which added {{to an understanding of}} the site and repaired damage <b>caused</b> <b>in</b> part by the large number of visitors. Today the site is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is maintained by English Heritage.|$|E

He finds a job managing the construction of a factory and becomes a co-worker of Décio, who lives with his paralyzed mother and Sônia, his adoptive sister. Sônia, who is engaged to Décio, is attracted to Marcos and although he is initially unaware of her feelings, he eventually acknowledges that he has fallen in love with her. After discovering that Marcos has seduced Sônia, Décio swears to kill him, but a fight culminates in Décio's death instead. At the end of the film, Marcos and Sônia get married.|$|E

5|$|The American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) funded Drinker to {{investigate}} the 1948 Donora smog, as the company {{had an interest in}} showing that its primary pollutants (sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide) had not significantly contributed to the damage it <b>caused.</b> <b>In</b> the middle of 1953, Amdur and her husband developed a method of spraying a combination mist of sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide into humid chambers containing guinea pigs {{to investigate}} the damage that it would cause to their lungs. Guinea pigs were used as they breathe more deeply through their mouths than smaller rodents which breathe through their noses. The Amdurs bought their own guinea pigs for the mini project, and spent a holiday weekend doing the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The School of Law's inaugural class began {{classes on}} August 16, 2006.
