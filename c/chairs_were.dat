5|$|In {{the late}} 1760s in Paris the first Parisian neoclassical <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> made, {{even before the}} {{accession}} of Louis XVI, whose name {{is attached to the}} first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sené and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} to New York {{to perform the}} first seven episodes, the four men decided to broadcast from Los Angeles instead. NBC {{did not have a}} studio on the West Coast, so for the next thirteen weeks, between January 16 and April 24, 1933, the show was transmitted from a borrowed empty soundstage at RKO Radio Pictures. Folding <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> brought in for the audience of around thirty or forty people – coming from vaudeville, Groucho and Chico preferred to perform to a crowd – and were quickly cleared {{out at the end of}} each performance so that the stage would be ready for any filming the following day. The last four episodes of the show were performed back at WJZ in New York.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, 1928, the Day of Atonement, British police {{resorted to}} {{removing}} by force a screen used to separate {{men and women}} at prayer. Women who tried to prevent the screen being dismantled were beaten by the police, who used pieces of the broken wooden frame as clubs. <b>Chairs</b> <b>were</b> then pulled out from under elderly worshipers. The episode made international news and Jews the world over objected to the British action. Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, the Chief Rabbi of the ultraorthodox Jews in Jerusalem, issued a protest letter {{on behalf of his}} community, the Edah HaChareidis, and Agudas Yisroel strongly condemning the desecration of the holy site. Various communal leaders called for a general strike. A large rally was held in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, following which an angry crowd attacked the local police station in which they believed Douglas Valder Duff, the British officer involved, was sheltering.|$|E

5|$|Rhys built {{a number}} of stone castles, {{starting}} with Cardigan castle, which was the earliest recorded native-built stone castle in Wales. He also built Carreg Cennen castle near Llandeilo, a castle set in a spectacular position on a mountain top. He held a festival of poetry and song at his court at Cardigan over Christmas 1176. This is generally regarded as the first recorded Eisteddfod. The festival was announced a year in advance throughout Wales and in England, Scotland, Ireland and possibly France. Two <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> awarded as prizes, one for the best poem {{and the other for}} the best musical performance. J. E. Caerwyn Williams suggests that this event may be an adaptation of the similar French puys. R.R. Davies suggests that the texts of Welsh law, traditionally codified by Hywel Dda at Whitland, were first assembled in book form under the aegis of Rhys.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} indeed {{the golden age of}} the chair, {{especially}} in France and England (including Colonial America), between which there was considerable give and take of ideas. Even Diderot could not refrain from writing of them in his Encyclopédie. The typical Louis Seize chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with Boucher or Watteau-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} colonial times, sedan <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> the only form of public conveyance. Public <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> licensed, and charged {{according}} to tariffs {{which would be}} prominently displayed. Chair stands were found at all hotels, wharves, and major crossroads, and the sturdy chair bearers would clamour for regular patronage.|$|E
50|$|The Garden Egg <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Peter Ghyczy in 1968. It was manufactured by Reuter Products. The <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> designed for both {{indoor and outdoor}} use, although as a design icon and collectable it is rarely used outdoors. The chair lid lifts and closes, and when closed is theoretically waterproof. The Egg <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> re-introduced in 2001 by Ghyczy Novo. The Garden Egg <b>Chair</b> <b>is</b> known by several names; “seftenberger ei, pod chair, l’œuf en garden(egg)chair.” Elastogran/Reuter produced the plastic polyurethane. Ghyczy's job was to start a design centre {{in order to show}} industrial customers polyurethane's potential. The Garden Egg <b>Chair</b> <b>is</b> one of the first chairs made with polyurethane. For a long time, the <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> produced by the East German company VEB-Synthese-Werk, but since 1998, it has been produced in the Netherlands.|$|R

25|$|As {{the formal}} {{home of the}} Russian Tsars, the palace was the setting for profuse, {{frequent}} and lavish entertaining. The dining table could seat 1000 guests, while the state rooms could contain up to 10,000 people—all standing, as no <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> provided. These rooms, halls and galleries were heated to such a temperature that while it was sub-zero outside, exotic plants bloomed within, while the brilliant lighting gave the ambiance of a summer's day.|$|E
25|$|A Windsor {{chair is}} a chair built {{with a solid}} wooden seat into which the chair-back and legs are round-tenoned, or pushed into drilled holes, in {{contrast}} to standard chairs, where the back legs and the uprights of the back are continuous. The seats of Windsor <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> often carved into a shallow dish or saddle shape for comfort. Traditionally, the legs and uprights were usually turned on a pole lathe. The back and sometimes the arm pieces (if arms are present) are formed from steam bent pieces of wood.|$|E
25|$|In a 30-week {{clinical}} trial at the Hospital del Cobre ("Copper Hospital"), extensive microbial analyses were implemented at the facility's {{intensive care unit}} (ICU). Nine hundred ninety copper surfaces from 90 rooms containing 6 different copper objects were studied against an equivalent number of rooms and surfaces containing non-copper objects. Over-the-bed tables were made from copper alloy C70600. Bedrails were clad with copper alloy C11000 foils. Visitor <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> fitted with copper alloy C70600 armrests. Copper alloy C71000 intravenous poles were provided. Writing pens used to input data on a touch screen were made from brass (70% Cu, 30% Zn).|$|E

50|$|Four to five <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> {{arranged}} in an inner circle. This is the fishbowl. The remaining <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> {{arranged in}} concentric circles outside the fishbowl. A few participants are selected {{to fill the}} fishbowl, {{while the rest of}} the group sit on the chairs outside the fishbowl. In an open fishbowl, one <b>chair</b> <b>is</b> left empty. In a closed fishbowl, all <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> filled. The moderator introduces the topic and the participants start discussing the topic. The audience outside the fishbowl listen in on the discussion.|$|R
25|$|The Bernard C. Richardson Zone {{was added}} in 1999 {{at a cost}} of $32.9 million raising the {{capacity}} to 82,600. For high-demand games, temporary bleachers were installed in the south end zone and folding <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> placed on the sidelines. In the fall of 2003, the Bright Football Complex was completed on {{the south end of the}} stadium. The facility (named for its principal donor, former Dallas Cowboys owner Bum Bright) includes a players' lounge overlooking Kyle Field, dressing rooms, one of the largest training and rehabilitation facilities in the country, and a state-of-the-art academic center.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, she hired William Lawrence Bottomley {{to create a}} unique {{addition}} known as the Finger Bowl, an outdoor dining area consisting of a raised pool surrounded by a flat ledge. <b>Chairs</b> <b>were</b> {{pulled up to the}} ledge and food was served from bowls floating on the water. It was sheltered by a wisteria-covered arbor supported by 12 stone piers. In the late 1930s, Gifford Pinchot started the White Pine Plantation to reforest some old farmland near the mansion. He was particularly interested in that species since it was the dominant tree in the forests of Pike County and had been heavily harvested during the previous century.|$|E
25|$|Purcell and Elmslie {{designed}} select {{pieces of}} furniture for the house, including a small, triangular-backed chair, dubbed a “surprise point” chair by William Purcell, for use in Edna’s writing nook. Several noteworthy built-in furnishings include a combined bench and radiator cover beneath the front living room windows; a desk in the writing nook; and a combined bed, writing desk, bookcase, and storage area in the children’s room, which Purcell designed after the Pullman-style bed of a train’s sleeping car. Purcell brought furniture from his previous home {{for use in the}} dining space, and folding <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> stored in the dining area for impromptu visitors.|$|E

25|$|The one serious {{instance}} of crowd trouble {{at the ground}} happened in the final session of the fourth day of the Test match between India and Australia in 1969. With India in desperate trouble in the second innings, Ajit Wadekar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan {{were involved in a}} partnership of 25 for the eighth wicket when the latter was declared out caught behind off the bowling of Alan Connolly. The decision was criticised by the radio commentators, and as Venkat left the wicket after some hesitation, trouble broke out in the East Stand. Bottles were thrown on the ground and <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> burned while the awnings were set on fire in the North stand. Play continued for an hour in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Academy Schools was {{the first}} {{institution}} to provide professional training for artists in Britain. The Schools' programme of formal training was modelled on that of the French Académie de peinture et de sculpture, founded by Louis XIV in 1648. It was shaped by the precepts laid down by Sir Joshua Reynolds. In his fifteen Discourses delivered to pupils in the Schools between 1769 and 1790, Reynolds {{stressed the importance of}} copying the Old Masters, and of drawing from casts after the Antique and from the life model. He argued that such a training would form artists capable of creating works of high moral and artistic worth. Professorial <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> founded in Chemistry, Anatomy, Ancient History and Ancient Literature, the latter two being held initially by Samuel Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chairs</b> <b>were</b> in {{existence}} {{since at least}} the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt. They were covered with cloth or leather, were made of carved wood, and were much lower than today’s chairs – chair seats were sometimes only 25cm high. In ancient Egypt chairs appear to have been of great richness and splendor. Fashioned of ebony and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood, they were covered with costly materials, magnificent patterns and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives. Generally speaking, the higher ranked an individual was, the taller and more sumptuous was the chair he sat on and the greater the honor. On state occasions the pharaoh sat on a throne, often with a little footstool in front of it.|$|E
