2500|$|Parathion is a <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> It {{generally}} {{disrupts the}} nervous system by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. It is absorbed via skin, mucous membranes, and orally. Absorbed parathion is rapidly metabolized to paraoxon, as described in Insecticidal activity. Paraoxon exposure can result in headaches, convulsions, poor vision, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, unconsciousness, tremor, dyspnea, and finally lung-edema as well as respiratory arrest. [...] Symptoms of poisoning are known to last for extended periods, sometimes months. The most common and very specific antidote is atropine, in doses of up to 100mg daily. Because atropine may also be toxic, {{it is recommended that}} small frequently repeated doses be used in treatment. If human poisoning is detected early and the treatment is prompt (atropine and artificial respiration), fatalities are infrequent. Insufficient oxygen will lead to cerebral hypoxia and permanent brain damage. [...] Peripheral neuropathy including paralysis is noticed as late sequelae after recovery from acute intoxication. Parathion and related organophosphorus pesticides are used in hundreds of thousands of poisonings annually, especially suicides. It is known as [...] "Schwiegermuttergift" [...] (mother-in-law poison) in Germany. For this reason, most formulations contain a blue dye providing warning.|$|E

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials comparing <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and placebo was performed. The effect of covariates on study outcomes was analysed by means of meta-regression using a Bayesian framework. Results: Forty-three randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 16106 patients were included. All-cause discontinuation was higher with <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (OR = 1. 66), as was discontinuation due to adverse events (OR= 1. 75). <b>Cholinesterase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> improved cognitive function (standardized mean difference = 0. 38), global symptomatology (standardized mean difference= 0. 28) and functional capacity (standardized mean difference= 0. 16) but not neuropsychiatric symptoms. Rivastigmine was associated with a poorer outcome on all-cause discontinuation (Diff OR = 1. 66) and donepezil with a higher efficacy on global change (Diff standardized mean difference = 0. 41). The proportion of patients with serious adverse events decreased with age (Diff OR = - 0. 09). Mortality was lower with <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> than with placebo (OR = 0. 65). Conclusion: While <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> show a poor risk-benefit relationship as indicated by mild symptom improvement and a higher than placebo all-cause discontinuation, a reduction of mortality was suggested.

40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} {{literature}} {{relating to the}} use of acetyl <b>cholinesterase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).

Results: Three controlled trials and seven open studies were identified. Efficacy was assessed in three key domains: cognitive, neuropsychiatric and parkinsonian symptoms. Conclusion: <b>Cholinesterase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have a moderate effect against cognitive symptoms. There is no clear evidence of a noticeable clinical effect against neuropsychiatric symptoms.
