25|$|The {{false scad}} is of major {{importance}} to commercial fisheries throughout its range, with fisheries off Morocco, Senegal {{and in the}} Mediterranean taking the highest numbers of fish. They are fished for primarily with trawls, purse seines and gill nets; although juveniles occasionally turn up inshore nets such as beach seines. The species {{is part of a}} number of fish that live a similar semi-pelagic lifestyle that make up what {{is often referred to as}} a 'small pelagics fishery'. Some of these are the similar Trachurus species, and due to these also being present in the catch, Caranx rhonchus is often not differentiated, leading to lower than accurate <b>catch</b> <b>statistics.</b> Furthermore, vendors are known to fraudulently market C. rhonchus as 'horse mackerel', which is strictly applied to members of Trachurus. To counter this, there has been research into determining fish species later in the marketing process by means of DNA analysis, a technique which has yielded strong results. FAO <b>catch</b> <b>statistics</b> indicate a current annual catch of between 1500 and 3700 tonnes per year from both Africa and Europe between 2002 and 2007. Older catch data indicates much more was taken between 1979 and 1992, with these years having catches between 4000 and 19000 tonnes. The species is sold fresh, frozen, smoked, salted, dried and is used for fish meal and oil.|$|E

Separate <b>catch</b> <b>statistics</b> are not kept for the species, as it is often not distinguished from other trevallies. The blugder is also of some interest to anglers, although the level of interest differs between countries. In South Africa it is considered a good catch by boat anglers and spearfishermen and is generally regarded as high quality table fare. In Australia it is still considered a good gamefish, but of a lower caliber than related species such as giant and bluefin trevally, and {{is regarded as a}} poor table fish. Its soft, oily flesh is often used for bait when reef fishing. It may be caught using small baits or lures.|$|E
25|$|The {{threadfin}} jack is of some {{importance to}} fisheries throughout its range, although individual <b>catch</b> <b>statistics</b> for the species are not kept. It is often caught by hook-and-line methods or by gill nets and various artisanal traps. It {{is considered to}} be good to excellent table fare, and is marketed both fresh and salted. The species has also been found at a number of archaeological sites in both Panama and Ecuador, indicating it has been caught by humans for food for at least 3450 years. The threadfin jack is also of interest to anglers who catch the species occasionally, and is considered a minor gamefish. Juveniles are occasionally caught from shore, such as piers and breakwaters, while larger individuals are caught over deeper reefs. The species takes a variety of bait, including fish and prawns, but they also take lures, including hard and small, fly-like Sabiki lures.|$|E

25|$|The {{bar jack}} is of minor to {{intermediate}} importance to fisheries through its range; both commercially and to recreational fishermen. Archaeological evidence from San Salvador Island in the Bahamas demonstrates this species {{has long been}} targeted by humans for food, with the native Indians of the region often taking the bar jack for consumption, although it was of lesser importance than reef fishes such as parrotfishes and groupers. Modern fisheries take considerable quantities of the fish, but it rarely makes {{up the bulk of}} the catch. <b>Catch</b> <b>statistics</b> are not available for most countries. The United States reports only a small catch of between 0 and 15 tonnes per year, but with the abundance of the species in the Caribbean, larger catches are made here. The bar jack is somewhat shy of baited hooks and is therefore taken predominantly by trawls and seines. It is marketed fresh in the Antilles and Bahamas, with its edibility rated fair to very good.|$|E
25|$|The yellowspotted {{trevally}} is {{of moderate}} importance to fisheries throughout its range, so <b>catch</b> <b>statistics</b> are rarely kept for this species specifically. One exception is Saudi Arabia, with the FAO reporting a yearly catch between 128 and 324 tonnes between 2000 and 2004, {{with no apparent}} trends in the catch data. The species is taken by hook and line, gill nets, and various traps. The yellowspotted trevally is of major importance to anglers and spearfishermen in some countries, with the species highly valued in Australia and South Africa. Surveys of recreational catches in the Pilbara region of Western Australia indicate around 5 tonnes of fish are taken every year, with around 3 tonnes kept for consumption or use as bait. Fish are mostly caught from boats using small baits including fish and crab, as well as lures, minnows, metal slugs, soft plastic lures, and even saltwater flies. It is an excellent gamefish, with young fish also considered good table fish, becoming somewhat dry with age. The yellowspotted trevally is also considered {{a good candidate for}} aquaculture in the future.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of sillaginids have large enough populations to allow an entire fishery to be based around them, with King George whiting, {{northern}} whiting, Japanese whiting, sand whiting and school whiting the major species. There have been no reliable estimates of catches for the entire family, as <b>catch</b> <b>statistics</b> generally include only those species taken in large numbers, {{but there are some}} species which make up significant numbers of the bycatch. To add to this problem, many of the lesser known species are taken by subsistence fisheries and not reported. From estimates by the FAO, however, it is evident that the family {{is one of the most}} important in the Indo-Pacific region, having an estimated catch of 22 718 tonnes in 1990 alone. In this same report, it was shown that the greatest three utilizers of sillaginids were the Philippines, Western Australia and Thailand respectively. The records also suggested that the catch increased from 1983 when it was 17 570 t, up to the last estimate in 1990 of 22 718 t. No such estimates have been carried out since. Modern records for Australia show that this trend has reversed, with all catches from Australia totaling 4 372 t in 2006 compared with 1990's 6000 t haul. Statistics from other countries are unavailable for such comparison.|$|E

25|$|The giant {{trevally}} is of high {{importance to}} modern fisheries throughout its range, although quantifying the amounts taken {{is very difficult}} {{due to the lack}} of fishery statistics kept in most of these countries. Hawaii has the best-kept statistics, where the 1998 catch consisted of 10,194 pounds of giant trevally worth around US$12,000. Historically, the species has been taken in far greater numbers, and has been an important food, market and game fish since the early 1900s. However, their exploitation has seen the landings of the species decrease by over 84% since the turn of the century, declining from 725,000lb to 10,000lb in recent <b>catches.</b> FAO <b>statistics</b> of the Asian region record catches between 4,000 and 10,000 tonnes between 1997 and 2007, although this excludes most fisheries which are not monitored or do not discriminate between trevally species. The giant trevally is commercially caught by a number of methods, including hook and line, handlines, gill nets and other types of artisanal traps. The species has also successfully been bred for aquaculture purposes in Taiwan. It is sold at market fresh, frozen, salted, and smoked, and as fishmeal and oil.|$|R
25|$|The {{crevalle jack}} {{is a highly}} {{important}} species to commercial fisheries throughout its range, with the greatest quantity of the species taken from the eastern Atlantic. In some fisheries, {{it is one of}} the most abundant species and therefore of great importance in these regions. In the Americas, the reported annual catch has ranged between 150 and 1300 tonnes since 1950, with catches since 2000 ranging between 190 and 380 tonnes. Most of the western Atlantic catch is from Florida, although Caribbean fisheries, such as Trinidad, take considerable quantities of the fish. The eastern Atlantic <b>catch</b> <b>statistics</b> do not differentiate longfin crevalle jack from crevalle jack, thus must be considered a composite dataset. This region only comprises catch data from Angola, Ghana, São Tome, and Principe. These catches are much larger than in the east, with hauls of between 1000 and 38 000 tonnes per year recorded since 1950, although catches since 2000 only range between 1900 and 10 200 tonnes. Crevalle jack is taken by a number of fishing methods, including haul seines, gill nets, purse seines, trawls, handlines and trolling lines. The abundance of the species in Trinidad leads to the fish being taken in several quite different types of fishery; demersal trawls, artisanal gill nets and even beach seines, which illustrates the species' importance. In Trinidad, recreational fishermen also may sell their catch, which adds to the overall quantity of fish sold. Crevalle jack is sold at market fresh, frozen, salted, and smoked, and as fishmeal and oil.|$|E
25|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} is {{an important}} species to both commercial fisheries and anglers, with {{the popularity of the}} fish leading to extensive aquaculture trials. The <b>catch</b> <b>statistics</b> for the bluefin trevally are poorly reported in most of its range, with only parts of the western Indian Ocean supplying information to the FAO. In this region, catch levels have fluctuated between 2 and 50 tonnes in the past decade. Hawaii also keeps catch records, with these showing the species is taken in far less numbers than the giant trevally, with only 704 pounds taken compared to 10 149lbs of giant trevally in 1998. In Hawaii, the nearshore stocks of the species have been in decline since the early 1900s, with commercial landings dropping over 300% from 1990 to 1991, and have not recovered. Most bluefin trevally sold in Hawaii are now imported from other Indo-Pacific nations. The species is taken by a variety of netting and trapping methods, as well and by hook and line in commercial fisheries. It is usually sold fresh, as well as frozen or salted. The rapid decline in the population has seen a focus on breeding the bluefin trevally in captivity. The species' aquaculture potential was first investigated in a 1975 experiment in French Polynesia, where juveniles of the species were caught in the wild and transported back to a laboratory. The study found the fish grew to a commercial size of 300 g in 6 to 8 months and only suffered a 5% mortality rate. It was concluded that such a technique carried out on a larger scale in lagoons would be promising due to the growth rate and relatively high price commanded by the species at market. Further investigations into the potential for offshore aquaculture were conducted in Hawaii, where the species successfully spawned in captivity. The only barrier in these studies to successful production was problems with commercial food items. An in vitro cell culture has recently been established for the species, which will allow long term management of potential viral diseases that may arise during aquaculture of the fish.|$|E

In 1543, whalemen from Lekeitio injured a whale, but it was captured by the men of Mutriku, resulting in the whale being divided between the two towns. The same year a mother-calf pair were caught. On 24 February 1546, a whale was reportedly killed in front of St. Nicholas Island. In 1611, two small whales {{were killed by the}} men of Lekeitio and Ondarroa, which resulted in a lawsuit.

Developments, challenges and advances in the methods for obtaining life history data for these species were discussed at a workshop in May 2015. The key points raised included nascent methods for otolith sectioning and interpretation, the need for standardised international ageing protocols and the issues and challenges in characterising reproductive maturation, including during non-spawning months due to resource limitations.

25|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} is an {{important}} species for commercial and subsistence fisheries throughout its range. Between 1990 and 2010 the FAO reported worldwide catch has ranged between 113,000 and 195,000 t, with a consistent trend towards higher <b>catches.</b> These <b>statistics</b> only include Indonesia, Malaysia and the UAE, suggesting true catch sizes to be higher. Of the countries that report catches to the FAO, Indonesia takes the highest amount, with between 129,000 t and 180,000 t reported each year between 2000 and 2010. Locally yellowstripe scad make up {{a high percentage of}} the catch; in an Indian example, it accounted for up to 36% of total landings in one survey. However, in India overall, yellowstripe scad makes up only 1.5% of total carangid catches. The species is predominantly taken in trawls, however is also caught by gill net, bag net, purse seines or ring nets, and push nets. The species is most abundant during spawning periods in India and consists of 8–13cm individuals. A study on the population dynamics in an Indian fishery during 1994 found there was low fishing pressure on the stocks, however a later assessment found stocks elsewhere in India to be overexploited. The novel use of hydroacoustic sounding to estimate the school size of yellowstripe scad, as well as other scad species, has been trialled with varying levels of effectiveness.|$|R

2500|$|The giant {{trevally}} is an [...] apex predator {{in most of}} its habitats, and {{is known}} to hunt individually and in schools. The species predominantly takes various fish as prey, although crustaceans, cephalopods and molluscs make up a considerable part of their diets in some regions. The species has some quite novel hunting strategies, including shadowing monk seals to pick off escaping prey, as well as using sharks to ambush prey. The species reproduces in the warmer months, with peaks differing by region. Spawning occurs at specific stages of the lunar cycle, when large schools congregate to spawn over reefs and bays, with reproductive behaviour observed in the wild. The fish grows relatively fast, reaching sexual maturity at a length of around 60cm at three years of age. The giant trevally is both an important species to commercial fisheries and a recognised gamefish, with the species taken by nets and lines by professionals and by bait and lures by anglers. <b>Catch</b> <b>statistics</b> in the Asian region show hauls of 4,000–10,000 tonnes, while around 10,000 lbs of the species is taken in Hawaii each year.
