Some IPTV services are currently available in London, while services operated in Hull ceased in April 2006. As the speed and availability of broadband connections increase, more television content can be delivered using protocols such as IPTV. However, its impact on the market is yet to be measured, as is <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude</b> toward watching television programs on personal computers instead of television sets. At the end of 2006, BT (the UK's former state owned monopoly phone company) started offering BT TV, which combines the digital free-to-air standard Freeview through an aerial, and on-demand IPTV, delivered over a BT Broadband connection through the television set-top box (BT has chosen to deploy Microsoft's Mediaroom platform for this).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{studies have}} found {{significant}} differences in <b>consumer</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward marketing between countries and attributed such variations to differences in the stage of consumerism development and cultural values. This study aims to test these competing hypotheses using econometric decomposition to identify the source of such cross-country variations. Design/methodology/approach: Using survey data of <b>consumer</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward marketing from China and Canada, this study adopts econometric decomposition to examine the cross-country difference in <b>consumer</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward marketing. Findings: The results show that Chinese consumers have {{more positive attitudes toward}} marketing than Canadians and the two countries differ significantly across all predictor variables. However, the results of decomposition suggest that consumerism, individualism and relativism do not have any significant effect on the country gap in <b>consumer</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward marketing, while idealism has a significant coefficient effect. Research limitations/implications: The study finds different effects of cultural values on <b>consumer</b> <b>attitudes</b> across countries and has meaningful implications for international marketing strategies.

Most, if not all, {{of these types of}} advertising campaigns utilize inoculation to create the messages. Burgoon et al. (1995) posited that the use of inoculation strategies for these types of campaigns should be utilized to enhance the corporations’ credibility and aide in maintaining the existing <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude.</b> This strategy should not be used to change consumer attitudes. Based on the analysis of previous research Burgoon et al. concluded issue/advocacy advertising is most effective for reinforcing support and avoid potential slippage in the attitudes of supporters. Based on previous publications they looked to test three hypotheses. The first was that issue/advocacy advertisements work to inoculate against counterattitudinal attacks. Next, issue/advocacy advertisements work to protect the source credibility. Lastly, conservatives {{are more likely to be}} inoculated by issue/advocacy messages.

5000|$|In the past, <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude</b> towards food {{technologies}} was {{not common}} talk {{and was not}} important in food development. Nowadays the food chain is long and complicated, foods and food technologies are diverse; consequently the consumers are uncertain about the food quality and safety and {{find it difficult to}} orient themselves to the subject. That is why consumer acceptance of food technologies is an important question. However, in these days acceptance of food products very often depends on potential benefits and risks associated with the food. This also includes the technology the food is processed with. Attributes like “uncertain”, “unknown” or “unfamiliar” are associated with consumers’ risk perception and consumer very likely will reject products linked to these attributes. Especially innovative food processing technologies are connected to these characteristics and are perceived as risky by consumers [...] Acceptance of the different food technologies is very different. Whereas pasteurisation is well recognised, high pressure treatment or even microwaves are perceived as risky very often. In studies done within Hightech Europe project, it was found that traditional technologies were well accepted in contrast to innovative technologies.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, Philips Lighting {{paved the}} way for a more energy {{efficient}} and environmental friendly technology in the lighting sector by inventing the compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL). Although the newly introduced light bulb had a longer lifetime, was more energy efficient and reduced the heat emissions to a minimum, it was not welcome in the market. Due to its higher acquisition price, inconvenient shape and dissatisfying functionality, the penetration rate of CFL bulbs into the lighting market stayed low (<0,1 CFL/American household) until the mid-90s. Not even the introduction of the award winning “Earth Light” changed the <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude</b> towards the environmentally friendly CFL bulb. A market survey exposed the major problems: very high acquisition price (10,80 € in comparison to 0,55 € for incandescent light bulbs) and confusion among the customers about the functionality and lifetime expectancy of CFL bulbs. Following these problems, in 2000 Philips introduced a new brand of long-lasting and energy efficient products, called “Marathon” which promised up to 25% of energy saving during its whole lifetime (5-7 yrs). The “Marathon” series provided a range of long-lasting and energy-efficient light bulbs, all labeled by the Energy Star and suitable for many locations and different demands of the customer.|$|E

50|$|Related to consumers' {{attitudes toward}} a brand or even toward the {{marketing}} communication, different online and social media statistics, including {{the number of}} likes and shares within a social network, can be used. The number of reviews for a certain brand or product and the quality assessed by users are indicators of attitudes. Classical measures of <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude</b> toward the brand can be gathered through surveys of consumers.Behavioral measures are very important because changes in consumers' behavior and buying decisions are what marketers hope to see through viral campaigns. There are numerous indicators {{that can be used}} in this context as a function of marketers' objectives. Some of them include the most known online and social media statistics such as number and quality of shares, views, product reviews, and comments. Consumers' brand engagement can be measured through the K-factor, the number of followers, friends, registered users, and time spent on the website. Indicators that are more bottom-line oriented focus on consumers' actions after acknowledging the marketing content, including the number of requests for information, samples, or test-drives. Nevertheless, responses to actual call-to-action messages are important, including the conversion rate.Consumers' behavior is expected to lead to contributions to the bottom line of the company, meaning increase in sales, both in quantity and financial amount. However, when quantifying changes in sales, managers need to consider other factors that could potentially affect sales besides the viral marketing activities. Besides positive effects on sales, the use of viral marketing is expected to bring significant reductions in marketing costs and expenses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Both at {{home and}} abroad {{concerns}} about genetically modified foods have disrupted food markets and raised a number of problems for international trade. This paper addresses the issue of labeling foods produced using genetically modified ingredients from an economic perspective. The wide range of <b>consumer</b> <b>attitudes</b> with respect to food safety and genetically modified foods highlights the need for research into how <b>consumer</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward food are established. <b>Consumer</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward genetically modified foods span the distance from profound fear to unflinching acceptance- a divergence in attitudes that can not be explained by variations in preferences. The debate generated by genetically modified foods also focuses attention on how <b>consumer</b> <b>attitudes</b> influence agricultural and food markets. In the case of genetically modified foods, a seemingly small demand for non-genetically modified foods has triggered a number of market changes. For example, a number of food manufacturers have begun to market non-genetically modified food products, and a number of elevators and processors have begun to segregate genetically modified varieties of corn and soybeans from conventional varieties. We present a simple economic model showing how introduction of labeling for genetically modified foods can affect food markets, and the role that social preferences and attitudes in place at the time labeling is introduced can influence the outcome of labeling policies. We examine how <b>consumer</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward food are established and how <b>consumer</b> <b>attitudes</b> influence market structure. The implications of labeling for international trade in food products is also discussed. 1...|$|R

Further, this paper measures the impact of price fairness on <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude</b> and comparative study of understanding the same in metro and non metro customers. Since, Metro and non-metro customers are different in their consumer behaviour in many ways. Linear regression and z-test was used to measure the impact of these attributes on <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude</b> and difference in metro and non-metro customers respectively. Paper identifies nine different antecedents of price fairness through extensive review of literature and then develops a simple model to understand price fairness easily. Furthermore, the degree of price fairness in formation of positive <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude</b> is high in non metro as compare to the metro city. Regression result between <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude</b> and price fairness clearly explain that the higher level of understanding towards price fairness provide higher level of positive <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude</b> among customers of both the metro and non-metro city.

40|$|Orientation: The {{study focused}} on the {{application}} of a model of consumer ethnocentrism in Zimbabwe, a developing country. Research purpose: The study sought to determine the effect of consumer ethnocentrism on <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude,</b> to determine the effect of <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude</b> on purchase intention and to establish the moderating effects of gender, age, education, income, ethnic grouping and city of residence on the effect of consumer ethnocentrism on <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude.</b> Motivation for the study: Research on consumer ethnocentrism in developing countries is still in its infancy. There is a need to conduct more research on consumer ethnocentrism in developing countries in order to enhance an understanding of this important construct in international marketing. Research design, approach and method: The study uses a cross section of 289 consumers from Harare and Bulawayo, the two largest cities in Zimbabwe. Structural equation modeling and moderated regression analysis were conducted to test the research hypotheses. Main findings: The study found that consumer ethnocentrism has a negative effect on <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude,</b> and <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude</b> has a positive effect on purchase intention. None of the demographic variables was found to significantly moderate the effect of consumer ethnocentrism on <b>consumer</b> <b>attitude.</b> Practical and managerial implications: Marketers who intend to expand into developing markets such as Zimbabwe are advised to consider consumer ethnocentrism and attitudes towards foreign poultry products. Firms targeting foreign markets where consumers are ethnocentric, such as in Zimbabwe, are advised to set up manufacturing facilities in such countries instead of exporting.
