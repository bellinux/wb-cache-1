AMY 1 copy number, salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) activity, and total sAA and glycosylated sAA contents were determined, and their correlations were analyzed. ResultsAlthough splenic asthenia and healthy children had no differences in AMY 1 copy number, splenic asthenia children had positive correlations between AMY 1 copy number and sAA activity before or after citric acid stimulation.

40|$|In view of {{the actual}} status of coastal dune {{fixation}} in our country, the present paper mainly reports the basic research result through wind tunnel experiment {{for the purpose of}} aiming at rational blown sand control. First of all, the actual status of blown sand damage and its prevention works is introduced, and it is pointed out that to illucidate the blown sand phenomenon in sandy plain mainly such as artificial sand dune and also the interrelation of said phenomenon with water content of sand surface layer is of utmost importance for blown sand control. Secondly, as establishment of measuring method is essential in experimental illudiation of these subjects, the measuring device of water content of sand surface layer utilizing light reflection and the device counting the number of blown sand using laser were trially produced to make clear the characteristics and the range of application. In dealing with the blown sand phenomenon, the sand movement in dune sand of wind dry condition as its base and also the relation of the threshold velocity of blown sand with the grain diameter distribution of sand dune are considered to be unclear in the conventional researches, and therefore the blown sand quantity formula in consideration of the grain diameter of sand dune was determined through demensional analysis and wind tunnel experiment. From this formula the writer could present the method of objectively judging the blown sand limit, ascertain its effectiveness, thereby making clear the interrelation between the grain diameter of dune sand and the blown sand limit. Furthermore, from on-the-spot survey and analysis of the relation of geographical features mainly in artificial sand dune with grain diameter distribution, and also from the wind tunnel experiment between errosion and grain diameter change, it was made clear that wind erosion and coarseness of grain diameter of dune sand are conspicuous in the land behind high artificial sand dune and that the land just behind artificial sand dune becomes the starting point of new blown sand toward internal land. As both the sand movement of size-group and the threshold shear velocity of size-group, which are the cause of coarseness of grain diameter, have not been illucidated as to the subject of blown sand, the dimensionless equation for it has been looked for and obtained. In order to clarify the influcence of water content of sand surface layer on the blown sand quantity and the threshold velocity of blown sand regarding the blown sand in the moistured sand surface condition, the influence of water <b>content</b> <b>ratio</b> was grasped as the change of coefficients respectively of the blown sand quantity equation in wind dry condition and of the dimensionless equation in threshold shear velocity, and its relation with water <b>content</b> <b>ratio</b> was obtained through experiments. The influcence of water <b>content</b> <b>ratio</b> on vertical distribution of blown sand was also expressed by the relation of dimensionless coefficient with water <b>content</b> <b>ratio,</b> thereby making it clear that the blown sand quantity, while being uniformed in vertical direction, takes a special reduction configuration in inverse proportion to the increment of water <b>content</b> <b>ratio,</b> which attributes mainly to the saltation of blown sand. The relation of water <b>content</b> <b>ratio</b> with grain diameter of blown sand was clarified by an index called the blown sand ratio of size-group in which both the median diameter of blown sand and the standard deviation tend to get bigger in proportion to water <b>content</b> <b>ratio,</b> and also the sand of larger size-group tends to occupy a large portion of sand composition. Based on the aforementioned respective results, it was discussed as its conclusion that contriving 2 ̆ 2 uniformity of grain diameter and surface uniformity of geographical features 2 ̆ 2 is effective as a conceptive guidance relating to the blown sand control...|$|E

That is, the more spherical the configuration of fine aggregate was, the lower the extruding pressure was, but the higher the velocity was.

In current study, the main target was to evaluate some neglected aspects of Fenton process in operational applications. Thus, three novel responses were introduced. Mass removal efficiency evaluates overall recalcitrant destruction by establishing organics mass balance pre- and post-Fenton treatment. This differentiates it from conventional chemical oxygen demand removal, since mass removal efficiency basically considers the whole mixture and not only the supernatant. The mass <b>content</b> <b>ratio</b> response provides a measure to evaluate the remaining organics in the sludge. Therefore, a borderline mode considering these limitations leads to best feasible field operations. It was found that mass <b>content</b> <b>ratio</b> for effluent reacted conversely to the sludge in response to coagulation. By increasing the coagulant dosage, coagulation improved and the sludge ratio increased in result. For the mass removal efficiency response, it seemed that appropriate balance of the oxidation/coagulation had considerable role through Fe 2 + dosage and [H 2 O 2]/[Fe 2 +] ratio. Finally, by including further conventional parameters such as sludge quantity, the best operational conditions (X 1 = 5. 7, X 2 = 16, X 3 = 207 mM) were optimized by response surface methodology to 27. 4 % and 14. 4 % for sludge and effluent mass <b>content</b> <b>ratio,</b> respectively, and 58. 1 % for mass removal efficiency.

Pork stomachs which were characterized by the highest water content (83. 3 %) and the lowest total protein (13. 3 %) and fat (2. 8 %) content in relation to the remaining raw meat materials had more distinct modifying effect on chemical and rheological characteristics of the examined products as compared to the addition of lean shoulder (A 1) and tendinous beef (A 3), the basic compositions of which are considerably less differentiated.

Nevertheless, indium is a scarce and expensive element and ITO films require high deposition temperature to achieve good electrical and optical properties. On the other hand, although not competing as ITO, doped Zinc Oxide (ZnO) is a promising and cheaper alternative. Therefore, our strategy has been to deposit ITO and ZnO multicomponent thin films at room temperature by radiofrequency (RF) magnetron co-sputtering in order to achieve TCOs with reduced indium content. Thin films of the quaternary system Zn-In-Sn-O (ZITO) with improved electrical and optical properties have been achieved. *Manuscript Click here to view linked References The samples were deposited by applying different RF powers to ZnO target while keeping a constant RF power to ITO target.
