The proposed solution is tailored for distributed power architectures, where the on-line efficiency measurement or estimation of each dc-dc converter is useful in order to perform a system power management and to monitor the status of each point of load (POL) converter. Existing solutions relay on the measurement of the input voltage and current, output voltage and current, the latter usually based on the output inductor <b>current</b> <b>sensing</b> (at least for buck-type converters).
