30|$|XRD {{patterns}} were generated from nonwoven fibrous mat using a Rigaku D/Max ULTIMA 11 X-ray diffractometer (Japan). The X-rays are {{generated by a}} cathode ray <b>tube</b> <b>filtered</b> to produce monochromatic radiation directed towards the sample. The interaction of the incident rays with the sample produces constructive interference (and diffracted rays). The diffracted intensity were recorded from 0 to 1400 at 2 θ angle and the pattern was recorded by Cu K radiation with 1.5418  Å and graphite monochromatic filtering wave at a tube voltage of 40  kV and tube current of 30  mA, and scanning {{in the region of}} 0 to 70 at 6  min− 1 with incident beam.|$|R
5000|$|Based on the {{shoulder}} boards used by the United States Navy, the United States Army and Air Force developed {{the shoulder}} mark, a <b>cloth</b> <b>tube</b> with embroidered or pinned rank insignia. Army officer shoulder marks are black with a 1/8-inch gold stripe below the embroidered grade insignia (the end far from the collar). In the Air Force, a similar stripe is limited to senior officers (majors and above). Air Force general officers have an additional stripe at the near end. Enlisted and Air Force junior officer shoulder marks lack these distinctions. These are worn on all class B uniform shirts. US Navy officers wear shoulder boards on Summer White and Service Dress White uniforms, and wool overcoats and reefers. [...] "Soft shoulder boards" [...] (shoulder marks) are worn on long sleeve white shirts and on black sweaters worn with Service Khaki or Service Dress Blue uniforms. Coast Guard officers wear Naval style shoulderboards on all class B uniform shirts.|$|R

40|$|Five video systems - {{potentially}} useful for airborne surveillance of oil spills - were developed, flight tested, and evaluated. The systems are: (1) conventional {{black and white}} TV, (2) conventional TV with false color, (3) differential TV, (4) prototype Lunar Surface TV, and (5) field sequential TV. Wavelength and polarization filtering were utilized in all systems. Greatly enhanced detection of oil spills, relative to that possible with the unaided eye, was achieved. The most practical video system is a conventional TV camera with silicon-diode-array image <b>tube,</b> <b>filtered</b> with a Corning 7 - 54 filter and a polarizer oriented with its principal axis in the horizontal direction. Best contrast between oil and water was achieved when winds and sea states were low. The minimum detectable oil film thickness was about 0. 1 micrometer...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} alumina filters with {{different}} pore surface areas, varying pore size distributions and mean pore diameters were impregnated by poly(ethylene imine) hyperbranched polymer functionalized with octyl aliphatic chains. Impregnation percentage was {{analogous to the}} hyperbranched polymer solution concentration and also depended on the filter pore surface areas. These observations permitted the manufacturing of filters with variable impregnation percentages. Implementation of two successive immersions of alumina into the polymer solution permitted much more uniform pore coating at the nanoscale as established by scanning electron microscopy. The property of these composite filters to encapsulate lipophilic polyaromatic organic pollutants dissolved in water via continuous filtration experiments has been examined and correlated to the structural characteristics of the filters, the polymer impregnation percentage and the overall impregnation procedure. These results allowed the optimization of the impregnation procedure affording hybrid <b>tube</b> <b>filters</b> that absorb 98 % of phenanthrene and 55 % of the far more water-soluble P-naphthol.

50|$|To smoke a {{buckskin}} it {{is folded}} {{in half and}} glued or sewn to form a bag with an opening on one end. A pant leg or other <b>cloth</b> <b>tube</b> {{is attached to the}} opening of the buckskin bag. The smoking fire can either be in a wood stove or a hole in the earth. Regardless of how the bed of coals is prepared, {{the other end of the}} pant leg is roughly sealed over the opening of the smoker. The buckskin bag is suspended above the smoker, and sticks can be placed inside of it to prevent the sides of the bag from touching each other. A handful of dry, rotten ("punky") wood is thrown on the coals, and begins smoldering. Care is taken to prevent the cloth from catching fire, as the hide can be burned in seconds. Ideally most or all of the smoke is forced through the buckskin. All holes must be sealed or taped to force the smoke through. The hide is smoked until the smoke color penetrates through to the other side, then the hide is turned inside out and it is smoked again until it reaches a desired color. Much care must be taken to ensure the fire is not burning, only smoldering, as flames or excessive heat will ruin the skin.|$|R
40|$|A simple, handy, reusable, and {{inexpensive}} water purification unit including a one-end sealed porous amorphous-silica (a-silica) tube coated with 2 [*]μm of porous TiO 2 photocatalyst layers has been developed.

40|$|The {{carcinogenic}} effect of UVA radiation (from Philips black light <b>tubes</b> <b>filtered</b> through a 2 mm-thick glass plate {{to eliminate the}} radiation below 320 nm) was studied in 7 groups of 25 lightly pigmented hairless mice. Irradiation with a moderate daily dose of combined UVB and UVA for 3 months induced a tumor incidence of 0. 22 after 58 weeks. When the combined UVB and UVA irradiation was followed by filtered UVA for 2, 4, or B months, the tumor incidence was marginally significantly increased to 0. 42, 0. 48, and 0. 50 (p 0. 1). UVA alone induced no tumors. It thus appears that in hairless mice initially exposed {{to a combination of}} UVB and UVA, subsequent continued irradiation with UVA increases tumor incidence. While only marginally statistically significant, tumor incidence in these animals seems to increase with duration and hence total UVA exposure. Furthermore, it is suggested that the photoaugmentative {{carcinogenic effect}} of UVA irradiation from unfiltered UVA bulbs can be reduced by attenuating the shorter wavelengths of the radiation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction As {{a result}} of the Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations and Tobacco Products Directive, all packs of {{cigarettes}} (factory-made and hand-rolled) in the United Kingdom must be drab brown, display pictorial warnings on the principal display areas, and contain no less than 20 cigarettes or 30 grams of tobacco. The legislation was phased in between May 2016 and May 2017. Our objective was to monitor pack, brand and product changes pre- and post-implementation.   Methods Our surveillance of the cigarette market involved a review of the trade press, a monthly monitor of online supermarkets, and regular visits to stores, from May 2015 to June 2017.   Results Pre-standardised packaging there were changes to the pack graphics (e. g. redesigned packs and limited-editions) and pack structure (e. g. re-sealable inner foil), and the issue of a number of re-usable tins. Post-standardised packaging, changes included newer cigarette pack sizes for some brand variants (e. g. 23 and 24 packs). Changes to the branding pre-standardised packaging included brand extensions, and post-standardised packaging included brand and/or variant name change, often with the inclusion of colour descriptors, and brand migrations. Product changes pre-standardised packaging included the introduction of novel filters (e. g. filters with two flavour-changing capsules, <b>tube</b> <b>filters,</b> firmer filters, and filters with granular additives). There was non-compliance with the legislation, with slim packs, which are not permitted, on sale after standardised packaging was implemented.   Conclusions Our findings highlight the need to monitor developments in markets introducing standardised packaging, and have policy implications for countries considering this measure...|$|R

30|$|To {{prepare the}} B. mori silk sericin (henceforward BMSS) solution, a {{published}} protocol (Nagura et al. 2001) was followed with some modifications. Cocoons (6  g) were cut into 1  cm[*]×[*] 1  cm pieces and washed with {{water in a}} 5 -L beaker with vigorous stirring for 30  min at room temperature. The washed material was transferred in a screw-capped bottle, with 80  mL water, and autoclaved at 121 °C for 30  min. The resulting solution was passed through a paper filter to retain the undissolved fibroin material, then aspirated in a syringe and injected into dialysis tubing (MWCO 12.4  kDa) that was pre-treated by soaking in water for 4  h and changing the water five times. The tube was then placed in a 2 -L beaker with hot water (80 °C) and dialysed with stirring for 4  h and three water exchanges. The final solution {{was removed from the}} <b>tube,</b> <b>filtered</b> through the 0.7 -μm Minisart® filter, and collected in a glass container that was kept at 80 °C (to prevent gelation) until use. The concentration of BMSS in the solutions resulting from various batches was between 1.12 % and 1.24 % (by gravimetric analysis).|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to determine anionic surfactants in river water using Teflon (PTFE) <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> preconcentration. PTFE adsorbs hydrophobic and electrically neutral chemical species on its surface. This allows the surface of PTFE <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> to adsorb and concentrate an ion pair formed between a cationic detecting agent and an anionic surfactant in aqueous solution. The detecting agent and the model anionic surfactant used were Co- 5 -Cl-PADAP, a highly sensitive detecting agent, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, respectively. After the ion pair was concentrated at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min for 5 min on a 7 cm long <b>filter</b> <b>tube</b> (inner diameter: 1. 5 mm), the ion pair was eluted with ethanol at a flow rate of 2. 0 mL/min. The detection limit was 2 ng mL- 1 (3 ×standard deviation of blank). The sensitivity of this method was equal to or {{higher than that of}} the conventional solvent extraction method. This method and the Ethyl Violet method (EV method, JIS) gave somewhat different analytical results for a standard solution containing various anionic surfactants because the sensitivities of the methods are different for each surfactant, while they yielded the same analytical results for river water samples...|$|R
40|$|Better {{knowledge}} of CT number values and their uncertainties {{can be applied}} to improve heavy ion treatment planning. We developed a novel method to calculate CT numbers for a computed tomography (CT) scanner using the Monte Carlo (MC) code, BEAMnrc/EGSnrc. To generate the initial beam shape and spectra we conducted full simulations of an X-ray <b>tube,</b> <b>filters</b> and beam shapers for a Siemens Emotion CT. The simulation output files were analyzed to calculate projections of a phantom with inserts. A simple reconstruction algorithm (FBP using a Ram-Lak filter) was applied to calculate the pixel values, which represent an attenuation coefficient, normalized in such a way to give zero for water (Hounsfield unit (HU)). Measured and Monte Carlo calculated CT numbers were compared. The average deviation between measured and simulated CT numbers was 4 ± 4 HU and the standard deviation σ was 49 ± 4 HU. The simulation also correctly predicted the behaviour of H-materials compared to a Gammex tissue substitutes. We believe the developed approach represents a useful new tool for evaluating the effect of CT scanner and phantom parameters on CT number values...|$|R
