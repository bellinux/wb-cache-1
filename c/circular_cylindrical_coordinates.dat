40|$|Straightforward {{algebraic}} expressions {{describing the}} elastic wavefield {{produced by a}} line source of finite length are derived in <b>circular</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinates.</b> The surrounding elastic medium {{is assumed to be}} both homogeneous and isotropic, anc[the source stress distribution is considered axisymmetic. The time- and space-domain formulae are accurate at all distances and directions from the source; no fa-field or long-wavelength assumptions are adopted for the derivation. The mathematics yield a unified treatment of three different types of sources: an axial torque, an axial force, and a radial pressure. The torque source radiates only azirnuthally polarized shear waves, whereas force and pressure sources generate simultaneous compressional and shear radiation polarized in planes containing the line source. The formulae reduce to more familiar expressions in the two limiting cases where the length of the line source approaches zero and infinity. Far-field approximations to the exact equations indicate that waves radiated parallel to the line source axI. s are attenuated relative to those radiated normal to the axis. The attenuation is more severe for higher I?equencies and for lower wavespeeds. Hence, shear waves are affected more than compressional waves. This fi-equency- and directiondependent attenuation is characterized by an extremely simple mathematical formula, and is readily apparent in example synthetic seismograms...|$|E

This class {{is suitable for}} stability studies of galactic disks in three dimensions and includes basis sets tailored for disks with vertical density profiles that are exponential (exp(-|z|/)), Gaussian (exp(-(z/) ^ 2) or locally isothermal (sech^ 2 (z/)). The basis sets are non-discrete and non-biorthogonal; however, the extra numerical computations required (compared with discrete biorthogonal sets) are explained and constitute a small overhead. The method of construction (and proof of completeness) is simple {{and can be used}} to construct basis sets for other density distributions that are best described in <b>circular</b> or elliptic <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinates.</b> When combined with a basis set designed for spheroidal systems, the basis sets presented here can be used to study the stability of realistic disks embedded in massive halos...|$|R

Moreover, finite element method simulations, numerical analyses and the insertion loss method are combined to investigate the effects of the main parameters on these wave bandgaps.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new representation of coherent laser beams that are usually described in <b>circular</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinates.</b> This representation {{is based on the}} decomposition of a laser beam of a given azimuthal order into beams exhibiting Cartesian symmetry. These beams, which we call constituent waves, diffract along only one of their transverse dimensions and propagate noncollinearly with the propagation axis. A cylindrically symmetric laser beam is then considered a coherent superposition of constituent waves and is represented by an integral over an angular variable. Such a representation allows for the introduction of the propagation factor M 2, defined in terms of one-dimensional root-mean-square (rms) quantities, in the treatment of two-dimensional beams. The representation naturally leads to the definition of a new rms parameter that we call the quality factor Q. It is shown that the quality factor defines in quantitative terms the nondiffracting character of a laser beam. The representation is first applied to characterize Laguerre-Gauss beams in terms of these one-dimensional rms parameters. This analysis reveals an asymptotic link between Laguerre-Gauss beams and one-dimensional Hermite-Gauss beams in the limit of high azimuthal orders. The representation is also applied to Bessel-Gauss beams and demonstrates the geometrical and one-dimensional characters of the Bessel-Gauss beams that propagate in a nondiffracting regime. By using two separate rms parameters, Q and M 2, our approach gives an alternative way to describe laser beam propagation that is especially well suited to characterize Bessel-type nondiffracting beams...|$|E
30|$|Many {{authors have}} modeled excitable tissue with the bidomain equations, {{choosing}} the coordinate system that most closely resembles the tissue geometry. In <b>circular</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinates,</b> Altman and Plonsey modeled {{a bundle of}} nerves as an infinite cylinder in an infinite conducting bath, studying first the steady state [13] and transient stimulation [14]. In the former they incrementally increased the realism of their model, going from an isotropic monodomain to an anisotropic bidomain, while in the latter they investigated the effect of fiber diameter on stimulation and impulse propagation. Henriquez et al. [15 – 17] and Trayanova et al. [18] investigated the merits of assuming a single fiber vs. a bundle, i.e. bidomain, of fibers when modeling an infinite cylinder of tissue excited by either a disk or a line source. They showed that the single fiber core conductor model is not an unreasonable approximation of the control region of a large bundle of fibers, but loses its validity toward {{the periphery of the}} bundle and is entirely unsatisfactory for small bundles. Plonsey and Barr showed in a two dimensional rectangular framework, except for special cases, the bidomain approach to modeling tissue electrophysiology is not a mere generalization of one dimensional cable theory [19, 20]. They found that current flowed very differently in isotropic tissue compared to anisotropic tissue with unequal anisotropy ratios. Roth gave approximate analytic solutions to the problem of bisyncytia with unequal anisotropy ratios [21], using rectangular coordinates. His perturbation method involved expansion in a parameter defined through the anisotropy ratios. He considered two sources: an expanding wave front that was approximated with a step function, and a point source. Trayanova et al. considered the case of bidomain tissue in a uniform electric field, modeling the heart as a sphere of anisotropic tissue with a core of blood [22]. The uniform field meant that they could assume azimuthal independence, leaving only a two dimensional problem in the spherical coordinates r and θ. Heretofore none has studied a three spatial dimension bidomain problem in spherical coordinates.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{alternate}} method for computing the {{external magnetic field}} from a <b>circular</b> <b>cylindrical</b> magnetic source. The primary objective is to characterize the magnetic source {{in terms of its}} equivalent multipole distribution. This multipole distribution must be valid at points close to the cylindrical source and a spherical multipole expansion is ill-equipped to handle this problem; therefore a new method must be introduced. This method, based upon the free-space Green's function in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinates,</b> is developed {{as an alternative to the}} more familiar spherical harmonic expansion. A family of special functions, called the toroidal functions or Q-functions, are found to exhibit the necessary properties for analyzing <b>circular</b> <b>cylindrical</b> geometries. In particular, the toroidal function of zeroth order, which comes from the integral formulation of the free-space Green's function in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinates,</b> is employed to handle magnetic sources which exhibit <b>circular</b> <b>cylindrical</b> symmetry. The toroidal functions, also called Q-functions, are the weighting coefficients in a ''Fourier series-like'' expansion which represents the free-space Green's function. It is also called a toroidal expansion. This expansion can be directly employed in electrostatic, magnetostatic, and electrodynamic problems which exhibit cylindrical symmetry. Also, it is shown that they can be used as an alternative to the Elliptic integral formulation. In fact, anywhere that an Elliptic integral appears, one can replace it with its corresponding Q-function representation. A number of problems, using the toroidal expansion formulation, are analyzed and compared to existing known methods in order to validate the results. Also, the equivalent multipole distribution is found for most of the solved problems along with its corresponding physical interpretation. The main application is to characterize the external magnetic field due to a six-pole permanent magnet motor in terms of its equivalent multipole distribution...|$|R

40|$|Using {{rigorous}} constitutive linearization {{of second}} variation introduced in [6] we study weak stability of homogeneous deformation of the axially compressed <b>circular</b> <b>cylindrical</b> shell, {{regarded as a}} 3 -dimensional hyperelastic body. We show that such deformation becomes weakly unstable at the citical load that coincides with value of the bifurcation load in von-Kármán-Donnel shell theory. We also show that the linear bifurcation modes described by the Koiter circle [11] minimize the second variation asymptotically. The key ingredients of our analysis are the asymptoticaly sharp estimates of the Korn constant for cylindrical shells and Korn-like inequalities on components of the deformation gradient tensor in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>coordinates.</b> The notion of buckling equivalence introduced in [6] is developed further and becomes central in this work.
