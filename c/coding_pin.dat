40|$|The Karhunen-Loeve {{transformation}} (KLT) is {{the best}} one among all orthogonal transformations of a given size {{from the point of}} view of the coding gain. When bits have been optimally allocated to transform coefficients, the distortion is only a function of the product of the transform coefficient variances. The KLT minimizes this product under the constraint of a given sum of these variances. It is optimum from both points of view of <b>coding</b> <b>pin</b> maximization and zonal sampling. The same objective can be pursued with subband systems. The analysis filter bank can be chosen so as to minimize the product of subband variances. That question will be dealt with in the case of a 2 -band system. It will be shown that CQF filters banks fulfilling the criterion of minimum product of subband variances are also optimum from the two points of view mentioned for the KTL...|$|E
40|$|Invention {{of oxygen}} {{cylinder}} {{was one of}} the most important developments in the field of medical practice. Oxygen and other gases were compressed and stored at high pressure in seamless containers constructed from hand-forged steel in 1880. Materials technology has continued to evolve and now medical gas cylinders are generally made of steel alloys or aluminum. The filling pressure as well as capacity has increased considerably while at the same time the weight of cylinders has reduced. Today oxygen cylinder of equivalent size holds a third more oxygen but weighs about 20 kg less. The cylinders are of varying sizes and are color coded. They are tested at regular intervals by the manufacturer using hydraulic, impact, and tensile tests. The top end of the cylinder is fitted with a valve with a variety of number and markings stamped on it. Common valve types include: Pin index valve, bull nose, hand wheel and integral valve. The type of valve varies with cylinder size. Small cylinders have a pin index valve while large have a bull nose type. Safety features in the cylinder are: Color <b>coding,</b> <b>pin</b> index, pressure relief device, Bodok seal, and label attached etc., Safety rules and guidelines must be followed during storage, installation and use of cylinders to ensure safety of patients, hospital personnel and the environment...|$|E

40|$|Indian <b>pin</b> <b>code</b> is a six-digit string. Because of {{the writing}} style of {{different}} individuals some of the digits in a <b>pin</b> <b>code</b> string may touch with its neighboring digits. Accurate segmentation of such touching components into individual digits is a difficult task. To avoid such segmentation, here we consider a <b>pin</b> <b>code</b> string as word and the <b>pin</b> <b>code</b> recognition problem is treated as lexicon free word recognition. In the proposed method, at first, binarization of the input document is done. Next, water reservoir concept is applied to pre-segment a <b>pin</b> <b>code</b> string into possible primitive components (individual digits or its parts). Pre-segmented components of the <b>pin</b> <b>code</b> are then merged into possible digits {{to get the best}} <b>pin</b> <b>code.</b> In order to merge these primitive components into digits and to find optimum segmentation, dynamic programming (DP) is applied using total likelihood of digits as the objective function. To compute the likelihood of a digit, modified quadratic discriminant function (MQDF) is used. The features used in the MQDF are based on the directional information of the components. Our system on handwritten Bangla <b>pin</b> <b>code</b> shows 99. 08 % reliability when rejection and error rates are 19. 28 % and 0. 74 %, respectively...|$|R
