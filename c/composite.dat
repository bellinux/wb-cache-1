In this research, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), feather fiber (FF), glass fiber (GF) and montmorillonite (MMT) <b>composites</b> were prepared using Brabender internal mixer. FF/PMMA and GF/PMMA <b>composites</b> were produced in the range of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 phr composition of feather and glass fiber respectively while FF/PMMA/MMT and GF/PMMA/MMT <b>composites</b> were produced in the range of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 phr composition of feather and glass fiber with the addition of 4 wt % of MMT. The performance of FF/PMMA was compared with GF/PMMA <b>composites.</b> The mechanical properties of <b>composites</b> were studied through the flexural test. The changes on the glass transition temperature (Tg) and thermal stability of <b>composites</b> was studied through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Morphology of the <b>composites</b> was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The chemical structure of <b>composites</b> was studied by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The structural characterization of silicate layer was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Biological properties were determined through in-vitro cytotoxicity test to demonstrate the biocompatibility of the <b>composites.</b> The result of flexural properties of FF/PMMA and GF/PMMA <b>composites</b> showed the addition of FF and GF significantly increased the strength and stiffness of <b>composites.</b> The <b>composites</b> containing 10 phr of both fiber had the highest flexural strength and modulus. Similar result was obtained for FF/PMMA/MMT and GF/PMMA/MMT <b>composites.</b> DSC results showed that the Tg of the PMMA matrix increased with increasing of fiber loading.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate and compare the effects of kenaf and rice husk fibers content on flammability, mechanical, thermal and morphology properties of polypropylene (PP) <b>composites.</b> The effects of ammonium polyphosphate (APP) content on mechanical and flammability properties of untreated and treated fibers filled PP <b>composites</b> were also investigated. The <b>composites</b> were prepared using a co-rotating twin screw extruder for compounding process and followed by compression molding for test specimen preparation. Rice husk and kenaf fibers were treated by alkaline treatment to modify the fiber surface. Cone calorimeter and limiting oxygen index (LOI) test were performed to determine the flammability properties of the samples. Flexural and impact test were done to determine the mechanical properties of PP <b>composites.</b> In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were done to investigate thermal stability of the <b>composites.</b> Addition of APP into PP <b>composites</b> was found to increase the LOI values that indicate the improvement of flame retardancy properties. Whereas, cone calorimeter results showed that incorporation of APP into fibers filled PP <b>composites</b> decreased the heat release rate (HRR) which indicated the improvement of flame retardancy system. Incorporation of APP into PP <b>composites</b> increased the flexural modulus of <b>composites</b> but decreased the flexural strength of <b>composites.</b> On the other hand, the flexural strength of PP <b>composites</b> was observed to increase with the addition of treated fibers. A decrease in impact strength was observed with the addition of APP to PP <b>composites.</b> Incorporation of treated fibers into PP <b>composites</b> also decreased the impact strength. From TGA results, it can be observed that the addition of APP into <b>composites</b> enhanced the thermal stability of <b>composites</b> at high temperature and increased the formation of char residue. The addition of APP in the fibers filled PP <b>composites</b> increased the crystallization temperature of <b>composites.</b> Morphological studies showed that both fibers that underwent alkaline treatment improved the fibers dispersion in the <b>composites</b> and also resulting in better mechanical properties.
