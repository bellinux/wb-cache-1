25|$|The {{concept of}} a singer-songwriter {{can be traced to}} ancient bardic oral tradition, which has existed in various forms {{throughout}} the world. Poems would be performed as chant or song, sometimes accompanied by a harp or other similar instrument. After the invention of printing, songs would be written and performed by ballad sellers. Usually these would be versions of existing tunes and lyrics, which were <b>constantly</b> <b>evolving.</b> This developed into the singer-songwriting traditions of folk culture.|$|E
25|$|The dairy {{industry}} is a <b>constantly</b> <b>evolving</b> business. Management practices change with new technology and regulations that move the industry toward increased economic and environmental sustainability. Management strategies can also loosely be divided into intensive and extensive systems. Extensive systems operate based on a low input and low output philosophy, where intensive systems adopt a high input high output philosophy. These philosophies as well as available technologies, local regulations, and environmental conditions manifest in different management of nutrition, housing, health, reproduction and waste.|$|E
25|$|Brisbane has {{maintained}} a <b>constantly</b> <b>evolving</b> live music scene, producing acts spanning genres including punk (see Brisbane punk rock), indie rock, electronic music, experimental music, noise rock, metal and post-punk. Brisbane's live music history is often intertwined with social unrest and authoritarian politics, as retold by journalist Andrew Stafford in , Radical Brisbane: An Unruly History, edited by academics Raymond Evans and Carole Ferrier, and BNE – The Definitive Archive: Brisbane Independent Electronic Music Production 1979-2014, produced by record label director Dennis Remmer.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} writing has been <b>constantly</b> <b>evolving,</b> {{particularly}} {{due to the}} development of new technologies over the centuries. The pen, the printing press, the computer and the mobile phone are all technological developments which have altered what is written, and the medium through which the written word is produced. Particularly with the advent of digital technologies, namely the computer and the mobile phone, characters can be formed by the press of a button, rather than making a physical motion with the hand.|$|E
25|$|While the {{practices}} or technologies employed in green building are <b>constantly</b> <b>evolving</b> and {{may differ from}} region to region, fundamental principles persist from which the method is derived: siting and structure design efficiency, energy efficiency, water efficiency, materials efficiency, indoor environmental quality enhancement, operations and maintenance optimization and waste and toxics reduction. The essence of green building is an optimization {{of one or more}} of these principles. Also, with the proper synergistic design, individual green building technologies may work together to produce a greater cumulative effect.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Western Empire in the late fifth century, the Eastern Roman Empire remained stable through the beginning of the Middle Ages and retained the ability for future expansion. Justinian I reconquered North Africa, Italy, Dalmatia and finally parts of Spain for the Eastern Roman Empire. However, this put an incredible strain on the Empire's limited resources. Subsequent emperors would not surrender the re-conquered land to remedy the situation. Thus the stage was set for Emperor Maurice to establish the Exarchates to deal with the <b>constantly</b> <b>evolving</b> situation of the provinces.|$|E
50|$|However {{the concept}} is subject to debate, on similar grounds as for the climax theory. Critics argue that {{ecosystems}} are not static but ever dynamic: as bioclimatic conditions <b>constantly</b> <b>evolve,</b> it is illusory to define either a final or a primary stage of vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Naval {{strategy}} <b>constantly</b> <b>evolves</b> as improved technologies become available.

Although Sikh architecture was initially developed within Sikhism its style {{has been used in}} many non-religious buildings due to its beauty. 300 years ago, Sikh architecture was distinguished for its many curves and straight lines; Shri Keshgarh Sahib and the Sri Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) are prime examples.|$|E
25|$|Wine tasting (often, in wine circles, simply tasting) is {{the sensory}} {{examination}} {{and evaluation of}} wine. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as sommeliers or buyers for retailers) use a <b>constantly</b> <b>evolving</b> specialized terminology {{which is used to}} describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.|$|E
25|$|The Culture, living {{mostly on}} massive spaceships and in {{artificial}} habitats, and also feeling {{no need for}} conquest in the typical sense of the word, possesses no borders. Its sphere of influence is better defined by the (current) concentration of Culture ships and habitats {{as well as the}} measure of effect its example and its interventions have already had on the 'local' population of any galactic sector. As the Culture is also a very graduated and <b>constantly</b> <b>evolving</b> society, its societal boundaries are also constantly in flux (though they tend to be continually expanding during the novels), peacefully 'absorbing' societies and individuals.|$|E

25|$|Radiation {{treatment}} is mainly {{effective in reducing}} the risk of local relapse in the affected breast. Therefore, it is recommended in most cases of breast conserving surgeries and less frequently after mastectomy. Indications for radiation treatment are <b>constantly</b> <b>evolving.</b> Patients treated in Europe have been more likely in the past to be recommended adjuvant radiation after breast cancer surgery as compared to patients in North America. Radiation therapy is usually recommended for all patients who had lumpectomy, quadrant-resection. Radiation therapy is usually not indicated in patients with advanced (stage IV disease) except for palliation of symptoms like bone pain or fungating lesions.|$|E
25|$|Currently one of {{the most}} active areas of {{knowledge}} representation research are projects associated with the semantic web. The semantic web seeks to add a layer of semantics (meaning) on top of the current Internet. Rather than indexing web sites and pages via keywords, the semantic web creates large ontologies of concepts. Searching for a concept will be more effective than traditional text only searches. Frame languages and automatic classification play a big part in the vision for the future semantic web. The automatic classification gives developers technology to provide order on a <b>constantly</b> <b>evolving</b> network of knowledge. Defining ontologies that are static and incapable of evolving on the fly would be very limiting for Internet-based systems. The classifier technology provides the ability to deal with the dynamic environment of the Internet.|$|E
25|$|The T-34 was the {{mainstay}} of Soviet armoured forces throughout the Second World War. Its design allowed it to be continuously refined to meet the <b>constantly</b> <b>evolving</b> needs of the Eastern Front: as the war went on it became more capable, but also quicker and cheaper to produce. Soviet industry would eventually produce over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded as the war progressed despite the loss of thousands in combat against the German Wehrmacht. Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, {{as well as the}} second most produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/55 series). Its development led directly to the T-54 and T-55 series of tanks, which in turn evolved into the later T-62, T-72, and T-90 that form the armoured mainstay of many modern armies. T-34 variants were widely exported after World War II, and, as of 2017, the tank remains in limited frontline service in many developing countries.|$|E
