50|$|Little {{is known}} {{regarding}} the mating behavior of black-spotted <b>cuscuses.</b> Courting is typically performed on tree limbs. Black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> produce offspring via sexual reproduction. They are viviparous, {{with the mother}} birthing live young.|$|E
50|$|Black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> have round {{heads with}} a short, pointed snout. The frontal skull bones are convex, which gives them their bulging forehead, {{and they have}} a large sinus that is closed off from the nasal cavity. In black-spotted <b>cuscuses,</b> the basioccipital and alisphenoid bones in the skull create a {{well-developed}} structure earlier than in other Phalangeridae. Their eyes are characterized by large, vertically split pupils that are useful for their nocturnal lifestyle. There is fur lining the inner ears, which are almost invisible. Black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> can be distinguished from other <b>cuscuses</b> by their teeth. They have low crowns and small premolars that lie anterior to the primary premolar in the upper jaw. In addition, they have a prominent protocone on their first, upper molars.|$|E
50|$|Petauroidea is a {{superfamily}} of marsupials from Australia and New Guinea. It {{is part of}} the suborder Phalangeriformes {{within the}} order Diprotodontia, which also includes, among others, wombats, kangaroos, <b>cuscuses.</b> The superfamily Phalangeroidea, including <b>cuscuses</b> and brushtail possums (family Phalangeridae) and pygmy possums (family Burramyidae), is the immediate sister group of the Petauroidea.|$|E
50|$|The family Phalangeridae {{originated}} from the Australian rainforests {{by the early}} Miocene epoch. Since then, <b>cuscuses</b> have successfully diversified from the Phalangerids. Current {{research has indicated that}} the Trichosurini (possums) separated from the <b>cuscuses</b> that comprised the extant Phalangerids approximately 23 to 29 million years ago. This split supports the surfacing of Sulawesi and New Guinea. The emergence of these land masses implies that the ancestors of the <b>cuscuses</b> traveled to the New Guinea region that appeared while the Trichosurini stayed in Australia. Shortly after this event, around 19 to 24 million years ago, the <b>cuscuses</b> divided into two groups. The first group consists of Ailurops and Strigocuscus celebensis, and the second consists of Phalanger and Spilocuscus, which currently has five species remaining. Out of these five, three are endangered, with Spilocuscus rufoniger being one of them.|$|E

50|$|The bear <b>cuscuses</b> are {{the members}} of the genus Ailurops. They are {{marsupials}} of the family Phalangeridae.|$|E
50|$|Black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> {{comprise}} one of {{the largest}} species of the family Phalangxeridae; only surpassed in size by the bear cuscus. Adult black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> weigh approximately 6 to 7 kg (13 to 15 lb) on average. Typically, they are 120 cm in length, with the head and body measuring approximately 70 cm, and the tail measuring 50 cm. Both adult males and females exhibit red and black fur that is dense and woolly. However, females are bigger and have a uniformly dark, saddle-like coloration, while males have spotty colorations. The pelages of the young transform through a series of colors during maturation. The undersides of black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> have areas of yellow and white. Females possess four mammae and modified pouches for neonates that open anteriorly.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cuscuses</b> mate year-round {{and with}} {{multiple}} partners, conducting courtship on tree limbs. The gestation period for a pregnant female is around 13 days, with a pouch period of 6-7 months. While females have four teats in their pouches and can {{have up to}} three young per birth, they rarely suckle more than two. Each young weighs no more than 1 gram at birth, and is held in the mother's well-developed forward-opening pouch. <b>Cuscuses</b> can live to be 11 years old, and reach sexual maturity around one year old.|$|E
50|$|Black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> {{primarily}} {{use their}} tails for grasping. They are naked at the tip, and {{the underside of}} the tails are streaked with calluses for ease of picking up items such as food.|$|E
50|$|This 7000 m2 {{greenhouse}} with waterfalls includes tropical {{plants such}} as bamboo, vines, banana trees, and hibiscus, and is home to animals including bee-eaters, bear <b>cuscuses,</b> dwarf mongoose, hornbills, and southern bald ibises.|$|E
50|$|The scaly-tailed possum is {{a member}} of the family Phalangeridae, which means that it is related to <b>cuscuses</b> and brushtail possums. It is a solitary nocturnal forager that feeds on leaves, flowers and fruit.|$|E
50|$|Phalanger (from the Greek phalangion, meaning spider's web, {{from their}} webbed (fused) toes) is a genus of possums. They are {{marsupials}} {{of the family}} Phalangeridae, and {{are one of the}} four genera whose species are commonly referred to as <b>cuscuses.</b>|$|E
50|$|The bear <b>cuscuses</b> are {{arboreal}} marsupials {{that live}} in the upper canopy of tropical rainforests. Almost nothing is known of their status and ecology. Although some scientists assign all populations to one species, A. ursinus, others place melanotis as its own species. The genus is distinct, though, and some authorities place it within its own subfamily, Ailuropinae. It is found only on some of the islands of Indonesia (e.g., Sulawesi), which are culturally part of Asia, where marsupials are generally not found but which are biogeographically part of the Australasian ecozone. It is hypothesized that the isolation of the bear <b>cuscuses</b> on the island of Sulawesi in the Miocene accounts for the animal's morphological divergence {{from the rest of the}} family Phalangeridae.|$|E
50|$|Ornaments {{made from}} bones and teeth of {{babirusa}} deer-pig and bear <b>cuscuses</b> (Ailurops ursinus) marsupial, was unearthed from limestone caves in Sulawesi. These jewellery was ingeniously manufactured from {{the teeth of}} the primitive pigs and bones of marsupials, estimated dated to between 22,000 and 30,000 years ago.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cuscuses</b> are {{generally}} arboreal folivore/frugivores, and are slow-moving and nocturnal, although hunters in New Guinea have observed them sunning themselves outside their burrows {{in the early}} morning. The tendency to nest in burrows makes this species vulnerable to hunting with dogs.The ground cuscus differs from all other phalangerids in spending its days in burrows {{in the ground and}} appears as comfortable at ground level as in the trees. Captive specimens are often described as being mainly arboreal, whereas wild ground <b>cuscuses</b> {{are generally}} described as a terrestrial species. Regarded as a solitary species, the ground cuscus fights by adopting a bipedal stance and lashing out with the forelimbs whilst emitting hissing and barking vocalisations. In captivity, compatible pairs can be housed together, but periodic fighting may still occur.|$|E
50|$|The Phalangeridae are {{a family}} of nocturnal {{marsupials}} native to Australia and New Guinea, including the <b>cuscuses,</b> brushtail possums, and their close relatives. Considered a type of possum, most species are arboreal, and they inhabit {{a wide range of}} forest habitats from alpine woodland to eucalypt forest and tropical jungle.|$|E
50|$|There is a masseteric process {{present in}} Spilocuscus rufoniger, which {{is unique to}} marsupials. There are also {{inflated}} frontal sinuses present in the species, which {{is thought to be}} a derived characteristic within the family Phalangeridae. Thus, certain distinct features of the black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> allow them to be classified them as marsupials in the family Phalangeridae.|$|E
50|$|The {{behaviors}} that occur among {{male and female}} Woodlark cuscus before, during, and after mating {{have not yet been}} observed. However, the capture of five female Woodlark <b>cuscuses</b> in August 1987 led to the following interesting observations: one of the females were parous but did not have any young while another was clearly lactating. Two others had its naked young in their pouches while one of them had its older young on its back. This transition from the pouch of the mother {{to the back of the}} mother as the young age is typical in the Phalanger lullulae because they are metatherians and this transition is typical metatherian behavior. The various states of the young and female <b>cuscuses</b> were in demonstrate that the breeding season most likely happens over a long period of time. It has also been noted that they give birth to single young.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{there are}} no {{existing}} national parks in Papua New Guinea to protect this species. However, to address the critical endangerment status, a management area has been built in Papua New Guinea, and there are numerous areas in Indonesia that the black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> can inhabit for protection. To further address the problem, hunting restrictions and public awareness need to be implemented.|$|E
50|$|The black-spotted cuscus is {{indigenous}} {{to the island}} of New Guinea. Although the species is spread throughout northern New Guinea, it has been commonly seen in Sattelberg, a village in the Morobe Province of Papua New Guinea. It dwells in undisturbed lower-montane, tropical, primary forests and lowland areas of thick brushwood below 1200 meters in elevation. Black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> have been located in secondary forests as well.|$|E
50|$|Before 1987, {{there were}} only eight {{specimens}} of Woodlark <b>cuscuses</b> identified so {{it was believed that}} the species was in fact on the brink of extinction. Observations in 1987 showed that they are rampant on the Eastern half of Woodlark Island and on Alcester Island, however, they were still considered vulnerable by the IUCN because of their restricted inhabitance. Currently, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN. While the Woodlark cuscus are hunted by the locals, it plays only a small part in the diet of the locals and does not impact its abundance on the islands. The biggest threat to these <b>cuscuses</b> would have to be the planned palm oil development by a Malaysian biofuels company. While it is not known how massive this project is, regardless of its magnitude, it will have adverse effects on the native forests on the island and will mark their end. The introduction of other Phalanger species could be a threat as they are potential competitors as well a means of disease transmission to the native Woodlark cuscus.|$|E
50|$|Spilocuscus rufoniger is an {{endothermic}} species. The black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> {{are primarily}} arboreal; they only descend {{to the ground}} periodically. Being nocturnal creatures, they rest in a curled position on high branches throughout the day. Naturally, they are sluggish creatures with predominantly solitary lifestyles. Feeding and nesting is performed individually. Interactions and encounters between individuals of this species typically involve aggression. There have been no reports of arboreal predators in the habitats of the black-spotted cuscus.|$|E
50|$|It is {{debated whether}} <b>cuscuses</b> {{originated}} in Australia and then migrated to New Guinea, or vice versa. It {{is believed that}} over the past million years there have been waves of migration during periods of low sea levels that exposed seabed across the Torres Strait. Currently the common spotted cuscus resides in Cape York, Queensland, in northeastern Australia, as well as New Guinea and nearby smaller islands. It inhabits areas as far west as Sulawesi and as far east as the Solomon Islands.|$|E
50|$|Reports {{from local}} sources in Papua New Guinea from the 1970s and the mid-1990s {{indicate}} that singer-like wild dogs found in New Guinea, {{whether they were}} pure singers or hybrids, fed on small to middle-sized marsupials, rodents, birds and fruits. Robert Bino stated that their prey consisted of <b>cuscuses,</b> wallabies, dwarf cassowaries and other birds. Singers in captivity do not require a specialized diet {{but they seem to}} thrive on lean raw meat diets based on poultry, beef, elk, deer, or bison.|$|E
50|$|This eagle is {{a fairly}} large species, though mid-sized {{as a member of}} the Aquila genus. It is mainly dark brown to black, with paler undersides to its flight {{feathers}} and a rounded tail. Its body length is 74 - 86 cm with a wingspan of between 1.65 and 1.9 m. One immature bird reportedly weighed 3.06 kg. Females are larger than males. Its wings are held level when gliding. It feeds on mammals (such as <b>cuscuses),</b> reptiles, fish, and birds.|$|E
50|$|The common {{spotted cuscus}} is {{typically}} a solitary creature, feeding and nesting alone. Interactions with others, especially between competing males, can be aggressive and confrontational. Male <b>cuscuses</b> scent mark their territory to warn off other males, emitting a penetrating musk odor both from their bodies and scent gland excretions. They distribute saliva on branches and twigs of trees to inform others of their territory and mediate social interactions. If they encounter another male in their area, they make barking, snarling, and hissing noises, and stand upright to defend their territories. They are aggressive, and can scratch, bite, and kick potential predators.|$|E
50|$|From 1982 to 1990, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{stated that}} the species was “Rare”. This was until its status was changed to “Vulnerable” in 1994 and then to “Endangered” in 1996. According to the IUCN, the black-spotted cuscus has been {{classified}} as Critically Endangered since 2010. The population of this species is drastically declining due to human disruptions. The expansion of human populations {{has led to the}} conversion from forestry to cultivated land for agricultural purposes. For instance, there has been an influx of Javan people into Papua New Guinea, which destroys the habitats of the black-spotted <b>cuscuses</b> and contributes to their decline.|$|E
50|$|It has thick, woolly fur {{of varying}} colours {{depending}} on age, sex, and location. Males are typically grey/white or brown/white with splotchy patterns {{on their back}} and a white underbelly. Only males have spots. Females are usually white or grey and unspotted. Some completely white individuals are known in both males and females. As the young grow, they go {{through a series of}} color changes before reaching sexual maturity around one year old. Colouration varies from reds and whites to buffs, browns, light greys, and blacks. Unlike some other species of <b>cuscuses</b> or possums, the common spotted cuscus does not have a dorsal stripe on its fur.|$|E
5000|$|What sets these <b>cuscuses</b> {{apart from}} other diprotodont {{marsupials}} is the back part of the cranium not being so exposed to the mastoid. [...] Its skull is {{in the shape of}} a pear and its widest portion of the skull can be found in the posterior end of its zygomatic arch. While the molars do not undergo strong crenulation, the nasal bones extend and stop where the premaxilla stops. Its dentition continues with the cingulum being quite large and very well-developed and sitting between the lopids of the lower molars. The backside of the skull where the paroccipital processes are located are longer in comparison to the rest of the skull.|$|E
50|$|The endemic mammals {{found here}} include the Obi mosaic-tailed rat (Melomys obiensis), masked flying fox (Pteropus personatus), and three {{arboreal}} marsupials, the ornate (Phalanger ornatus), Rothschild's (P. rothschildi), blue-eyed (P. matabiru) and Gebe (P. alexandrae) <b>cuscuses.</b> There are {{over two hundred}} different birds on the islands, twenty-six of which are endemic, a large number for this small island group. The endemics include four birds which are the only species in their genera, including the elusive invisible rail (Habroptila wallacii), the white-streaked friarbird (Melitograis gilolensis), and two birds of paradise, the paradise-crow (Lycocorax pyrrhopterus) and Wallace's standardwing (Semioptera wallacii). The islands are also home to the largest bee in the world, Wallace's giant bee (Megachile pluto).|$|E
5000|$|The Terrace {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} parts of the zoo. It is home to a pair of lions, keas, red pandas, fruit bats and {{flamingos}} as well as Twilight World which was the first such exhibit to offer the daytime visitor the chance to view the twilight behaviour of nocturnal animals. By exchanging night and day, the animals (which are awake during their 'night') can be observed during daylight hours. The lights allow a natural transition from night to day and vice versa. Twilight world is split into four zones: the Desert (sand cats, mongooses, rattlesnakes and kowaris, the Rainforest (slow loris, mouse deer, quolls, aye-ayes, <b>Cuscuses</b> and mouse lemurs), the Cave (scorpions, blind cave fish and naked mole rats) and the House (rats and mice).|$|E
50|$|Thanks to Oxford University's {{journey to}} Woodlark Island, {{they were able}} to note and monitor the {{behavior}} of the Woodlark cuscus by using radio tracking techniques. These studies revealed that the cuscus is a solitary animal and the activities of the cuscus surround the few sleeping trees they come in contact with. They sleep during the day so they are nocturnal and their arboreal lifestyle lends them the opportunity to forage for food in the upper regions of trees while they nest in the lower regions of trees that are designated for sleeping. While foraging, they will make a variety of vocalizations to communicate from barking to snarling as a whining cry which sounds much like that of a human infant. When they interact, they have proven to be quite aggressive towards each other. With four species of bats living on the island, they are seen as potential competitors with the <b>cuscuses.</b> When obtaining food, they may eat the secondary regrowth from the tree and vine Rhus taitensis which grows quickly and contains the nectar which the locals on the island claim that they enjoy. Other sources indicate that they eat two species of vine which have yet to be identified.|$|E
5000|$|On August 24, 2012, {{the second}} known {{photograph}} of a New Guinea singing dog in the wild was taken by Tom Hewitt, Director of Adventure Alternative Borneo, in the Jayawijaya Mountains or Star Mountains of Papua Province, Indonesia, Western New Guinea by a trek party returning from Puncak Mandala, at approximately 4,760 m high the highest peak in the Jayawijaya range and second highest freestanding mountain of Oceania, Australasia, New Guinea and Indonesia (though Hewitt himself seems to erroneously say this peak is in the Star Mountains which are adjacent to the Jayawijaya range, and also casually calls the region 'West Papua' rather than Indonesia's Papua Province in the Western geopolitical 'half' of the New Guinea landmasses, while his identification of the peak is quite clear, including its estimated elevation which is distinctive among New Guinea's peaks). In a valley flanked by waterfalls on both sides among approximately 4 km high limestone peaks, replete with such flora and fauna as cycads, grasses and blooms of the highlands, <b>cuscuses,</b> possums, tree kangaroos unidentified ground-nesting birds in swamp grass, and a bird-of-paradise species heard but not seen, Hewitt relates that his veteran trek guide called out [...] "dog" [...] four times and pointed to fetch Hewitt and his trek client from their explorations behind large boulders and have them realize that ahead and above the guide and camp cook on a rocky outcrop was a dog, in Hewitt's words [...] "not scared, but[...] [...] genuinely curious[...] [...] as we were of it, and it certainly felt like a rare meeting for both sides. The guides and cook were also surprised.” While the guide had at first approached [...] "quite close", the dog retreated as the party came toward it, though it stayed on the hillside while being photographed for a mutual observation session of about 15 minutes. Hewitt only became {{fully aware of the}} importance of his party's sighting and photograph of this dog when he contacted Tom Wendt, New Guinea Singing Dog International (NGSDI)'s founder upon returning home, then regretting that he did not videorecord the encounter. Hewitt and Wendt observe that West Papuan locals report that sightings are rare, and that New Guinea singing dogs have not been domesticated by current human inhabitants of their area.|$|E
40|$|Sinery AS, Boer C, Farida WR. 2012. The {{population}} condition {{and availability of}} feed of cuscus in the Arfak Mountain Nature Reserve, West Papua. Biodiversitas 13 : 86 - 91. The cuscus is a pouched marsupial grouped in the Phalangeridae family, which is nocturnal, arboreal, herbivore, {{and in most cases}} the tail is prehensile. The animals are legally protected due to low reproduction, limited distribution area, and high rate of illegal hunting. The illegal hunting happened not only in the production forest areas but also in the reserve areas such as Nature Reserve of Arfak Mountain, directly or indirectly, affects the life quality of the ecosystem, mainly <b>cuscuses</b> population. Therefore, it is necessary to do efforts to have a better management of the region to ensure the sustenance of many components in it. This research is aimed to know the population density of cuscus in Arfak Mountain Nature Reserve and carried out for two months. The method used was descriptive by using direct and indirect observation. The result shows that <b>cuscuses</b> existing in the Arfak Mountain conservation area were northern common cuscus (Phalanger orientalis), ground cuscus (Phalanger gymnotis) and common spotted cuscus (Spilocuscus maculatus). The biggest individual number is of P. orientalis with 39 individuals consisting of 18 males and 21 females, the second is of P. gymnotis with 10 individuals consisting of 4 males and 6 females, and the smallest is of S. maculatus with 9 individuals consisting of 4 males and 5 females.
