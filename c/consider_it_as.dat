5|$|Although this {{question}} is brought up {{now for the first}} time to be decided by this Court, we <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> having been long since settled in public opinion. In no other case for many years has this jurisdiction been asserted, and the general acquiescence of legal men shows the prevalence of opinion in favor of the negative of the proposition.|$|E

5|$|Holtzmann {{initially}} wanted Cole Porter {{to write}} the score, but he declined. She was going to approach Noël Coward next, but happened to meet Dorothy Hammerstein (Oscar's wife) in Manhattan. Holtzmann told Dorothy Hammerstein that she wanted Rodgers and Hammerstein to create a show for Lawrence, {{and asked her to}} see that her husband read a book that Holtzmann would send over. In fact, both Dorothy Rodgers and Dorothy Hammerstein had read the novel in 1944 and had urged their husbands to <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a possible subject for a musical. Dorothy Hammerstein had known Gertrude Lawrence since 1925, when they had both appeared in André Charlot's London Revue of 1924 on Broadway and on tour in North America.|$|E

25|$|The Buddhist text Divyavadana {{describes}} Ashoka {{putting down}} a revolt due to activities of wicked ministers. This {{may have been}} an incident in Bindusara's times. Taranatha's account states that Chanakya, Bindusara's chief advisor, destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made himself the master of all territory between the eastern and the western seas. Some historians consider this as an indication of Bindusara's conquest of the Deccan while others <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> suppression of a revolt. Following this, Ashoka was stationed at Ujain, the capital of Malwa, as governor.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, the European {{intellectual}} {{transformation of}} {{and after the}} Renaissance bridged the Middle Ages and the Modern era. The Age of Reason in the Western world is generally regarded as being the start of modern philosophy, and {{a departure from the}} medieval approach, especially Scholasticism. Early 17th-century philosophy is often called the Age of Rationalism and is considered to succeed Renaissance philosophy and precede the Age of Enlightenment, but some <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the earliest part of the Enlightenment era in philosophy, extending that era to two centuries. The 18th century saw the beginning of secularization in Europe, rising to notability {{in the wake of the}} French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|While Cambyses {{met with}} his son and {{organized}} the 350,000+ men, Astyages armed men under and over age for fighting battles, and {{from all over the}} empire, to come. Purportedly with 1,205,000+ men, Astyages marched his troops out. Most historians consider this number fantastic, but others <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> part of the reserves. This is because in the battles to come, no more than 200,000 men from either side would actually take to the field. When Astyages knew he had underestimated Cyrus, he knew putting down a revolt was not enough, but a massive invasion had to be carried out, so the invasion of Persia by Astyages began.|$|E

25|$|If the {{inhabitants}} {{were allowed to}} stay in their homes, Finland would receive a few hundred thousand new Russian-speaking people with no experience of living in Finnish society. If services for them in their own language were to be provided, Finland would need many more officials capable of speaking Russian. In ProKarelia's vision, nearly half of the Russian population in Karelia would expel to Russia, and even more would leave if Finland paid their expenses for doing so. However most of the Russian speaking population of Karelia were born there, have spent all their life in the region and <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> their legal land.|$|E
25|$|In the October 1954 {{issue of}} Popular Mechanics {{there was an}} {{extensive}} survey of Corvette owners in America. The surprising finding was their opinions in comparison to foreign sports cars. It was found that 36% of those taking the survey had owned a foreign sports car, and of that, half of them rated the Corvette as better than their previous foreign sports car. Nineteen percent rated the Corvette as equal to their foreign sports car and 22% rated the Corvette as inferior. While many were well pleased with the Corvette, they did not <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a true sports car. The principal complaint of the surveyed owners was the tendency {{of the body to}} leak extensively during rain storms.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{existence}} of ORS is generally accepted, there is some controversy {{as to whether it}} is a distinct condition or merely a part or manifestation of other psychiatric conditions, mainly due to the overlapping similarities. Similarly, there is controversy with regards how the disorder should be classified. As ORS has obsessive and compulsive features, some <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a type of obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder, while others consider it an anxiety disorder due to the strong anxiety component. It is also suggested to be a type of body dysmorphic disorder or, as it involves a single delusional belief, some suggest that ORS is a monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis (hypochondriacal type of delusional disorder, see monothematic delusion).|$|E

25|$|If a {{woman has}} one or more small prolactinoma, {{there is no reason}} that she cannot {{conceive}} and have a normal pregnancy after successful medical therapy. The pituitary enlarges and prolactin production increases during normal pregnancy in women without pituitary disorders. Women with prolactin-secreting tumors may experience further pituitary enlargement and must be closely monitored during pregnancy. However, damage to the pituitary or eye nerves occurs in {{less than one percent of}} pregnant women with prolactinoma. In women with large tumors, the risk of damage to the pituitary or eye nerves is greater, and some doctors <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> high as 25%. If {{a woman has}} completed a successful pregnancy, the chances of her completing further successful pregnancies are extremely high.|$|E
25|$|Upamāṇa (उपमान), comparison, analogy. Some Hindu schools <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{a proper}} means of knowledge. Upamana, states Lochtefeld, may be {{explained}} with {{the example of a}} traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called upameyam, the object of comparison is called upamanam, while the attribute(s) are identified as samanya.|$|E
25|$|On 13 January 2016, 56 deputies of the {{parliamentary}} coalition formed around PD proposed controversial businessman Vlad Plahotniuc {{for the position}} of prime minister. The proposal was immediately rejected by President Nicolae Timofti, invoking integrity reasons. Timofti asked coalition representatives to propose another name until 14 January at 12 a.m. In the evening of 13 January, the coalition announced that will propose again Plahotniuc, thus escalating the constitutional conflict. The same day, two rallies took place in Chișinău, one that supports Vlad Plahotniuc for the position of prime minister and another that opposes the nomination. Next day, protests continued, {{with tens of thousands}} of people demonstrating in central Chișinău against Plahotniuc. By night, Timofti nominated the Secretary General of the Presidency, Ion Păduraru, candidate for this position, defying PD's proposal. However, Ion Păduraru announced his withdrawal from the race in less than 24 hours after the announcement of his nomination. He justified his gesture by the fact that {{the parliamentary}} majority has already nominated another proposal of premier, and President Timofti will <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a compromise solution. On 16 January, the parliamentary coalition grouped around the Democratic Party of Vlad Plahotniuc announced that disagrees with the proposal of President Timofti and came up with a new proposal for premier, instead of Plahotniuc – Pavel Filip. Later that day, up to 20,000 people joined three different rallies that were organized by both the left Socialist Party of Moldova and the centre-right Civic Platform DA. The protesters called on the Moldovan president and chief prosecutor to resign, demanding early elections and prompt measures against corruption. They also opposed the nomination of Pavel Filip to the post of Prime Minister.|$|E
