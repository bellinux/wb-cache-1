5|$|An {{approximation}} to the curve-shortening flow can be computed numerically, by approximating the <b>curve</b> as a polygon {{and using}} the finite difference method to calculate the motion of each polygon vertex. Alternative methods include computing a convolution of polygon vertices and then resampling vertices on the resulting <b>curve,</b> or repeatedly applying a median filter to a digital image whose black and white pixels represent the {{inside and outside of}} the <b>curve.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities <b>curve</b> or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities <b>curve</b> are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the <b>curve</b> are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities <b>curve.</b> At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E

It sums up general ideas of these <b>curves</b> and deals with particular methods for computing planar <b>curves.</b> It describes methods used for computing Ferguson cubic <b>curves,</b> Kochanek-Bartels spline, Cardinal spline, Catmull-Rom spline, Bézier <b>curves</b> and their modifications, Coons cubic <b>curves,</b> Coons cubic B-spline <b>curves</b> and NURBS.

5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth simple closed <b>curve</b> move in this way, the <b>curve</b> remains simple and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any continuous <b>curve</b> evolution. If the <b>curve</b> is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of the <b>curve</b> decreases as the <b>curve</b> converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E
5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings may reach {{singularities}} before contracting to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed <b>curve</b> {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then they will remain equal throughout {{the evolution of the}} <b>curve,</b> and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the <b>curve</b> collapses to a singularity.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed <b>curve,</b> the area {{enclosed}} by the <b>curve</b> shrinks, at the constant rate of 2 units of area {{per unit of}} time, independent of the <b>curve.</b> Therefore, the total time for a <b>curve</b> to shrink to a point is proportional to its area, regardless of its initial shape.|$|E

5|$|In {{order for}} the flow to be well defined, the given <b>curve</b> must be {{sufficiently}} smooth {{that it has a}} continuous curvature. However, once the flow starts, the <b>curve</b> becomes analytic, and remains so until reaching a singularity at which the curvature blows up. For a smooth <b>curve</b> without crossings, the only possible singularity happens when the <b>curve</b> collapses to a point, but immersed curves can have other types of singularity.|$|E

We determine {{the exact number of}} rational points of the <b>curves</b> in the class and we characterize maximal (respectively minimal) <b>curves</b> of the class as subcovers of some suitable <b>curves.</b> In particular we show that Coulter's maximal <b>curves</b> are Galois subcovers of the appropriate Hermitian <b>curves...</b>|$|R

50|$|Important {{examples}} of algebraic <b>curves</b> are the conics, which are nonsingular <b>curves</b> of degree two and genus zero, and elliptic <b>curves,</b> which are nonsingular <b>curves</b> of genus one studied in number theory and which have important applications to cryptography. Because algebraic <b>curves</b> in fields of characteristic zero {{are most often}} studied over the complex numbers, algebraic <b>curves</b> in algebraic geometry may be considered as real surfaces. In particular, the non-singular complex projective algebraic <b>curves</b> are called Riemann surfaces.|$|R
5|$|Similar {{results can}} be {{extended}} from closed curves to unbounded curves satisfying a local Lipschitz condition. For such curves, if {{both sides of the}} <b>curve</b> have infinite area, then the evolved <b>curve</b> remains smooth and singularity-free for all time. However, if one side of an unbounded <b>curve</b> has finite area, and the <b>curve</b> has finite total absolute curvature, then its evolution reaches a singularity in time proportional to the area on the finite-area side of the <b>curve,</b> with unbounded curvature near the singularity. For curves that are graphs of sufficiently well-behaved functions, asymptotic to a ray in each direction, the solution converges in shape to a unique shape that is asymptotic to the same rays.|$|E
5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} symmetric <b>curve</b> of constant width according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest centrally symmetric shape enclosed by the <b>curve)</b> and the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest centrally symmetric shape enclosing the <b>curve).</b> For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine the measures of asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other <b>curve</b> of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.|$|E

40|$|We provide bar and cobar constructions as functors acting {{between various}} {{categories}} of <b>curved</b> operads and <b>curved</b> cooperads.

5|$|The {{method of}} Mokhtarian and Mackworth {{involves}} computing the curve-shortening flow, tracking the inflection {{points of the}} <b>curve</b> as they progress through the flow, and drawing a graph that plots {{the positions of the}} inflection points around the <b>curve</b> against the time parameter. The inflection points will typically be removed from the <b>curve</b> in pairs as the <b>curve</b> becomes convex (according to the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem) and the lifetime of a pair of points corresponds to the salience of a feature of the shape.|$|E

5|$|Transforming a <b>curve</b> {{with equal}} normal speeds at all points {{has been called}} the grassfire transform.

40|$|A {{detailed}} algebraic-geometric {{background is}} presented for the tropical approach to enumeration of singular <b>curves</b> on toric surfaces, {{which consists of}} reducing the enumeration of algebraic <b>curves</b> to that of non-Archimedean amoebas, the images of algebraic <b>curves</b> by a real-valued non-Archimedean valuation. This idea was proposed by Kontsevich and recently realized by Mikhalkin, who enumerated the nodal <b>curves</b> on toric surfaces. The main technical tools are a refined tropicalization of one-parametric equisingular families of <b>curves</b> and the patchworking construction of singular algebraic <b>curves.</b> The case of <b>curves</b> with a cusp and the case of real nodal <b>curves</b> are also treated...|$|R

5|$|A flow is {{a process}} in which the points of a {{mathematical}} space continuously change their locations or properties over time.

5|$|For {{a simple}} closed <b>curve,</b> using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth <b>curve</b> would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine <b>curve</b> is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E
