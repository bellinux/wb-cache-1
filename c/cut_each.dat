5|$|Kikuyu girls <b>cut</b> <b>each</b> other's vulvas in the 1950s as {{a symbol}} of defiance, {{in the context of the}} {{campaign}} against female genital mutilation in colonial Kenya. The movement came to be known as Ngaitana ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 2000, {{in a live}} radio {{interview}} on KROQ-FM (Los Angeles), Billy Corgan announced the band's decision to break {{up at the end}} of that year following additional touring and recording. The group's final album before the break-up, Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music, was released in September 2000 in a limited pressing on vinyl with permission and instructions for free redistribution on the Internet by fans. Only twenty-five copies were <b>cut,</b> <b>each</b> of which was hand numbered and given to friends of the band along with band members themselves. The album, released under the Constantinople Records label created by Corgan, consisted of one double LP and three ten-inch EPs. Originally, the band asked Virgin to offer Machina II as a free download to anyone who bought Machina. When the record label declined, Corgan opted to release the material independently.|$|E

50|$|Make a slice {{through the}} corner of the polyhedron, cutting through all the edges {{connected}} to the vertex. The cut surface is the vertex figure. This is perhaps the most common approach, and the most easily understood. Different authors make the slice in different places. Wenninger (2003) <b>cuts</b> <b>each</b> edge a unit distance from the vertex, as does Coxeter (1948). For uniform polyhedra the Dorman Luke construction <b>cuts</b> <b>each</b> connected edge at its midpoint. Other authors make the cut through the vertex {{at the other end of}} each edge.|$|R

25|$|Milne {{toured the}} Caucasus in early 1919 and thought “the {{country and the}} {{inhabitants}} are equally loathsome” and that British withdrawal “would probably lead to anarchy” but “the world would (not) lose much if {{the whole of the}} country <b>cut</b> <b>each</b> other’s throats. They are certainly not worth the life of a single British soldier”. At the end of August 1919 the British withdrew from Baku (the small British naval presence was also withdrawn from the Caspian Sea), leaving only 3 battalions at Batum. Lord Curzon, Foreign Secretary, wanted a British presence in the region, although to Curzon’s fury (he thought it “abuse of authority”) the CIGS Henry Wilson gave Milne permission to withdraw if he deemed it necessary. After a British garrison at Enzeli (on the Persian Caspian coast) was taken prisoner by Bolshevik forces on 19 May 1920, Lloyd George finally insisted on a withdrawal from Batum early in June 1920. Financial retrenchment forced a British withdrawal from Persia in the spring of 1921.|$|E
500|$|Around 1747, Boydell {{published}} {{his first major}} work, The Bridge Book, for which he drew and <b>cut</b> <b>each</b> print himself. It cost one shilling and contained six landscapes in each of which, not surprisingly, a bridge featured prominently. [...] A year later, in 1748, Boydell, apparently financially secure, married Elizabeth Lloyd. The couple {{did not have any}} children and Elizabeth died in 1781.|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte de Sauve {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as a source}} of the information that led to the execution of Marguerite de Valois's lover Joseph Boniface de La Môle and Annibal de Coconnas for engaging in a conspiracy to overthrow the gravely ill Charles IX and the Queen Mother in 1574 with the assistance of Huguenot troops. In 1575, Catherine de' Medici, abetted by her son Henry III, instructed Charlotte to seduce the king's brother, her youngest son, François, Duke of Alençon, with the aim of provoking hostility between the two young men, so that they would not conspire together in the future. Charlotte subsequently became the duke's mistress, creating a rift between the former close friends, as Navarre and Alençon became rivals over Charlotte. According to Marguerite's memoirs: [...] "Charlotte de Sauve treated both of them [...] {{in such a way that}} they became extremely jealous of each other, to such a point that they forgot their ambitions, their duties and their plans and thought of nothing but chasing after this woman". Henry of Navarre wrote to a friend: [...] "The court is the strangest I have ever known. We are nearly always ready to <b>cut</b> <b>each</b> other's throat ... All the band you know wants my death on account of my love for Monsieur [...] and they have forbidden for the third time my mistress [...] to speak to me. They have such a hold on her that she does not dare look at me. I am waiting for a minor battle, for they say they will kill me, and I want to be one jump ahead of them". On one occasion, Henry III had Alençon's papers searched for evidence of political plotting but turned up only a declaration of love from Madame de Sauve.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the head}} of WHCA, Williams argued a tax case against the Washington Department of Revenue on behalf of {{boarding}} homes and negotiated a settlement ratified by the Legislature in 2004. Under the settlement, estimated to be worth over $31 million in just the first four years, boarding homes pay less than one-fifth of the tax rate the state was looking to impose through a change in regulatory interpretation. [...] During his tenure, nursing home care faced proposed $72 million Medicaid budget <b>cuts</b> <b>each</b> year from 2002-04; the cut proposed in 2002 would have been $14.13 per day for each patient. [...] WHCA defeated those <b>cuts</b> <b>each</b> legislative session and turned them into a $33.1 million funding increase in 2003 and a $19.3 million funding increase in 2004 that boarding homes shared.|$|R

40|$|Twelve {{intact and}} 12 docked Najdi lambs of {{equal numbers of}} males and females were {{utilized}} in the experiment. Upon attaining 40 kg fasted and shorn body weight the lambs were slaughtered and their carcasses were dissected into wholesale <b>cuts.</b> <b>Each</b> <b>cut</b> was then dissected into lean, fat and bone, which were weighed separately. The data showed that docked lambs were 19 days earlier in attaining the designated slaughter body weight and produced carcasses with 1. 33 and 0. 20 kg more weights in primal and rough cuts, respectively, compared to intact lambs. Also, the total separable lean weigh in primal cuts was heavier for the docked lambs in comparison to intact lambs which reflected significant differences (P< 0. 05) in lean weight from wholesale loin and rack cuts. Non-significant differences were observed for the amounts of separable fat deposited in <b>each</b> <b>cut</b> between docked and intacy lambs except for wholesale leg cut. No significant differences were detected between the docked and intact groups for bone weight in <b>each</b> <b>cut...</b>|$|R
