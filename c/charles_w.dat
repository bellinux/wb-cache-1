5|$|<b>Charles</b> <b>W.</b> Holliday and Joseph R.

The 2% percent of S.grandis that overlapped with S.convallis were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second.

5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer <b>Charles</b> <b>W.</b> Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} Fleming's other Bond stories, {{he used the}} names of people he knew, or knew of, {{throughout}} his story, including the book's eponymous villain, who was named after British architect Ern≈ë Goldfinger.

Fleming had based the actual character on American gold tycoon <b>Charles</b> <b>W.</b> Engelhard, Jr. Fleming also used a number of his own experiences within the book, and the round of golf played with Goldfinger was based upon a tournament in 1957 at the Berkshire Golf Club in which Fleming partnered the Open winner Peter Thomson.|$|E

5|$|In the 1908 presidential election, Bradley {{supported}} <b>Charles</b> <b>W.</b> Fairbanks for the Republican nomination, while Willson favored William Howard Taft.

This infuriated Bradley and ended his alliance with Willson. In the 1911 Republican nominating convention, Bradley did not support Edward C. O'Rear, the party's eventual gubernatorial nominee. He did little to support O'Rear in the general election, and former governor James B. McCreary was elected.|$|E
