5|$|<b>Charles</b> <b>W.</b> Holliday and Joseph R.

The 2% percent of S.grandis that overlapped with S.convallis were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. The markings on S.grandis males {{were found to be}} the same as on females.|$|E

5|$|Chotiner {{continued}} to practice law. In 1962, his wife Ruth obtained an interlocutory divorce decree against him. After the decree became final, Chotiner married again in 1965. In January 1966, attorney and land developer <b>Charles</b> <b>W.</b> Hinman {{was arrested and}} charged with plotting to have Chotiner murdered. Chotiner had represented Hinman's wife in a contested divorce case, and Hinman had been jailed for eleven days for failure to pay his fees. No actual attempt on his life took place. Hinman was sentenced to between one and five years in prison. In 1957, one of Chotiner's divorce clients had been killed along with her daughter by the client's estranged husband in the attorney's Beverly Hills office.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer <b>Charles</b> <b>W.</b> Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} Fleming's other Bond stories, {{he used the}} names of people he knew, or knew of, {{throughout}} his story, including the book's eponymous villain, who was named after British architect Ernő Goldfinger. Upon learning {{of the use of}} his name, Goldfinger threatened to sue over the use of the name, before the matter was settled out of court. Fleming had based the actual character on American gold tycoon <b>Charles</b> <b>W.</b> Engelhard, Jr. Fleming also used a number of his own experiences within the book, and the round of golf played with Goldfinger was based upon a tournament in 1957 at the Berkshire Golf Club in which Fleming partnered the Open winner Peter Thomson.|$|E

5|$|In the 1908 presidential election, Bradley {{supported}} <b>Charles</b> <b>W.</b> Fairbanks for the Republican nomination, while Willson favored William Howard Taft. Disharmony marred {{the state}} nominating convention, and despite being a newly minted senator, Bradley was not chosen as a {{delegate to the}} Republican National Convention. This infuriated Bradley and ended his alliance with Willson. In the 1911 Republican nominating convention, Bradley did not support Edward C. O'Rear, the party's eventual gubernatorial nominee. He did little to support O'Rear in the general election, and former governor James B. McCreary was elected.|$|E

5|$|Over Ross's protests, {{the men of}} the Sixth Regiment {{elected him}} colonel in 1862.

Their brigade commander, General <b>Charles</b> <b>W.</b> Phifer, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge. Ross's actions impressed other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862, he was nominated for promotion to brigadier general. Although he was not promoted at that time, his unit {{was the only one of}} the 810 dismounted cavalry units in the area to be promised the return of their horses.|$|E
