5|$|While body {{piercing}} has grown more widespread, it can remain controversial, particularly in youth. Some countries impose age of consent laws requiring parental permission for minors to receive {{body piercing}}s. Scotland requires parental consent for youths below 16, while in 2011 Wales began considering a similar law. In addition to imposing parental <b>consent</b> <b>requirements,</b> Western Australia prohibits piercing private areas of minors, including genitals and nipples, on penalty of fine and imprisonment for the piercer. Many {{states in the}} US also require parental consent to pierce minors, with some also requiring the physical presence of the parents during the act. The state of Idaho has imposed a minimum age for body piercing at 14.|$|E
5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive <b>consent</b> <b>requirements</b> in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E

2500|$|Applying {{this new}} {{standard}} to the challenged Pennsylvania Act, the plurality {{struck down the}} spousal notice requirement, finding that for many women, the statutory provision would impose a substantial obstacle in their path to receive an abortion. The plurality recognized that the provision gave too much power to husbands over their wives ("a spousal notice requirement enables the husband to wield an effective veto over his wife's decision"), and could worsen situations of spousal and child abuse. In finding the provision unconstitutional, {{the authors of the}} plurality opinion clarified that the focus of the undue burden test is on the group [...] "for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant." [...] Otherwise stated, courts should not focus on what portion of the population is affected by the legislation, but rather on the population the law would restrict. The plurality upheld the remaining contested regulations – the State's informed consent and 24-hour waiting period, parental <b>consent</b> <b>requirements,</b> reporting requirements, and the [...] "medical emergencies" [...] definition – holding that none constituted an undue burden.|$|E

40|$|Background: In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates {{clinical}} trials. These regulations address good clinical {{practices as}} well as human subject protection (FDA, 2012). One {{of the most important}} legal and ethical concerns in clinical trials is informed consent. 21 CFR 50 governs human subjects research. Part 50. 24 provides an emergency research exception to the informed <b>consent</b> <b>requirement.</b> Research was conducted to determine the appropriateness of this exception, whether the benefit justifies the exception, and its public health significance. ^ Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted and articles were identified from peer-reviewed journals. ^ Results: There is some variance in opinions regarding the appropriateness of the exception, but the literature reviewed found the study results of these trials justified the waiver. ^ Conclusion: The exception to the informed <b>consent</b> <b>requirement</b> is likely appropriate and justified in emergency research when implemented within the specified guidelines. ...|$|R

40|$|John Locke {{held that}} every person has a natural duty to use her {{property}} efficiently, and that consent is required for legitimate political power. On the face of it, these two positions {{seem to be in}} tension. This is because, (1) according to Locke, it is nearly impossible to use resources efficiently unless one lives within a political community, and (2) the waste restriction is enforceable. Consequently, it might seem that persons living outside civil society may be forced to submit to civil power, in violation of the <b>consent</b> <b>requirement.</b> I argue that this tension is only apparent; although the waste restriction is enforceable, the <b>consent</b> <b>requirement</b> is safe. But in the course of resolving this difficulty, three significant, but little-noticed, features of Locke's doctrine of consent to government come to light: (A) consent is conceptually necessary, and not just morally required, for persons to be subject to political power; (B) most people living outside civil society have a moral obligation to enter civil society if they can; and (C) consent to government can bind under duress so long as the duress does not render anyone dependent on the arbitrary wills of others...|$|R

5000|$|The plaintiffs brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, seeking injunctive relief.

The panel {{consisted}} of Eighth Circuit Judge William Hedgcock Webster, District Judge Harris Kenneth Wangelin, and Senior District Judge Roy Winfield Harper. The court held that Section 6(1) of the challenged act, which [...] "prescribed the standard of care which a person performing an abortion must exercise {{for the protection of}} the fetus" [...] was unconstitutionally overboard. It upheld the rest of the challenged act. Judge Webster concurred with the panel majority in finding 6(1) overboard and upholding [...] "the constitutional validity of Section 2(2)1 (defining [...] "viability"), Section 3(2) (requiring the woman's written consent to an abortion), Section 10 (maintenance of records) and Section 11 (retention of records)." [...] He dissented from the majority opinion with respect to four other provisions: 3(3) (spousal <b>consent</b> <b>requirement),</b> 3(4) (parental <b>consent</b> <b>requirement),</b> 7 (termination of parental rights if child is born alive), and 9 (prohibition of saline amniocentesis method of abortion).|$|R
