This paper focuses {{on the role of}} regional government in sustainable production <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> polices, one of the specific topics in the framework of the European Regional Sustainable Development Network activities. Issues of sustainable production <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> are very broad. This paper focuses on policies and instruments directed towards sustainable production <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> in regions. The paper elaborates current theory and practice in the area of sustainable production <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> policies to answer the main question of what are the key challenges and opportunities for regional government. The paper starts with a short overview of current (policy) thinking in the field of regional sustainable production <b>and</b> <b>consumption.</b> We then identify the theoretical and practical issues for both regional policy development and regional stakeholder involvement in the field of regional sustainable production <b>and</b> <b>consumption.</b> Finally, we explore examples of good practice in the development of regional public policy related to sustainable production <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> patterns <b>and</b> identify some key messages for both the EU and the regions...|$|R

In addition, we identified two psychosocial predictors of resemblance, namely parenting style and adolescents' self-monitoring. As expected, results indicated that authoritative parenting style increased target-parent resemblance in food likes (directly) <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> (indirectly), <b>and</b> self-monitoring orientation increased target-friend resemblance in food likes (directly) <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> (indirectly). We also showed that target-friend resemblance was more culture-based than target-parent resemblance, suggesting that parental influence is more specific to the dyadic relation than is peer influence...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to test the {{relationships}} between physical environment, price perceptions, <b>consumption</b> emotions, <b>and</b> customer satisfaction in Chinese resort hotels. Five hundred self-administered questionnaires were distributed, and 340 were returned. Findings from this study reveal that the physical environment is a significant predictor of <b>consumption</b> emotions <b>and</b> price perceptions, which in turn affect customer satisfaction. Moreover, <b>consumption</b> emotions <b>and</b> price perceptions significantly mediate the relationship between physical environment and customer satisfaction. The management of resort hotels needs to consider that an attractive physical environment can be used for developing positive <b>consumption</b> emotions <b>and</b> price perceptions among customers, which may then increase their satisfaction...|$|R

5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change <b>consumption</b> <b>and</b> savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E
