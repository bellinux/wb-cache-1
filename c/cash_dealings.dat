But there were details of the outlay in which Lemuel was of use, and he had brought greater comfort into the house for less money. He rejected her old and simple device of postponing the payment of debt as an economical measure, and substituted <b>cash</b> <b>dealings</b> with new purveyors. He gradually but inevitably took charge of the store- room, and stopped the waste there; early in his administration he had observed the gross and foolish prodigality with which the portions were sent from the carving-room, and after replacing Mrs. Harmon's nephew there, he established a standard portion that gave all the needed variety, and still kept the quantity within bounds. It came to his taking charge of this department entirely, and as steward he carved the meats, and saw that nothing was in a way to become cold before he opened the dining-room doors as head-waiter.|$|E
50|$|The Gemini-Vikatan {{umbrella}} {{was one of}} {{the earliest}} media organisations that sought to be a professionally managed and the first instance of a vertically integrated organisation in Asia. Initially as joint managing director along with his father S. S. Vasan and later as managing director of the media empire, Balan brought soul and substance to the films made under the Gemini banner by writing, producing and then directing more than 30 films in six languages. The film he first worked on and scripted was the Hindi film Grihasti in 1955 starring Ashok Kumar. This was later remade in Tamil as Motor Sundaram Pillai starring Shivaji Ganesan along with an ensemble cast and was the directorial debut of Balan. Some of the films he made not only were highly successful and memorable, but they also went on to establish the careers of many new talents introduced into the film industry such as Amitabh Bachchan (his first starring role in the unsuccessful Sanjog, 1970), Jayalalitha (Motor Sundaram Pillai), Ravichandran (Motor Sundaram Pillai), Rajesh Khanna (Aurat), Shivakumar (Motor Sundaram Pillai) etc. to name a few. Leading the cause for industry status recognition in the country for films, Vasan and Balan resolved to say no to <b>cash</b> <b>dealings</b> in film/media production to bring in transparency {{at a time when it}} was unheard of half a century ago. When the studio system itself came under siege in the late 1960s, Mr Balan pioneered independent film financing and helped many emerging filmmakers establish themselves successfully outside the studios by providing guidance, production design and packages to assist them. He ran the media empire successfully while his father, S.S. Vasan who was nominated to the Rajya Sabha as a member of parliament from 1964 till his death in 1969 could focus on his parliamentary duties in Delhi. In the mid-1970s, the colossal failure of his magnum opus in four languages (Hindi, Tamil and Telugu) titled Ellorum Nallavare precipitated the shut down of the Gemini Studios. In the early 1980s with the decline of the studio system, Balan sought to focus on publishing and sold the film company and its assets while retaining Vasan Publications/Ananda Vikatan. One of the last films directed by him was Nishan in Bengali starring Uttam Kumar in 1978. As producer, writer and director, films made by S. S. Balan include, Grihasthi, Gharana, Aurat, Motor Sundaram Pillai, Olivilakku, Teen Bahuraniyan, Lakhon Mein Ek, Sanjog, Shatranj, Siriththu Vaazha Vendum, Nishaan, Maadaivam and Ellorum Nallavare. He has directed and worked on films with many top actors in India across Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada and Bengali, including MGR, NTR, Shivaji Ganesan, Muthuraman, Raj Kumar, Rajendra Kumar, Prithviraj Kapoor, Mehmood, Amitabh Bacchan and Rajesh Khanna.|$|E
