This instability shows up as a broadening of the energy spectrum lines, which perturbation theory fails to reproduce entirely.|$|E

40|$|We solve infinite-dimensional {{stochastic}} {{differential equations}} (ISDEs) describing {{an infinite number}} of Brownian particles interacting via two-dimensional <b>Coulomb</b> <b>potentials.</b> The equilibrium states of the associated unlabeled stochastic dynamics are the Ginibre random point field and Dyson's measures, which appear in random matrix theory. To solve the ISDEs we establish an integration by parts formula for these measures. Because the long-range effect of two-dimensional <b>Coulomb</b> <b>potentials</b> is quite strong, the properties of Brownian particles interacting with two-dimensional <b>Coulomb</b> <b>potentials</b> are remarkably different from those of Brownian particles interacting with Ruelle's class interaction potentials.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel, geometrically {{adaptive}} method for surface reconstruction from noisy and sparse point clouds, without orientation information. The method employs a fast convection algorithm {{to attract the}} evolving surface towards the data points. The force field in which the surface is convected is based on generalized <b>Coulomb</b> <b>potentials</b> evaluated on an adaptive grid (i. e., an octree) using a fast, hierarchical algorithm. Formulating reconstruction as a convection problem in a velocity field generated by <b>Coulomb</b> <b>potentials</b> offers a number of advantages. Unlike methods which compute {{the distance from the}} data set to the implicit surface, which are sensitive to noise due to the very reliance on the distance transform, our method is highly resilient to shot noise since global, generalized <b>Coulomb</b> <b>potentials</b> can be used to disregard the presence of outliers due to noise. <b>Coulomb</b> <b>potentials</b> represent longrange interactions that consider all data points at once, and thus they convey global information which is crucial in the fitting process. Both the spatial and temporal complexities of our spatially-adaptive method are proportional {{to the size of the}} reconstructed object, which makes our method compare favorably with respect to previous approaches in terms of speed and flexibility. Experiments with sparse as well as noisy data sets show that the method is capable of delivering crisp and detailed yet smooth surfaces. ...|$|R

The negative sign of the exponential gives the interaction an effectively finite range, so that particles at great distances will hardly interact any longer (interaction forces drop off exponentially with increasing separation).|$|E

2500|$|Early {{attempts}} to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved {{the replacement of}} the Schrödinger equation with a covariant equation such as the Klein–Gordon equation or the Dirac equation. While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory, which applies quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles). The first complete quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics, provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction. The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems. A simpler approach, one that has been employed since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field. For example, the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric field of the hydrogen atom using a classical [...] <b>Coulomb</b> <b>potential.</b> This [...] "semi-classical" [...] approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of photons by charged particles.|$|E
