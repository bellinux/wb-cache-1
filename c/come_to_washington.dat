He visited Berkeley to look at Lawrence's calutrons, and met with Oppenheimer, who gave him a report on bomb design on 8 October. Groves was interested in Oppenheimer's proposal to establish a separate bomb design laboratory. When they met again in Chicago a week later, he invited Oppenheimer to discuss the issue. Groves had to catch a train to New York, so he asked Oppenheimer to accompany him {{so that they could}} continue the discussion. Groves, Oppenheimer, and Colonel James C. Marshall and Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols all squeezed into a single compartment where they talked about how a bomb laboratory could be created, and how it would function. Groves subsequently had Oppenheimer <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., where the matter was discussed with Vannevar Bush, the {{director of}} the OSRD, and James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). On 19 October, Groves approved the establishment of a bomb laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Meeker's farm at Swamp Place was not {{a success}} as the land was too poor to grow crops. The family {{continued}} to run the store in Steilacoom. On January 5, 1861, Oliver Meeker drowned while returning from a buying trip to San Francisco, when his ship, the Northerner, sank off the California coast. The Meekers had borrowed to finance the trip, and the losses from this disaster reduced Ezra Meeker to near penury. He secured the squatter's claim of Jerry Stilly on land in the Puyallup Valley, and moved {{his wife and children}} there in 1862. While clearing his own holdings, he earned money by helping to clear the land of others. His father and surviving brother, John Meeker, also had claims in the valley. John Meeker had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> Territory by ship in 1859 and had settled in the Puyallup Valley. Ezra Meeker ran for the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1861, but was defeated. In 1869, Meeker ran for Pierce County Surveyor; he was defeated by James Gallagher, 138 votes to 116.|$|E

25|$|When Jefferson {{retired in}} 1809 he had {{accumulated}} many possessions while in Washington, {{which included a}} huge collection of books. Organizing and packing these things was a great task. Jefferson summoned Bacon to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> with two servants to help him pack, load and supervise the transport of these things back to Monticello. Together they loaded about thirty crates which would {{be sent back to}} Monticello by water.

25|$|In late 1860 President Buchanan was formulating his yearly State of the Union {{address to}} Congress, and asked Attorney General Black to offer {{insight into the}} {{legality}} and constitutionality of secession. Black then asked Stanton for advice. Stanton approved a strongly worded draft of Black's response to Buchanan, which denounced secession from the Union as illegal. Buchanan gave his address to Congress on December 3. Meanwhile, Buchanan's cabinet were growing more discontent with his handling of secession, and several members deemed him too weak on the issue. On December 5 his Secretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb resigned. On December 9 Secretary of State Lewis Cass, disgruntled over Buchanan's failure to defend the government's interests in the South, tendered his resignation. Black was nominated to replace Cass on December 12. About a week later, Stanton, {{at the time in}} Cincinnati, was told to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> at once, for he had been confirmed by the Senate as Buchanan's new Attorney General.

500|$|Lincoln {{faced the}} {{question}} of what to do about Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, held by the Army against the will of South Carolinians, who had blockaded it. The fort's commander, Major Robert Anderson, had sent word that he would run out of supplies. Seward, backed by most of the Cabinet, recommended to Lincoln that an attempt to resupply Sumter would be provocative to the border states, that Lincoln hoped to keep from seceding. Seward hinted to the commissioners that had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> on behalf of the Confederacy that Sumter would be surrendered. [...] Lincoln was loath to give up Sumter, feeling it would only encourage the South in its insurgency.|$|E
500|$|In July 1864, New York {{publisher}} Horace Greeley {{sent word}} to Lincoln {{that there were}} Southern peace emissaries in Canada.

[...] Greeley reported to Lincoln that the emissaries lacked accreditation by Davis, but were confident they could bring both sides together. Lincoln sent Hay to Ontario with {{what became known as the}} Niagara Manifesto: that if the South laid down its arms, freed the slaves, and reentered the Union, it could expect liberal terms on other points.

500|$|After {{the end of}} the First World War, many navies—including {{those of}} the United States, the United Kingdom, and Imperial Japan—continued and {{expanded}} construction programs that had begun during the conflict.
