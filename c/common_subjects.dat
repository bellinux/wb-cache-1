5|$|Depictions in {{classical}} art are rare for such striking birds. The only known Ancient Egyptian {{example is a}} relief, probably of a little green bee-eater, on a wall of Queen Hatshepsut's mortuary temple, and an early Roman mural depicting blue-cheeked bee-eaters {{was found in the}} villa of Agrippina. Bee-eaters have been depicted on the postage stamps of at least 38 countries, the European and Carmine bee-eaters being the most <b>common</b> <b>subjects,</b> with 18 and 11 countries respectively.|$|E

Critics generally praised the game for its detailed graphics, deep and long levels, and advanced artificial intelligence of enemies. However, the game's inconsistent frame rate and intense distance fog were <b>common</b> <b>subjects</b> of criticism. A remastered version of the game developed by Night Dive Studios was released for Microsoft Windows in 2017. A sequel, , was released in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in {{many other}} moths, the colour of C. rhipheuss wings {{does not come from}} pigments. The colour {{originates}} from coherent scattering and interference of light by the microstructure of the ribbon-like scales covering the moth's wings. These structural characteristics make this species and its Neotropical relative Urania <b>common</b> <b>subjects</b> of research in optical science.|$|E

5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and {{the ease with}} which they may be grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were <b>common</b> <b>subjects</b> in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of the}} hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E

25|$|Many urban {{legends and}} misconceptions about drugs {{have been created}} and {{circulated}} among young people and the general public, {{with varying degrees of}} veracity. These are commonly repeated by organizations which oppose all classified drug use, often causing the true effects and dangers of drugs to be misunderstood and less scrutinized. The most <b>common</b> <b>subjects</b> of such false beliefs are LSD, cannabis, and MDMA. These misconceptions include misinformation about adulterants or other black market issues, as well as alleged effects of the pure substances.|$|E
25|$|In visual art, the plagues have {{generally}} been reserved for works in series, especially engravings. Still, relatively few depictions in art emerged compared to other religious themes until the 19th century, when the plagues became more <b>common</b> <b>subjects,</b> with John Martin and Joseph Turner producing notable canvases. This trend probably reflected a Romantic attraction to landscape and nature painting, for which the plagues were suited, a Gothic attraction to morbid stories, and a rise in Orientalism, wherein exotic Egyptian themes found currency. Given the importance of noble patronage throughout Western art history, the plagues may have found consistent disfavor because the stories emphasize the limits of a monarch's power, and images of lice, locusts, darkness, and boils were ill-suited for decoration in palaces and churches.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} {{the players and the}} nature of the rules are <b>common</b> <b>subjects</b> of debate with every edition. It {{continued}} to cause confusion until 2013 when it was clarified that the CLT20 rules state the players are free to choose their team. However, for a player named in an IPL team's squad, he would have to forego 20% of his salary to choose another team. The IPL offers the most lucrative salaries and is the only tournament to have a clause relating to the CLT20 in its contracts. As a result, players are unlikely to choose against their IPL teams. For non-IPL teams wanting to keep their players, not only would they be forfeiting the compensation fee, some have felt the need to offer their players compensation in an attempt to sway their decision.|$|E

25|$|A special form of Attic vases of {{this period}} was the Tyrrhenian amphora (550-530 BC). These were egg-shaped neck amphora with decorations {{atypical}} of the usual Attic design canon of the period. Almost all of the c. 200 surviving vases were found in Etruria. The body of the amphora is usually subdivided into several parallel friezes. The upper or shoulder frieze usually shows a popular scene from mythology. There are sometimes less <b>common</b> <b>subjects,</b> such as a unique scene of the sacrificing of Polyxena. The first known erotic images on Attic vases are also found at this vase location. The painters frequently put annotations on Tyrrhenian amphora which identify the persons shown. The other two or three friezes were decorated with animals; sometimes {{one of them was}} replaced with a plant frieze. The neck is customarily painted with a lotus palmette cross or festoons. The amphoras are quite colorful and recall Corinthian products. In this case a Corinthian form was obviously deliberately copied to produce a particular vase type for the Etruscan market, where the style was popular. It is possible that this form was not manufactured in Athens but somewhere else in Attica, or even outside Attica. Important painters were the Castellani Painter and the Goltyr Painter.|$|E
500|$|Sleep {{and dreams}} were <b>common</b> <b>subjects</b> for the Zürich-born Henry Fuseli, though The Nightmare is unique among his {{paintings}} for {{its lack of}} reference to literary or religious themes (Fuseli was an ordained minister). His first known painting is Joseph Interpreting the Dreams of the Butler and Baker of Pharaoh (1768), and later he produced [...] (1798) inspired by John Milton's Paradise Lost, and Richard III Visited by Ghosts (1798) based on Shakespeare's play.|$|E

500|$|Dunstanburgh's ruins {{became a}} popular subject for {{artists from the}} end of the 18th century onwards. Thomas Girtin toured the region, and painted the castle, his picture {{dominated}} by what art historian Souren Melikian describes as [...] "the forces of nature unleashed", with [...] "wild waves" [...] and dark clouds swirling around the ruins. J. M. W. Turner was influenced by Girtin, and when he first painted the castle in 1797 he similarly focused on the wind and the waves around the ancient ruins, taking some artistic licence with the view of the castle to reinforce its sense of isolated and former grandeur. Turner drew on his visit to produce further works in oils, watercolours, etchings and sketches, through until the 1830s, making the castle one of the most <b>common</b> <b>subjects</b> in his corpus of work.|$|E
500|$|Trees {{feature in}} many of Ursula K. Le Guin's books, {{including}} the forest world of Athshe and the Immanent Grove on Roke in the Earthsea series, {{to such an extent}} that in her introduction to her collection The Wind's Twelve Quarters, she admits to [...] "a certain obsession with trees" [...] and describes herself as [...] "the most arboreal science fiction writer". James Cameron's 2009 film Avatar features a giant tree named Hometree, the sacred gathering place of the humanoid Na'vi tribe; the interconnected tree, tribe and planet are threatened by mining: the tribe and the film's hero fight to save them. Trees are <b>common</b> <b>subjects</b> in poetry, including Joyce Kilmer's 1913 lyric poem named [...] "Trees". Flowers, similarly, are the subjects of many poems by poets such as William Blake, Robert Frost, and Rabindranath Tagore.|$|E
