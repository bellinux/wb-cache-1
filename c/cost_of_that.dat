He sends Kotarō to the school, where Genzō and Tonami decide {{he is the only}} one at the school whose head could pass for Kan Shūsai's. This scene {{is a classic example of}} the {{conflict}} between giri (honor, fealty) and ninjō (human compassion), as Genzō and Tonami sacrifice an innocent boy to save their master's son. When the sound of Genzō's sword striking off Kotarō's head is heard from offstage, Matsuōmaru strikes a distinctive Matsuō mie pose, expressing his suppressed anguish. He then departs with the head in a box, to identify it for Shihei as Kan Shūsai's head, pretending to have done the deed and thus saving Kan Shūsai's life.|$|E
25|$|S. 517 {{would impose}} a private-sector mandate by {{eliminating}} an existing right {{of action for}} wireless carriers (and others), who are currently able to pursue legal action against those who, without permission, circumvent the access controls on certain wireless telephone handsets. The cost of the mandate would be the forgone net value of settlements and damages in such cases. A search of the literature suggests that few, if any, of those types of lawsuits have been brought against individual consumers. Because such claims would probably be uncommon {{in the future and}} the damage awards allowed in such cases would be relatively small, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate would be small and fall below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandate ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). If the Librarian of Congress decides to broaden the exemption allowed under the bill to cover other types of mobile devices, such an action would eliminate additional rights of action. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> expansion would depend on what devices the Librarian would include under the exemption and the forgone net value of settlements and damages. CBO has no basis to estimate the cost of such mandates as it would depend on the regulatory actions taken by the Librarian.|$|E

[...] The Virginia Constitution of 1902 included defined first-class cities as those having a population of 10,000 or more based upon the last census enumeration, while second-class cities were those that had a population of fewer than 10,000. [...] Cities which previously had been granted a city charter, but {{did not have the}} requisite population, had their status grandfathered in.

The significant amount of research into the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> children to couple and sole parent households has been important in assessing and developing family support policies. Changing societal expectations {{about the level of}} involvement of fathers in child rearing activities has highlighted the need to understand the costs facing usually male non-resident parents in having contact with their children. The budget standards methodology is used in this paper to estimate the costs for non-resident parents exercising regular contact with their children. <b>Costs</b> <b>of</b> contact are found to be high.
