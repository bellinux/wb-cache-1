25|$|Because {{of their}} gentler {{conditioning}} regimens, these transplants {{are associated with}} a lower risk of transplant-related mortality and therefore allow patients who are considered too high-risk for conventional allogeneic HSCT to undergo potentially curative therapy for their disease. The optimal conditioning strategy for each disease and recipient has not been fully established, but RIC can be used in elderly patients unfit for myeloablative regimens, for whom a higher risk of <b>cancer</b> <b>relapse</b> may be acceptable.|$|E
25|$|A newer {{treatment}} approach, non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation, also termed reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), uses {{doses of}} chemotherapy and radiation {{too low to}} eradicate all the bone marrow cells of the recipient. Instead, non-myeloablative transplants run lower risks of serious infections and transplant-related mortality while relying upon the graft versus tumor effect to resist the inherent increased risk of <b>cancer</b> <b>relapse.</b> Also significantly, while requiring high doses of immunosuppressive agents {{in the early stages}} of treatment, these doses are less than for conventional transplants. This leads to a state of mixed chimerism early after transplant where both recipient and donor HSC coexist in the bone marrow space.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemotherapy}} or irradiation given immediately {{prior to}} a transplant is called the conditioning regimen, the purpose {{of which is to}} help eradicate the patient's disease prior to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be ablated (destroyed) with dose-levels that cause minimal injury to other tissues. In allogeneic transplants a combination of cyclophosphamide with total body irradiation is conventionally employed. This treatment also has an immunosuppressive effect that prevents rejection of the HSC by the recipient's immune system. The post-transplant prognosis often includes acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease that may be life-threatening. However, in certain leukemias this can coincide with protection against <b>cancer</b> <b>relapse</b> owing to the graft-versus-tumor effect. Autologous transplants may also use similar conditioning regimens, but many other chemotherapy combinations can be used {{depending on the type of}} disease.|$|E

Gus is 17 in the book but 18 in the film. In the book, Gus has an ex-girlfriend, Caroline, who died from cancer which is not mentioned in the film. Hazel's former best friend Kaitlyn does not appear in the film. In the book, Hazel and Gus meet when she turns around to find him staring at her, while in the film they meet on the way to their support group. Gus dies more quickly in the film than in the book. In the book, Hazel searches for the letter, while in the film, Van Houten gives it to her. In the book, Hazel shows forgiveness towards van Houten after Gus's funeral, while in the film she demands that he leave. In the book, Hazel is a vegetarian but this is not referenced in the film. A scene in the film in which Gus comes in a limousine to pick up Hazel and her mother when they are leaving for Amsterdam, does not appear in the book. However, in the book, Gus is late when Hazel and her mother arrive at his house in a taxi because he appears to be fighting with his parents over his <b>cancer</b> <b>relapse</b> and the trip.

2500|$|Graft-versus-tumor effect (GVT) or [...] "graft versus leukemia" [...] {{effect is}} the {{beneficial}} {{aspect of the}} Graft-versus-Host phenomenon. For example, HSCT patients with either acute, or in particular chronic, graft-versus-host disease after an allogeneic transplant {{tend to have a}} lower risk of <b>cancer</b> <b>relapse.</b> This is due to a therapeutic immune reaction of the grafted donor T lymphocytes against the diseased bone marrow of the recipient. This lower rate of relapse accounts for the increased success rate of allogeneic transplants, compared to transplants from identical twins, and indicates that allogeneic HSCT is a form of immunotherapy. GVT is the major benefit of transplants that do not employ the highest immuno-suppressive regimens.|$|E

40|$|Radiotherapy is a {{well-established}} therapeutic modality in oncology. It provides survival benefits {{in several different}} cancer types. However, <b>cancers</b> <b>relapsing</b> after radiotherapy often develop into more aggressive conditions, which are difficult to treat and are associated with poor prognosis. Cumulating experimental evidence indicates that the irradiated tumor bed contributes to such aggressive behavior. The involved mechanisms have long remained elusive. Recent progress in the field revealed previously unrecognized cellular and molecular events promoting growth, invasion and metastasis of tumors progressing in an irradiated microenvironment. Cellular mechanisms include inhibition of sprouting angiogenesis, formation of hypoxia, activation and differentiation of stromal cells and recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells with vasculogenic and pro-metastatic activities. Identified pathways include TGFβ/ALK 5, CXCL 12 /CXCR 4, KITL/KIT and CYR 61 /αVβ 5 integrin. The availability of pharmacological inhibitors impinging on these pathways opens novel opportunities for translational and clinical studies. These experimental results and ongoing work highlight {{the importance of the}} irradiated microenvironment in modulating the tumor response to radiotherapy and open new opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for <b>cancer</b> patients <b>relapsing</b> after radiotherapy.

40|$|While {{specific}} mutations allow organisms {{to adapt}} to stressful environments, most changes in an organism's DNA negatively impact fitness. The mutation rate is therefore strictly regulated and often considered a slowly-evolving parameter. In contrast, we demonstrate an unexpected flexibility in cellular mutation rates {{as a response to}} changes in selective pressure. We show that hypermutation independently evolves when different Escherichia coli cultures adapt to high ethanol stress. Furthermore, hypermutator states are transitory and repeatedly alternate with decreases in mutation rate. Specifically, population mutation rates rise when cells experience higher stress and decline again once cells are adapted. Interestingly, we identified cellular mortality as the major force driving the quick evolution of mutation rates. Together, these findings show how organisms balance robustness and evolvability and help explain the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings, ranging from emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes to <b>cancer</b> <b>relapses</b> upon chemotherapy. status: publishe...|$|R
