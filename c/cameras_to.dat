Kiarostami fastened <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> the dashboard of a car, and then allowed his actors to act. There was no film crew in the car, and no director. There is no camera movement, {{other than the}} movement of the car which carries the camera. There is minimal cutting and editing.|$|E

5|$|In April 2012, the WWF and International Rhino Foundation added 120 video <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> the {{existing}} 40 to better monitor rhino movements and judge {{the size of}} the animals' population. A recent survey has found far fewer females than males. Only four females among 17 rhinos were recorded in the eastern half of Ujung Kulon, which is a potential setback in efforts to save the species.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, Gottschalk altered Panavision's {{business}} model. The {{company now}} maintained its full inventory, making its lenses and the cameras it had acquired from MGM available only by rental. This meant that equipment could be maintained, modified, and regularly updated by the company. When Panavision eventually brought its own camera designs to market, it was relatively unconstrained by retrofitting and manufacturing costs, {{as it was}} not directly competing on sales price. This allowed Panavision to build <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> new standards of durability.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} for NASA's imaging team was that, as the mission progressed, the objects being photographed were getting {{farther away from}} the spacecraft, therefore appearing fainter and requiring longer exposures and even slewing (panning) of the <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> achieve good quality. The telecommunication capability also decreased with distance, limiting the number of data modes that could be used by the imaging system.|$|E

5|$|L.A.

Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly five million copies combined. L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files, a subset of the game's cases for virtual reality support through the HTC Vive, will be released in November 2017.|$|E
5|$|Night Trap is an {{interactive}} movie video game developed by Digital Pictures and originally released by Sega for the Sega CD in 1992. The game is presented primarily {{through the use}} of full motion video (FMV). In Night Trap, the player takes the role of a special agent tasked to watch over teenage girls (starring Dana Plato) visiting a house which, unbeknownst to them, is full of danger. The player watches live surveillance footage of the house and triggers traps to capture anyone seen endangering the girls. The player can freely switch their view between different <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> keep watch over the girls and eavesdrop on conversations to follow the story and listen for clues.|$|E

In 2008, TriMet secured {{a grant from the}} Transportation Security Administration to allow the transit agency to add security <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> the station. Portland Community College (PCC) began construction of a training center at the station in 2008, with the $25 million facility then opened in 2009. TriMet had planned to build a third track in 2009 at the station in order to allow the extension of the Red Line to Willow Creek using federal stimulus funds, but canceled the project due to projected costs.|$|E

The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying.

5|$|To {{create the}} bank {{needed for the}} episode, Ilt Jones and the {{location}} department staff found a former bank and current animation school and film production house on Fourth and Main Street in downtown Los Angeles. The building was completely renovated, complete with fake ATMs, columns, desks, and double-glazed windows. All of the items inside of the bank were bought from a bank-supply catalogue by set decorator Tim Stepeck. During the hold-up scene outside the bank, a four-block area was sealed off to allow <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> film. A total of eleven cameras, some at different speeds, were used. Some of the cameras made it onto the film, but they were erased during post-production.|$|E

40|$|In this {{contribution}} it {{is argued}} that vision systems urgently require an open <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> lens communication standard. Traditional machine vision systems are built out of components that are manufactured by different vendors. New lens mounts with an open <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> lens communication standard would also allow machine vision systems to incorporate features that are already common in commercial products. This includes the automatic correction of various types of lens aberrations, including geometric distortion, lateral chromatic aberration, and lens shading. The lack of an open <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> lens communication standard is, however, an even more serious obstacle because modern techniques of computational imaging cannot find wide-spread application in machine vision systems. An open <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> lens communication standard opens up wide-range application to all kinds of computational imaging systems and the machine vision industry is well advised to implement such a standard...|$|R

5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E
5|$|Making {{necessary}} arrangements {{each year}} for {{the growing number of}} pilgrims poses a logistic challenge for the government of Saudi Arabia, which has, since the 1950s, spent more than $100 billion to increase pilgrimage facilities. Major issues like housing, transportation, sanitation, and health care have been addressed and improved greatly by the government by introducing various development programs, with the result that pilgrims now enjoy modern facilities and perform various rites at ease. The Saudi government often sets quota for various countries to keep the pilgrims' number at a manageable level, and arranges huge security forces and CCTV <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> maintain overall safety during Hajj. Various institutions and government programs, such as the Haj subsidy offered in India or the Tabung Haji based in Malaysia assist pilgrims in covering the costs of the journey. For 2014 Hajj, special Hajj information desks were set up at Pakistani airports to assist the pilgrims.|$|E
