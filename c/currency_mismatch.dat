Hence, original sin and <b>currency</b> <b>mismatch</b> are used interchangeable in these early studies. Goldstein and Turner (2003) criticized this by showing that large output losses due to the currency mismatches during financial crises could not be attributed to original sin. Hence, they claimed that the original sin is not a sufficient condition for a <b>currency</b> <b>mismatch.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{cases of}} fear of {{floating}} mainly focus {{on the case of}} currency depreciation. Following the <b>currency</b> <b>mismatch</b> channel and balance sheet effects above, there is an output cost associated with depreciation of domestic currency, sometimes this adverse effect in output is called contractionary depreciation/devaluation.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, {{liability}} dollarization (see Domestic liability dollarization) is {{one main}} reason against floating exchange rate. It {{refers to the}} situations where liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies (usually denominated in US dollar) while assets are in the local currency. Consequently. liability dollarization is also used interchangeably with <b>currency</b> <b>mismatch.</b> Under this <b>currency</b> <b>mismatch,</b> an unexpected depreciation of local currency would deteriorate bank and corporation's balance sheets, and the shrink in asset relative to foreign currency debts would threaten {{the stability of the}} financial system in local country. In countries with significant currency mismatches, the balance sheet effect is quite substantial, ignoring the high exchange rate volatility can prove to be very costly. This could provide an argument for sterilized foreign market intervention.|$|E
50|$|Criticism on {{the concept}} of {{original}} sin has been twofold. On the one hand, Morris Goldstein and Philip Turner claim that original sin is not a sufficient condition for a <b>currency</b> <b>mismatch,</b> and thus cannot account for the large output losses due to the currency mismatches during financial crises. On the other hand, Carmen Reinhart, Kenneth Rogoff and Miguel Savastano claim that the main problem of emerging market economies is to learn how to borrow less rather than learn how to borrow more in their domestic currency. They assumed that the problems of emerging markets were not due to original sin, but to so-called debt intolerance: the inability of emerging markets to manage levels of external debt that, under the same circumstances, would be manageable for developed countries. Eichengreen, Hausmann and Panizza respond to both criticisms in a paper elaborating the difference between currency mismatches, debt intolerance and original sin.|$|E

Contractionary devaluations may arise when firms face maturity or <b>currency</b> <b>mismatches</b> that, when faced with real exchange rate depreciations, lead to balance-sheet effects that erode firms' wealth and lead to an output contraction. While some authors show that the standard Mundell-Fleming result may hold even in the presence of <b>currency</b> <b>mismatches,</b> others point out that, if the balance sheet effect is large enough, devaluations can be contractionary. Using a large panel of 57 countries across the world and various newly constructed measures of dollarization, we test whether the balance sheet effect hypothesis has been relevant during the past decades in explaining economic downturns. Additionally, we explore the channels through which devaluations can be contractionary; in particular, we explore whether investment and consumption decisions are negatively affected by exchange rate devaluations under <b>currency</b> <b>mismatches...</b>|$|R
40|$|Financial {{instability}} is a {{major problem}} for the world's middle-income developing countries. Barry Eichengreen's proposal for dealing with the problem treats <b>currency</b> <b>mismatches</b> [...] the fact that developing countries borrow in dollars instead of their own currency [...] as the principal cause. I argue that institutional flaws, with monetary and fiscal policy for example, drive financial instability and also account for countries' inability to place local-currency denominated debt contracts.

5000|$|Later {{research}} has mainly {{focused on the}} international component of original sin: the inability of most countries to borrow abroad in their own currency. Barry Eichengreen, Hausmann and Ugo Panizza show {{that almost all of}} the countries (except US, Euro area, Japan, UK, and Switzerland) suffered from (international) original sin over time. [...] The authors argued that this international component of original sin has serious consequences. It makes debt riskier, increases volatility, and affects a country's ability to conduct an independent monetary policy. This is because original sin is likely to cause a <b>currency</b> <b>mismatch</b> in the national balance sheet of a country: the currencies of its assets and those of its liabilities do not correspond. Thus, large swings in the real exchange rate will have an effect on aggregate wealth and it will be more difficult for the country to service its debt. In other words, original sin tends to make the fiscal balance dependent on the real exchange rate and the short term real interest rate.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, {{the real}} or {{potential}} costs of DLD exist largely at the systemic level {{and over the}} long term. When DLD is widespread, economic actors are often required to experience a <b>currency</b> <b>mismatch</b> between domestically denominated income and dollar-denominated liabilities, which represent the only available means of long-term borrowing. Currency mismatches are a particular danger for firms and sectors in non-tradable goods and services. Countries {{with high levels of}} DLD, moreover, are often afflicted as well with [...] "Original Sin," [...] a country's inability to borrow in its own currency. While the resulting vulnerability may not be apparent in normal times, it can be revealed during turbulent times, {{even in the absence of}} a major crisis. In economies with fixed or heavily managed exchange rate regimes, for instance, an abrupt change in regime can reveal the exposure of actors who have not hedged for exchange rate risk. Internal as well as external shocks to the real exchange rate and/or real effective rate can produce similarly disruptive balance sheet effects, with economy-wide implications for liquidity. These problems can become particularly acute in an economy without an effective lender of last resort and/or one that issues only domestically denominated debt. Extensive DLD additionally impedes adjustment by means of the real exchange rate and increases the likelihood and severity of a Sudden Stop. Thus, [...] "fear of floating" [...] (that is not allowing the exchange rate to adjust in the face of external shocks, see: floating exchange rate) may be a consequence of DLD, as countries with unofficially dollarized economies may find a freely moving exchange rate to be too costly. Berkmen and Cavallo (2007) tested the causality between DLD and fear of floating empirically. Their findings support the [...] "fear of floating" [...] argument. Countries with high liability dollarization (external, public, or financial) tend to stabilize their exchange rate. This finding is robust to various proxies for exchange rate management. For the reverse causality, on the other hand, the authors do not find evidence that more active intervention in foreign exchange markets (i.e., more fixing) leads to higher liability dollarization.|$|E

40|$|What is {{the role}} of foreign {{currency}} debt in precipitating financial crises? In this paper we compare the 1880 to 1913 period to recent experience. We examine debt crises, currency crises, banking crises and the interrelation between these varieties of crises. We pay special attention to the role of hard <b>currency</b> debt, <b>currency</b> <b>mismatches</b> and debt intolerance. We find fairly robust evidence that high exposure to foreign currency debt does not necessarily lead to a high chance of having a debt crisis, currency crisis, or a banking crisis. A key finding is some countries do not suffer from great financial fragility despite high exposure to original sin. In the nineteenth century, the British offshoots and Scandinavia generally avoided severe financial meltdowns while today many advanced countries have high original sin but have had few financial crises. The common denominator in both periods is that <b>currency</b> <b>mismatches</b> matter. A strong reserve position or high exports relative to hard currency liabilities helps decrease the likelihood of a debt crisis, currency crisis or a banking crisis. This strengthens the evidence for the hypothesis that foreign currency debt is dangerous when mis-managed. We discuss the robustness of these results and make some general comparisons based on this evidence from over 60 years of intense international capital market integration. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, local {{currency}} emerging market (EM) debt {{has been developing}} to become an attractive and complementary investment category as many EM countries have been successful to reduce <b>currency</b> <b>mismatches</b> and maturity problems by implementing sound fiscal and monetary policies. Analyzing the period from 2002 to July 2009, we show that the local currency EM debt investments provide significant additional alpha and diversification to traditional bond portfolios. In particular, first, EM local currency bond returns are less correlated to the US stock market, treasury and high-yield bond markets, and global risk premia compared to the a case of EM equity and US dollar-denominated bond markets. Second, yields and excess returns on local currency debt depend largely on expected depreciation of the exchange rate against US dollar, while excess returns on dollar-denominated EM debt {{are for the most}} part compensation for bearing the global risk. Third, EM sovereign local currency bond returns beat other emerging and mature market asset classes by providing higher risk adjusted excess returns and diversification. In light of our findings, we suggest that the development of local currency bond markets in EM countries could contribute to global financial stability by reducing <b>currency</b> <b>mismatches</b> and reliance on foreign currency debt, which in turn is linked to growth and poverty reduction. ...|$|R
