5000|$|In {{contrast}} to [...] "traditional" [...] equity warrants, with <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> no new issuance of common stock occurs if the warrant is exercised. The underlying {{shares of common}} stock are usually either owned by the issuer of the <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> or the issuer has a mechanism, such as owning equity warrants for the underlying shares, through which they can obtain the shares.|$|E
50|$|Similar to options, <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> {{have become}} popular {{in recent years}} as a way of speculating cheaply on market movements. CFDs costs tend to be lower for short periods and have a much wider range of {{underlying}} products. In markets such as Singapore, some brokers have been heavily promoting CFDs as alternatives to <b>covered</b> <b>warrants,</b> and may have been partially responsible for the decline in volume of covered warrant there.|$|E

The famous Black-Scholes model is the most widely used model for option pricing and hedging. However, because of the existence of transaction costs and it is unrealistic to hedge continuously in the real world, the Black-Scholes model and the delta dynamic hedging strategy which based on the Black-Scholes model are no longer effective. Thus this paper discussed and simulated 6 alternative discrete hedging strategies in evidence. In order to choose an optimum hedging strategies, this paper focuses on researching performance and sensibility of these discrete hedging strategies with <b>covered</b> <b>warrant</b> of China Merchants Bank. This paper evaluates the hedging performance with measures of total hedging cost, net cash flow and yield rate.

40|$|We {{provide a}} new, supply-side {{explanation}} for the consistent, statistically signiﬁcant, empirical observation that <b>covered</b> <b>warrant</b> prices are {{higher than those of}} corresponding traded options. <b>Covered</b> <b>warrant</b> market-makers, who set prices, are also the issuers and always have net short positions. Their reservation prices for redeeming or issuing more warrants reﬂect the change in their total hedgingrelated costs. For overall net short positions we show both bid and ask reservation prices lie above perfect-market values, since transaction costs increase both issuers’ marginal costs of warrant issuance and the marginal beneﬁts of warrant redemption. The model generates prices and bid-ask spreads consistent with existing empirical evidence and also new testable implications...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Covered</b> <b>warrants</b> {{are very}} similar to options—much more so than [...] "traditional" [...] warrants. This is because <b>covered</b> <b>warrants,</b> just like options, can be created to allow holders to benefit from either rising prices or falling prices, by having both put and call warrants. They can also be created {{on a wide variety of}} {{underlying}} instruments not just equities and they are fairly standardised and are mostly traded on exchanges.|$|E
50|$|Naked {{warrants}} {{are issued}} without an accompanying bond and, like traditional warrants, are {{traded on the}} stock exchange. They are typically issued by banks and securities firms. These are also called <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> and are settled for cash, e.g. do not involve the company who issues the shares that underlie the warrant. In most markets around the world, <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> are more popular than the traditional warrants described above. Financially they are also similar to call options, but are typically bought by retail investors, rather than investment funds or banks, who prefer the more keenly priced options which tend to trade on a different market. <b>Covered</b> <b>warrants</b> normally trade alongside equities, which makes them easier for retail investors {{to buy and sell}} them.|$|E

5000|$|A {{covered warrant}} gives the holder the right, {{but not the}} obligation, to buy ("call" [...] warrant) or to sell ("put" [...] warrant) an {{underlying}} asset at a specified price (the [...] "strike" [...] or [...] "exercise" [...] price) by a predetermined date. The price paid for this right is the [...] "premium" [...] and with <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> you cannot lose more than this initial premium paid. They are limited liability instruments {{so there are no}} further payments or margin calls required to maintain a covered warrant position. <b>Covered</b> <b>warrants</b> offer a flexible alternative to private investors who seek to gain the leverage benefits of derivatives, but who wish to limit their risk.|$|E

50|$|Unlike normal warrants, {{they are}} usually issued by {{financial}} institutions instead of share-issuing companies and are listed as fully tradable securities {{on a number of}} stock exchanges. They can also have a variety of underlying instruments, not just equities, and may allow the holder to buy or sell the underlying asset. These attributes make it possible to use <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> as a tool to speculate on financial markets.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{exposure}} is to market risk as the warrant will be profitable {{only when the}} market price exceeds the strike price for a [...] "call warrant" [...] or is below the strike for a [...] "put warrant". The inherent leveraging effect of the warrant significantly increases the risks and traders that are using warrant to speculate can make or lose significant sums very quickly. With <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> the maximum loss {{is limited to the}} price paid for the warrant (ask or offer price) plus any commission or other transaction charges. Thus, although warrants are classed as high risk they are not as risky as other investment products such as contracts for differences or spread betting in which an investor would have to pay for future losses.|$|E

40|$|The {{covered warrant}} {{market in the}} UK has gained in {{popularity}} over time since first launched in 2002. This has opened up an alternative investment choice which offers derivative securities with a life of typically one to two years. It seems to fulfill many of the functions of a traded options market. Since most research {{has been focused on}} options trading, the investigation on <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> trading is still very limited. This is also largely {{due to the lack of}} readily available data for end-traded <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> and the existing <b>covered</b> <b>warrants.</b> A unique set of hand-collected data, supplemented by public and private data from main <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> issuer and the financial database are employed, making this thesis possible. The sample periods can be divided into two separate sets. The UK <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> trading during the period July 2004 - December 2006 are used to examine the impact of warrant introduction and expiration on the price, volume and volatility of the underlying securities. For the introduction analyses, both the announcement and listing of <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> have negative impacts on the price of underlying securities for both call and put features, though the impact of the announcement is more pronounced than that of the listing. These affects are temporary and do not persist much beyond the introduction of the warrants. Negative price impacts of the expiration event are also reported for both call and put <b>covered</b> <b>warrants.</b> However, this study finds no significant impacts on the volume of underlying securities trading from the announcement, listing and expiration of call and put <b>covered</b> <b>warrants.</b> Further evidence indicates an increase in volatility of the underlying securities during the announcement and listing of <b>covered</b> <b>warrants.</b> The results hold true for both call and put warrants cases. On the other hand, a decreasing stock volatility is found as a consequence of the expiration of both call and put <b>covered</b> <b>warrants.</b> The second data set involves the call <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> traded in the UK market between April 2007 and December 2008; this was analysed for evidence of the best appropriate <b>covered</b> <b>warrants</b> pricing model. This study suggests default risk as a major concern for the warrant price which is called the Vulnerable warrant price. The reasons behind this arise from concern about the issuer’s creditworthiness due to traders’ fraudulent action and the recent subprime problem, the difficulties of dynamic hedging by issuers because of market imperfections, as well as the no guarantees on covered warrant trading provided by the London Stock Exchange. The most salient findings of the study are the following. The Vulnerable warrant price is generally lower than both the Black-Scholes price and warrant market price throughout the warrant’s lifetime. The evidence suggests an overvalued warrant price in the UK market. Moreover, the in-the-money warrants indicate a higher rate of default in comparison to the out-of-the-money warrants. An additional finding shows that the market becomes aware of the default risk only on a short-term basis. The presentation of negative abnormal returns of both market and the Black-Sholes prices support the assumption that default risk is a relevant factor in pricing the UK <b>covered</b> <b>warrants.</b> These findings add to the literature dealing with the effect of derivatives trading on the underlying securities as well as providing more empirical evidence on a particular covered warrant market. This could be of interest not only for practitioners to widen their investment opportunities but also for regulators to have this as a guideline for their future related policies planning.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} mapping current {{situation}} {{on the market in}} warrants as nonstandardised option contracts. Particular attention is paid to the special issues of warrants modified into the form of so called "access products". The function of such financial instrument is to open extraordinary investment opportunity to certain kind of investors, who otherwise are not allowed to make direct investment into the underlying asset itself. Access products can be considered as particular financial innovation, which spread out on Central European capital markets. The most familiar form of access products are low strike price <b>covered</b> call <b>warrants,</b> the characteristics of which are being analyzed and compared to standard options and warrants. The author also focuses on the process of issuing warrant securities on Czech capital market according to Czech law and problems linked to it, which the issuer encounters.
