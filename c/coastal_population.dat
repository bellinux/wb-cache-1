5|$|The fake will {{in which}} the Shunzhi Emperor had {{supposedly}} expressed regret for abandoning Manchu traditions gave authority to the nativist policies of the Kangxi Emperor's four regents. Citing the testament, Oboi and the other regents quickly abolished the Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus. Over the next few years, they enhanced {{the power of the}} Imperial Household Department, which was run by Manchus and their bondservants, eliminated the Hanlin Academy, and limited membership in the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers to Manchus and Mongols. The regents also adopted aggressive policies toward the Qing's Chinese subjects: they executed dozens of people and punished thousands of others in the wealthy Jiangnan region for literary dissent and tax arrears, and forced the <b>coastal</b> <b>population</b> of southeast China to move inland in order to starve the Taiwan-based Kingdom of Tungning run by descendants of Koxinga.|$|E

40|$|The diurnal water {{relations}} of three halophytic species common to both inland and coastal habitats in saline flats of Karachi, Pakistan were studied. The first [hypothesis was that species with different adaptation modes leaf succulent (()) (Suaeda fruticosa L.

The second hypothesis {{was that the}} <b>coastal</b> <b>populations</b> were more stressed in comparison to inland populations. The first hypothesis was rejected because the overall diurnal variation pattern of water relations was similar in all three species. There were quantitative differences in all parameters studied in various species from inland and <b>coastal</b> <b>populations,</b> and species also showed some individual differences in their responses to stress. The second hypothesis was accepted because <b>coastal</b> <b>populations</b> were generally more stressed in comparison to inland populations...|$|R

On reaching Zanzibar he learned that his efforts were useless, as on 1 July 1890 the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty between Germany and the UK had been signed, whereby Uganda was left as an area of British influence and Peters' agreement with Mwanga became null and void. Meanwhile, the power of his company had ended when the <b>coastal</b> <b>population</b> rebelled in the Abushiri Revolt against the implementation of the lease agreement between the Sultan and the Germans.

25|$|After {{the arrival}} of Romans, {{following}} the fall of Carthage in 146 BC, the <b>coastal</b> <b>population</b> spoke mainly Punic, but that influence decreased away from the coast. From Roman period until the Arab conquest, Latin, Greek and Numidian further influenced the language, called Neo-Punic to differentiate it from its older version. This also progressively gave birth to African Romance, a Latin dialect, influenced by Tunisia's other languages and used along with them. Also, {{as it was the}} case for the other dialects, Punic probably survived the Arabic conquest of the Maghreb: the geographer al-Bakri described in the 11th century people speaking a language that was not Berber, Latin or Coptic in rural Ifriqiya, a region where spoken Punic survived well past its written use. However, {{it may be that the}} existence of Punic facilitated the spread of Arabic in the region, as Punic and Arabic are both Semitic languages and share many common roots.|$|E

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) that was set-up in 1946 concludes that during the resistance movement that was led by the Chinese and indigenous peoples in North Borneo, the Kenpeitai are involved in the reign of terror by arresting, torturing and massacre hundreds of Chinese revolt members while doing an apparently systematic extermination of <b>coastal</b> <b>population</b> that was inhabited by the Suluk people. The last supreme commander of the Japanese army in northern Borneo, Masao Baba was charged on 8 March 1947 on suspicion of involvement in war crimes and also brought to Rabaul for trial, where he was charged with command responsibility for the Sandakan Death Marches that causing more than 2,000 Allied POWs deaths. During the trial, he confess to aware of the weakened condition of the prisoners but still direct orders for a second march. The trial began from 28 May until 2 June and was concluded later on 5 June with a death sentence; where he was subsequently hanged on 7 August 1947.|$|E
40|$|The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is {{economically}} {{one of the}} world’s {{most important}} marine species—a species presently suffering from heavy overexploitation throughout its range of distribution. Although not fully understood, the Atlantic cod {{is believed to be}} structured into populations in a rather complex manner, whereby both highly migratory and more confined ocean-spawning stocks coexist with stationary <b>coastal</b> <b>populations.</b> Owing to the complex population structure, little is presently known about how overexploit-ation of offshore stocks may affect other segments of the species. Here, we use microsatellite DNA analyses of coastal and offshore cod in combination with oceanographic modelling to investigate the population structure of Atlantic cod in the North Sea–Skagerrak area and evaluate the potential for larval transport into <b>coastal</b> <b>populations.</b> Our results suggest an extensive but temporally variable drift of offshore cod larvae into <b>coastal</b> <b>populations.</b> In a year (2001) with high inflow of North Sea waters into the Skagerrak we find that juvenile cod caught along the Skagerrak coast are predominantly of North Sea origin, whereas in a year (2000) with low inflow juveniles appear to be of local origin. These findings indicate that offshore cod may influence <b>coastal</b> cod <b>populations</b> over large distances...|$|R

500|$|Although {{the initial}} American {{commitment}} {{to the war in}} Vietnam had been limited to advice and materiel support, by 1964 there were 21,000 US advisors in South Vietnam. However, with the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) weakened by successive defeats {{at the hands of the}} communists, the South Vietnamese government faltering, and Saigon threatened with a major offensive, the situation led to a significant escalation of the war in 1965, with a large-scale commitment of US ground troops under the command of General William Westmoreland. At first the Americans had adopted a cautious strategy, applied to the strictly limited role of base defence by US Marine units. This was abandoned in April 1965, and replaced by a new [...] "enclave strategy" [...] of defending key <b>coastal</b> <b>population</b> centres and installations. This strategy required the introduction of nine additional US battalions, or 14,000 troops, to bring the total in Vietnam to 13.

Analyses using v 2, FST (based on haplotype frequencies) and FST values (based on frequencies and genetic distances between haplotypes) yielded statistically significant separation (randomized permutation values P< 0. 05) among four different <b>coastal</b> <b>populations</b> and between all but one of these and the offshore subspecies (overall FST= 0. 0691). Ninety-one coastal animals from these four geographic populations and 50 offshore animals were genotyped for seven nuclear microsatellite loci. Analysis using FST values (based on allelic frequencies) yielded statistically significant separation between most <b>coastal</b> <b>populations</b> and offshore animals, although no <b>coastal</b> <b>populations</b> were distinguished. These results argue for the existence of some genetic isolation between offshore and inshore populations and among some inshore populations, suggesting that these should be treated as separate units for management purposes...|$|R
