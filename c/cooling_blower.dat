50|$|Volkswagen used straight-five {{engines in}} their Eurovan, and {{developed}} a different straight-five engine which {{was used in the}} Jetta, Passat, Golf, Rabbit, and New Beetle in North America until the early 2010s. In South Africa, the well known VW Microbus/Caravelle (a passenger carrier) was later equipped with an Audi 5-cylinder 2.5 L (1991-1994) and still later a 2.6 L (1995-2002) water cooled engine, replacing the old air cooled Volkswagen 1,800 and 2,100 cc power plants that gave substandard performance to the large family bus. The tall straight-five Audi engine had to be slanted to fit below a rear engine deck, employing an extra electric <b>cooling</b> <b>blower</b> on shut-down, so as to prevent warping of the hot aluminium head and inlet manifold.|$|E

5000|$|In 1973 (per {{the table}} below), DC {{traction}} at 3,000 volts, lost about 3 {{times as much}} energy (percentage-wise) in the catenary as AC at 25,000 volts. Paradoxically, {{it turned out that}} DC locomotives were somewhat more efficient overall than AC locomotives. [...] "Auxiliary Electric Motors" [...] are mainly used for air cooling electric machinery such as traction motors. Electric locomotives concentrate high power electric machinery in a relatively small space and thus require a lot of cooling. [...] Per the table below, a sizeable amount of energy (11-17%) is used for this, but when operating at nominal power only 2-4% is used. [...] The fact that the cooling motors run at full speed (and power) all the time makes their power consumption constant, so when the locomotive motors are operating at low power (far below the nominal regime) the percent of this power used for <b>cooling</b> <b>blowers</b> becomes much higher. The result is that under actual operating conditions, the percent energy used for cooling is a few times higher than [...] "nominal". Per the table below, AC locomotives used about 50% more energy for this purpose since in addition to cooling the motors, the <b>blowers</b> must <b>cool</b> the transformer, rectifiers and the smoothing reactor (inductors), which are mostly absent on DC locomotives. [...] The 3-phase AC power for these blower motors is supplied from a rotary phase converter which converts single phase (from the catenary via the main transformer) to 3-phase (and this also takes energy). It's proposed to reduce blower speeds when less cooling is needed.|$|R

25|$|The {{filaments}} require {{constant and}} often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the microwatt level. Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode slam into the anode (plate) and heat it; this can occur {{even in an}} idle amplifier due to quiescent currents necessary to ensure linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes are cooled by radiation through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum envelope to conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually <b>cooled</b> by a <b>blower,</b> or water-jacket.|$|R

40|$|Gas coolant at low {{pressure}} exhibits poor heat transfer characteristics. This {{is an area}} of concern for the passive response targeted by the Generation IV GCFR design. For the first 24 hour period, the decay heat removal for the GCFR design is dependent on an actively powered blower, which also would reduce the temperature in the fuel during transients, before depending on the passive operation. Natural circulation cooling initiates when the blower is stopped for the final phase of the decay heat removal, as under forced convection the core decay heat is adequately cooled by the running blower. The ability of the coolant to flow in the reverse direction or having recirculation, when the blowers are off, necessitates more understanding of the flow behavior characteristics in the upper plenum. The work done here focuses primarily on the period after the blower has been turned off, as the core is adequately <b>cooled</b> when the <b>blowers</b> are running, thus {{there was no need to}} carry out the analysis for the first 24 hours. In order to understand the plume behavior for the GCFR upper plenum several cases were run, with air, helium and helium-air mixture. For each case, the FLUENT was used to characterize the steady state velocity vectors and corresponding temperature in the upper plenum under passive decay heat removal conditions.

40|$|Background. Large {{quantities}} of water condensation {{occur in the}} anaesthesia circuit during low-flow anaesthesia. We hypothesized that cooling of the CO 2 absorbent would prevent water condensation. Methods. To cool CO 2 absorbent efficiently, we constructed a novel temperature gradient reduction (TGR) canister, which was <b>cooled</b> by a <b>blower.</b> Experiments were divided into three groups: the conventional canister group (control group, n 6), the TGR canister without cooling group (TGR group, n 6), and the TGR canister with cooling group (TGR cooling group, n 6). One kilogramme of CO 2 absorbent was placed into the canister. The anaesthetic ventilator was connected to a 3 litre bag and 300 ml min 21 of CO 2 was introduced. About 500 ml min 21 of oxygen was used as fresh gas. The anaesthetic ventilator was set at a ventilatory frequency of 12 bpm, and tidal volume was adjusted to 700 ml. Results. The longevity of the CO 2 absorbent was 437 (SD 7. 8) min in the control group, 564 (13. 8) min in the TGR group (P, 0. 001 vs control), and 501 (5. 8) min in the TGR cooling group (P, 0. 001 vs control, TGR). Total water condensation in the anaesthesia circuit was 215 (9. 4) mg min 21 in the control group, 223 (9. 7) mg min 21 in the TGR group, and 47. 7 (5. 7) mg min 21 in the TGR cooling group (P, 0. 001 vs control, TGR). Conclusions. TGR of CO 2 absorbent with cooling is a useful and simple method to reduce water condensation in the anaesthesia circuit in low-flow anaesthesia, with a little increase in the longevity of the CO 2 absorbent...|$|R
40|$|Two cowling systems {{intended}} {{to reduce the}} drag and improve the low-speed cooling characteristics of conventional radial engine cowlings were tested in model form to determine the practicability of the methods. One cowling included a blower mounted on the rear face of a large propeller spinner which drew cooling air in through side entrance ducts located behind the equivalent engine orifice plate. The air was passed through the equivalent engine orifice plate from rear to front and out through a slot between the spinner and the engine plate. The blower produced substantially all the power necessary to circulate the cooling air in some cases, so the quantity of air flowing was independent of the air speed, Two types of blowers were used, a centrifugal type and one using airfoil blades which forced the air outward {{from the center of}} rotation. The other cowling was similar to the conventional N. A. C. A. cowling except for the addition of a large propeller spinner nose. The spinner was provided with a hole in the nose to admit <b>cooling</b> air and <b>blower</b> blades to increase the pressure for cooling at low speeds. The tests show that with both cowling types the basic drag of the nacelle was reduced substantially below that for the N. A. C. A. cowling by virtue of the better nose shape made possible by the spinner. The drag due to the side-entrance ducts was nearly zero when the openings were closed or when the blower was drawing in a certain quantity of air in proportion to the air speed. The drag increased, however, when air mas allowed to spill from the openings. The nose-entrance blower showed considerable promise as a cooling means although the blower tested was relatively inefficient, owing {{to the fact that the}} blower compartments evidently were expanded too rapidly under the conditions imposed. by the design...|$|R
50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial <b>cooler</b> to the <b>blower</b> intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|R
