Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated the costs, voice quality, quality of life, and clinical results of both treatments. Methods. Costs and effects from the first visit up to 2 years of follow-up were calculated, based on chart data of 35 and 54 patients who were treated with curative intent for T 1 a glottic carcinoma from 1995 to 1999 with radiotherapy and endoscopic cordectomy, respectively. Voice quality {{and quality of life}} were evaluated by means of patient questionnaires. Results. Total <b>costs</b> (<b>in</b> <b>Euros)</b> of radiotherapy and CO 2 -laser cordectomy were EURO 8322 and EURO 4434, respectively, including the costs of treating possible recurrences. The effects of both treatments were equal, including voice quality and quality of life. Conclusions.

30|$|First, set-up {{costs are}} the net costs that a firm invests to train its {{apprentices}}. Net Training <b>Costs</b> <b>in</b> <b>Euros</b> include the average gross costs, e.g., costs for apprentices (wages), costs for trainers, physical costs and other costs, minus the corresponding {{benefits such as}} productive contribution of apprentices during their training. 10 Net training costs can be positive (i.e., a net investment) or negative (i.e., a net benefit). Empirically, non-training firms might not train apprentices because of significantly higher net training <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> contrast to training firms (Wolter et al. 2006). Therefore, training costs for non-training firms would systematically differ if these firms were {{to switch to a}} training policy. Muehlemann et al. (2010) provide a solution to this problem by using selection models to investigate the potential costs and benefits of non-training firms. Analogously, we estimate training costs for non-training firms with identical selection models and the same exclusion restriction, i.e., availability of skilled workers. 11 Subsequently, we multiply these net training costs per year and per apprentice by the Training Duration for a specific training occupation in years (ranging from 2 to 3.5  years) to calculate the net training costs for the whole training duration of one apprentice.|$|R

The views expressed in this Working Paper are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the IMF or IMF policy. Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. We analyze determinants of sovereign bond yields in 22 advanced economies over the 1980 - 2010 period using panel cointegration techniques. The application of cointegration methodology allows distinguishing between long-run (debt-to-GDP ratio, potential growth) and short-run (inflation, short-term interest rates, etc.) determinants of sovereign borrowing costs. We find that in the longrun, government bond yields increase by about 2 basis points in response to a 1 percentage point increase in government debt-to-GDP ratio and by about 45 basis points in response to a 1 percentage point increase in potential growth rate. In the short-run, sovereign bond yields deviate from the level determined by the long-run fundamentals, but about half of the deviation adjusts in one year. When considering the impact of the global financial crisis on sovereign borrowing <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> <b>euro</b> area countries, the estimations suggest that spreads against Germany in some European periphery countries exceeded the level determined by fundamentals {{in the aftermath of the}} crisis, while some North European countries have benefited from “safe haven ” flows...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{relative}} cost effectiveness of escitalopram compared with venlafaxine XR {{in patients with}} major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a double-blind, multinational, randomised clinical trial and examined the costs {{and quality of life}} of 251 patients taking escitalopram versus venlafaxine. Outpatients fulfilling criteria for MDD were randomised to receive oral escitalopram 10 - 20 mg/day or venlafaxine 75 - 150 mg/day for 8 weeks. Patient-reported outcomes (EuroQOL questionnaire, Quality of Life Depression Scale), use of medical services and absence from work (relating to the previous 3 months) were recorded at baseline, with repeated measurements at week 8. Unit <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> year values were applied to the resource utilisation data. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the EuroQOL score as the effectiveness measure. The perspective was that of the healthcare payer, with a societal perspective considered in a sensitivity analysis. Results: Statistically significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes (vs baseline) were observed in both groups after 8 weeks' treatment. Patients treated with escitalopram tended to report fewer problems on the EuroQOL dimensions than venlafaxine recipients. Mean per-patient <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> <b>euros</b> (_, year 2003 values) for the escitalopram group, compared with the venlafaxine group, were 32 % lower (_ 110 vs _ 161) from a healthcare perspective, although this was not a statistically significant difference. Differences were related to lower drug acquisition costs and fewer hospitalisations for escitalopram than venlafaxine recipients. A multivariate model adjusting for baseline characteristics showed that escitalopram reduced direct costs compared with venlafaxine (p = 0. 007). Bootstrapped distributions of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios also showed similar effectiveness but lower costs for escitalopram compared with venlafaxine. Inclusion of indirect costs led to similar results. Conclusion: This prospective economic analysis suggests that escitalopram has similar effectiveness to venlafaxine in the treatment of MDD, but may be associated with lower healthcare costs. These findings are consistent with previously published economic evaluations. Cost-effectiveness, Depression, Escitalopram, Venlafaxine...|$|R

We assess the cost-effectiveness of TT compared to no therapy in the treatment of patients previously treated with G 1 CHC. METHODS: The available published literature provided the data source. The target population was made up of previously treated Caucasian patients with G 1 CHC and these were evaluated over a lifetime horizon by Markov model.

Outcomes included discounted <b>costs</b> (<b>in</b> <b>euro</b> at 2012 value), life years gained (LYG), quality adjusted life year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The robustness of the results was evaluated by one-way deterministic and multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In RR patients, ICER per LYG compared to no therapy was € 9555 for BOC-LEAD-IN-RR and € 7910 for TVR-LEAD-IN-RR, being BOC dominated by TVR. In PAR patients, ICER for LYG was € 11, 947 for BOC-LEAD-IN-PAR and € 14, 931 for TVR-PAR, being TVR cost-effective compared to BOC (ICER for QALY € 22, 258).

A comparison is made with the US and across individual member countries. First, we find that the underlying source of the oil price shift is crucial to determine the repercussions on the economy and the appropriate monetary policy reaction. Second, the transmission mechanism is considerably different compared to the US. In particular, inflationary effects in the US are mainly driven by a strong direct pass-through of rising energy prices and indirect effects of higher production <b>costs.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, <b>Euro</b> area inflation reacts sluggishly and is much more driven by second-round effects of increasing wages. The monetary policy reaction of the ECB to oil shocks is also strikingly different compared to the FED.

40|$|Deep muscle {{relaxation}} {{has been shown}} to facilitate operating conditions during laparoscopic surgery. Minimally invasive esophageal surgery is a high-risk procedure in which the use of deep neuromuscular block (NMB) may improve conditions in the thoracic phase as well. Neuromuscular antagonists can be given on demand or by continuous infusion (deep NMB). However, the positioning of the patient often hampers train-of-four (TOF) monitoring. A continuous infusion thus may result in a deep NMB at the end of surgery. The use of neostigmine not only is insufficient for reversing deep NMB but also may be contraindicated for this procedure because of its cholinergic effects. Sugammadex is an effective alternative but is rather expensive. This study aims to evaluate the use of deep versus on-demand NMB on operating, anaesthesiologic conditions, and <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> patients undergoing a two- or three-phase thoracolaparoscopic esophageal resection. We will conduct a single-center randomized controlled double-blinded intervention study. Sixty-six patients undergoing a thoracolaparoscopic esophageal resection will be included. Patients will receive either continuous infusion of rocuronium 0. 6 mg/kg per hour (group 1) or continuous infusion of NaCl 0. 9 % 0. 06 ml/kg per hour (group 2). In both groups, on-demand boluses of rocuronium can be given (open-label design). The primary aim {{of this study is to}} compare the surgical rating scale (SRS) during the abdominal phase. Main secondary aims are to evaluate SRS during the thoracic phase, to evaluate anesthesiologic conditions, and to compare <b>costs</b> (<b>in</b> <b>euros)</b> associated with use of rocuronium, sugammadex, and duration of surgery. This study is the first to evaluate the benefits of deep neuromuscular relaxation on surgical and anaesthesiologic conditions during thoracolaparoscopic esophageal surgery. This surgical procedure is unique because it consists of both an abdominal phase and a thoracic phase taking place in different order depending on the subtype of surgery (a two- or three-stage transthoracic esophagectomy). In addition, possible benefits associated with deep NMB, such as decrease in operating time, will be weighed against costs.

Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis on real patient data and evaluate which medication adherence or lifestyle intervention is less cost demanding for the payer. Methods: Medline was searched systematically for published type 2 diabetes interventions regarding medication adherence and lifestyle in order to determine their efficacies, that were then used in the cost-effectiveness analysis. For cost-effectiveness analysis-required disease progression simulation, United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes model 2. 0 and Slovenian type 2 diabetes patient cohort were used. The intervention duration was set to 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. Complications and drug <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> <b>euro</b> (EUR) were based on previously published type 2 diabetes costs from the Health Care payer perspective in Slovenia. Results: Literature search proved the following interventions to be effective in type 2 diabetes patients: medication adherence, the Mediterranean diet, aerobic, resistance, and combined exercise. The long-term simulation resulted in no payer net savings. The model predicted following quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained and incremental costs for QALY gained (EUR/QALYg) after 10 years of intervention: high-efficacy medication adherence (0. 245 QALY; 9, 984 EUR/QALYg), combined exercise (0. 119 QALY; 46, 411 EUR/QALYg), low-efficacy medication adherence (0. 075 QALY; 30, 967 EUR/QALYg), aerobic exercise (0. 069 QALY; 80, 798 EUR/QALYg), the Mediterranean diet (0. 057 QALY; 27, 246 EUR/QALYg), and resistance exercise (0. 050 QALY; 111, 847 EUR/QALYg). Conclusion: The results suggest that medication adherence intervention is, regarding cost-effectiveness, superior to diet and exercise interventions from the payer perspective. However, the latter could also be utilized by patients without additional costs, but medication adherence intervention requires trained personnel because of its complex structure. Interventions should be performed for > 2 years to produce noticeable health/cost results. Keywords: type 2 diabetes, adherence, intervention, medication, lifestyle, cost-effectivenes...|$|R

In comparison with TVR-based strategies, SOF was cost-effective in IL 28 B CT/TT (ICER per LYG € 22, 229) and G 1 a (€ 19, 359) patients, not cost-effective in IL 28 B CC (€ 45, 330), fibrosis F 0 -F 3 (€ 26, 444), and in cirrhosis (€ 34, 906) patients, and dominated in G 1 b patients. The models were sensitive to SOF prices and to likelihood of sustained virological response. Conclusion: In untreated G 1 CHC patients, SOF-based TT may be a cost-effective alternative to first-generation protease inhibitors depending on pricing. The cost-effectiveness of SOF improved in IL 28 B CT/TT and G 1 a patients. SOF was dominated by TVR in G 1 b patients even if, in clinical practice, this issue could be counterbalanced by the good tolerability profile of SOF and by the shorter treatment duration...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Briefing Paper is to discuss wage setting and price {{stability}} <b>in</b> the <b>Euro</b> area and the European Union (EU). As has been stated on several occasions, the President of the ECB, Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet, reiterated in his introductory statement of 11 January 2007 the view {{that there is a}} risk that wage dynamics could be stronger than expected. He stressed that "wage agreements should take into account productivity developments, while recognising the still high level of unemployment and price competitiveness positions". He repeats that "it is also important that wage settlements move away from automatic, backward-looking indexation mechanisms". In {{the first part of the}} Briefing Paper, we discuss the ECB's view on wage setting and price stability against the background of the academic debate on the grease and the sand in the price and wage setting process In the second part of this paper, we will discuss the empirical evidence on unemployment rates, labour productivity per hour worked and hourly labour <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Euro</b> area and the EU. Finally, we draw some conclusions on the ECB's point of view on wage setting and price stability. The only remedy against the inflationary effect of automatic indexation mechanisms is a low and predictable level and variabilit...|$|R
25|$|Boeing's {{production}} <b>costs</b> {{are mostly}} <b>in</b> United States dollars, whereas Airbus' production <b>costs</b> are mostly <b>in</b> <b>Euro.</b> When the dollar appreciates against the euro {{the cost of}} producing a Boeing aircraft rises relatively {{to the cost of}} producing an Airbus aircraft, and conversely when the dollar falls relative to the euro it is an advantage for Boeing. There are also possible currency risks and benefits involved in the way aircraft are sold. Boeing typically prices its aircraft only in dollars, while Airbus, although pricing most aircraft sales in dollars, has been known to be more flexible and has priced some aircraft sales in Asia and the Middle East in multiple currencies. Depending on currency fluctuations between the acceptance of the order and the delivery of the aircraft this can result in an extra profit or extra expense—or, if Airbus has purchased insurance against such fluctuations, an additional cost regardless.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the {{management}} of sarcoma is improving, non adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) remains high, {{mainly because of the}} low incidence of the disease and the variety of histological subtypes. Since {{little is known about the}} health economics of sarcoma, we undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis (within the CONnective TIssue CAncer NETwork, CONTICANET) comparing costs and outcomes when clinicians adhered to CPGs and when they did not. METHODS: Patients studied had a histological diagnosis of sarcoma, were older than 15 years, and had been treated in the Rhône-Alpes region of France (in 2005 / 2006) or in the Veneto region of Italy (in 2007). Data collected retrospectively for the three years after diagnosis were used to determine relapse free survival and health costs (adopting the hospital's perspective and a microcosting approach). All <b>costs</b> were expressed <b>in</b> <b>euros</b> (€) at their 2009 value. A 4...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{treatment}} regimens for Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) {{are based}} on the use of oral alkylating agents. Recently, however, other more costly agents have been proposed for the treatment of WM. In the current study, the authors report on results obtained using oral melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (MCP) to treat 72 patients with WM, and they compare these results (and the associated costs) with those observed using more aggressive protocols. METHODS: Between July 1973 and April 2002, the authors documented overexpression of the immunoglobulin M paraprotein in 317 consecutive patients. Of these, 100 had newly diagnosed WM, and the 72 who were symptomatic were treated using the MCP protocol. Response rate, overall survival (OS), response duration, freedom from progression (FFP), event-free survival (EFS) duration, toxicity, and <b>cost</b> per course <b>in</b> <b>Euro</b> and U. S. dollars were evaluated for patients receiving this regimen. RESULTS: Seventy-one of 72 patients (99...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: In Spain, {{the first}} line {{treatment}} of hyperphosphatemia in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) consists of calciumbased phosphate binders (CB). However, their use is associated with vascular calcification and an increased mortality risk. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of second-line Lanthanum Carbonate (LC) treatment in patients not responding to CB (calcium carbonate and calcium acetate). Material and methods: A lifetime Markov model was developed considering three health states (predialysis, dialysis and death). Transitions between states and efficacy data were obtained from randomized clinical trials and the European Dialysis and Transplant Association Annual report. Mortality rate was adjusted with the relative risk related to serum phosphorus levels. According to the Spanish healthcare system perspective, only medical direct costs were considered. Dialysis <b>costs</b> (2013 prices <b>in</b> <b>Euros)</b> were obtained from diagnosis-related groups. Drug costs were derived from ex-factory prices, adjusted with 7. 5...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} costs, {{benefits and}} cost-effectiveness of anti-TNF agents in PsA patients with inadequate response to conventional treatment. Methods. A total of 107 patients, from nine Italian rheumatology centres, with {{different forms of}} PsA were given anti-TNF treatment, mainly etanercept (87 %). Information on resource use, health-related quality of life, disease activity, function and laboratory values were collected at baseline and through out the 12 months of therapy. <b>Cost</b> (expressed <b>in</b> <b>euro</b> 2007) and utility (measured by EuroQol) before and after anti-TNF therapy initiation were compared in order to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and cost effectiveness acceptability curve was calculated. Results. At the end of 12 months, {{there was a significant}} increase <b>in</b> direct <b>cost</b> due to an increase of drug cost caused by TNF inhibitors that was only partially offset by the decrease <b>in</b> indirect <b>cost.</b> <b>In</b> the last 6 months of therapy, the direct cost increased by (sic) 5052, the cost for the National Health System (NHS) by (sic) 5044 and the social cost by (sic) 4638.

40|$|International audienceErythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) {{are largely}} {{prescribed}} before dialysis stage to {{chronic kidney disease}} patients. In accordance to current international guidelines, lots {{have been made by}} pharmacological companies in order to improve self management of ESAs: subcutaneaous administration, pencil devices, mutidose cartridges, low injection volume, very fine needles, once a month injections but none is currently known on the percentage of patients who actually do self administration of ESAs. We conducted a simple prospective questionnaire study in different nephrology departments in France, on pre-dialysis patients. Questionnaires have been fulfilled by randomly selected French nephrologists during visits with outpatients treated by ESA. Costs have been evaluated by ESA and nurse visit direct <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> <b>euros</b> and compared by a Wilcoxon test. Within 6 months, 143 questionnaires of outpatients have been completed. The characteristics of the population are as followed: 53 % men, mean age 66. 4 ± 16. 9 y/o, 38. 6 % of diabetics, mean estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR by MDRD formula) 22. 8 ± 11. 6 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2). ESAs are prescribed as follow: Aranesp(®) (50. 3 %), Mircera(®) (36. 3 %), NeoRecormon(®) (10. 5 %), Eprex(®) (2. 1 %) and Retacrit(®) (0. 7 %). ESA self administration concerns only 24. 8 % of the patients their while most of the patients (70. 2 %) ask a nurse for injection without any differences between ESAs (P= 0. 24), sex (P= 0. 81) or presence of diabetes (P= 0. 78). ESA self administration is more frequent for working patients (56. 8 % versus 34. 7 %; P= 0. 0002). Moreover, for 86. 7 % of the patients, nurse comes at home and in 60 % of the cases only for this injection. Finally, 42 % of the patients feel improvement as soon as a couple of hours after injection whatever ESA used (0 - 45 days). In addition, mean haemoglobin level is 11. 4 ± 1. 3 g/dL, mean ferritinemia is 229 ± 211 UI/mL. Non surprisingly, nurse injection regimen is more expensive than self injection (P= 0. 0016). This simple questionnaire shows that despite efforts made to improve ESA self administration, a minority of patients are in fact proceeding to ESA self administration. Asking for a nurse, does not help patient to be independent, and increases health cost. Efforts have to be made in order to help patients for ESA self administration...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness {{analysis}} of three diagnostic imaging {{strategies for the}} assessment of aortoiliac and femoropopliteal arteries in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The strategies were: angiography as the reference strategy, duplex scanning (DS) plus supplementary angiography (S 1) and DS plus confirmative angiography (S 2). DESIGN, MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision model was built with sensitivity and specificity data from literature, supplemented with prospective hospital <b>cost</b> data <b>in</b> <b>Euro</b> (euro). The probability of correctly identifying the status of a lesion was taken as the primary outcome. We compared strategies by assessing the extra costs per additional correctly identified case. RESULTS: Assuming no false positive or false negative results, angiography is the most effective strategy if the prevalence of significant obstructive lesions in the aortoiliac and femoropopliteal tract exceeds 70 %, or if the sensitivity of duplex scanning is lower than 83 %. In case of lower prevalence, strategy S 1 becomes equally or even more effective than angiography. At a prevalence of 75 %, performing angiography costs euro 8443 per extra correctly identified case compared with strategy S 1. CONCLUSIONS: In most situations angiography is more effective than diagnostic strategy S 1. However, if society is unwilling to pay more than euro 8443 for knowing a patient's disease status, diagnostic strategy S 1 is a cost-effective alternative to angiography, especially at lower prevalence value...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the interaction between natural history, current practice patterns in diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of oesophageal cancer, and associated health resource utilization and costs. Methods: A cost analysis of a prospective population-based cohort of 1100 patients with a primary diagnosis of oesophageal cancer was performed using chart review from the Australian Cancer Study Clinical Follow-Up Study. The analysis enabled estimation of healthcare resources and associated <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> 2009 <b>euros</b> by stage of disease and treatment pathway. Results: Most patients (88 絠per cent) presented with stage II, III or IV cancer; 61 籠per cent (672 of 1100) were treated surgically. Overall mean costs were ೷ 195 (median ಹ 114) for patients undergoing surgery and ౷ 281 (median ౳ 066) for those treated without surgery. Surgery contributed 66 素per cent of the total costs (mean ಴ 697 per patient) in the surgical group. In the non-surgical group, use of chemotherapy was more prevalent (81 繠per cent of patients) and contributed 61 籠per cent of the total costs. Other important cost determinants were gastro-oesophageal junction tumours, treatment location and tumour stage. Mean costs of those monitored for Barrett's oesophagus (7 糠per cent of patients) were lower, although about one-third still presented with advanced-stage cancer. Conclusion: Overall costs for managing oesophageal cancer were high and dominated by surgery <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> patients treated surgically and by chemotherapy <b>costs</b> <b>in</b> patients treated without surgery. Radiotherapy, treatment location and cancer subtype were also important. Monitoring for Barrett's oesophagus and earlier-stage detection were associated with lower management costs, but the potential net benefit from surveillance strategies needs further investigation.

40|$|Both common {{macroeconomic}} shocks and country-specific {{developments have}} subjected {{the flexibility of}} wage setting mechanisms <b>in</b> the <b>euro</b> area to a stress test in recent years. Against this background, this paper takes {{a fresh look at}} wage flexibility in EMU and attempts to draw a few lessons from the experience of the early years. First, we {{set the stage for the}} analysis by providing a brief description of the stylised facts regarding nominal and real wage and unit labour <b>cost</b> developments <b>in</b> the <b>euro</b> area over the recent business cycle. Then, the paper presents an empirical assessment of wage inertia based on new econometric estimates of a Phillips-curve type wage equation across euro area countries and offers an interpretation of the main findings with respect to nominal and real wage flexibility. Finally, we investigate the cyclical responsiveness of relative competitive positions among euro area countries. We conclude that from a bird's eye perspective euro area wage and labour cost dynamics have been quite benign in the past couple of years. However, our estimates suggest that persistent cross-country differences in wage and labour cost developments have not always reflected warranted adjustment needs; they are rather indicative of an eventually insufficient degree of nominal and real wage flexibility <b>in</b> the <b>euro</b> area. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} one of the leading causes of death and it has been shown that primary {{prevention}} with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) lipid-lowering drugs can reduce cardiovascular events. Acquisition costs vary between statins and this may be an important consideration <b>in</b> the overall <b>cost</b> effectiveness (CE) of different options. Objective: To perform a CE study of the main statins used in Spain for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with high cholesterol levels. Study design: The CE analysis was based on an open-label, prospective, naturalistic, randomised intervention study under usual care conditions in primary care settings in patients with high cholesterol levels (total cholesterol [TC] > 240 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] > 160 mg/dL) and one or more cardiovascular risk factors. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System; the year of costing was 2001. Patients: A total of 161 patients (49. 7 % males), mean age 65 +- 10. 3 years, without evidence of cardiovascular disease were included in the study. Of those, 82. 1 % were hypertensive, 37. 1 % had diabetes mellitus and 17. 9 % were smokers. Interventions: Forty-eight patients received oral atorvastatin 10 mg/day, 32 received fluvastatin 40 mg/day, 44 received simvastatin 20 mg/day and 37 patients received pravastatin 20 mg/day for 6 months. Main measurements and results: After 6 months, the therapeutic goals of LDL-C control, according to the recommendations of the Spanish Society of Arteriosclerosis - Consensus- 2000, were reached in 62. 5 %, 43. 8 %, 45. 5 % and 40. 5 % of patients treated with atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin, respectively. The average CE ratio, expressed as the <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> <b>euros</b> (_) per patient achieving the therapeutic goals, was _ 424. 3 for atorvastatin, _ 503. 5 for fluvastatin, _ 527. 0 for simvastatin and _ 683. 4 for pravastatin. The incremental CE ratios for atorvastatin versus fluvastatin and simvastatin were _ 238. 9 and _ 149. 5, respectively, per additional patient reaching therapeutic goals. Atorvastatin, fluvastatin and simvastatin all dominated pravastatin. Conclusions: All the statins studied have been shown to be effective for reducing both TC and LDL-C levels. In this study, atorvastatin was the most efficient drug, with the best CE ratio (cost per patient reaching therapeutic goals). Atorvastatin was more effective and less costly than pravastatin, and when compared with fluvastatin or simvastatin the additional cost per additional patient achieving therapeutic goals wasAtorvastatin, Cardiovascular-disorders, Cost-effectiveness, Fluvastatin, Hypercholesterolaemia, Pravastatin, Simvastatin...|$|R
