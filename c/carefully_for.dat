5|$|Initial {{gameplay}} of Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth comprises unarmed {{escape and}} evasion together with investigative exploration, although first-person shooter (FPS) style combat is introduced later on. As with most survival horror video games, ammunition is limited {{and must be}} conserved <b>carefully</b> <b>for</b> situations when it will really be indispensable, occasionally requiring the player to avoid combat even when armed. The game {{as a whole is}} heavily scripted and very linear, with only one path through the chapters from start to finish, in contrast with some earlier survival horror games such as the original Alone in the Dark (which itself was inspired by the Mythos).|$|E

25|$|Effective annual {{interest}} or yield may be calculated or applied differently {{depending on the}} circumstances, and the definition should be studied <b>carefully.</b> <b>For</b> example, a bank may refer to the yield on a loan portfolio after expected losses as its effective yield and include income from other fees, meaning that the interest paid by each borrower may differ substantially from the bank's effective yield.|$|E
25|$|Guerrillas must plan <b>carefully</b> <b>for</b> {{withdrawal}} once {{an operation}} has been completed, {{or if it}} is going badly. The withdrawal phase is sometimes regarded as {{the most important part of}} a planned action, and to get entangled in a lengthy struggle with superior forces is usually fatal to insurgent, terrorist or revolutionary operatives. Withdrawal is usually accomplished using a variety of different routes and methods and may include quickly scouring the area for loose weapons, evidence cleanup, and disguise as peaceful civilians.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common causes of falsely high breath {{analyzer}} readings is the existence of mouth alcohol. In analyzing a subject's breath sample, the breath analyzer's internal computer is making the assumption that the alcohol in the breath sample came from alveolar air—that is, air exhaled from deep within the lungs. However, alcohol may have come from the mouth, throat or stomach for a number of reasons. To help guard against mouth-alcohol contamination, certified breath-test operators are trained to observe a test subject <b>carefully</b> <b>for</b> at least 15–20 minutes before administering the test.|$|E

The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in the south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region. But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod.|$|E
25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears <b>carefully</b> <b>for</b> signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E
25|$|Darbha {{police station}} {{was at a}} {{distance}} of 10km and a major CRPF camp was also nearby. However their way was blocked by trees that the Naxalites knocked down. It took security reinforcements several hours to reach the spot, as they had to walk <b>carefully,</b> <b>for</b> fear that land mines had been planted on the road leading to the area. This is because in past, it has been seen that Maoists plant mines in and around the area of attacks to target security forces rushing for rescue and relief operations Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reviewed the situation with Congress President Sonia Gandhi and other senior leaders. The PM called up chief minister Raman Singh to offer para-military reinforcements. Raman Singh had returned to Raipur, cancelling his Vikas Yatra, to hold an emergency meeting of the state cabinet. A three-day state mourning has been declared and all those who died in the attack will be given a state funeral.|$|E

25|$|Cleveland {{lost its}} {{first game of}} the season and was shut {{out for the first time}} in 62 games against the Giants in Cleveland. Unlike the Eagles, the Giants {{prepared}} <b>carefully</b> <b>for</b> the Browns and were able to stop the team's potent passing attack. After the Browns beat Philadelphia, Giants coach Steve Owen scouted the team and resolved to use an innovative umbrella defense, a formation where the defensive ends were used to cover passes. This freed the team's linebackers and safeties to cover passes over the middle of the field. The Giants advanced 52 yards on a drive in the first quarter, ending with a touchdown run by Eddie Price. The extra point attempt failed, but the six points were enough to win the game as New York's defensive strategy paid dividends. Graham had no completions in the first half and threw four interceptions. Cleveland had several opportunities to score late in the game, including a drive set up by a good punt return by Dom Moselle that ended with a fumble. Graham also missed on passes to Speedie and Horace Gillom in the end zone in the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen {{minutes to an hour}} of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do {{can mean the difference between}} a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched <b>carefully</b> <b>for</b> the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E
500|$|Compression {{ultrasonography}} {{has both}} high {{sensitivity and specificity}} for detecting DVT in symptomatic patients. Results are not reliable when the patient is symptomless and must be checked <b>carefully.</b> <b>For</b> [...] example, in high risk post-operative patients, mainly after orthopedic surgery where there is already lower limb pain and edema following surgery, thrombi can be localized in the calf veins and often these are not completely occlusive. In this situation a complete examination is mandatory.|$|E

500|$|Hard {{suction hose}} {{may also be}} used to connect a fire engine to a hydrant. [...] This {{practice}} is common in Australia, but woven jacket fire hose is normally used for this purpose in the United States. [...] Using hard suction hose in this manner requires that the fire engine be positioned <b>carefully</b> <b>for</b> the limited flexibility of the hose, and may require multiple firefighters due to the weight and bulk of the hose section. In certain circumstances, {{it may be possible to}} use hard suction hose to draft from a hydrant with adequate water supply but a low flow rate.|$|E

Temperament is critical; the horse must remain responsive under pressure and not become excited or difficult to control. Many are Thoroughbreds or Thoroughbred crosses. They are trained to be handled {{with one hand on}} the reins, and to respond to the rider's leg and weight cues for moving forward, turning and stopping. A well trained horse will carry its rider smoothly and swiftly to the ball and can account for 60 to 75 percent of the player's skill and net worth to his team.|$|E
