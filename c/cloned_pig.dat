In this study, we investigated {{the correlation between}} OPN mRNA and its promoter methylation changes by the 5 -aza-dc treatment in fibroblast cell and promoter assay. Aberrant methylation of porcine OPN was frequently found in different tissues of somatic nuclear transferred cloning pigs, and bisulfite sequence data suggested that the OPN promoter region − 2615 to − 2239 nucleotides (nt) may be a crucial regulation DNA element.

However, concerns about whether SCNT animals are as healthy or epigenetically normal as conventionally bred ones are raised as {{the efficiency of}} cloning by SCNT is much lower than natural breeding or In-vitro fertilization (IVF). Thus, we have conducted a genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiling between phenotypically normal <b>cloned</b> <b>pigs</b> and control pigs in two tissues (muscle and liver), using Affymetrix Porcine expression array as well as modified methylation-specific digital karyotyping (MMSDK) and Solexa sequencing technology.

40|$|Abstract. Somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} (SCNT) {{is a useful}} technique for creating pig strains that model human diseases. However, production of numerous cloned disease model pigs by SCNT for large-scale experiments is impractical due to its complexity and inefficiency.

A founder diabetes transgenic <b>cloned</b> <b>pig</b> was generated by SCNT and treated with insulin to allow for normal growth to maturity, at which point epididymal sperm could be collected for cryopreservation.

40|$|The current {{research}} was conducted to explore the in vitro developmental outcome and cytological/molecular quality of porcine nuclear-transferred (NT) embryos reconstituted with adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ABM-MSCs) that were epigenetically transformed by treatment with nonspecific inhibitor of histone deacetylases, known as trichostatin A (TSA). The cytological quality of cloned blastocysts was assessed by estimation of the total cells number (TCN) and apoptotic index. Their molecular quality was evaluated by real-time PCR-mediated quantification of gene transcripts for pluripotency- and multipotent stemness-related markers (Oct 4, Nanog, and Nestin). The morula and blastocyst formation rates of NT embryos derived from ABM-MSCs undergoing TSA treatment {{were significantly higher than}} in the TSA-unexposed group. Moreover, the NT blastocysts generated using TSA-treated ABM-MSCs exhibited significantly higher TCN and increased pluripotency extent measured with relative abundance of Oct 4 and Nanog mRNAs as compared to the TSA-untreated group.

To provide {{an overview of}} some influencing factors related to embryo transfer, the follow-up data related to <b>cloned</b> <b>pig</b> production collected in our laboratory was examined. (i) Spring showed a higher full-term pregnancy rate compared with winter (33. 6 % vs 18. 6 %, P =  0. 006). Furthermore, a regression equation can be drawn between full-term pregnancy numbers and pregnancy numbers in different months (y =  0. 692 x− 3. 326). (ii) There were no significant differences detected in the number of transferred embryos between surrogate sows exhibiting full-term development compared to those that did not. (iii) Non-ovulating surrogate sows presented a higher percentage of full-term pregnancies compared with ovulating sows (32. 0 % vs 17. 5 %, P =  0. 004; respectively). (iv) Abortion was most likely to take place between Day 27 to Day 34. (v) Based on Life Table Survival Analysis, delivery in normally fertilized and surrogate sows is expected to be completed before Day 117 or Day 125, respectively. Additionally, the length of pregnancy in surrogate sows was negatively correlated with the average litter size, which was not found for normally fertilized sows. In conclusion, performing embryo transfer in appropriate seasons, improving the quality of embryos transferred, optimizing the timing of embryo transfer, limiting the occurrence of abortion, combined with ameliorating the management of delivery, is expected to result in the harvest of a great number of surviving cloned piglets...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{is a major}} epigenetic modification in the mammalian genome {{that regulates}} crucial aspects of gene function. Mammalian cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) often results in gestational or neonatal failure with only {{a small proportion of}} manipulated embryos producing live births. Many of the embryos that survive to term later succumb to a variety of abnormalities that are likely due to inappropriate epigenetic reprogramming. Aberrant methylation patterns of imprinted genes in cloned cattle and mice have been elucidated, but few reports have analyzed the <b>cloned</b> <b>pig</b> genome. Four surviving cloned sows that were created by ear fibroblast nuclear transfer, each with a different life span and multiple organ defects, such as heart defects and bone growth delay, were used as epigenetic study materials. First, we identified four putative differential methylation regions (DMR) of imprinted genes in the wild-type pig genome, including two maternally imprinted loci (INS and IGF 2) and two paternally imprinted loci (H 19 and IGF 2 R). Aberrant DNA methylation, either hypermethylation or hypomethylation, commonly appeared in H 19 (45 % of imprinted loci hypermethylated vs. 30 % hypomethylated), IGF 2 (40 % vs. 0 %), INS (50 % vs. 5 %), and IGF 2 R (15 % vs. 45 %) in multiple tissues from these four cloned sows compared with wild-type pigs. Our data suggest that aberrant epigenetic modifications occur frequently in the genome of cloned swine. Even with successful production of cloned swine that avoid prenatal or postnatal death, the perturbation of methylation in imprinted genes still exists, which may be one of reason for their adult pathologies and short life. Understanding the aberrant pattern of gene imprinting would permit improvements in future cloning techniques...|$|E

These expression aberrations could potentially cause the following pathological anomalies in clones: diabetic nephropathy in the kidney and dysregulated surfactant homeostasis in the lung. Interestingly, upregulated expression of genes belonging to the MAPK pathway was observed in all three organs. To investigate whether the differences in levels of gene expression were caused by differential DNA methylation, the global DNA methylation level was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Stresses {{placed on}} both the egg cell and the {{introduced}} nucleus in early research were enormous, resulting in a low percentage of successfully reprogrammed cells. For example, in 1996 Dolly the sheep was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood. As the procedure was not automated, but had to be performed manually under a microscope, SCNT was very resource intensive. The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the differentiated somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from understood. However, by 2014, researchers were reporting success rates of 70-80% with <b>cloning</b> <b>pigs</b> and in 2016 a Korean company, Sooam Biotech, {{was reported to be}} producing 500 cloned embryos a day.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{transfer}} (NT) is {{a procedure}} by which genetically identical individuals can be created. The technology of pig somatic NT, including {{in vitro maturation}} of oocytes, isolation and treatment of donor cells, artificial activation of reconstructed oocytes, embryo culture and embryo transfer, has been intensively studied in recent years, resulting in birth of <b>cloned</b> <b>pigs</b> in many labs. While it provides an efficient method for producing transgenic pigs, more importantly, {{it is the only}} way to produce gene-targeted pigs. So far <b>pig</b> <b>cloning</b> has been successfully used to produce transgenic pigs expressing the green fluorescence protein, expand transgenic pig groups and create gene targeted pigs which are deficient of alpha- 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase. The production of pigs with genetic modification by NT is now in the transition from investigation to practical use. Although the efficiency of somatic cell NT in pig, when measured as development to term as a proportion of oocytes used, is not high, it is anticipated that the ability of making specific modifications to the swine genome will result in this technology having a large impact not only on medicine but also on agriculture...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cloned</b> <b>pigs</b> {{generated}} by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) show a greater ratio of early abortion during mid-gestation than normal controls. X-linked genes {{have been demonstrated}} to be important {{for the development of}} cloned embryos. To determine the relationship between the expression of X-linked genes and abortion of cloned porcine fetuses, the expression of X-linked genes were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and the methylation status of Xist DMR was performed by bisulfate-specific PCR (BSP). q-PCR analysis indicated that there was aberrant expression of X-linked genes, especially the upregulated expression of Xist in both female and male aborted fetuses compared to control fetuses. Results of BSP suggested that hypomethylation of Xist occurred in aborted fetuses, whether male or female. These results suggest that the abnormal expression of Xist may be associated with the abortion of fetuses derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos...|$|R
