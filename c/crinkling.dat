500|$|La Venta Monument3 stands [...] {{high and}} {{measures}} [...] wide by [...] deep; it weighs 12.8 tons. Monument3 was located a few metres {{to the east}} of Monument2, but was moved to the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa. Like the other La Venta heads, its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600BC. It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through weathering, making analysis difficult. It had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion. Straps descend in front of each ear and continue {{to the base of the}} monument. The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps; they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olmec region. Although most of the facial detail is lost, the <b>crinkling</b> of the bridge of the nose is still evident, a feature that is common to the frowning expressions of the other Olmec colossal heads.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent times}} more {{systematic}} hill lists {{have been produced}} based upon topographical prominence and height, rather than mere visual appeal. Most relevant to <b>Crinkle</b> Crags are the lists of Hewitts and Nuttalls. These variously list the summit, the first <b>Crinkle</b> (<b>Crinkle</b> Crags South Top), and two tops on Shelter Crags (Shelter Crags and Shelter Crags North Top), but exclude the other three <b>Crinkles.</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the mechanisms involved in Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, we examined a novel symbiotic mutant, <b>crinkle</b> (Ljsym 79), {{from the model}} legume Lotus japonicus. On nitrogen-starved medium, <b>crinkle</b> mutants inoculated with the symbiont bacterium Mesorhizobium loti MAFF 303099 showed severe nitrogen deficiency symptoms. This mutant was characterized by the production of many bumps and small, white, uninfected nodule-like structures. Few nodules were pale-pink and irregularly shaped with nitrogen-fixing bacteroids and expressing leghemoglobin mRNA. Morphological analysis of infected roots showed that nodulation in <b>crinkle</b> mutants is blocked at {{the stage of the}} infection process. Confocal microscopy and histological examination of <b>crinkle</b> nodules revealed that infection threads were arrested upon penetrating the epidermal cells. Starch accumulation in uninfected cells and undeveloped vascular bundles were also noted in <b>crinkle</b> nodules. Results suggest that the <b>Crinkle</b> gene controls the infection process that is crucial during the early stage of nodule organogenesis. Aside from the symbiotic phenotypes, <b>crinkle</b> mutants also developed morphological alterations, such as crinkly or wavy trichomes, short seedpods with aborted embryos, and swollen root hairs. <b>crinkle</b> is therefore required for symbiotic nodule development and for other aspects of plant development...|$|R

2500|$|The {{nomenclature}} of {{the various}} tops is very confused. Traditional guidebooks tend to rely on what the eye sees and therefore focus attention upon the five ‘crinkles’ of the summit ridge. These are generally {{referred to as the}} first to fifth <b>crinkles,</b> but Richards starts in the north, Birkett [...] in the south and Wainwright [...] employs both conventions, depending upon the direction of travel. For clarity in this article the first <b>crinkle</b> will be taken as the southernmost top. On this basis, the second <b>Crinkle</b> (also called Long Top) is the true summit of the fell. The only other <b>Crinkle</b> with a definitive name is Gunson Knott, the fifth. To the north of the <b>Crinkles</b> proper is a depression and then the outcropping continues over Shelter Crags.|$|R
40|$|Development of the {{wrinkled}} fabrics {{depends on}} geometry and relaxation {{behavior of the}} multilayer woven fabrics. After bleaching and relaxation, the new shapes and sizes of <b>crinkles</b> were recorded. The results prove that the manner of fabric deformation during relaxation depends upon the multilayer fabrics structure. The quantities of the <b>crinkles</b> on the fabric {{are related to the}} float length type. Multilayer woven fabrics with longer float length show higher <b>crinkled,</b> and its deformation behavior is non-linear. Thus, connected deformations are closely related to the stretch potential and influence multilayer woven fabrics draping and fitting of the garment. For this purpose, we have postulated new model for the relationship between fabric geometry and stretch potential. The suggested hypotheses make it possible to predict mathematically the <b>crinkle</b> of multilayer woven fabrics and prediction of suitable-sett of warp and weft. The area covering value was chosen as suitable model for description of multilayer woven fabrics structure. The study was divided into two parts, the first presents the relationship between fabric geometry of the relaxation behavior whereas the second investigated the influence of multilayer woven fabrics stretch potential on the relaxation ability of bleached fabric. Three variants of cumulative parameter of a <b>crinkle</b> woven fabrics structure were introduced. The realistic models based on a better approach of geometry and material properties will be created in order to investigate the numerical analysis performance of the mechanical properties of <b>crinkle</b> woven fabrics. A correlation between calculated values of structural parameters <b>crinkle</b> multilayer woven fabrics values was evaluated...|$|R
