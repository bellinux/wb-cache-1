5|$|<b>Conveyor</b> belts offer a very {{efficient}} method of loading, with standard loading rates varying between 100 and 700tons per hour, although {{the most advanced}} ports can offer rates of 16,000tons per hour. Start-up and shutdown procedures with <b>conveyor</b> belts, though, are complicated and require time to carry out. Self-discharging ships use <b>conveyor</b> belts with load rates of around 1,000tons per hour.|$|E
5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes to offload coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A <b>conveyor</b> belt system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. The <b>conveyor</b> belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead gantry with a <b>conveyor</b> belt attached to the <b>conveyor</b> belt system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|E
5|$|The left {{edge of the}} <b>conveyor</b> belt is sharp due {{to higher}} density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of {{stratiform}} precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along the <b>conveyor</b> belt. Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this <b>conveyor</b> belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold <b>conveyor</b> belt originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E
50|$|In {{similarity}} to vertical <b>conveyors,</b> spiral <b>conveyors</b> {{raise and lower}} materials to different levels of a facility. In contrast, spiral <b>conveyors</b> are able to transport material loads in a continuous flow. Industries that require a higher output of materials - food and beverage, retail case packaging, pharmaceuticals - typically incorporate these <b>conveyors</b> into their systems over standard vertical <b>conveyors</b> due {{to their ability to}} facilitate high throughput. Most spiral <b>conveyors</b> also have a lower angle of incline or decline (11 degrees or less) to prevent sliding and tumbling during operation.|$|R

5|$|The two establishments were {{constructed}} in South East Northumberland {{as part of}} an incentive to lower the high unemployment numbers. The site was also chosen because of the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries. Ellington Colliery sunk in 1909, with Lynemouth Colliery sinking 18 years later. However, in 1968, the two collieries were connected underground by the Bewick Drift, from which coal was brought to the surface. The Drift had no rail connection, and so coal was sent to the washery at Lynemouth by <b>conveyor</b> belt. The power station was constructed nearby the end of the <b>conveyor</b> belt.|$|E

5|$|Polar front {{theory is}} {{attributed}} to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. A <b>conveyor</b> belt, also referred to as the warm <b>conveyor</b> belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of the <b>conveyor</b> belt originated in 1969.|$|E

5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving <b>conveyor</b> belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under <b>conveyor</b> belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E

These <b>conveyors</b> should use only the highest quality premium belting products, which reduces belt stretch and results in less maintenance for tension adjustments. Belt <b>conveyors</b> can be used to transport product in a straight line or through changes in elevation or direction.

5|$|After {{years of}} {{persistence}} and attempts at marketing, Evans's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal <b>conveyor</b> to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and <b>conveyor</b> belt to his designs, and now possessed {{a full complement of}} materials handling machines for just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|E
