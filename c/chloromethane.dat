40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The charge {{distribution}} of halogen atoms on organochlorine compounds {{can be highly}} anisotropic and even display a so-called σ-hole, which leads to strong halogen bonds with electron donors. In this paper, we have systematically investigated a series of <b>chloromethanes</b> with one to four chloro substituents using a polarizable multipole-based molecular mechanics model. The atomic multipoles accurately reproduced the ab initio electrostatic potential around <b>chloromethanes,</b> including CCl 4, which has a prominent σ-hole on the Cl atom. The van der Waals parameters for Cl were fitted to the experimental density and heat of vaporization. The calculated hydration free energy, solvent reaction fields, and interaction energies of several homo- and heterodimer of <b>chloromethanes</b> are in good agreement with experimental and ab initio data. This study suggests that sophisticated electrostatic models, such as polarizable atomic multipoles, are needed for accurate description of electrostatics in organochlorine compounds and halogen bonds, although further improvement is necessary for better transferability. Halogen atoms are commonly found in inorganic, organic, and pharmacological molecules. 1 − 3 It {{has been reported that}} ∼ 50 % of compounds in high-throughput drug screening contain...|$|R

25|$|In 1847, Scottish {{obstetrician}} James Y. Simpson was {{the first}} to demonstrate the anaesthetic properties of chloroform on humans and helped to popularise the drug for use in medicine. By the 1850s, chloroform was being produced on a commercial basis by using the Liebig procedure, which retained its importance until the 1960s. Today, chloroform — along with dichloromethane — is prepared exclusively and on a massive scale by the chlorination of methane and <b>chloromethane.</b>|$|E

In searching for a new refrigerant, requirements for the compound were: low boiling point, low toxicity, and to be generally non-reactive.

There is also a thermal heterogeneous decomposition of nitrous oxide which also produces nitrogen. The photolysis of CC 14, CFC 13, CF 2 C 12 adsorbed on fused quartz and on different types of sand was also investigated. There was no thermal heterogeneous reaction with any of these <b>chloromethanes.</b> Apparently the larger bond energy of approximately 74 kcal for the C-C 1 bond compared to approximately 40 kcal for the N-O bond in N 2 O makes the thermal reaction inoperative for the <b>chloromethanes...</b>|$|R

25|$|In organic chemistry, ammonia {{can act as}} a {{nucleophile}} in substitution reactions. Amines can {{be formed}} by the reaction of ammonia with alkyl halides, although the resulting -NH2 group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the hydrogen halide formed. Methylamine is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with <b>chloromethane,</b> and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare racemic alanine in 70% yield. Ethanolamine is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with ethylene oxide: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce diethanolamine and triethanolamine.|$|E

40|$|Substrates {{containing}} a P 3 aspartic residue are in general cleaved poorly by thrombin. This may be {{partly due to}} an unfavourable interaction between the P 3 aspartate and Glu 192 in the active site of thrombin. In Protein C activation and perhaps also thrombin receptor cleavage, binding of ligands at the anion-binding exosite of thrombin seems to improve the activity of thrombin with substrates {{containing a}} P 3 aspartate. To investigate the importance of Glu 192 and exosite-binding in modulating thrombin's interactions with a P 3 aspartate, peptidyl <b>chloromethanes</b> based on the sequence of the thrombin receptor (containing a P 3 aspartate) have been synthesized and the kinetics of their inactivation of alpha-thrombin and the mutant Glu 192 [...] >Gln determined. The values of the inactivation rate constant (ki) for the <b>chloromethanes</b> containing a P 3 aspartate were about two-fold higher with the Glu 192 [...] >Gln mutant. A peptide based on the sequence of hirudin (rhir 52 65), which binds to the anion-binding exosite of thrombin, was an allosteric modulator of the amidolytic activity of the Glu 192 [...] >Gln mutant; a 5 -fold decrease in the K(m) value for the substrate D-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide was observed {{in the presence of}} saturating concentrations of rhir 52 - 65.

However, the increases in the ki values were greater with the Glu 192 [...] >Gln mutant (5 -fold compared with 2 -fold for alpha-thrombin). Thus exosite binding does not seem to mitigate putative unfavourable interactions between Glu 192 and the P 3 aspartate. Moreover, increases in the ki caused by exosite binding were not unique to <b>chloromethanes</b> containing a P 3 aspartate; increases of the same magnitude were also observed when the P 3 position was occupied by the favourable D-phenylalanine in place of the unfavourable aspartate. The results obtained were consistent with exosite binding's causing changes in the conformation of the S 2 and/or S 1 site of thrombin...|$|R

40|$|In this work, we have {{examined}} the diffusive mixing of <b>chloromethanes</b> in different molecular solids H 2 O, D 2 O, and CH 3 OH by monitoring their chemical sputtering spectra due {{to the impact of}} Ar + ions in the collision energy range of 3 - 60 eV, focusing on amorphous solid water. The chemical sputtering spectra have been monitored over the temperature window accessible by liquid nitrogen, and the coverages of the molecules of interest and ice have been varied from one to several hundred monolayers. Instrumentation and sensitivity of the technique have been discussed. It is found that while the diffusion of CCl 4 in the molecular solids investigated is hindered, other choloromethanes such as CHCl 3 and CH 2 Cl 2 undergo diffusive mixing over the same temperature range. Quantitatively, while ∼ 4 monolayers (ML) of ice are found to block CCl 4 diffusion, the numbers are ∼ 250 and ∼ 600 ML for CHCl 3 and CH 2 Cl 2, respectively. Crystallinity of ice does not have any effect on the diffusivity of water molecules when it is deposited below the <b>chloromethanes.</b> The effect of substrate was insignificant, and the rise in temperature increased diffusive mixing wherever the process was observed at a lower temperature...|$|R

Measured rate coefficients for all reactions (except for O- 2 /CClF 3 and O- 2 and O-/CF 4 which do not react) are at or close to the collisional rate. Where electron transfer is exoergic it is observed for the chlorofluoromethanes {{but not for the}} <b>chloromethanes.</b> It is suggested that nucleophilic attack of O- and O- 2 on both chlorine and carbon (in the case of the chlorofluoromethanes) and on chlorine, carbon and hydrogen (in the case of the <b>chloromethanes)</b> are required to produce the observed products. It is also suggested that, with the exception of methyl chloride, the halide ion, X- (X = Cl or F), is not formed directly, but by the decomposition of ClX- which is formed with excess vibrational energy. Following a discussion of the relevance of our results to the effects of oxygen doping upon the response of an electron capture detector (ECD) to halocarbon, it is concluded that the currently accepted mechanism to explain the observed increased sensitivity of the ECD is partially in error. © 1993...|$|R

The paper discusses recent data derived from a geochemical and isotopic fingerprinting study carried out at the Pandora site which {{is characterized by the}} existence of long VC plume and the Caretti site where high concentrations of chlorinated compounds, including VC occur. Data was also collected in an unconfined aquifer underneath a major petrochemical plant. The isotope data showed than the unusual negative δ 13 C values observed in the VC at both sites (Pandora – 43 and – 65 ‰; Caretti: - 62 and – 72 ‰) could not be associated to reductive dechlorination of manufactured primary PCE or TCE. The isotope data showed also unusual negativeδ 13 C values for PCE and TCE in the impacted aquifer beneath the petrochemical plant and the Caretti site. Based on the industrial history in the region that included production of PVC and <b>chloromethanes</b> (ClM), it is postulated that the contamination in the Ferrara region is linked to wastes originating from the production of <b>chloromethanes.</b> The primary organic compound used in ClM production is methane, which is strongly depleted in 13 C similar to the values observed in VC, PCE and TCE at the investigated sites.
