5|$|After the 1943 Argentine coup d'état, Juan Perón, {{a member}} of the United Officers Group that {{engineered}} the plot, became Minister of Labor. Campaigning among workers with promises of land, higher wages, and social security, he won a decisive victory in the 1946 presidential elections. Under Perón, the number of unionized workers expanded as he helped to establish the powerful General Confederation of Labor. Perón turned Argentina into a corporatist <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> powerful organized interest groups negotiated for positions and resources. During these years, Argentina developed the largest middle class on the South American continent.|$|E

Traumatized by the events of the Russian Revolution, Olga wished to sever all ties with the <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> her family had been massacred.

5|$|Aside {{from sports}} that have world-wide appeal and competitions, {{such as the}} Olympic Games, the {{entertainment}} value of a sport depends on the culture and <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it is played. For example, in the United States, baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is rugby union; in Iran, it is freestyle wrestling. Japan's unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history. In some cases, such as the international running group Hash House Harriers, participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component {{is more important than}} the competitive.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} status as the largest {{warships}} in the U.S. Navy, the deployment of an aircraft carrier can fulfill a symbolic role, not {{just in terms of}} a deterrent to an enemy, but often as a diplomatic tool, in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can take place either as a single visit to a <b>country,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operating of the carrier and to interact with its senior officers, or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, or other deployments involving training, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international Maritime security operations, combating piracy in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia.|$|E
5|$|Griesbach {{agreed with}} Woide and {{expanded}} on Michaelis' point of view. If this manuscript has been corrupted from a version, {{it is more}} reasonable to suspect the Coptic, the version of the <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it was written. Between this manuscript and both the Coptic and Syriac versions there is a remarkable coincidence. According to Griesbach the manuscript follows three different editions: the Byzantine in the Gospels, the Western in the Acts and General epistles, and the Alexandrian in the Pauline epistles. Griesbach designated the codex by letter A.|$|E

5|$|International law {{requires}} that every merchant ship be registered in a country. The <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a ship is registered is its flag state, and the flag state gives the ship the right to fly its civil ensign. A ship's flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. A ship operates under the laws of its flag state, and these laws are used if the ship is involved in an admiralty case. The organization which actually registers the ship is known as its registry. Registries may be governmental or private agencies.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to modern}} times, horse breeds {{throughout}} Europe were known {{primarily by the}} name of the region where they were bred. The Lusitano takes its name from Lusitania, an ancient Roman name for the region that today is Portugal. A very similar horse, the Spanish Andalusian, originally described the horses of distinct quality that came from Andalusia in Spain. Some sources state that the Andalusian and the Lusitano are genetically the same breed, and the only difference is the <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> individual horses are born. The Lusitano is also known as the Portuguese, Peninsular, National or Betico-lusitano horse.|$|E
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E
