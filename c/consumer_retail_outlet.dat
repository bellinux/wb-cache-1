50|$|A {{relatively}} recent innovation in retailing {{is the introduction}} of designer private labels. Designer-private labels involve a collaborative contract between a well-known fashion designer and a retailer. Both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the <b>consumer’s</b> budget. For <b>retail</b> <b>outlets,</b> these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic.|$|R
50|$|Historically in Indonesia {{popular music}} has been sold to <b>consumers</b> through small <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> whose {{merchandise}} mainly consists of cassettes and VCDs. Although music-related e-commerce is a small sector {{in the country and}} mainly focuses on selling to customers outside Indonesia, it is more likely to contribute to the internationalization {{of what used to be}} national or regional Indonesian popular music. Unlike retailers, e-commerce does not shape or reflect the consumption of Indonesian music by Indonesians. Like many institutions in Indonesia, popular music <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> are stratified by social class and generally calculate their sales activities based on the needs and interests of their intended audience.|$|R

Occupation of floor space {{needs to be}} limited to the essential minimum, especially for non customer interaction spaces. <b>Retail</b> <b>outlets</b> are generally not built to standard designs, but customised to suit their locality and customer potential. The result was the requirement of a supermarket chain for a design tool for fruit and vegetable receiving facilities. The space requirements of storage areas as a function of operational parameters such as store sales volumes are the model outputs. Apart from using the tool for new store designs, it is required to serve as a measurement tool for existing stores. The study describes the development of the design tool using Pareto principles, regression and finally facility design practices. The tool defines the floor space required relating to the confidence level required for the storage area to be large enough for variations in receipt volumes through the course of a year...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{economic}} and mathematical simulation of an autonomous network of <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> at a local market. The question of simulation of redistribution precesses in the network is discussed. Two interconnected and complemented economic -mathematical models are suggested. These models describe the evolution precesses of the sale conditions in the network. They are constructed {{on the basis of}} the price demand and the system state functions. The mathematical models are described by a dynamic system of partial differential equations. The main attention is given to mathematical simulation of the redistribution process of <b>consumer</b> demand through <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> in the network under fluctuations of prices. The numerical realization of the models is discussed. Computer simulations show that the proposed models can adequately reflect some real processes of the sales redistribution in the network...|$|R

40|$|The 'sustainable seafood movement' is over 20 years old, and {{has made}} use of {{numerous}} methods {{in an attempt to}} educate consumers about seafood. In South Africa, there are two such campaigns: the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and the Southern African Sustainable Seafood Initiative (SASSI). This study aimed to investigate the awareness of <b>consumers</b> at major <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> in Cape Town of these initiatives, and to link awareness with seafood consumption behaviour. It used face-to-face surveys, which were conducted at all times of the week in outlets of three major supermarket chains located at five middle-class shopping centres. Aspects investigated included consumers': recognition of the MSC and SASSI; preferred seafood species; production method(s); and favoured sources of seafood. The data were analysed by means of chi-squared (χ 2) analysis. The MSC label was recognised by slightly over a tenth of the consumers and SASSI by just less than half. Overall it was found that shoppers were more concerned about the quality and value for money, than the type, sustainability and size of their seafood. Consumers who shopped at the <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> which have a working relationship with SASSI did not show a higher awareness of SASSI. Even the consumers who were the most aware of SASSI and/or the MSC, and indicated that they considered sustainability a factor when making seafood choices, still favoured species from fisheries the sustainability of which is classified as problematic. The results point to raised awareness, yet unchanged purchasing behaviour...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Because {{women can}} {{initiate}} {{use of the}} female condom, the method is believed {{to make it easier}} for women to protect themselves against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV infection. Evidence is lacking about factors associated with trying the female condom and using it consistently. METHODS: A sample of 1, 740 sexually active <b>consumers</b> visiting <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> in urban Zimbabwe that sell male or female condoms were surveyed in 1998, one year after a social marketing campaign had begun. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess factors associated with ever-use of the female condom and consistent use (always or often) with marital and regular nonmarital partners. RESULTS: Perceived ease of use and affordability of the product and prior use of the male condom were associated with men’s and women’s ever-use. Consistent use with marital partners was negatively associated with reporting multiple partners in the past year (odds ratio, 0. 3) and positively associated with using the device for pregnancy prevention (5. 4) and previously using the male condom (8. 0). Consistent use with regular nonmarital partners was associated with numerous variables, including perceived ease of use (1. 9) and effectiveness for STI prevention (3. 8), low HIV risk perception (2. 4), and use for pregnancy (2. 9) and STI (2. 3) prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived affordability and ease of use may encourage couples to try the female condom but may not lead to consistent use. Because the reasons for use can vary between marital and nonmarital relationships, the femal...|$|R

40|$|We {{research}} the management approach that quantitatively combines {{decisions that affect}} different planning horizons [...] namely, the strategic and operational ones [...] and simultaneously derive the optimal values of these decisions. The system we investigate comprises <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> and customers in an infinite-horizon setting. Both <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> and customers are located on a finite homogenous line segment. The total demand posed by customers is normally distributed with known mean and variance. To optimally design and operate such a system, we need to determine the optimal values {{of the number of}} <b>retail</b> <b>outlets,</b> the location of each <b>retail</b> <b>outlet,</b> and the replenishment inventory levels maintained at each <b>retail</b> <b>outlet.</b> We analyze the system from an expected cost point of view, considering the fixed costs of operating the <b>retail</b> <b>outlets,</b> the expected holding and shortage costs, and the expected delivery costs. We show that all decisions can be represented {{as a function of the}} number of <b>retail</b> <b>outlets.</b> Moreover, we show that the system's expected cost function is quasi-convex in the number of <b>retail</b> <b>outlets.</b> We compare our model to a model that does not integrate these decisions at once.
