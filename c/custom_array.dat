However, without correctly standardized files there is a significant barrier for testing competing analysis approaches since this file is one of the required inputs for many commonly used algorithms. The need to test combinations of probe assignments and analysis algorithms led us to develop ArrayInitiative, a tool for creating and managing <b>custom</b> <b>array</b> specifications. Results ArrayInitiative is a standalone, cross-platform, rich client desktop application for creating correctly formatted, custom versions of manufacturer-provided (default) array specifications, requiring only minimal knowledge of the array specification rules and file formats. Users can import default array specifications, import probe sequences for a default array specification, design and import a <b>custom</b> <b>array</b> specification, export any array specification to multiple output formats, export the probe sequences for any array specification and browse high-level information about the microarray, such as version and number of probes. The initial release of ArrayInitiative supports the Affymetrix 3 ' IVT expression arrays we currently analyze, but as an open source application, we hope that others will contribute modules for other platforms. Conclusions ArrayInitiative allows researchers to create new array specifications, in a standard format, based upon their own requirements. This makes it easier to test competing design and analysis strategies that depend on probe definitions. Since the <b>custom</b> <b>array</b> specifications are easily exported to the manufacturer's standard format, researchers can analyze these customized microarray experiments using established software tools, such as those available in Bioconductor. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Normalization is a {{critical}} step in analysis of gene expression profiles. For dual-labeled arrays, global normalization assumes {{that the majority of}} the genes on the array are non-differentially expressed between the two channels and that the number of over-expressed genes approximately equals the number of under-expressed genes. These assumptions can be inappropriate for <b>custom</b> <b>arrays</b> or arrays in which the reference RNA is very different from the experimental samples. Results We propose a mixture model based normalization method that adaptively identifies non-differentially expressed genes and thereby substantially improves normalization for dual-labeled arrays in settings where the assumptions of global normalization are problematic. The new method is evaluated using both simulated and real data. Conclusions The new normalization method is effective for general microarray platforms when samples with very different expression profile are co-hybridized and for <b>custom</b> <b>arrays</b> where the majority of genes are likely to be differentially expressed. </p...|$|R

This process of including only variable genes narrowed the number of data points to be analysed to a more manageable number.

For Crohn's disease (CD), the iChip and GWAS data explained 19 and 26 % of variation in liability, respectively, and SNPs in the densely genotyped iChip regions explained 13 % of the SNP-heritability for both the iChip and GWAS data. For ulcerative colitis (UC), the iChip and GWAS data explained 15 and 19 % of variation in liability, respectively, and the dense iChip regions explained 10 and 9 % of the SNP-heritability in the iChip and the GWAS data. From bivariate analyses, estimates of the genetic correlation in risk between CD and UC were 0. 75 (SE 0. 017) and 0. 62 (SE 0. 042) for the iChip and GWAS data, respectively. We also quantified the SNP-heritability of genomic regions that did or did not contain the previous 163 GWAS hits for CD and UC, and SNP-heritability of the overlapping loci between the densely genotyped iChip regions and the 163 GWAS hits. For both diseases, over different genomic partitioning, the densely genotyped regions on the iChip tagged at least as much variation in liability as in the corresponding regions in the GWAS data, however a certain amount of tagged SNP-heritability in the GWAS data was lost using the iChip due to the low coverage at unselected regions.
