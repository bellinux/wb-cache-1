40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} of ranging patterns of both mono and polyspecific troops of Cercopithecus cephus, C. pogonias, and C. nictitans {{has shown that}} association results in a change of habitat use, including a less intensive exploitation and a better selection of the areas with the richest supply of fruit species. Consequently, associated species of Cercopithecus showed a more efficient search for fruit and a more diversified diet. In contrast, no such evidence was found for insect foraging. A clear interspecific division of roles in the patterns of warning about aerial and terrestrial predators has been demonstrated. The nictitans and pogonias species, living in the higher strata, were informed of terrestrial predators by C. cephus monkeys, which live lower. In turn, the latter benefitted from the C. pogonias male's loud calls given {{in the presence of}} aerial danger. Some evidence suggests that predation by the monkey-eagle upon C. cephus was decreased by the association. Although both foraging efficiency and predator avoidance appeared to be improved by polyspecific association, several facts suggest that predation pressure, notably by the <b>crowned</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>eagle,</b> was the prime factor for the evolution of this life style...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} behavioural features of many forest primates are the loud calls given by the adult males. Early observational studies repeatedly postulated that these calls function in intragroup spacing or intergroup avoidance. More recent field experiments with Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana) of Ta Forest, Ivory Coast, have clearly shown that loud male calls function as predator alarm calls because calls reliably (1) label different predator classes and (2) convey semantic information about the predator type present. Here, I test the alarm call hypothesis another primate, the Campbell’s monkey (C. campbelli). Like Diana monkeys, male Campbell’s monkeys produce conspicuous loud calls to crowned hawk eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus), two of their main predators. Playback experiments showed that monkeys responded to the predator category represented by the different playback stimuli, regardless of whether they consisted of (1) vocalisations of the actual predators (<b>crowned</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>eagle</b> shrieks or leopard growls), (2) alarm calls to crowned hawk eagles or leopards given by other male Campbell’s monkeys or (3) alarm calls to crowned hawk eagles or leopards given by sympatric male Diana monkeys. These experiments provide further evidence that non-human primates have evolved the cognitive capacity to produce and respond to referential labels for external events...|$|E
40|$|Five {{species of}} diurnal {{primates}} in the Kibale Forest of western Uganda [...] red colobus (Colobus badius), black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza), redtail monkeys (Cercopithecus a canius), blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis), mangabeys (Cercocebus albigena) [...] oflen associate in mixed-species groups that vary {{in size and}} composition from day to day. Across this range of species, we found no consistent effect of association on feeding rate. In addition, there is no systematic difference between the species-specific individual feeding rates when animals were in mixed-species groups feeding in a specific tree on one day and when individuals {{of one of the}} same species were feeding in the same individual tree on a subsequent day. I f associating in a mixed-species group lowers the risk of predation, one might expect hat the number of vigilant events wouM decrease in mixed-species groups. However, the only species to exhibit a consistent decrease in vigilant behavior when in association was the red colobus. Redtail monkeys were more vigilant when in association. We predicted that the density and distribution of food resources would both constrain the frequency of association and the size of mixed-species groups. Based on 22 months of data on food resources and bimontMy censuses, we found no relationship between the frequency of association (except mangabeys) or mean mixed-species group size and the density and distribution of food resources for all species. Finally, we examined the behavior of the monkeys in and out of association before and after the playback of a <b>crowned</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>eagle</b> call (Spizaetus coronatus), a known predator. When more species were in associatiort, the amount of time they spent being vigilant following the playback was greater and the response more intense than when fewer species were in association or when the group was alone.

40|$|A route census {{was carried}} out by one {{observer}} using the same methods along the same survey routes during the same seasons in 1996 and 2000 to estimate the abundance of medium- and large-sized diurnal mammals within the home range of the chimpanzees of M Group in the Mahale Mountains, western Tanzania. All eight mammalian species censused were known to have been consumed by chimpanzees, and there are other resident predators such as leopards and <b>crowned</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>eagles.</b> No statistically signifi cant differences were found in group densities of gregarious species or individual densities of non-gregarious species between the two data sets. However, frequencies of encounter with and estimates of group size of some species suggested possible decrease (bushbucks) or increase/non-decrease (red-tailed monkeys, yellow baboons, red colobus, warthogs, blue duikers and forest squirrels) from 1996 to 2000, although such an assumption could not be made for blue monkeys due to their low densities in both years. No quantitative predation data for the relevant period exist, but the results show that predation pressure as a whole including hunts by chimpanzees did not seem to exceed population growth rates of the prey mammals, with the exclusion of blue monkeys and the possible exception of bushbucks, during the 1996 - 2000 period at Mahale...|$|R
40|$|Primate long-distance calls have {{typically}} been interpreted as communication signals between conspecific groups (the ‘resource defence hypothesis’), but their potential role as anti- predator alarm calls has received comparably little attention. Male diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana diana, in the Taï forest of Côte d’Ivoire often utter long-distance calls, either spontaneously or {{in reaction to}} a variety of stimuli, including predators and non-predators. The present study focuses only on predation contexts and provides evidence for communication to both predators and conspecifics. Males called only in response to predators whose hunting success depends on unprepared prey, that is, leopards and <b>crowned</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>eagles,</b> but not in response to pursuit hunters, such as chimpanzees and humans, which can pursue the caller in the canopy. Calling was regularly combined with approaching the predator. Both observations suggest that male long-distance calls are used to signal detection to the predator (‘perception advertisement hypothesis’). Analysis of male long-distance calls given to leopards and eagles showed that they differed according to a number of acoustic parameters. The two call variants were played to different diana monkey groups; conspecifics responded to them as though the original predator were present. We conclude that, in addition to their function in perception advertisement, diana monkey long-distance calls function as within-group semantic signals that denote different types of predators...|$|R

40|$|The interrelationships between species composition, resource-use and availability, {{breeding}} and competition were studied in two hill habitat raptor communities in a conserved reserve and an unprotected communal land in Zimbabwe in 1995 and 1996. The conserved Lonestar Study Area (LSA) and the unprotected Communal Land Study area (CLSA) had 38 and 31 raptor species, high and normal diversities {{for the area}} sizes respectively. An estimated 147 pairs of 21 raptor species bred in 40 km² in the LSA compared to only 26 pairs of 22 raptor species per 40 km² in the CLSA. Six species (African <b>Hawk</b> <b>Eagle</b> Hieraaetus spilogaster, Black Eagle Aquila verreauxii, Crowned Eagle Stephanoaetus coronatus, Little Banded Goshawk Accipiter badius, Barn Owl Tyto alba,and Barred Owl Glancidium capense made up 69 % of breeding raptors in the LSA, while African <b>Hawk</b> <b>Eagles,</b> Little Banded Goshawks, Barn Owls and Barred Owls made up 58 % of the breeding raptors in the CLSA. The abundance of Black, <b>Crowned</b> and African <b>Hawk</b> <b>Eagles</b> in the LSA was linked to abundant hyrax, Heterohyrax brucei and Procavia capensis and juvenile bushbuck Tragelaphus prey, and the high reproduction rates of Natal Francolin Francolinus natalensis (0. 7 per ha when not breeding). Little Banded Goshawk and Barn Owl abundances were linked {{to their ability to}} change prey preferences according to prey availability. A fairly high rate of breeding attempts by eagles in the LSA in both years (60 - 76 % of all pairs per year) was probably also linked to prey abundance, Most breeding failures were predator related, and were more common in areas of relatively low nesting densities indicating lower parental vigilance there. High eagle breeding densities were associated with small mean territory sizes in the LSA (7. 7 - 10. 7 km² for the main eagle species). Eagles in the LSA usually nested closer to another eagle species than a conspecific, resulting in regular distributions of nests and no territory overlap within species. Differences in daily flight activity of eagles in both study areas, and in the onset of breeding between LSA eagles probably reduced interspecific aggression. Interspecific competition food and nest sites amongst LSA eagles was possibly lessened by slight ditferences in resource selection. Raptor resources were mostly unaffected by human activities in either study area during the study period. Differences in the raptor communities were probably as a result of natural habitat differences. The CLSA raptors potentially face resource loss through forest clearing and hunting. An expansion of the present CAMPFIRE program will protect the CLSA raptors. ...|$|R
