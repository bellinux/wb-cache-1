2500|$|The St. Lawrence Subdivision, {{a former}} New York Central Railroad {{secondary}} line, is a single-track railway that runs [...] from the Chicago Main Line near Carousel Center to the junction at Massena with the Canadian National Railway (CN) to Montreal. The portion from the Chicago Main Line to Watertown is [...] On that section {{there are two}} <b>controlled</b> <b>passing</b> sidings; one at Control Point Woodard (CP W) north of Liverpool within the Woodard Industrial Park, and another at Pulaski. The line serves Clay before traversing north to Parish and points beyond. In Liverpool, the tracks skirt the living history museum at St. Marie de Ganathaha and adjacent parklands on Onondaga Lake Parkway. The track is abutted on both sides by residential areas. North of Liverpool to Woodard is primarily industrial with some adjacent resident property, and beyond Woodard to Brewerton is primarily rural woodlands and mixed residential.|$|E
50|$|As in all funiculars, on the Gubałówka, a {{continuous}} steel cable {{is attached to}} a pair of tram-like carriages set at a steep angle on narrow gauge rails. These two carriages travel up and down the steep mountain slope, the ascending and descending vehicles counterbalancing each other in turn. The line is single, apart from one automatically <b>controlled</b> <b>passing</b> place situated roughly halfway up. The cable runs between the rails, guided by numerous roller wheels. Street style lighting is provided along the whole length of the line.|$|E
5000|$|Brooking was {{primarily}} right-footed, but was comfortable {{on his left}} foot. He played as an attacking midfield player, known for his <b>controlled</b> <b>passing</b> and midfield authority. Early in his career he was vulnerable to being out-muscled by opposition players (leading his teammates to nickname him 'Cyril' after Cyril Lord the carpet salesman, as Ron Greenwood told him [...] "you're always on the floor"). He lacked pace, leading to another nickname, Boog, after a slow baseball player called Boog Powell the team had witnessed during {{a tour of the}} United States. He was rarely booked or sent off during his West Ham career and due to his gentlemanly approach to the game where he rarely contested a referee's decision he picked up another nickname, Hadleigh, after a television upper class and urbane detective played by Gerald Harper.|$|E

50|$|The St. Lawrence Subdivision, {{a former}} New York Central Railroad {{secondary}} line, is a single-track railway that runs 158.8 mi from the Chicago Main Line near Carousel Center to the junction at Massena with the Canadian National Railway (CN) to Montreal.

50|$|In 1959, Graham McMillan and {{his brother}} Lex joined a new {{football}} club, Annerley. This club had just been promoted to the 1st Division and consisted {{of a number of}} young players having their first experience at that level. A very good friend of Graham McMillan's, Bill Barron, who had worked with McMillan as a trainer for many years joined Annerley as coach. Barron boasted very little soccer experience but was a great thinker and innovator and the club, to its credit, was prepared to give him a go. They were not disappointed. The team won every trophy on offer that year. The Minor Premiership, the Grand Final, the Hilton Shield and the Tristram Shield, in which Annerley F.C. won the final by nine (9) goals to nil. The newspaper report stated that, “the team gave the finest display ever seen by a Brisbane Club team. Their <b>controlled</b> <b>passing,</b> interchanging, pace and machine-like play ripped the oppositions defence to ribbons”. Graham McMillan {{and his brother}} Lex spent one more year with Annerley F.C, but with the emergence of the ethnic clubs in Brisbane, Lex was signed by Polonia whilst Graham McMillan was signed by Hellenic F.C. In Graham McMillan's first year with Hellenic F.C. he finally had his knee operated on. After a short rehabilitation period McMillan was back playing, ending the season with Hellenic as champions. Graham McMillan played 9 seasons with Hellenic F.C. during which time the team won 5 Premierships plus many other trophies.|$|E
40|$|In 1932 we {{described}} ' a method, {{which we}} have been employing in this hospital, for more accurately locating the posterior horns of the cerebral ventricles, and a device which facilitates this localization and aids in the ventricular puncture. This has proved in our hands satisfactory {{for a number of}} years. We believe it has tended to minimize unnecessary trauma from repeated unsuccessful punctures and has made possible accurate, <b>controlled</b> <b>passing</b> of the ventricular needle when the patient's head is safely protected with sterile drapes. With the idea of further perfecting this method, we have made a study of 360 sets of cerebral pneumograms. We report in this paper some of the data thus gained from this study, show the further development of the apparatus, and also include a few of the clinical findings from the study of the involved cases which we feel are worth recording. The main problems of ventricular puncture, from a surgical standpoint, seem to us to be: (1) to choose the part of the ventricle which is the most constant in location, which offers the largest target to hit with the least risk of injury to adjacent vulnerable structures; (2) to choose the surface approach to this target which offers the least risk of injury to important surface structures; (3) to be able to locate accurately the site for the trephine holes in relation to easily determined constant bony landmarks; and (4) from these trephine holes to fix accurately the pre-determined direction of the trocars when the patient's head is covered with sterile drapings. As to the first, we have followed Dandy and the others who have chosen the atrium of the lateral ventricle, or the site where the posterior horn, the body, and the descending horns all join together. As for the second, we have preferred to traverse the cortex well away from the visual cortical centers medially and the sensory centers laterally. For further data regarding the third, w...|$|E
