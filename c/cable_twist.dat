40|$|The strain {{state of}} the superconducting Nb 3 Sn strands in {{multi-stage}} twisted ITER Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICCs) strongly determines the transport properties. For an accurate prediction of the performance and a proper understanding of the underlying phenomena, {{a detailed analysis of}} the stress and strain distribution along all individual strands is imperative. Also during the cabling process, the axial stress of the individual strands must be well controlled to avoid kinks, in particular when mixing different strands, e. g., Nb 3 Sn and copper strands. A mechanical model for a superconducting cable (CORD) was developed, which can predict the strain and stress states of all single strands including interstrand contact force and the associated deformation. The simulation results are not only important for analysis but can be used for optimization of cable manufacturing and conductor design optimization.

40|$|During beam {{injection}} {{the components}} of the magnetic field inside the magnets decay in time. At the re-start of the ramping, this decay is cancelled resulting in a fast change of the harmonics called "snapback". This sudden variation affects mainly the sextupole and decapole components and can induce significant changes in the machine chromaticity, thus causing particle beam loss. Standard magnetic measurements with rotating coils do not have a sufficient time resolution to properly characterize the snapback phenomenon. A system based on Hall probes has been developed from an existing prototype to measure with a moderate acquisition frequency (3 - 10 Hz) the decay and snapback of the sextupole- and, for the first time, of the decapole fields. The present system also provides local measurements of these field harmonics along a wavelength of the superconducting <b>cable</b> <b>twist</b> pitch. In this paper, we describe the assembly features of this detector and of the measurement chain. The performances are demonstrated based on preliminary measurements performed on the LHC pre-series dipoles in operating conditions...|$|E

The model is validated comparing loss values per <b>cable</b> <b>twist</b> pitch with the ones obtained through analytical formulae present in literature; an excellent agreement is found. Conclusions are drawn regarding {{the choice of the}} boundary conditions and the minimum length of the cable sample, to simulate the behavior of real long cables. In order to suppress losses, a resistive core is inserted in the cable and this strategy is implemented in the model. Induced currents and losses distributions in cables with core are derived and compared with the uncored case; conclusions are drawn about the choice of core width, placement and electrical resistance, to maximize its effect.

40|$|Besides the {{temperature}} and magnetic field, the strain and stress state of the superconducting Nb 3 Sn wires in multi-stage twisted cable-in-conduit conductors (CICCs), as applied in ITER or high field magnets, strongly influence their transport properties. For an accurate quantitative prediction of the performance and a proper understanding of the underlying phenomena, {{a detailed analysis of}} the strain distribution along all individual wires is required. For this, the thermal contraction of the different components and the huge electromagnetic forces imposing bending and contact deformation must be taken into account, following the complex strand pattern and mutual interaction by contacts from surrounding strands. In this paper, we describe a numerical model for a superconducting cable, which can simulate the strain and stress states of all single wires including interstrand contact force and associated deformation. The strands in the cable can be all similar (Nb 3 Sn/Cu) or with the inclusion of different strand materials for protection (Cu, Glidcop). The simulation results are essential for the analysis and conductor design optimization from cabling to final magnet operation conditions. Comparisons are presented concerning the influence of the sequential <b>cable</b> <b>twist</b> pitches and the inclusion of copper strands on the mechanical properties and thus on the eventual strain distribution in the Nb 3 Sn filaments when subjected to electromagnetic forces, axial force and twist moment.

40|$|Superconducting {{accelerator}} magnets {{are fundamental}} components of high-energy particle accelerators. Very high field quality {{and stability of}} the magnets are {{required in order to}} operate the accelerator with minimizing　beam instability and beam loss. Particularly, time-varying field quality during a period of the beam injection is an important subject to be understood. A possible reason of the time-varying magnetic field is the change of the　superconductor magnetization due to local magnetic field change induced by redistribution of imbalance current in superconducting cables. In order to clarify and to evaluate the mechanism, experimental studies and their　evaluations with computer simulations were performed． 　　　Magnetic field measurements of the superconducting quadrupole　magnets (MQXAs) developed by KEK for the CERN/LHC insertion regions were carried out. The measurements at the beam injection current were performed by using a set of rotating harmonic coils after pre-excitations of the magnet. The periodic patterns of the magnetic field along the magnet axis, of which pattern length is equal to the <b>cable</b> <b>twist</b> pitch, was observed. The amplitude of the periodic pattern was decreased with time. The average field over the even number of the wave-length of the periodic pattern corresponding to the effective field quality, was also changed with time. It was thought that the decrease of amplitude is caused by equalization of imbalance currents in cables, and the change of average is caused by re-magnetization of superconducting filament．　From the measurements of 18 magnets, it was clarified that the behaviors of the amplitude and the average indicate strong dependences on the pre-excitation． 　　　A change of superconductor magnetization due to external field change was　experimentally evaluated. By using a vibration sample magnetometer (VSM), the　magnetization of superconductor used in the LHC magnets was measured. The behavior of re-magnetization of filaments induced by the external magnetic field with arbitrary direction was clarified． 　　　In order to evaluate the mechanism of time-varying magnetic field, a simulation program was developed. At first, the numerical model of re-magnetization was developed. In this model, persistent current, which flowed in a superconductor filament, was assigned as “nested cosine theta current distribution” in coaxial shell as division of filament. Magnetization behavior calculated by cosine theta model indicated good agreement with results measured by VSM. As the next step, a numerical model of imbalance currents was developed. The imbalance currents were ascribed as zigzag currents given randomly. The amplitude of periodic pattern induced by the zigzag currents was evaluated by means of Monte Carlo simulation. To reproduce the measured periodic pattern　amplitudes, current imbalance with a level of hundred amperes was required in calculation. 　　　A 3 -dimensinal full coils model based on the LHC magnet was developed as　extension of above programs. Imbalance currents in cables were assigned as zigzag current models on each cable position. Magnetic field in the magnet bore induced by the zigzag currents was computed, and a sinusoidal field pattern along the longitudinal axis was given. The local magnetic field at the strand in the coils was also calculated. Magnetization change of the superconductor filament in the coils, due to the local magnetic field change induced by zigzag current change, were computed by using the cosine theta model. Finally, the magnetic field in the bore induced by each magnetization of superconductor filaments in the coils was calculated. The simulation reproduced the magnetic field change in the magnet bore, by assuming the change of the zigzag currents which was needed to induce the periodic pattern consistent with measured results. It has been understood that magnetization change due to local magnetic field change induced by imbalance current redistribution causes the time-varying magnetic field during a period of beam injection in accelerator operation． 　　　In　conclusion, the field measurement of the magnets showed the strong　dependencies on periodic pattern amplitude and the average field to the　pre-excitation history. The computation model for superconductor magnetization by　cosine theta distribution was developed, and the calculation agreed with the VSM　measurements. The simulation for the imbalance currents in the cables has shown　the periodic pattern similar to the hat observed in the measurement. It has been　understood that the simulation combining the magnetization and the imbalance　currents has shown that the magnetization change due to the local field change induced by the decay of the imbalance currents are in good agreement with that　observed in the measurement...|$|E
