Morgan then defeated the <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British army under Tarleton on January 17, 1781, at Cowpens. As after {{the defeat of the}} Loyalists at King's Mountain, Cornwallis was criticized for his decision to detach a substantial part of his army without adequate support. Despite the setbacks, Cornwallis proceeded to advance into North Carolina, gambling that he would receive substantial Loyalist support. Greene evaded combat with Cornwallis, instead wearing his army down through a protracted war of attrition. By March, Greene's army had grown enough where he felt confident in facing Cornwallis. The two armies engaged at Guilford Courthouse on March 15, and, though Greene was beaten, Cornwallis' army had suffered irreplaceable casualties. Compounding this, far fewer Loyalists were joining as expected due to effective Patriot suppression. Cornwallis' casualties were such that he was compelled to retreat to Wilmington for reinforcement, leaving the interior of the Carolinas, and Georgia, wide open to Greene.|$|E

40|$|Native human CRP in {{solution}} formed complexes {{with the}} abnormal lipoprotein beta-VLDL in serum {{of patients with}} type III hyperlipoproteinaemia.

40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} use of flaxseed {{protein isolate}} (FPI) as an emulsifying agent was studied {{in combination with}} whey protein isolate (WPI) or alone. All the FPI and WPI–FPI emulsions were kinetically unstable. <b>The</b> increase <b>of</b> FPI concentration (0. 7 % w/v) led to a higher <b>creaming</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FPI emulsions due partly {{to a reduction in}} interfacial tension between aqueous and oil phases, but mainly to the gel network formation. However at this same high FPI concentration, WPI–FPI emulsions showed a decrease in droplet size and creaming stability, which could be due to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> flaxseed gum in the protein isolate enhancing depletion effects. A protein excess was verified in the mixed systems (0. 14 or 0. 7 % (w/v) FPI) and <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> FPI concentration led to an even greater surface protein content. Increasing homogenization conditions (pressure and number <b>of</b> passes), <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FPI systems increased, mainly at higher concentration (0. 7 % w/v). Meanwhile, in the mixed systems, <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emulsions containing 0. 7 % (w/v) FPI decreased even more, but was improved for the emulsions with 0. 14 % (w/v) FPI. Thus, it was observed that systems containing only FPI at higher concentration were stabilized by gel formation, while in WPI–FPI systems there was a competition by interface between biopolymers with a consequent depletion process. As a result, more stable systems were obtained with WPI addition at lower FPI concentration (0. 14 % w/v) and using higher homogenization pressure and number of passes (60 MPa, two passes) ...|$|R
