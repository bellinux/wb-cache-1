The aim of {{this work}} is to develop methods for an {{assessment}} of <b>critical</b> <b>doses</b> and dose rates that can result in significant radiation-induced effects in agrocenoses. This is realized on an example of cultivated plants which {{are one of the}} main components of agroecosystems. Available information on dose dependences in such umbrella endpoints as reproduction, survival, morbidity, alterations in morphological and biochemical processes, genetic effects in crops, vegetables, fruit trees, etc are gathered from papers issued mainly in Russian scientific press during last 50 years. Data are maintained as database in MS Access that contains about 10000 records at the moment. As <b>critical</b> exposure values, <b>doses</b> are considered producing 50 % changes of biological effect at acute impact (ED 50), or dose rates resulting in 10 % changes at chronic exposure of plants (EDR 10). The <b>critical</b> <b>doses</b> and dose rates for agrocenosis estimated from available information on reproduction and survival are presented here.

40|$|Purpose of {{this work}} was to study the effect of UV {{irradiation}} on a microecosystem consisting of several interacting species. The system chosen was of a hypersaline type, where all the species present live at high salt concentration; it comprises different bacteria; a producer, the photosynthetic green alga Dunaliella salina; and a consumer, the ciliated protozoan Fabrea salina, which form a complete food chain. We were able to establish the initial conditions {{that give rise to}} a self-sustaining microecosystem, stable for at least 3 weeks. We then determined the effect of UV irradiation on this microecosystem under laboratory-controlled conditions, in particular by measuring the critical UV exposure for the two main components of the microecosystem (algae and protozoa) under UV-B irradiances comparable to those of solar irradiation. In our experiments, we varied irradiance, total dose and spectral composition of the actinic light. The <b>critical</b> <b>doses</b> at irradiances of the order of 56 kJ/m 2 (typical average daily irradiance in a sunny summer day in Pisa), measured for each main component of the microecosystem (algae and ciliates), turned out to be around 70 kJ/m 2 for ciliates and 50 kJ/m 2 for D. salina. By exposing microecosystems to daily UV-B irradiances of the order of 8 kJ/m 2 (typical average daily irradiance in a sunny winter day in Pisa), we found no effect at total doses of the order of the <b>critical</b> <b>doses</b> at high irradiances, showing that the reciprocity law does not hold.

As increasing dose, the gel {{fraction of the}} film increased sharply above a <b>critical</b> <b>dose</b> and then decreased gradually after passing a maximum. The scission/cross-linking ratio and the <b>critical</b> <b>dose</b> were determined using the Charlesby-Rosiak equation as 0. 52 and 9 kGy for 10 % gel and 0. 43 and 14 kGy for 20 % gel, respectively. The gel fraction for 20 % HPMC film was lower at low dose and higher at high dose than that for 10 % film. The behavior of the swelling ratio of the gel film was just opposite {{to that of the}} gel fraction. The cross-linking density of the gel estimated from the Flory theory linearly increased with irradiation dose at low dose, passed a maximum around 100 and 160 kGy for 10 % and 20 % films, respectively, and decreased at high dose. These results suggest the competition of scission and cross-linking induced by indirect effect of irradiation.

Methods: In this study, 40 women underwent bone densitometry of Lunar DPX-MD system with pencil beam in two scan modes of AP spine and femur, simultaneously. Then surface doses of thyroid, uterus, scan center, and background were measured by placing 433 TLDs- 400 at the surface of thyroid and uterus and also scan center. Then correlation between scan center <b>dose</b> and <b>critical</b> organs surface <b>dose</b> were analyzed and regression functions with significant level were determined. Results: In AP spine and femoral scanning, average surface doses of thyroid (91 TLD- 400) and uterus (84 TLD- 400) were 1. 88 ± 1. 36 and 1. 81 ± 1. 03 µGy, respectively.

Effective doses were derived from measurements {{with the use of}} lithium-fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (LiF-TLD) at several organ sites using an Alderson-Rando phantom. RESULTS: LiF-TLD measurements resulted in effective doses of 1. 7 mSv for CT, 1. 9 mSv for CTA of intracranial vessels, and 2. 8 mSv for CTA of cervical vessels, respectively.
