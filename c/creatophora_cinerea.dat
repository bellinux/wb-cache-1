40|$|While egg {{destruction}} by brood parasites is {{a relatively}} well-known phenomenon, such destruction by non-brood-parasitic heterospecifics is less common. Here, we provide the first evidence of egg destruction by Wattled Starlings <b>Creatophora</b> <b>cinerea</b> on Pied Babblers Turdoides bicolor. We find that the incubation success of Pied Babblers decreases significantly following the arrival of Wattled Starlings at the study site, and we provide video evidence of Wattled Starlings destroying Pied Babbler eggs. This behaviour is costly to Pied Babblers, whose current reproductive attempt is abandoned, with subsequent reproductive attempts delayed by several weeks. We {{found no evidence that}} egg destruction occurred for nutritional benefit: Wattled Starlings never consumed the eggs they destroyed. Rather, this behaviour appears to represent a form of resource competition, since Wattled Starlings only predate babbler nests in habitats where the starlings also build their nests. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Four {{new species}} of feather mites {{belonging}} to three different genera of the family Pteronyssidae are described from passerine birds of South Africa: Pteroherpus africanus sp. n. from the garden bulbul Pycnonotus barbatus (Desfontaines) (Pycnonotidae), Pteroherpus cysticolae sp. n. from the wing-snapped cisticola Cisticola ayresii Hartlaub (Sylviidae), Pteronyssoides promeropis sp. n. from the Gurney’s sugarbird Promerops gurneyi Verreaux (Promeropidae), and Sturnotrogus creatophorae sp. n. from the wattled starling <b>Creatophora</b> <b>cinerea</b> Menschen (Sturnidae). A brief review of recent publications on the taxonomy of the family Pteronyssidae is given. The present paper continues the series of our publications dedicated to feather mites associated with South African passerines (Mironov and Kopij 1966 a, b, 1997, 2000) and includes descriptions of four new feather mite species of the family Pteronyssidae Oudemans, 1941. The family Pteronyssidae currently includes 18 genera and about 130 described species. The representatives of this family are mostly associated with different bird families of Piciformes and Passeri-formes and only one genus, Cleyastobius Gaud, 1981, occurs on the wooden hoopoes Phoeniculidae (Coracii-formes). A detailed generic revision of the family Pteronyssidae (considered in a status of subfamily) {{was carried out by}} Faccini and Atyeo (1981). A review of species associated with birds of the orders Piciforme...|$|E
40|$|A new Isospora (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) {{species is}} {{described}} {{from a single}} red-browed finch (Neochmia temporalis) (subspecies N. temporalis temporalis), {{that was part of}} a captive population in Western Australia. Sporulated oocysts of this isolate are spherical, 18. 3 (18. 2 - 18. 9) × 18. 2 (18. 2 - 18. 6) μm, with a shape index (length/width) of 1. 0; and a smooth and bilayered oocyst wall, 1. 2 μm thick (outer layer 0. 9 μm, inner 0. 3 μm). A polar granule is present, but the oocyst residuum and a micropyle are absent. The sporocysts are ovoid-shaped, 13. 3 (9. 5 - 16. 4) × 8. 6 (6. 8 - 10. 0) μm, with a shape index of 1. 5. An indistinct Stieda body is present, but the substieda body is absent. A sporocyst residuum is present and composed of numerous granules of different size scattered among the sporozoites. Morphologically, the oocysts from this isolate are different from those of all known valid Isospora spp. Molecular analysis was conducted at 4 loci; the 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COI) gene and the heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) gene. At the 18 S locus, this new isolate exhibited 99. 9 %, 99. 8 %, 99. 7 %, and 99. 5 % similarity to I. sp. MAH- 2013 a from a superb starling (Lamprotornis superbus), I. MS- 2003 from a Southern cape sparrow (Passer melanurus), I. sp. Tokyo from a domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica) and I. MS- 2003 from a Surinam crested oropendula (Psarocolius decumanus). At the 28 S locus, this new isolate exhibited 99. 7 % similarity to both an Isospora sp (MS- 2003) from a Northern house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and an Isospora sp. (MS- 2003) from a Southern cape sparrow. At the COI locus, this new isolate exhibited 98. 9 % similarity to an Isospora sp. ex Apodemus flavicollis. At the hsp 70 locus, this new isolate exhibited 99 % similarity to isolate MS- 2003 (. AY 283879) from a wattled starling (<b>Creatophora</b> <b>cinerea).</b> Based on morphological and molecular data, this isolate is a new species of Isospora, which is named Isospora neochmiae n. sp. after its host, the red-browed finch (Neochmia temporalis) ...|$|E
