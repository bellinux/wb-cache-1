There was a joint across the street called the <b>Copper</b> <b>Rail,</b> which was a soul food {{restaurant}} and a bar where the musicians from the Metropole would all hang out. Soon I learned Dizzy mentioned me in an interview in International Musician, the musician unionâ€™s magazine, when he was asked about any promising young musicians he'd heard." [...] He was a fan of Oscar Peterson from a young age and he studied with the master pianist from 1961-1962.

40|$|The {{transient}} response of a 0. 4 by 0. 6 cm rectangular bore rail accelerator was analyzed by a three dimensional finite element code. The <b>copper</b> <b>rail</b> deflected to a peak value of 0. 08 mm in compression and then oscillated at an amplitude of 0. 02 mm. Simultaneously the insulating side wall of glass fabric base, epoxy resin laminate (G- 1 o) was compressed to a peak value of 0. 13 mm and rebounded {{to a steady}} state in extension. Projectile pinch or blowby due to the rail extension or compression, respectively, can be identified by examining the time history of the rail displacement. The effect of blowby was most significant at the side wall characterized by mm size displacement in compression. Dynamic stress calculations indicate that the G- 10 supporting material behind the rail is subjected to over 21 MPa at which the G- 10 could fail if the laminate was not carefully oriented. Results for a polycarbonate resin (Lexan) side wall show much larger displacements and stresses than for G- 10. The tradeoff between the transparency of Lexan and the mechanical strength of G- 10 for sidewall material is obvious. Displacement calculations from the modal method are smaller than {{the results from the}} direct integration method by almost an order of magnitude, because the high frequency effect is neglected...|$|E

50|$|The model {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} some 20 drive coils through which a small armature (called the bucket) traveled, pushed by the pulsed magnetic fields of the drive coils. The bucket rode on four <b>rails</b> made from <b>copper</b> plumbing tubes, through which was fed direct current from several car batteries connected in series. It was an epoxy glass cylinder, roughly 10 cm in diameter by 20 cm long, wrapped with a coil of aluminium wire, energized by the batteries. The <b>copper</b> <b>rails</b> were mounted onto the interior of the drive coils, and the bucket was held onto the <b>copper</b> <b>rails</b> by spring-loaded beryllium copper strips with automotive carbon brushes mounted on the ends. The passage of the bucket depressed microswitches which triggered the discharge of capacitors through the drive coils.|$|R

En route it passed through Kajabbi (apparently derived from an Aboriginal word {{indicating}} a kite hawk) and Oona (formerly named Kalkadoon).

Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, College of EngineeringThe Electro Magnetic Rail Gun on board with Navy consists of high current carrying <b>copper</b> <b>rails.</b> Aprojectile carrier or armature slides over these rails with very high velocities. Inefficient sliding contact conditions between these two produces high rail wear. This restricts life of rails to a very less number of shots than expected. This research aims at finding effect of solid lubricant contact conditioner (SLIC) on sliding electrical contacts, which can help in predicting sliding interface behavior with and {{without the use of}} SLIC. The findings will ultimately help in increasing the rail life. The actual working conditions are simulated with an instrumented Pin-on-Disc setup. The setup is used to perform Static, Circular and Spiral sliding tests to estimate key quantities of interest such as contact resistance, coefficient of friction, amount of material transfer and wear. Tests are carried out at different current densities and contact force combinations, with and without use of conditioner. Test results show, use of solid lubricant conditioner reduces coefficient of friction by half in sliding, decreases amount of material transfer or wear but increases contact resistance by small amount...|$|R

Long range maritime land attack {{can be accomplished}} with today's chemically propelled munitions only by sacrificing responsiveness. Projectiles launched with electromagnetic forces can achieve velocities above 2 - 3 kilometers per second. The technical challenges to be overcome before electromagnetic launch can be considered practical for maritime land attack include development of high density pulsed power supplies, high current power switching and a long life launcher. To investigate electromagnetic launch technology a 1. 2 meter railgun was constructed. It was designed to allow augmentation and various bore configurations. The railgun power unit consists of two 11 kV, 830 microfarads capacitors discharging through a 7 micro-H inductor coil. A crowbar circuit provides capacitor protection. Operational testing of the firing circuit, instrumentation, power unit, and launcher structure was satisfactory. The 7 micro-H coil induced currents within the power unit, which adversely effected triggering circuitry. The molybdenum projectiles initially tested proved disappointing due to their tendency to meld with the <b>copper</b> <b>rails.</b> An extended current pulse resulting from such a meld caused failure of the crowbar circuit, which curtailed further testing. The induction coil could safely be discarded, and a revised crowbar circuit will prevent further failure.

50|$|The {{route to}} later connect Cloncurry with Mount Isa was a {{creature}} of history. Any extension beyond Cloncurry was overwhelmingly to be dictated by mining interests. The first section went south, with the second section going south west and the final section going north west. Firstly came the Selwyn Branch Railway (Dajarra and Selwyn railway lines) that opened on 15 December 1910 and ran south from Cloncurry to the Hampden and Mt Elliott mines. Smelted <b>copper</b> was <b>railed</b> east and coking coal on return journeys. Cattle and coke also exchanged trips. Next in 1911 came construction work on the Dajarra Branch Railway south-west of the Selwyn Branch. It branched from the Selwyn branch at Malbon and opened to Duchess on 21 October 1912 and to Dajarra on 16 April 1917.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the Selwyn Branch {{began in}} 1909. The line ran about 50 {{kilometres}} south from Cloncurry railway station to Malbon railway station with sidings built en route at Dolomite, Marimo, Mitakoodi and Marraba. From there it continued {{south to the}} Hampden mine and opened on 11 June 1910. The fledgling township was first named Gulatten, then Hampden, then {{for a brief time}} Friezland before finally being renamed in 1916 as Kuridala (an Aboriginal word indicating eagle hawk). [...] An extension further south to the Mount Elliott mine at Selwyn opened on 15 December 1910 (along with the Selwyn Range named after Alfred Selwyn, Director of the Geological Survey of Victoria). [...] Smelted <b>copper</b> was <b>railed</b> east and coking coal on return journeys. Cattle and coke also exchanged trips. Falling copper prices forced the closure of the Mount Elliott and Hampden smelters in 1919 and 1920 respectively. The branch continued to operate at a slow pace until it was closed in 1961. Road transport no doubt squeezed out the cattle market.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{electrified}} {{with a central}} rail sectional steel conductor; the sections were connected by copper strips, U shaped to allow expansion of the joints. The rails were used as return conductors, also connected by <b>copper</b> strips at <b>rail</b> joints. The total resistance was approximately 0.25 Ohms per mile. The centre track conductor was not laid at twelve level crossings; electrical connectivity was maintained by having a collector {{on the front and}} rear of the locomotive-carriages, the distance between which was greater than the insulated section. Another level crossing, made at a slew angle, 150 ft long used an overhead copper wire, 15 ft high, connecting to a cast iron collector {{on the roof of the}} locomotive. After a lightning strike resulted in several electrificutions, and caused blown fuses at the generator the rails were connected to earth at several points.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue is}} derived from {{ballistic}} erosion {{as it relates to}} nanoparticle production and respiration of these particles as a health concern ballistic erosion and ballistic erosion as it relates to railgun performance. A common thread between these two issues is dynamic recrystallization (DRX). DRX has been demonstrated to be the dominant mechanism for solid-state flow associated with ballistic projectile/target penetration and interaction, friction-stir welding phenomena, and other high-strain rate deformation phenomena. ^ Aerosol particulates collected on filters from ballistic penetration and erosion events for W-Ni-Co and W-Ni-Fe kinetic energy rod projectiles penetrating steel target plates were observed to be highly cytotoxic after 48 h exposure to human epithelial A 549 lung cells. The aerosol consisted of micron-size Fe particulates and nanoparticulate aggregates consisting of W, Ni or W, Co and some Fe, characterized by SEM and TEM, and using energy-dispersive (X-ray) spectrometry by (EDS) for elemental analysis and mapping. Cytotoxic assays of micron and nano-size, manufactured metal particulates of W, Ni, Fe, and Co demonstrated that only the nanoparticulate elements demonstrated measurable cytotoxicity. Aluminum projectile (or armature) tribomaterial deposition onto <b>copper</b> conducting <b>rails</b> in an experimental solid-armature railgun system was observed, by optical, SEM and TEM. The extreme deformation at the aluminum/copper interface creates a solid-state flow regime by dynamic recrystallization which also leads to the erosion-product deposition. Melting of the low-temperature aluminum deposit also contributes to the rail damage and degradation of electromagnetic behavior. The creation of nano-grains by dynamic recrystallization allows for mixing at the aluminum/copper interface, and there is no evidence for traditional alloying. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work has been to investigate {{the applicability of the}} gas gun to study the armature-rail interface wear characteristics relevant to rail gun operations. The approach involved developing constitutive models for armature materials (aluminum 6061) as well as oxygen-free high-thermal conductivity <b>copper</b> as the <b>rail</b> material. Taylor rod-on-anvil impact experiments were performed to validate the accuracy of constitutive strength models by correlating predictions of dynamic simulations in ANSYS AUTODYN with experimental observations. An optical comparator was used to discretize the cross sectional deformation profile of each rod-shaped sample. Parameters of the Johnson-Cook strength model were adjusted for each material to match deformation profiles obtained from simulations with profiles obtained from impact experiments. The fitted Johnson-Cook model parameters for each material were able to give overall deformed length and diameter values within 2 % of the experimentally observed data. Additional simulations were then used with the validated strength model parameters to design the geometry involving cylindrical rods of armature material accelerated through a concentric cylindrical extrusion die made of copper, to emulate the interface wear effects produced in a rail gun operation. Experiments were conducted using this geometry and employing both the 7. 62 mm and 80 mm diameter gas guns. Microstructural analysis was conducted on interfaces of the recovered samples from both designs. Hardness measurements were also performed along the interface layer to evaluate the structure formation due to solid-state wear or melt formation. The stress and strain conditions resulting in the observed microstructural effects were correlated with predictions from numerical simulations performed using the validated material models. The overall results illustrate that the stress-strain conditions produced during acceleration of Al through hollow concentric copper extrusion die, result in interface deformation and wear characteristics that are influenced by velocity. At velocities (less than 800 m/s), interface wear leads to formation of layer dominated by solid-state alloying of Cu and Al, while higher velocities produce a melted and re-solidified aluminum layer. Hence, use of different armature (Al-based) and rail (Cu-based) materials can be evaluated with the gas-gun set-up employed in the current work to study the effects of interface wear ranging from formation melt layer to solid-state alloying as a function of material properties and velocity.
