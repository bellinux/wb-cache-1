5|$|There {{are three}} unique Titan classes, {{variants}} of light, medium, and heavy, with inversely related speed and armor: the all-rounder Atlas, the bulky Ogre, and the fleet-footed Stryder. The latter two chassis are unlocked upon finishing both faction campaigns and were later made unlockable by leveling up as well. Each chassis has a respective <b>Core</b> <b>power</b> that {{works on a}} cooldown timer: respectively, increased damage, increased shields, and unlimited dashes. Titan tactical ability options include stopping enemy ammunition in midair to throw back in their direction, emitting electrified smoke to hurt and repel pilots climbing the Titan's back, and deploying a defensive wall. Additionally, players can equip two perk kits to customize for their preferred strategy. Their primary weapons include rocket launchers, lightning cannons, and chainguns. Titans can act autonomously when put in guard and follow modes, which directs the Titan either to protect their vicinity or to tail their pilot, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore <b>core</b> <b>power</b> was required. Unable to increase (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature, General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its basic size. They removed two stages {{from the rear of}} the HP compressor, leaving an empty air passage where the blades and vanes had once been. Two booster stages were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor, which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000lbf (227kN). The increase in core size and overall pressure ratio raised the core flow, decreasing the bypass ratio to 4.26.|$|E

It was designed to accommodate BMW's 4.4 litre M62 V8 engines for future models. The manual transmission was dropped entirely, leaving only the automatic. The 7 Series electronics system was being phased out during {{the development of the}} third-generation Range Rover and being replaced with the electronics from the BMW 5 Series (E39). Note that there were three [...] "Generations" [...] of the L322, from 2002 until 2005 was the aforementioned M62 BMW V8 with ZF 5HP-24 transmission, going along to 2006 until 2009 a 4.4-litre Jaguar derived engine alongside a 4.2-litre supercharged variant of the Jag engine partnered with the ZF 6HP-26 transmission. In 2010 Land Rover fitted the newly designed 5.0 N/A and Supercharged engine with ZF 6HP-26 until the 2012 model year, which saw the end of the L322 production.

5000|$|In the PS3/Xbox 360/PC game, {{throughout}} {{the game the}} Prince learns new powers. The biggest new feature is the addition of elemental powers, which behave as power-ups, enhancing the Prince's ability in battles and allowing him to access unreachable areas. There are four <b>core</b> <b>powers</b> in the game: Fire, Ice, Wind and Earth. Each of them translates to a different power during combat, {{such as the ability}} to [...] "solidify" [...] water fountains and turn them into climbable columns.

40|$|Most EU-scholars {{conceive}} of the EU as a multilevel polity with strong powers to regulate economic policy externalities among the member states but little power to intervene in, let alone assume, core functions of sovereign government ('core state powers') such as foreign and defense policy, public finance, public administration, {{and the maintenance of}} law and order. This book challenges this view. Based on a systematic comparison of integration processes in military security, fiscal policy, and public administration, it finds steady progress in the integration of <b>core</b> state <b>powers</b> although with substantial sectoral variation. But the EU is not heading towards state-building. In contrast to the historical experience of national federations, the European integration of <b>core</b> state <b>powers</b> proceeds mostly by regulating national capacities, not by creating European ones, and leads to territorial fragmentation rather than increased cohesiveness.

50|$|In nuclear engineering, {{the void}} {{coefficient}} (more properly called “void coefficient of reactivity”) {{is a number}} {{that can be used}} to estimate how much the reactivity of a nuclear reactor changes as voids (typically steam bubbles) form in the reactor moderator or coolant. Reactivity, in the nuclear engineering sense (not to be confused with chemical reactivity), measures the degree of change in neutron multiplication in a reactor core. Reactivity is directly related to the tendency of the reactor core to change power level: if reactivity is positive, the <b>core</b> <b>power</b> tends to increase; if it is negative, the <b>core</b> <b>power</b> tends to decrease; if it is zero, the <b>core</b> <b>power</b> tends to remain stable. The reactivity of the core may be adjusted by the reactor control system in order to obtain a desired power level change (or to keep the same power level). It can be compared to the reaction of an automobile as conditions around it change (for instance, wind intensity and direction or road slope), and therefore the corresponding counter-measure that the driver applies to maintain road speed or execute a desired manoeuvre.|$|E
