The tetrauret blocks had a folded conformation at room and relatively low temperatures. The polymers containing these moieties did not cross-link at room temperature and below.

This project, however, {{provides a}} class of thermoset ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) materials based on norbornene dicarboximide moieties containing acetal ester group linkage which is degradable when subjected to heat or acidic-catalysis. In this study, acetal ester linkages were introduced into di-functional monomer by a one-step neat reaction between a functionalised imidonorbornene containing a terminal carboxylic acid group and a 1, 4 -butanediol divinyl ether. Each monomer and product was characterised by 1 H and 13 C NMR analysis, while the obtained polymers were analysised by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), FTIR, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and oven. The results of TGA indicated that the <b>cross-linked</b> <b>materials</b> started losing weight at 150 ℃ {{and the extent of}} the weight loss at 300 ℃.

As was expected, the mobility of hydronium ions is enhanced with the strength of the electric field. Moreover, the electric field induces a significant rearrangement of the sulfonate groups, which is evidenced by the alignment of theC-S bonds along the direction of the field.

40|$|The IFNAR {{chain of}} the type I {{interferon}} (IFN) receptor (IFNIR) undergoes rapid ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and acts as a species-specific transducer for type I IFN action. Using the vaccinia/T 7 expression system to amplify IFNAR expression, we found that human HeLa-S 3 cells transiently express high levels of cell surface IFNAR chains (approximately 250, 000 chains per cell). Metabolic labeling and immunoblot analysis of transfected HeLa cells show that the IFNAR chain is initially detected as 65 -kDa and 98 -kDa precursors, and then as the 130 -kDa mature protein. Due to variation in N-glycosylation, the apparent molecular mass of the mature IFNAR chain varies from 105 to 135 kDa in different cells. IFNIR structure was characterized in various human cell lines by analyzing 125 I-labeled IFN cross-linked complexes recognized by various antibodies against IFNIR subunits and JAK protein-tyrosine kinases. Precipitation of <b>cross-linked</b> <b>material</b> from Daudi cells with anti-IFNAR antibodies showed that IFNAR was present in a 240 -kDa complex.
