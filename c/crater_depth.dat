40|$|The {{technique}} of photoclinometry is applied here to Viking orbiter images of Mars {{in order to}} derive topographic profiles across Martian craters on both softened and unsoftened terrain. The results demonstrate that craters on the two kinds of terrain are in fact topographically distinct. Both simple and complex softened craters are characterized by more convex-upward crater walls than are unsoftened craters, and both simple and complex softened craters have rounder crater rims. Softened complex craters have modestly smaller <b>crater</b> <b>depths</b> than unsoftened complex craters. Both the rim heights and bowl depths are reduced, with the rim heights reduced more.

5000|$|A {{study of}} the {{distribution}} of these craters demonstrated that the thickness of a frozen layer on Mars varies from about 1.3 km (equator) to 3.3 km (poles). This represents a great deal of frozen water. It would be equal to 200 meters of water spread over the entire planet, if one assumes the ground has 20% pore space. The researchers assumed that the single-layer ejecta craters would all be within the icy layer, but the double and multiple layer ejecta craters would always penetrate the icy layer. [...] By finding an average of the largest single-layer ejecta <b>crater</b> <b>depth</b> and the smallest multiple-layer ejecta <b>crater</b> <b>depth,</b> the thickness of the icy layer, called the cryosphere was determined.|$|E

40|$|A one-component {{one-dimensional}} (X- 1 D) {{hydrodynamic model}} has been developed to describe the expansion of laser-generated plumes in ion sources. The model incorporates the conservation formalism of hydrodynamics, normal and plasma absorption mechanisms of laser-target coupling and the local thermal equilibrium condition for ionization. The consid-erable difficulties (non-linearities, shock waves) in finding the solution were overcome by using the Godunov algorithm. A comprehensive study of the model covered three different laser types (ruby, CO, and frequency-quadrupled Nd-YAG) and three classes of solid targets (metals, transparent insulators and opaque insulators). Density, velocity and temperature profiles across the expanding plume were evaluated {{at the end of}} the laser pulse, to yield <b>crater</b> <b>depths,</b> cloud extensions, ion yields, relative sensitivity factors and ion kinetic energy distributions, i. e. quantities more closely related to experimental data.

There is a disproportionately tall central peak located near the crater midpoint.

50|$|For U-Th-Pb geochronology a beam {{of primary}} ions (O2)1− are {{accelerated}} and collimated towards the target where it sputters “secondary” ions from the sample. These secondary ions are accelerated along the instrument where the various isotopes of uranium, lead and thorium are measured successively, along with reference peaks for Zr2O+, ThO+ and UO+. Since the sputtering yield differs between ion species and relative sputtering yield increases or decreases with time depending on the ion species (due to increasing <b>crater</b> <b>depth,</b> charging effects and other factors), the measured relative isotopic abundances do not relate to the real relative isotopic abundances in the target. Corrections are determined by analysing unknowns and reference material (matrix-matched material of known isotopic composition), and determining an analytical-session specific calibration factor.|$|E
40|$|If {{apparent}} <b>crater</b> <b>depth</b> is {{a function}} of crater diameter, then the frequencies of <b>crater</b> <b>depth</b> and diameter should be similar and the distribution of apparent depths of craters on the lunar surface should be random. Apparent depths of complex craters, which range from 0. 2 to 4. 3 km on the moon, exhibit little correlation with crater diameters. Crater frequency decreases at increasing diameters, but apparent <b>crater</b> <b>depth</b> displays a Gaussian distribution. The average <b>crater</b> <b>depth</b> for all young craters is 1. 8 km. The mean depth of craters on the maria is 1. 3 km, and the mean depth of craters on the highlands is 2. 1 km. A contour map of apparent crater depths exhibits sufficient organization to suggest that the apparent <b>crater</b> <b>depth</b> is correlated to major lunar provinces. In general, regions of shallow craters are associated with basin interiors. Greater apparent depths are associated with highland terrains...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{morphological}} parameters (depth/diameter ratio, circularity index) of microcraters in the 0. 2 to 100 micron diameter range {{were obtained}} via SEM techniques for three lunar glass surfaces. The depth/diameter ratios are typically 0. 5 to 0. 8 {{with a range}} of 0. 3 to 1. 3. The circularity index varies from 0. 4 to 1. 0 with a pronounced maximum at 0. 7 to 0. 9. These parameters are compared with microcraters produced in the laboratory via electrostatic particle accelerators. The following conclusions are drawn: The great majority of observed <b>crater</b> <b>depths</b> are compatible with micrometeoroid densities of 2 to 4 g/cu cm; <b>crater</b> <b>depths</b> are incompatible for projectile densities less than 1 g/cu cm and greater than 7 g/cu cm. The circularity index of microcrater pits indicates rather equidimensional, if not spherical, projectiles. Needles, platelets and other highly irregular shapes can be excluded.

40|$|New Martian {{topographic}} {{data from}} Mariner 9 ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS) profiles provide depth data for 139 Martian craters of all degrees of degradation, between the diameters of 15 and 201 km. The population of Martian craters, including morphologically fresh examples, is shallower than both lunar and Mercurian fresh crater populations. Because the surface gravities of Mercury and Mars are identical within 5 %, {{these differences in}} fresh <b>crater</b> <b>depths</b> suggest that factors other than gravity may play important roles in determining initial <b>crater</b> <b>depths</b> (e. g., differences in impact velocity, substrate variations, and Martian atmospheric effects during the crater-forming event). Degraded Martian craters are, on the average, no shallower than lunar pre-Imbrian craters of similar sizes. If the early bombardment of Mars was as significant a degradational agent as {{it was on the}} moon, then major levels of crater degradation and crater shallowing on Mars were associated with this mechanism. Continued eolian infilling, although locally significant, may be a less significant cause of morphometric degradation of large old Martian craters...|$|R
40|$|General {{equations}} of ice dynamics are re-examined, using scale analysis, {{in order}} to derive a simplified thermomechanically coupled model for ice flow and heat transfer in ice caps filling volcanic craters. Relatively large aspect ratios between <b>crater</b> <b>depths</b> and diameters, low surface temperatures and intense volcanic heating are the principal characteristics of such craters. The conventional boundary-layer (shallow-ice) approximation is revised to account for these conditions and, in addition, the variable density of the snow, firn and bubbly ice. Large <b>crater</b> <b>depths</b> and intense bottom melting result in low longitudinal balance velocities, controlled by both shear and longitudinal stresses, and hence small surface slopes. In such situations ice can be assumed to be linearly viscous. A flowline model of the glacier dynamics is developed using this assumption. Explicit predictive formulas for ice-particle trajectories and age—depth relations, thus obtained, suggest that the age of ice {{at the bottom of}} glaciers in volcanic craters on Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia, may reach hundreds or thousands of years. Ice cores from these glaciers represent unique climatic and volcanic archives...|$|R

It is found that the formation of a hinge, about which the coherent ejecta flap rotates at the rim of the transient crater, divides material in the flow field into ejected and downward and outward-driven portions. Ejected material originates from an excavation cavity whose geometry is distinct from that of the transient <b>crater.</b> The shallow <b>depths</b> of excavation both observed in impact and explosion craters and predicted by the Z-model flow fields imply that thickness estimates of such lunar geologic units as the maria basalts, which are determined by assuming that excavation depths are similar to (1) final or (2) transient <b>crater</b> <b>depths,</b> must be reduced by factors of two to three respectively.
