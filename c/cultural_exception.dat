Second, if internal measures aimed at protecting cultural heritage can be challenged by foreign investors, is mixed arbitration a suitable forum to protect public interests Indeed, it seems that the regime established according to investment treaties does not strike an appropriate balance between the different interests concerned. After giving a brief look at the legal framework protecting foreign investments, the conflict areas between investment treaty provisions and national cultural policies are explored through an empirical analysis of the recent arbitral jurisprudence concerning cultural heritage.

Although economic globalization and international economic governance have spurred a more intense dialogue and interaction among nations—potentially promoting cultural diversity and providing {{the funds to}} recover and preserve cultural heritage—these phenomena can also jeopardize the cultural wealth of nations. Foreign direct investments have an unmatched penetrating force with the ultimate capacity of changing landscapes and erasing memory. At the same time, the increase in foreign direct investment has determined the creation of legally binding and highly effective regimes that demand States to promote and facilitate foreign direct investment. Has an international economic culture emerged that emphasizes productivity and {{economic development}} {{at the expense of}} cultural wealth? Does the existing legal framework adequately protect the cultural wealth of nations vis-à-vis economic globalization? This article surveys a selected sample of investment arbitrations, showing that while international investment law has not developed any institutional machinery for the protection of world heritage through investment dispute settlement (after all international investment law is not intended to protect cultural heritage), in recent years, a jurisprudential trend has emerged that takes cultural heritage into consideration. After defining the concept of cultural heritage disputes, this study analyzes and critically assesses these disputes and explores the use of <b>cultural</b> <b>exceptions</b> as a tool to prevent disputes in this field...|$|R

This paper finalizes a line of studies aimed at developing Emotion and Odor Scales (EOSs) in several cultures. Previously available for Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Singapore, new EOSs are presented here for the United States, Brazil, and China. These scales, developed with 350 - 540 participants per country, have been conceived to allow the measurement of affective feelings (e. g., emotions, moods, attitudes) {{in response to a}} wide range of odors including pleasant and unpleasant, food and non-food ones. Several affective categories were recurrent in the countries examined here: Disgust/Irritation, Happiness/Well-being, Sensuality/Desire, Energy, but also Soothing/Peacefulness and Hunger/Thirst, indicating a potential link between emotion and adaptive universal functions of olfaction such as danger avoidance, ingestion and social communication. For these common categories, similarity in affective responses generally reflected geographic proximity indicating also a strong influence of <b>cultural</b> aspects. <b>Exceptions</b> to this pattern were Singapore and China, with affective responses of Singaporeans being closer to those of Europeans. This series of studies allows us to propose a universal scale (UniGEOS) that might be used in the future for examination of other cultures. This scale comprises affective categories that we found to be culturally shared, enclosing the most frequently shared affective terms, and several culture-specific aspects that may be relevant in other cultures. This tool can be used in its complete form (25 affective terms) or as a short version with nine categories entitled Unpleasant feelings, Happiness/Delight, Sensuality/Desire, Energy, Soothing/ Peacefulness, Hunger/Thirst, Interest, Nostalgia and Spirituality...|$|R

40|$|The Spanish {{dictionary}} defines exception as {{the deviation}} from the rule or general condition {{of the other things}} of its same kind. Considering this definition we can recognize as an exception: Those ways of living that deviate from the regular ones, social relations that are accomplished and, even being of the same kind, show themselves as different. Those artistic, architectural or social movements that deviate from the prevailing ones, differing from them and being able to overthrow the established canons. Those management, cultural or educational projects that differ by their ability to achieve their aims under alternative routes or unusual models. Those artistic works within the own production line of a single author. Those project tools or strategies that are not usually recognized as such. Those conformed spaces, objects or cities, developed or established infrequently or far away from the normality. In HipoTesis we believe in the importance of the idea of exception. In 1962 Thomas Kuhn in his book “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” underlines the concept of paradigm. According to Kuhn, a paradigm is a way to build a scientific thought, never complete and always open to adding those theories to strengthen it over time. However, although the paradigms constitute the core of scientific positions and as well the architectural ones, events or arguments that can not be incorporated into those positions already exist, and they are still valid and recognized. It is about exceptions, called “paradigms anomalies” by Kuhn, which have the potential both to change and to create new revolutions. This issue of HipoTesis Numbered Issues aims at bringing together thoughts on those exceptions that have been decisive, important, significant. Not necessarily because they are able to break down the prevailing paradigms, but because they can become records, recognizable moments, designated, outlined, which at any time can make the leap and become rules to be established. For all that, we do a call to the exception understood in its broadest sense, as isolated cases, ways of working, intellectual positions, historical or <b>cultural</b> events. <b>Exception</b> not only as everything that deviates from the rule or the establishment and therefore becomes its debtor, but also as a new opening, a new look towards the future.

In addition, course activities surveys provided additional information about student perceptions of course activities. Participants in this study came from various countries as they prepared to attend a U. S. university in Hawaii. The distance learning program fostered language proficiency through various learning activities, with an emphasis on synchronous dialogue over video chat technologies. In addition to English-language proficiency, the program sought to help students learn to effectively communicate with students from other cultures. Cross-cultural proficiency was fostered through cross-cultural dialogue with tutors, teachers, and other students. Students showed improvement in speaking, listening, vocabulary, and grammar. However, on average, students did not show an improvement in reading proficiency. Students reported that dialogue with tutors and teachers was among the most helpful activities in learning English.

40|$|Since {{the first}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947, France {{has insisted that}} {{cultural}} products are different from other traded goods and should be exempted from ongoing liberalisation of international trade – a principle known as the ‘cultural exception’. This exclusion allows France to implement policies in favour of its cultural industries, particularly a highly complex system of quotas and subsidies for the film industry which it maintains is essential to counter US market dominance and maintain cultural diversity. Over the past decade, the launch of video-on-demand services has revolutionised how films are delivered and consumed. Policy-makers have attempted {{to keep pace with}} these developments, expanding the scope of French support schemes accordingly. Adopting a mixed methods approach, this thesis analyses cultural diversity in the French film industry in detail, incorporating for the first time both the cinema and video-on-demand sectors and combining qualitative and quantitative data to understand the impact of French policies on diversity. Quantitative analysis reveals strong evidence of diversity in both sectors but that, while digital channels offer greater variety of choice, cinema is more balanced between films of different geographic origins. Employing a consistent approach to policy development in both channels, policy-makers have failed to take into account these and other differences, or to target measures at the emerging threats to diversity in the digital environment – potentially undermining the French defence of the <b>cultural</b> <b>exception</b> on diversity grounds. There is a surprisingly superficial use of the term cultural diversity in trade circles, leading to the conclusion that a more sophisticated approach is needed. Refining French policy in line with empirical data and actively using that evidence to demonstrate policy success will be a necessary part of this more sophisticated approach if France is to successfully defend the <b>cultural</b> <b>exception</b> in future trade negotiations...|$|E
