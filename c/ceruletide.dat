Jejunal pressures were recorded by three perfused catheters with orifices between 10 and 20 cm aboral of the ligament of Treitz. <b>Ceruletide</b> dose dependently diminished phase I and increased phase II type activity {{and tended to}} reduce the number, but not the duration, of activity fronts.

In 50 % of the rats, mesenteric fat necrosis was present, free peritoneal fluid containing massive elevations of trypsinogen and amylase were noted in most animals. Intravenous secretion at a low dose given simultaneously with <b>ceruletide</b> exerted a variable protective effect on the pathological process. A high dose of secretin produced a striking macroscopic, microscopic, and biochemical protective effect on ceruletide-induced pancreatitis. High resolution light microscopy and electron microscopy showed a marked cellular disorganization in the acini of animals treated with <b>ceruletide</b> alone.

40|$|Sixty two {{patients}} with a clinical suspicion of biliary dyskinesia were investigated with endoscopic manometry of the sphincter of Oddi before and after intravenous injection of cholecystokinin or <b>ceruletide.</b> In 52 patients injection was followed by decreased pressure in the sphincter of Oddi; 43 of these had normal prestimulatory values (group I), while the values were raised in the other nine patients (group II). A paradoxical response to intravenous injection was observed in 10 women (group III) : increased baseline sphincteric pressure occurred in eight and increase in the amplitude of phasic contractions in four patients. The prestimulatory sphincteric pressure was raised in five and normal in the remaining patients. Eight patients were treated with papillotomy (seven) or balloon dilatation of the sphincter (one). They experienced relief of pain during a follow up period of 11 - 16 months. Intravenous injection of cholecystokinin or <b>ceruletide</b> may disclose a special type of biliary dyskinesia even in patients with normal prestimulatory manometric findings.

40|$|Although {{sphincter}} of Oddi dysfunction is a recognised {{cause of}} post cholecystectomy pain, the control mechanisms involved in sphincter of Oddi function are poorly understood. Pharmacological relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi {{may have a}} beneficial effect particularly in sphincter of Oddi dysfunction where basal sphincter pressure is high. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of calcium channel blockade (nicardipine) and synthetic cholecystokinin (<b>ceruletide)</b> on sphincter of Oddi pressures. Nineteen patients (median age 49 years; range 21 - 75) attending for routine endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic (ERCP) examination were studied. No patients with evidence of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction were included in the study. Each patient was randomly allocated to receive a three minute intravenous infusion of nicardipine 3 mg (six) <b>ceruletide</b> 5 ng/kg (seven) or placebo (six). Endoscopic biliary manometry was done with recording of basal sphincter of Oddi pressures, sphincter of Oddi phasic wave amplitude and frequency before and after intravenous infusions. In the nicardipine group patients showed a decrease in both basal and phasic amplitude sphincter of Oddi pressure (mm Hg) from the preinfusion values (mean (SEM)) of 24. 7 (3. 6) and 112. 3 (13. 4) to 12. 9 (2. 9) (p less than 0. 01) and 89. 9 (12. 4) (p less than 0. 03) after infusion respectively. <b>Ceruletide</b> produced a decrease in sphincter of Oddi phasic wave frequency (c/min) from 3. 4 (0. 3) before infusion to 2. 6 (0. 5) after infusion (p less than 0. 05). We conclude that nicardipine effectively decreases sphincter of Oddi pressure.

CR 1409 was further used to examine whether nerve-mediated motor responses to electrical field stimulation or distension of the gut wall may involve the release of CCK-like peptides. CR 1409 (0. 06 - 2. 1 microM) antagonized longitudinal muscle responses to <b>ceruletide</b> (caerulein, a CCK-related decapeptide) in a concentration dependent and competitive manner (pA 2 7. 77); responses to CCK-octapeptide (CCK- 8) were antagonized with a similar potency. Contractions of the circular muscle evoked by <b>ceruletide</b> were also blocked by CR 1409 (0. 2 - 0. 4 microM). Longitudinal muscle contractions in response to dimethylphenylpiperazinium, bethanechol, histamine, substance P, or 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT), and circular muscle contractions evoked by acetylcholine, 5 -HT, substance P, or substance K were not altered by CR 1409 (0. 4 microM). Longitudinal muscle contractions induced by electrical field stimulation (with pulses delivered at 0. 05 and 1 Hz in the absence, and at 5 Hz {{in the presence of}} atropine) were not or only slightly reduced by CR 1409 (0. 4 microM). Longitudinal contractions due to activation of extrinsic nerves by capsaicin remained unaltered in the presence of CR 1409 (0. 4 microM).

40|$|BackgroundâChronic {{diarrhoea}} is {{the clinical}} hallmark of patients presenting with idiopathic bile acid malabsorption. Its pathogenesis is unknown; colonic water secretion can be induced by dihydroxy bile acids, {{but it is}} not known whether enrichment of the bile acid pool with these bile acids occurs in such patients. Furthermore, bile acid malabsorption is known to affect biliary lipid composition, but no information is available for the idiopathic type. â¨AimsâTo verify: (a) whether diarrhoea in patients with idiopathic bile acid malabsorption is associated with enrichment of the bile acid pool with dihydroxy bile acids; and (b) whether supersaturation with cholesterol of duodenal bile occurs in such patients as a result of chronic bile acid depletion. â¨PatientsâThirteen patients with idiopathic bile acid malabsorption diagnosed according to abnormal 75 SeHCAT test and absence of other organic diseases, and 23 control subjects. â¨MethodsâBile rich duodenal fluid was collected during intravenous <b>ceruletide</b> infusion in the fasting state. Biliary lipids were analysed by enzymatic assays and bile acids by high performance liquid chromatography. â¨ResultsâPatients with idiopathic bile acid malabsorption had a cholesterol saturation index similar to controls. Bile acid composition showed only a decrease in percentage cholic acid (29 (2) % versus 36 (2) %; p< 0. 05); the dihydroxy:trihydroxy bile acid ratio was similar to controls. â¨ConclusionsâPatients with idiopathic bile acid malabsorption do not have an increased risk of forming cholesterol gallstones. The mechanism of diarrhoea does not seem to depend on an enrichment of the bile acid pool with dihydroxy bile acids. ...|$|E
40|$|Background. Artificial {{nutrition}} {{is frequently}} associated with hepatobiliary complications, {{probably due to}} the inherent derangement of the gastrointestinal tract physiology. Alterations of hepatic lipid metabolism are likely to be involved. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of artificial nutrition on bile acid production, a key event in cholesterol homeostasis, in humans. Patients and Methods. Eleven patients receiving artificial nutrition, either parenteral nutrition (PN; n = 6) or enteral nutrition (EN; n = 5) with no previous history of liver disease, underwent analysis of cholesterol 7 Î±-hydroxylation rates in vivo, a measure of bile acid formation, by isotope release analysis after intravenous injection of [7 Î±-(3) H]cholesterol. The results were compared with those obtained in a population of 16 age-matched control subjects. Results. Hydroxylation rates were lower in patients with artificial nutrition (PN: 94 Â± 13 mg/d; EN: 230 Â± 39 mg/d, mean Â± SEM) when compared with controls (385 Â± 47 mg/d) (P <. 01, 1 -way analysis of variance). In a patient receiving EN, hydroxylation rates increased 3. 5 -fold after treatment with the cholecystokinin analogue <b>ceruletide</b> (20 Âµg bid for 2 weeks intramuscularly). Serum lathosterol-to-cholesterol ratio, a marker of cholesterol synthesis, was also significantly reduced in artificial nutrition, whereas serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF 19) were increased. Conclusion. In vivo 7 Î±-hydroxylation is suppressed in artificial nutrition, particularly in PN. The finding associates with reduced cholesterol production, possibly as a metabolic consequence. The data suggest a regulatory role of gastrointestinal hormones and FGF 19 on bile acid production and might suggest a pathophysiological basis for some common complications of artificial nutrition, such as gallstone disease and cholestasis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUNDâLittle {{information}} {{is available on the}} pathogenesis of cholesterol microlithiasis, and it is not clear if biliary lipid composition in these patients is similar to changes seen in cholesterol gall stone patients. â¨AIMSâTo measure biliary lipid composition in patients with cholesterol microlithiasis. â¨PATIENTSâEleven patients with cholesterol microlithiasis, 20 Â cholesterol gall stone patients, and 17 Â healthy controls. â¨METHODSâDuodenal bile was collected in the fasting state during <b>ceruletide</b> infusion. Biliary cholesterol, phospholipids, and total bile acids were analysed by enzymatic assays, and conjugated bile acids by high pressure liquid chromatography. â¨RESULTSâPatients with microlithiasis had a cholesterol saturation index significantly higher than controls (mean value 1. 30 Â (95 % confidence interval 1. 05 - 1. 54) v 0. 90 Â (0. 72 - 1. 08)) but similar to gall stone patients (1. 51 Â (1. 40 - 1. 63)). This was due to a significant decrease in per cent phospholipid (10. 0 % (7. 1 - 12. 8)) compared with controls (21. 4 % (18. 1 - 24. 6)) and gall stone patients (24. 9 % (20. 5 - 29. 3)). Per cent cholesterol was similar in patients with microlithiasis and controls (5. 3 % (4. 5 - 6. 1) and 5. 6 Â %Â (4. 3 - 6. 8), respectively) but was significantly increased in gall stone patients (10. 9 % (9. 3 - 12. 4)). Bile acid composition in patients with microlithiasis was similar to controls whereas in gall stone patients deoxycholic acid was significantly increased: 27. 3 % (24. 8 - 29. 7) v 19. 0 % (15. 7 - 22. 2) in controls and 20. 6 % (14. 9 - 26. 2) in patients with microlithiasis. â¨CONCLUSIONâPatients with cholesterol microlithiasis have biliary cholesterol supersaturation, similarly to cholesterol gall stone patients. Whereas in the latter this is due to increased per cent cholesterol, in patients with microlithiasis this is caused by phospholipid deficiency, with normal per cent cholesterol and normal biliary bile acid composition. â¨â¨â¨Keywords: cholesterol microlithiasis; biliary sludge; biliary lipid composition; bile acids; phospholipid; deoxycholic aci...|$|E
40|$|This {{systematic}} review aimed to collate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of various interventions {{used to treat}} tardive dyskinesia (TD) and, where appropriate, to combine the data for mete-analysis, Clinical trials were identified by electronic searches, handsearches and contact with principal investigators. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, for outcomes related to improvement, deterioration, side-effects and drop out rates. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenzel Odds Ratio (fixed effect model). For treatments that had significant effects, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. From 296 controlled clinical trials, data were extracted from 47 trials. For most interventions, we could identify no RCT-derived evidence of efficacy. A meta-analysis showed that baclofen, deanol and diazepam were no more effective than a placebo. Single RCTs demonstrated a lack of evidence of any effect for bromocriptine, <b>ceruletide,</b> clonidine, estrogen, gamma linolenic acid, hydergine, lecithin, lithium, progabide, seligiline and tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol. The meta-analysis found that five interventions were effective: L-dopa, oxypertine, sodium valproate, tiapride and vitamin E; neuroleptic reduction was marginally significant. Data from single RCTs revealed that insulin, alpha methyl dopa and reserpine were more effective than a placebo. There was a significantly increased risk of adverse events associated with baclofen, deanol, L-dopa, oxypertine and reserpine. Metaanalysis {{of the impact of}} placebo (n= 485) showed that 37. 3 % of participants showed an improvement. Interpretation of this {{systematic review}} requires caution as the individual trials identified tended to have small sample sizes. For many compounds, data from only one trial were available, and where meta-analyses were possible, these were based on a small number of trials. Despite these concerns, the review facilitated the interpretation of the large and diverse range of treatments used for TD. Clinical recommendations for the treatment of TD are made, based on the availability of RCT-derived evidence, the strength of that evidence and the presence of adverse effects.
