40|$|The {{anatomical}} {{location of}} imaging features is of crucial importance for accurate diagnosis in many medical tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have had huge successes in computer vision, but {{they lack the}} natural ability to incorporate the anatomical location in their decision making process, hindering success in some medical image analysis tasks. In this paper, to integrate the anatomical location information into the network, we propose several deep <b>CNN</b> architectures <b>that</b> consider multi-scale patches or take explicit location features while training. We apply and compare the proposed architectures for segmentation of white matter hyperintensities in brain MR images on a large dataset. As a result, we observe <b>that</b> the <b>CNNs</b> <b>that</b> incorporate location information substantially outperform a conventional segmentation method with hand-crafted features as well as <b>CNNs</b> <b>that</b> do not integrate location information. On a test set of 46 scans, the best configuration of our networks obtained a Dice score of 0. 791, compared to 0. 797 for an independent human observer. Performance levels of the machine and the independent human observer were not statistically significantly different (p-value= 0. 17). Comment: 13 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

By July 2015 ISIL had studied Snowden's disclosures and, said U.S. officials, its leaders were using couriers or encrypted communications that Western analysts could not crack.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{the parents}} of a 6-year-old boy in Miami sued the police {{department}} for firing a Taser at their child. The police said the boy was threatening to injure his own leg with a shard of glass, and said that using the device was the safest option to prevent the boy from injuring himself. Nevertheless, the boy's mother told <b>CNN</b> <b>that</b> the three officers involved probably found it easier to reason with her child. Also in 2004, a 12-year-old girl skipping school and drinking alcohol was Tasered in Miami-Dade while she was running from police and started to run into traffic. The Taser was successfully deployed to stop her from being hit by cars or causing an automobile accident. In March 2008, an 11-year-old girl was subdued with a Taser.

500|$|Disney did {{not return}} reporters' calls or emails for comment, nor took any legal action during the festival, {{although}} it confirmed to <b>CNN</b> <b>that</b> it was [...] "aware" [...] of the movie. Despite critical apprehension that the film would never be shown outside the festival, some observers saw the situation as more complex. Were Disney to attempt to forcefully suppress the film, that effort could serve to draw even more attention to it, a phenomenon known as the Streisand effect. Even if Disney were to successfully prevent official distribution, the film could easily be pirated and distributed over the Internet. In his Post review, Smith suggested that Disney prevent this by taking the opposite course, simply ignoring Escape from Tomorrow and letting the attention dissipate by itself.|$|E

Sandra Menendez, a student who claimed to have been interviewed by Erdely but who was not directly quoted in the article, told <b>CNN</b> <b>that</b> she and others became uncomfortable after speaking with Erdely, concluding she had [...] "an agenda".|$|E

500|$|On November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party {{executive}} council voted 13â€“3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot. [...] "The {{general sense of}} the council was that he wasn't a serious candidate {{and that was why}} he wasn't selected to be on the ballot", stated John Werner, the party's director. In addition, he was declared [...] "not viable", as he was running in only one state. Several days later he announced that he was dropping out of the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle. CNN has reported that Obama supporters pressured the South Carolina Democratic Executive Council to keep Colbert off the ballot.

500|$|Clark {{has said}} that he began to truly define his {{politics}} only after his military retirement and the 2000 presidential election, won by George W. Bush. Clark had a conversation with Condoleezza Rice in which she told him that the war in Kosovo would not have occurred under Bush. Clark found such an admission unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the interventionist policies of the Clinton administration. He said he would see it as a sign that things were [...] "starting to go wrong" [...] with American foreign policy under Bush. Clark supported the administration's War in Afghanistan in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks but did not support the Iraq War. Clark continued to warn people as a commentator on <b>CNN</b> <b>that</b> he believed the United States was undermanned in Iraq. He said the war was [...] "never ... WMD or regime change" [...] and believes [...] "the connection to the War on Terrorism was not shown." ...|$|E
