40|$|The {{relationship}} between the <b>conducting</b> <b>behavior</b> {{and the degree of}} charge fluctuation in the β″-type BEDT-TTF salts is reviewed from the standpoints of vibrational spectroscopy and crystal structure. A group of β″-type ET salts demonstrates the best model compounds for achieving the above relationship because the two-dimensional structure is simple and great diversity in <b>conducting</b> <b>behavior</b> is realized under ambient pressure. After describing the requirement for the model compound, the methodology for analyzing the results of the vibrational spectra is presented. Vibrational spectroscopy provides the time-averaged molecular charge, the charge distribution in the two-dimensional layer, and the inter-molecular interactions, etc. The experimental results applied to 2 / 3 -filled and 3 / 4 -filled β″-type ET salts are reported. These experimental results suggest that the conducting property, the difference in the time-averaged molecular charges between the ionic and neutral-like sites, the alternation in the inter-molecular distances and the energy levels in the charge distributions are relevant to one another.

Materials and Methods: A review of the current literature from clinical trials that investigated the efficacy of risperidone and paliperidone on CD considering the inclusion criteria and search strategies was performed by a search of PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Results: Out of 53 titles, 31 were irrelevant. The abstract of 22 potentially related articles were studied. Only six articles reported the results of clinical trial. However, one of them reported the effect of risperidone on <b>conduct</b> <b>behaviors</b> in autistic disorders.

40|$|BackgroundHealth-compromising {{behaviors}} in adolescents and adults co-occur. Because motor vehicle crashes {{are the leading}} cause of death and disability for these age groups, understanding the association between risky driving and other health compromising behaviors is critical. MethodsWe performed a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of an intervention for participants who screened positive for risky driving and problem drinking. Using baseline data, we examined relationships among <b>conduct</b> <b>behavior</b> problems before and after age 15, depressive symptoms, sleep, problem drinking, and risky driving (hostile, reckless and drinking and driving) in late adolescents ages 1822 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 24 (n= 110) and adults ages 2522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 44 (n= 202). We developed a measurement model for the entire sample using confirmatory factor analysis, which was then specified as a multi-group structural equation model. ResultsLate adolescents and adults had some similar associations for pathways through problem drinking to drinking and driving; depression to reckless driving; and <b>conduct</b> <b>behavior</b> problems after 15 to hostile driving. Late adolescents, however, had more complex relationships: depressive symptoms and <b>conduct</b> <b>behavior</b> problems before 15 were associated with more risky driving behaviors through multiple pathways and males reported more risky driving. ConclusionsRisky driving is associated with other health-compromising behaviors and mental health factors. It is a multidimensional phenomenon more pronounced in late adolescence than adulthood. In order to promote safe driving, the findings support the need to consider behaviors that are a health threat in the late adolescent population during driving training and licensure.

40|$|The {{literature}} suggests that children who abuse animals {{may be at risk}} towards becoming violent into adulthood. In addition, research suggests certain family risk factors may be associated with childhood animal cruelty. However, because childhood animal cruelty is a symptom of Conduct Disorder (CD), it is unclear whether family risk factors serve as specific antecedents of cruelty to animals (CTA) versus more general antecedents of <b>conduct</b> <b>behavior</b> problems. In the current study, two groups of early to late adolescent boys (CTA and N-CTA) were compared on histories of physical child abuse, sexual child abuse, paternal alcoholism, paternal unavailability, and domestic violence. The {{literature suggests}} that these family risk factors may be significant in development of CT A. The adolescents in Group 1 were boys who had conduct problems with documented histories of animal cruelty (n = 50;CTA). Group 2 consisted of adolescent boys (n = 50; N-CTA) with conduct problems without documented histories of animal cruelty. Results found that children in the CTA group had significantly greater histories of physical and/or sexual child abuse anddomestic violence in comparison to children in the N-CTA group. These results suggest that physical and/or sexual abuse to a child, and exposure to domestic violence, may be significant in development of childhood animal cruelty. Assessment and intervention of childhood animal cruelty should address the problem behavior as well as the abusive experiences it may signify to prevent more serious and persistent behavior problems into adulthood...|$|E

30|$|As Passini {{identified}} in his research, {{a considerable number}} of decisions are made during {{a short period of time}} in wayfinding. However, selecting the right environmental information (cues) is very confusing in complex buildings (Dogu 2000). Research shows many people become lost in hospitals because their mental map conflicts with actual on-site information and they are overloaded with information about irrelevant elements (Estates 2005). Augmented Reality (AR) supports information accessing by adding digital information to the real world scene by enabling a hybrid representation on a single display (Azuma 1997). Thus, AR will significantly assist people to identify decision execution cues with a simple pop out advice on the screen, thereby massively reducing the workload of identifying specific places where they should <b>conduct</b> <b>behavior</b> actions. In Lawton’s theory (Lawton 1996), there are two main strategies for wayfinding in indoor environments—orientation strategy and route strategy. Orientation strategy mainly relies on specific references in the surroundings to identify the location. Route strategy is focused on following a specific route in users’ cognitive processes. Route strategy helps people form a cognitive route to follow, right through from their starting place to their destination. However, in cases where people deviate from a specific route, orientation strategy will help establish their position by relying on local cues (Lawton 1996). AR will provide clear and legible environmental information, and facilitate the cognitive process of route strategy by overlaying the routing information in the real world. Thus, users can easily identify the locations where they should conduct wayfinding behaviors in order to follow routing information to reach their destination.|$|E

Polyethylene films were made of polyethylene powder at refined purity, and photoelectric dyes were coupled to the film surface at higher density compared with the prototype. Either dye-coupled film or dye-uncoupled plain film used as a control was implanted subretinally from a scleral incision in both eyes of an RCS rat at 6 weeks of the age. Behavior tests 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after implantation were conducted by observing head turning or body turning in the direction consistent with clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of a black-and-white-striped drum around a transparent cage housed with the rat. After the behavior tests at 8 weeks, rats' eyes were enucleated to confirm subretinal implantation of the films and processed for immunohistochemistry. In the behavior tests, the number of head turnings consistent with the direction of the drum rotation was significantly larger in RCS rats with dye-coupled- compared with plain-film implantation [P < 0. 05, repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), n = 7]. The number of apoptotic neurons was significantly smaller in eyes with dye-coupled- compared with plain-film implantation (P < 0. 05, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 6).
