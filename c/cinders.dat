5|$|The Portland Basin {{is being}} pulled slowly apart between faults in the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills) {{on the west}} side of Portland, the East Bank fault along the east side of the Willamette River, and other fault systems near Gresham further east. About 3million years ago, many small volcanoes and cinder cones erupted through the thin, {{stretched}} crust of the basin and in the Cascade foothills to the southeast. Ash, <b>cinders,</b> and debris from these Boring Lava Field volcanoes added another layer of sediment to the Troutdale formation.|$|E
5|$|The steep-sided, {{symmetrical}} stratovolcanoes in {{the region}} were built by repeated eruptions of thick, slow-moving lava that have commonly flowed only a few kilometres from the vent. Explosive eruptions are often associated with these volcanoes, depositing alternating layers of volcanic ash, <b>cinders,</b> blocks, and globes of molten rock called volcanic bombs or lava bombs, which are added to its slopes to create the stratovolcano. Edziza's stratovolcanoes contain a fine-grained silica-rich volcanic rock called trachyte; they have not erupted for thousands of years, allowing erosion to destroy the original cone, creating craggy ridges and rock outcrops of more resistant materials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cinder</b> Cone is a <b>cinder</b> cone {{with a small}} crater on {{the west}} side of the Helm Glacier in Garibaldi Provincial Park in British Columbia, Canada. <b>Cinder</b> Cone is {{surrounded}} by <b>cinder</b> flats and its crater is filled with melt water during the summer. <b>Cinder</b> Cone is eroded easily by melt water during the spring, washing the pyroclastics into the Valley of Desolation. <b>Cinder</b> Cone produced a 9 km long lava flow during the early Holocene.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cinder</b> {{proceeds}} to find Levana, who has Thorne in the throne room. Levana tells <b>Cinder</b> {{that her mother}} set Levana on fire {{as a child and}} made her this way. She then demands <b>Cinder</b> relinquish all claims to the throne or Thorne takes a dive. When Thorne calls her bluff, Levana has him jump, with <b>Cinder</b> catching him at the last moment. They wrestle and Thorne is about to shoot <b>Cinder</b> when Cress comes and shoots it out of his hand. Still being controlled by Levana, Thorne stabs Cress. As <b>Cinder</b> is distracted with trying to kill Levana, Throne stabs <b>Cinder.</b> Scarlet and Wolf show up, Scarlet gets controlled by Levana and <b>Cinder</b> is forced to knock her out. Wolf rushes to her aid and as the only one not able to be controlled, helps Scarlet and Cress. Levana and <b>Cinder</b> battle it out, both turning their own guns on themselves. Levana feigns penance, then stabs <b>Cinder,</b> who in turn shoots her. Levana dies, while <b>Cinder</b> survives due to being a cyborg.|$|R
40|$|Over {{one hundred}} <b>cinder</b> cones reside within the Potrillo {{volcanic}} field in southern New Mexico. 3 He surface exposure dating and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating reveal {{the age of}} the volcanic field to be from 1 Ma to 20 ka years old. 3 He surface exposure dating of lava flows associated with <b>cinder</b> cones and current morphologic dating methods show a relationship between <b>cinder</b> cone slope degradation and relative age. Previous studies investigating the morphology of Quaternary basaltic <b>cinder</b> cones in Hawaii, Nevada and Mexico concluded that the degradation of <b>cinder</b> cone slope angle over time is a reliable age indicator. A morphometric method using digital topographic maps (DRGs) and digital elevation models (DEMs) was used to calculate <b>cinder</b> cone slope angles. Exponential trend analysis of radiometric dates from specific lava flows were used to correlate relative ages with <b>cinder</b> cone slope angles. The spatial distribution of <b>cinder</b> cone slope angles within the Potrillo volcanic field categorized the <b>cinder</b> cones into three age groups. The oldest group of <b>cinder</b> cones had measured slope angles ranging from 4 ° to 9 °. The second and intermediate group of <b>cinder</b> cone slope angles ranged from 10 ° to 16 °. The youngest group measured slope angles ranging from 17 ° to 21 °. Analysis of <b>cinder</b> cone slope distribution in the Potrillo volcanic field suggests that volcanism occurred at different time intervals. In addition, trendline analysis provides a powerful and useful tool for predicting <b>cinder</b> cone ages in the Potrillo volcanic field. ...|$|R
5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed <b>cinders,</b> which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
5|$|The term {{track and}} field is {{intertwined}} with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a {{track and field}} stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track—the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was {{a third of a}} mile (536.45m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened <b>cinders</b> were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.|$|E

5000|$|The {{story is}} set in a futuristic city, New Beijing, when the {{countries}} of the world have re-organized to form various new empires and alliances and the moon has been colonized. Asia is now an emperor ruled country known as the Eastern Commonwealth. Letumosis, a disease started by the Lunars and had been nicknamed the [...] "Blue Fever," [...] is raging throughout the world and the cure is unknown. The protagonist, Linh <b>Cinder,</b> is a cyborg who operates a mechanic stall at a local street market in New Beijing and lives under the guardianship of her stepmother, Linh Adri. Early in the story, she meets Prince Kai, who asks her to fix a personal android. Cyborgs are treated as second class citizens, so <b>Cinder</b> hides her identity from Kai. Soon, one of <b>Cinder’s</b> stepsisters, Linh Peony, falls sick with letumosis after accompanying <b>Cinder</b> to a junkyard to collect spare parts for a repair. In anger, <b>Cinder’s</b> stepmother [...] "volunteers" [...] <b>Cinder</b> for plague research. When <b>Cinder</b> is injected with the strain of letumosis, it is discovered that she is immune to the disease. Dr. Erland, the head researcher, starts to do research on <b>Cinder’s</b> immunity, which leads to research on <b>Cinder’s</b> unique physiology, her cyborg implants, and eventually to <b>Cinder’s</b> life prior to becoming a cyborg at the age of eleven, which <b>Cinder</b> has no memory of.|$|R

25|$|Stratovolcanoes or {{composite}} volcanoes are tall conical mountains {{composed of}} lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers, the strata that {{gives rise to}} the name. Stratovolcanoes are also known as composite volcanoes because they are created from multiple structures during different kinds of eruptions. Strato/composite volcanoes are made of <b>cinders,</b> ash, and lava. <b>Cinders</b> and ash pile on top of each other, lava flows on top of the ash, where it cools and hardens, and then the process repeats.
