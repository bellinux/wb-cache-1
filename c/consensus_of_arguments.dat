This essay therefore explores how the relationship between contemporary jewellery and the human body it adorns has developed in the exhibition setting from the 1980 s onwards. It considers {{the extent to which}} jewellery artists have challenged and transformed traditional modes of display; and how, in many cases, this has expanded the language of jewellery. This will entail charting the move beyond display cabinets to less predictable means of presentation; some of which have reinvigorated notions of functionality or included performative adornment by models and actors. Central to this analysis will be the approaches of leading jewellery artists such as Ruudt Peters, Christoph Zellweger and Ted Noten, for whom the aesthetics and means of theatrical installation can be as important as the work itself. Alongside other practitioners who have directly replicated the act of wearing in the display setting, and those pieces of jewellery produced with the aid of audience participation. Pivotal works that appear to challenge the conventions of display will be contextualised. For example, Ted Noten’s dispersal of 300 limited edition brooches to the taxi drivers of Middlesbrough, so they could act as ambassadors for Middlesbrough’s Institute of Modern Art’s jewellery collection in 2011. The associated preview event included a drive through at the museum, whereupon the taxi drivers collected their individual brooches. Each consisting of a winged form that stands on the driver’s dashboard to augur safe and speedy transport; and moreover to help “drivers engage passengers in conversation and debate”. Another happening beyond the confines of four white gallery walls was Be Nice To A Girl, Buy Her A Ring, 2009, by Noten. It consisted of a vending machine in a shop window, where viewers could buy a ring for their sweetheart on impulse, whilst out and about in the streets of Amsterdam. Within this framework the opportunity to try on, touch and wear jewellery on display will be investigated, as will schemes that have involved temporarily loaning out contemporary jewellery. An example of the former is Touching Warms the Art, 2008, an exhibition of jewellery at the Museum of Contemporary Craft, Portland, Oregon, where exhibitors were invited to participate on condition their works could be held, touched and worn during the show; thereafter, all donated works entered the teaching collection. An analysis of general institutional responses to the demands of contemporary jewellery to leave the vitrine will follow, in addition to the willingness of commercial galleries to aid these developments, such as the inventive Galerie Marzee, in Nijmegen, Netherlands. First source information will be garnered through interviews with jewellers and curators alike and used to underpin the <b>consensus</b> <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> that emerge, or otherwise. Finally, the invention of new technologies in the production and dispersal of jewellery activity, including rapid prototyping and the internet, will draw the essay to a close, along with a prognosis for future developments in the display of contemporary jewellery...|$|E

40|$|State-of-the art mappers {{articulate}} several techniques using diﬀerent {{sources of}} knowledge in an uniﬁed process. An important issue of ontology mapping is to ﬁnd ways of choosing among many techniques and their variations, and then combining their results. For this, an innovative and promising option is to use frameworks dealing with arguments for or against correspondences. In this paper, we re-use an argumentation framework that considers the conﬁdence levels <b>of</b> mapping <b>arguments.</b> We also propose new frameworks that use voting {{as a way to}} cope with various degrees <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> among <b>arguments.</b> We compare these frameworks by evaluating their application to a range of individual mappers, {{in the context of a}} real-world library case...|$|R
40|$|Experts do play a {{particular}} role in public socio-scientific debates, {{even more so}} if they form heterogeneous coalition with other actors and experts. A case study about a public science education controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution/creationism in the UK press is used to investigate in detail how connections and coalitions between experts and other actors involved in the controversy emerged and played out. The research focuses {{on the question of}} what role collaborative and other networks of experts played in terms of influence, visibility, credibility, <b>consensus</b> and weight <b>of</b> <b>argument.</b> Issues that are considered in the research are the status {{of the members of the}} coalitions forming during the debate and how it is displayed in media representations and letters and petitions, and also how these networks and coalitions of experts perform in relation to each other...|$|R
5000|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts, Abraham in History and Abraham in Tradition. In Part I, Van Seters argues that there is no {{unambiguous}} evidence pointing to an origin for the stories in the 2nd millennium BC. [...] "Arguments based on reconstructing the patriarch's nomadic way of life, the personal names in Genesis, the social customs reflected in the stories, and correlation of the traditions of Genesis with the archaeological data of the Middle Bronze Age have all been found, in Part One above, to be quite defective in demonstrating an origin for the Abraham tradition in the second millennium B.C.". This finding has implications for certain then-current strands in Biblical criticism: [...] "Consequently, without any such effective historical controls on the tradition one cannot use any part of it in an attempt to reconstruct the primitive period of Israelite history. Furthermore, a vague presupposition about the antiquity of the tradition based upon a <b>consensus</b> approval <b>of</b> such <b>arguments</b> should no longer be used as a warrant for proposing a history of the tradition related to early premonarchic times." ...|$|R

5000|$|Traditionally the Delphi {{method has}} {{aimed at a}} <b>consensus</b> <b>of</b> the most {{probable}} future by iteration. Other versions, such as the Policy Delphi, [...] is instead a decision support method aiming at structuring and discussing the diverse views of the preferred future. In Europe, more recent web-based experiments have used the Delphi method as a communication technique for interactive decision-making and e-democracy.The Argument Delphi, was developed by Osmo Kuusi, focuses on ongoing discussion and finding relevant arguments {{rather than focusing on}} the output. The Disaggregative Policy Delphi, developed by Petri Tapio, uses cluster analysis as a systematic tool to construct various scenarios of the future in the latest Delphi round. The respondent's view on the probable and the preferable future are dealt with as separate cases. The computerization <b>of</b> <b>Argument</b> Delphi is relatively difficult because of several problems like argument resolution, argument aggregation and argument evaluation. The computerization <b>of</b> <b>Argument</b> Delphi, was developed by Sadi Evren Seker, proposes solutions to such problems.|$|R

40|$|John Locke famously {{argued that}} the governed are {{unlikely}} to consent {{to a form of}} political power that unduly exposes them to harm. Nowadays, non-arbitrary political power is often understood as requiring governing institutions to strike a difficult balance between capacity and constraint. Whilst being constrained enough {{not to be able to}} get away with the arbitrary treatment of individuals, polities need to be capable enough to protect individuals against non-political sources of arbitrariness. An influential school of thought within the EU literature assumes that the Union is most likely to produce 'restrained yet capable' forms of political power where it is indirectly legitimated by a <b>consensus</b> <b>of</b> Member States. That school of thought basically adopts assumptions of Coasian bargaining theory as introduced to political science by Buchanan and Tullock (1962). Extending a line <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> begun by Fritz Scharpf, this paper shows, however, that, where Coasian bargaining theory breaks down, a <b>consensus</b> <b>of</b> Member States is most unlikely to guarantee non-arbitrary decision-making.

40|$|An {{abstract}} argumentation framework {{can be used}} {{to model}} the argumentative stance of an agent at a high level of abstraction, by indicating for every pair <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> that is being considered in a debate whether the first attacks the second. When modelling a group of agents engaged in a debate, we may wish to aggregate their individual argumentation frameworks to obtain a single such framework that reflects the <b>consensus</b> <b>of</b> the group. Even when agents disagree on many details, there may well be high-level agreement on important semantic properties, such as the acceptability <b>of</b> a given <b>argument.</b> Using techniques from social choice theory, we analyse under what circumstances such semantic properties agreed upon by the individual agents can be preserved under aggregation.

30|$|However, the {{consensus}} in [23] has also a shortcoming; namely, {{it is not}} an average consensus.

2500|$|Article Two of the Constitution sets {{one of the}} {{principal}} qualifications to be eligible for election of the office of President as being a natural born citizen of the United States. Although McCain was not born within a state of the United States, his status as a natural-born citizen (and future eligibility to be elected to the presidency) may have been assured at birth by either jus sanguinis, since his parents were U.S. citizens, or jus soli, as the Panama Canal Zone was at that time (1936) a United States possession (1903–1979), or both. However, Internet talk questioned whether McCain, who was born at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in Panama, qualified as a natural-born citizen. A bipartisan legal review by Laurence Tribe and Theodore Olson, as well as a unanimous but nonbinding Senate resolution, indicate that McCain does indeed fulfill the requirement. However, University of Arizona constitutional law professor Gabriel J. Chin argues both that the Tribe-Olson opinion is unsound under current law and that McCain was actually granted citizenship by a law which was passed eleven months after McCain's birth, disqualifying him under the Constitution from natural-born citizenship and the Presidency. Commenting on the Chin paper, Temple University law and citizenship expert Peter Spiro said, [...] "No court will get close to it, and everyone else is on board, so there's a constitutional <b>consensus,</b> the merits <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> such as this one aside." [...] Catholic University law professor Sarah Duggan agreed that no legal challenge would prevail, but said only a constitutional amendment could fully resolve the question.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address an often {{overlooked}} problem in defeasible argumentation: how do we deal with arguments that {{are on their own}} defeated, but together remain undefeated? Pollock (1991) finds this accrual <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> a natural supposition, but then surprisingly denies its existence. We think that arguments do accrue. To handle the accrual <b>of</b> <b>arguments,</b> we introduce compound defeat <b>of</b> <b>arguments.</b> We call the defeat <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> compound, if groups <b>of</b> <b>arguments</b> can be defeated by other groups <b>of</b> <b>arguments.</b> The formalism presented in this paper is based on this notion of compound defeat.
