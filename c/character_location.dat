2500|$|The Prisoner is a 1980 Apple II {{computer}} game produced by Edu-Ware. The game was {{loosely based on}} the 1960s television series The Prisoner and incorporates that show's themes {{about the loss of}} individuality in a technological, controlling society. [...] The player's role is that of an intelligence agent who has resigned from his job for reasons known only to himself, and who has been abducted to an isolated island community that seems designed to be his own personal prison. The island's authorities will use any means—including coercion, disorientation, deception, and frustration—to learn why their prisoner has resigned, and every <b>character,</b> <b>location,</b> and apparent escape route seem {{to be part of a}} grand scheme to trick the player into revealing a code number representing the prisoner's reason for resigning. The game occasionally breaks the fourth wall by acknowledging that a game is being played.|$|E

It mainly consisted of <b>character</b> <b>location,</b> character segmentation and {{character recognition}}. Firstly, it preprocessed {{the image of}} medicine bottle label for the following procedures; secondly, it obtained the general character region by contour tracing and realized the precise location by horizontal projection algorithm; then it located character adhesion region by vertical projection algorithm and segmented the merged characters by drop fall algorithm; finally, it adopted Karhunen-Loeve transform to extract character features from the subclasses of coarse classification and accurately recognized characters by the improved BP algorithm. Experiments show that the system can recognize the bottle label characters quickly and accurately, it is of great practical value.

40|$|Single {{character}} named entity (SCNE) {{is a name}} entity (NE) {{composed of}} one Chinese character, such as " # " (zhong 1, China) and " #" # e 2,Russia #. SCNE is very common in written Chinese text. However, {{due to the lack}} of in-depth research, SCNE is a major source of errors in named entity recognition (NER). This paper formulates the SCNE recognition within the sourcechannel model framework. Our experiments show very encouraging results: an Fscore of 81. 01 % for single <b>character</b> <b>location</b> name recognition, and an F-score of 68. 02 % for single character person name recognition. An alternative view of the SCNE recognition problem is to formulate it as a classification task. We construct two classifiers based on maximum entropy model (ME) and vector space model (VSM), respectively. We compare all proposed approaches, showing that the sourcechannel model performs the best in most cases. ...|$|E
40|$|Younger {{brains are}} noisier {{information}} processing systems; {{this means that}} information for younger individuals has to allow clearer differentiation between those aspects that are required for the processing task in hand (the ‘signal’) {{and those that are}} not (the ‘noise’). We compared toddler-directed and adult-directed TV programmes (TotTV/ATV). We examined how low-level visual features (that previous research has suggested influence gaze allocation) relate to semantic information, namely the location of the character speaking in each frame. We show that this relationship differs between TotTV and ATV. First, we conducted Receiver Operator Characteristics analyses and found that feature congestion predicted speaking <b>character</b> <b>location</b> in TotTV but not ATV. Second, we used multiple analytical strategies to show that luminance differentials (flicker) predict face location more strongly in TotTV than ATV. Our results suggest that TotTV designers have intuited techniques for controlling toddler attention using low-level visual cues. The implications of these findings for structuring childhood learning experiences away from a screen are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Information {{concerning}} the frequency, severity, <b>character,</b> <b>location,</b> duration, diurnal pattern of headache and ancillary symptoms were obtained in 25 patients with autonomic failure and 44 control subjects. Precipitating and ameliorating factors were identified. Autonomic failure patients had more {{head and neck}} discomfort than controls. Their discomfort was {{much more likely to}} localize in the occiput, nape of the neck and shoulder, compared with controls. There was a greater tendency for the discomfort to occur in the morning and after meals. It was sometimes less than 5 min in duration and was often associated with dimming, blurring, or tunnelling of vision. It was provoked by upright posture and relieved by lying down. Patients with severe autonomic failure and orthostatic hypotension often present with a posture-dependent headache or neck pain. Because the relationship of these symptoms to posture is often not recognized, the fact that these findings may signal an underlying autonomic disorder is underappreciated, and the opportunity to consider this aetiology for the headache may be missed...|$|E

Our proposal will extend this prototype to enable inter-textual study of all the Yoknapatawpha fiction. This enlargement will deploy the exceptional capacities of digital humanities to make the study of Faulkner’s engagement with a particular place and major issues in American history as dynamic as his repeated returns to it and them. The extended design will provide students with new means to appreciate Faulkner’s art, and scholars with transformative digital pathways to research all that his work can reveal about literature and culture...|$|E

40|$|Text {{detection}} and {{optical character recognition}} (OCR) in images of natural scenes is a fairly new computer vision area but yet very useful in numerous applicative areas.

Therefore, {{it is very difficult}} to compare them objectively. Since our aim is to help the research community in standardizing the evaluation of the text {{detection and}} OCR methods, we present CVL OCR DB, a public database of annotated images of text in diverse natural scenes, captured at varying weather and lighting conditions. All the images in the database are annotated with the text region and single <b>character</b> <b>location</b> information, making CVL OCR DB suitable for testing and evaluating both text detection and OCR methods. Moreover, all the single characters are also cropped from the original images and stored individually, turning our database into a huge collection of characters suitable for training and testing OCR classifiers...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt {{is often}} {{difficult}} for many people to find appropriate topics or elements when they are writing a story. The goal {{of this research is}} to propose a framework and implement it through designing a computer-aided system for creating stories by stimulating user's creativity on finding story elements. Many computer-aided systems, such as in the fields of CAD, CAI, etc., have pointed out the importance of assisting creative thinking with computer. For example, Huang, Li, Wang & Chang (2007) proposed a method to assist creative learning by brainstorming and collaboration. Liu (2000) reassembled a shape to construct various different shapes in order to stimulate the user's creativity by seeing richer variations. In this work, we use pictures and texts as the stimulating elements and design appropriate user interface to facilitate the story. We have implemented a computer system, based on the concept of pictures-and-attributed-notes (PAN), aiming to stimulate creativity and imagination when user is creating a story. The attributed notes are in the form of <b>Character,</b> <b>Location,</b> Object, Situation, Action and Theme (CLOSAT), proposed by Rabiger (2000) ...|$|E
