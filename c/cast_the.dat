5|$|The casting {{approach}} for Carnivàle was to <b>cast</b> <b>the</b> best available actors {{and to show}} the characters' realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much. Carnivàle casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions such as for Adrienne Barbeau as Ruthie.|$|E

5|$|After Stillman's defeat on May 14, {{the regulars}} and militia {{continued}} up the Rock River {{to search for}} Black Hawk.

As morale plummeted, Governor Reynolds asked his militia officers to vote on whether to continue the campaign. General Whiteside, disgusted with the performance of his men, <b>cast</b> <b>the</b> tie-breaking vote in favor of disbanding. Most of Whiteside's brigade disbanded at Ottawa, Illinois, on May 28. About 300 men, including Abraham Lincoln, agreed to remain in the field for twenty more days until a new militia force could be organized.|$|E
5|$|After independence, the Parliament of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when {{amendments to}} the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed to provide for Non-constituency Members of Parliament ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes <b>cast.</b> <b>The</b> scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament. In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused by the political parties represented in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|After their {{extraordinary}} early successes, {{beginning with}} Oklahoma! in 1943, Rodgers and Hammerstein had written two musicals in the 1950s {{that did not}} do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes. Lee's novel focuses on a father, Wang Chi-yang, a wealthy refugee from China, who clings to traditional values in San Francisco's Chinatown. Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted {{the focus of the}} musical to his son, Wang Ta, who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation into American culture. The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian – or at least, plausibly Asian-looking – <b>cast.</b> <b>The</b> musical, much more light-hearted than Lee's novel, was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour.|$|E

O'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger filmed the original pilot. Around the time the creators wanted to recast Martha Kent when The Huntress was canceled, allowing O'Toole to join the <b>cast.</b> <b>The</b> actress had played Lana Lang in Superman III.|$|E
5|$|Artists in {{the eighteenth}} century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) {{depicted}} the witches variously, as have many directors since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, or have adapted them to different cultures, as in Orson Welles's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have <b>cast</b> <b>the</b> witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Mühe was married to his third wife, stage actress Susanne Lothar, and living in Berlin with her and their two children, Sophie Marie and Jakob. Mühe and Lothar starred {{together}} in Mühe's last film, Nemesis (2010), which deals with a couple's troubled relationship. However, Lothar, who died in 2012, launched a lawsuit to block the film from release for nearly three years, apparently because she felt that it would <b>cast</b> <b>the</b> couple in a bad light.|$|E
