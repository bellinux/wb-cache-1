40|$|This study {{investigates the}} factors that {{influence}} the design and implementation of a project-based learning (PBL) curriculum within an alternative education program in a suburban public school district. The study sought {{to tell the story of}} the implementation of PBL from the perspectives of staff and students at the school. A narrative inquiry methodology was selected. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve staff members and eight students. Data also included field notes made at school events throughout the year and student artefacts of learning. The data were analyzed using open, axial, and selective coding processes. The data from staff participants revealed three thematic categories of factors that influenced the design and implementation of PBL: (1) foundational factors (positive relationships with students, a commitment to student-centered learning, flexible scheduling, staff collaboration, and administrative support); (2) challenges (students’ social emotional well being, students’ learning fears and learning disabilities, students’ levels of interest and motivation for learning, and teachers’ concerns regarding the academic rigour of the PBL model); and (3) professional development activities (shared vision for PBL, workshops and in-service sessions, online and off-site learning opportunities, teacher inquiry and experiential learning, and staff opportunities for collaboration and reflection). Factors that contributed to students’ engagement in the PBL model revealed both distancing and embracing narratives. Distancing narratives reflected {{the factors that}} <b>had</b> <b>disengaged</b> <b>students</b> from learning in their former school. These included barriers to learning, feelings of alienation, and school bureaucracies. Embracing narratives reflected the key factors that contributed to students’ engagement in the PBL model. These included a caring environment, flexible learning, a co-constructed curriculum, personal relevancy and authenticity, and empowerment. The findings of this research suggest that if positive inter-relational conditions are established in the learning environment among teachers and students (sense of belonging, trusting relationships, collaborative practices, ethic of care) project-based learning can be an effective curriculum model for re-engaging vulnerable youth in school. Furthermore, the study suggests that a PBL curriculum model grounded in students’ interests and passions can provide personally relevant, authentic learning opportunities that empower alternative education students and help them develop resiliency, self-efficacy, and more positive self-images...|$|R
50|$|HOL {{involves}} {{students in}} junior secondary school (Years 7 - 10) as a preventative measure. It operates {{on the assumption}} that if <b>students</b> <b>have</b> become fully <b>disengaged</b> they will either exit prematurely, or remain disaffected and derive minimal benefit from their time there. Thus the program attempts to identify and recruit <b>disengaging</b> <b>students</b> before negative attitudes and behaviours become entrenched. Students are reported to remain, on average, two years in the program on a voluntary basis.|$|R
40|$|The {{premise of}} this {{research}} project was to attempt to finds solutions to eradicate the problem of disengagement in the classroom when conducting group work and employing the use of group assignments {{in order to assess}} student learning. I wanted to propose a way teachers can strive to ensure all students within the group contribute to the groups’ success and learning without <b>having</b> some <b>students</b> <b>disengage</b> from the situation and rely on others to do the work of the group. The problem with group projects is too often the division of work becomes unfair, and only some members of the group are actually engaged in learning. The accountability for learning and progress forward shifts from the individual to the group, and this too often results in only part of the group making any learning contributions while {{the other part of the}} group has checked out and become disengaged from the learning...|$|R

40|$|This thesis report {{presents}} {{results of}} a qualitative study conducted at Iowa State University. The purposes {{of the study were}} to investigate college student perceptions of leadership, and to identify beliefs that empower some students to be involved in leadership opportunities as well as beliefs that constrain some students from being engaged in leadership. A review of the literature was conducted concerning paradigms of leadership, how students perceive leadership, and what attempts are made to develop leadership. Twenty-four student leaders (students holding leadership positions in student organizations) were interviewed through focus groups, and five <b>disengaged</b> <b>students</b> (students who did not currently hold, and have never held, positions of leadership in student organizations) were interviewed individually. The student leaders generally regarded leadership to be an individualistic phenomenon pertaining to positions of power and influence, which requires particular qualities and skills that individuals should possess.;While their beliefs were fairly similar to <b>student</b> leaders, the <b>disengaged</b> <b>students</b> indicated more beliefs that anyone can be a leader, and that leadership does not require a position or title. In addition, the student leaders revealed many empowering beliefs that have encouraged them to engage in leadership, whereas the <b>disengaged</b> <b>students</b> revealed several constraining beliefs that have limited their motivation to engage in leadership opportunities. The student leaders also indicated that they receive more encouragement and support from others, are given more opportunities, and have had a background that has fostered their desire to be leaders. The <b>disengaged</b> <b>students</b> demonstrated a lack of confidence, a lack of interest in leadership, a self-perceived deficiency in leadership qualities, and fewer opportunities to lead. A review of appropriate documents was conducted as well, in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the institutional leadership beliefs of Iowa State University. Implications for higher education and recommendations for practice are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{will address}} the {{excessive}} use of suspensions and other disciplinary actions against Black males who are disengaged from school. Academically <b>disengaged</b> <b>students</b> often come to school late, miss assignments, have difficulty understanding schoolwork, and may have attentional challenges or alternative learning styles. Black males can become disengaged from school {{for a variety of}} reasons, including being dissatisfied with school because of noninclusive curricula, racial biases, and poor relationships with teachers. In addition, some Black males are not socialized to the academic environment due to unclear and inconsistent messages about school from home and the community. Finally, some Black males have learning or attentional disabilities that are misunderstood or misdiagnosed. Research suggests that academically <b>disengaged</b> <b>students</b> account for the majority of all suspensions. This study will examine responses of students, parents and teachers who completed Monitoring the Future: A Continuing Study of American Youth. The chapter will clarify the relationship between suspensions and academic disengagement, and provide policy solutions for school leaders to develop strategies to reduce suspensions by providing a more inclusive and compassionate learning environment for Black males...|$|R
30|$|The changes {{implemented}} in PISA 2009 were first, {{in order to}} incentivise student participation, a prize draw was introduced in which three participating students in each school received a 15 euro voucher which good be exchanged {{in a number of}} different shops (e.g. for books, music, games). While this <b>could</b> <b>have</b> served to attract a somewhat higher number of <b>disengaged</b> <b>students,</b> analyses of the sampling outcomes suggest that this was not the case (Cosgrove et al., 2010). No major issues with testing were identified by the PISA Quality Monitora for Ireland, although some disengagement among students was observed by test administrators (LaRoche and Cartwright, 2010). It is possible that other countries may also have found student engagement to be a problem, though systematic information on this is not available. Further discussion on the disengagement issue can be found in Section 2.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study that {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} student behaviour is a concern for school teachers. A questionnaire was used to investigate teachers’ views about student behaviour in their classes.

Aggressive and anti-social behaviours occur infrequently. Teachers employ strategies to manage unproductive behaviours that locate the problem with the student. This paper argues that teachers could benefit from understanding how the classroom ecology influences engagement and therefore student behaviour, rather than focusing on ‘fixing’ unproductive behaviour...|$|R

50|$|A {{significant}} {{consensus among}} research on arts education exists {{and this is}} that arts reach {{students who are not}} otherwise being reached and that the arts reach students in ways that they are otherwise not being reached. Students failing is commonly explained by <b>disengaged</b> <b>students</b> and finding that arts provide students a reason and a motivation for being engaged with school and thus preventing students from dropping out of school. This motivation found within can be examined through the way that engagement in arts enhances self-awareness, self-confidence, trust and empowerment. Creating art is a personal experience and involves the student’s personal resources implicating a greater involvement and investment in a work without right or wrong answers. Personal investment nourishes self-directed learning and encourages the learning experience itself rather than learning as a means of test score performance.|$|R
