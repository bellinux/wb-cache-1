Two additional transmitters {{in the southern part}} of the market, officially classed as WXMI digital repeaters, serve the direct Kalamazoo area on channel 30 from the tower of WGVU-TVs Kalamazoo satellite WGVK, along with a second repeater licensed to Battle Creek on channel 17 transmitting from the citys south side; all four translators carry WXMI and its subchannel services, and all map via PSIP to channel 17.

The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 42 to VHF channel 7 for post-transition operations.

Although stations in other major markets have similar problems, WHDH is the only station in the Boston area market which changed its digital channel due to the June 2009 transition, requiring a <b>channel</b> <b>map</b> rescan to receive the station. WHDH was also one of three area stations, along with WMUR-TV (channel 9) and WWDP (channel 46), to broadcast in VHF post-transition, requiring either a traditional indoor antenna within Boston proper, or in outer areas at minimum an outdoor antenna.|$|E

A `` 3 / 2 -D'' bow shock model is qualitatively successful at reproducing the general features of the radial velocity <b>channel</b> <b>maps,</b> {{but it does not}} show the same complexity as the data and it fails to reproduce the line ratios in our high spatial resolution maps.

40|$|An EPR-channel {{consists}} of two Hilbert spaces, H A and H B, and of a density operator sitting on the their direct product space H AB. The channel is triggered by a von Neumann measurement on H A, resulting in a state (density operator) ω A. Because a measurement in H A {{can be considered as}} a measurement in H AB equally well, it induces a new state in H AB and, hence, a new state, ω B, in H B. The map ω A → ω B depends only on the channel’s original density operator, and not on the chosen complete von Neumann measurement. This map is referred to as “channel map”. The construction of the <b>channel</b> <b>map</b> is described together with various of its properties, including an elementary link to the modular conjugation and to some related questions.

40|$|I review recent results {{derived from}} {{numerical}} simulations of the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), in particular concerning {{the nature and}} formation of turbulent clouds, methods for comparing the structure in simulations and observations, {{and the effects of}} projection of three-dimensional structures onto two dimensions. Clouds formed as turbulent density fluctuations are probably not confined by thermal pressure, but rather their morphology may be determined by the large-scale velocity field. Also, they may have shorter lifetimes than normally believed, as the large-scale turbulent modes have larger associated velocities than the clouds' internal velocity dispersions. Structural characterization algorithms have started to distinguish the best fitting simulations to a particular observation, and have opened several new questions, such as the nature of the observed line width-size relation and of the relation between the structures seen in <b>channel</b> <b>maps</b> and the true spatial distribution of the density and velocity fields. The velocity field apparently dominates the morphology seen in intensity <b>channel</b> <b>maps,</b> at least in cases when the density field exhibits power spectra steep enough.
