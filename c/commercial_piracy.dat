40|$|Abstract: We {{examine the}} effects of a government’s {{sensitivity}} to its tax revenues, earned from the software industry, on its anti-piracy policies that consists of monitoring and penalizing a commercial software pirate. We consider a strategic entry-deterrence framework where the original producer chooses a pricing strategy that either allows or deters the pirate’s entry. Sensitivity to tax revenues is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to prevent piracy. Welfare maximization may or may not result in monitoring as the socially optimal outcome. If monitoring is socially optimal then the pirate’s entry is deterred. The equilibrium entry-deterring price may be less than the equilibrium monopoly price. Only in the extreme case the monopoly outcome is restored. Keywords:Accommodating strategy, Aggressive strategy, <b>Commercial</b> <b>piracy,</b> Sensitivity factor. ...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} involved in thinking seriously about piracy is {{the wide range of}} activities, engagements and transactions that fall under this banner. From communitarian filesharing to copyright-infringing political communication to <b>commercial</b> bootlegging, <b>piracy</b> comes in many shapes, sizes and ideological inflections. Consequently, any credible analysis of piracy's 'economic effects' - a topic long characterised by overheated rhetoric about profit leakage {{on the one hand and}} new-economy innovation on the other - requires a differentiated vocabulary for thinking about the relationship between consumers, media objects, and distribution networks. This paper, which draws on material from the forthcoming book The Informal Media Economy (Lobato and Thomas), is an attempt to revisit the issue of 'effects' from the viewpoint of economic plurality. Moving through a series of contrasting examples - including systems that variously cannibalise, complement, ignore and extend formal media markets - we will consider the diverse ways that pirate systems interact with established distribution models for film, television and digital media. In this way, we can also catch glimpses of something larger: the tango of mutual influence between formal and informal worlds...|$|R

This paper reports on a study that examined the perceptions and experiences of hospitality and tourism students on software piracy. On the basis of the empirical results collected from hospitality and tourism students in Hong Kong, it is concluded that most students have used or purchased pirated software.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{would suggest}} if a pirated product, which is {{cheaper than the}} {{original}} product, becomes more reliable then the relative demand of the pirated product or the rate of piracy will increase when consumers have different willingness to pay.

40|$|We review {{strategies}} that movie distributors {{have used to}} cope with piracy, copying and sharing of movies in the United States in four categories: “hard goods” <b>commercial</b> <b>piracy,</b> consumer theft of pay TV signals, consumer copying and sharing of videos and pay TV, and mostly in prospect [...] Internet file sharing. In the past, distributors have mainly sought to raise costs of engaging in these activities by increasing legal jeopardy, advantaging anti-copy technology, and reducing original sources of supply. They appear to have effectively reduced or contained most piracy, copying and sharing of movies in the U. S., at least with analog media. Movie distributors are following similar strategies with digital media, including Internet file sharing. Digital media raise the stakes because of lower costs of copying or sharing and higher quality of outputs. Digital outputs are not always as high quality as source originals, however, and Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies potentially improve distributor control. The movie studios now face technological, demand, and political uncertainties in the U.

40|$|Market piracy in the design-based {{industry}} is an expanding worldwide phenomenon (Grossman and Shapiro, 1988 a,b; Chaudhry and Walsh, 1996; Schultz II and Saprito, 1996).

5000|$|The term [...] "piracy" [...] {{has been}} used to refer to the {{unauthorized}} copying, distribution and selling of works in copyright. The practice of labelling the infringement of exclusive rights in creative works as [...] "piracy" [...] predates statutory copyright law. Prior to the Statute of Anne in 1710, the Stationers' Company of London in 1557, received a Royal Charter giving the company a monopoly on publication and tasking it with enforcing the charter.

40|$|In {{the case}} of the need of {{extraordinary}} security, Kirchhoff-loop-Johnson-(like) -noise ciphers can easily be integrated on existing types of digital chips in order to provide secure data communication between hardware processors, memory chips, hard disks and other units within a computer or other data processor system.

The key can be stored in flash memories within the communicating chip units at hidden random addresses among other random bits that are continuously generated by the secure line but are never actually used. Thus, even if the system is disassembled, and the eavesdropper can have direct access to the communication lines between the units, or even if she is trying to use a man-in-the-middle attack, no information can be extracted.

40|$|Digital piracy {{has become}} a major issue for the global {{information}} goods economy. The threat and the damage caused by piracy are widespread and span the entire range of information goods from music and movies to software. Each year, the industry’s losses to piracy amount to billions of dollars. According to the BSA/IDC 2009 Global Software Piracy Report (BSA/IDC 2009), software piracy caused a revenue loss of more than 50 billion dollars in the world in 2008, and that for every two dollars ’ worth of software purchased legitimately, more than one dollar’s worth was obtained illegally. Some 35 percent of all music discs sold worldwide are illegal copies costing the industry $ 4. 6 Billion (IFPI 2005), and the movie industry’s annual losses to piracy reached $ 6. 1 Billion (MPA-LEK 2008). Further, each year the affected industries spend millions of dollars in direct costs of fighting piracy through activities such as litigation and publicity campaigns.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the impact of moral equity, relativism, and {{attitude}} towards digital piracy behaviour in a developing country. End-user piracy is more difficult to detect than <b>commercial</b> <b>piracy.</b> Thus, an effective strategy to combat piracy needs a comprehensive understanding of both the supply and demand sides of piracy. The current study focuses on the demand side by investigating the impact of moral equity, relativism, and attitude on consumer piracy behaviour in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach – Using a convenient sample in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, questionnaires were distributed in a large private university. In addition, through snowball sampling techniques, the surveys were also distributed to other adults who live within a walking distance from the campus. The data collection resulted in 222 usable surveys (a response rate of 68 per cent). Findings – In Indonesia, moral equity had a negative and significant impact on purchases of illegal copies of music CDs and pirated software. Relativism affects the purchase of pirated software positively, but its effect on purchases of illegal copies of CDs is insignificant. Attitude towards the act was negatively impacted by moral equity for CDs and software. Relativism only significantly affects the purchase of pirated software but in the opposite direction while it has failed to reach significance for illegal music CD purchases. Attitude towards the software piracy and purchases of illegal copies of music CDs positively affect consumer’s digital piracy behaviour. Finally, Indonesian consumers feel more morally wrong to purchase illegal copies of CDs than to buy pirated software. Practical implications – In the context of Indonesia, higher moral equity has affected piracy behaviour negatively. Therefore, efforts to reduce piracy should focus on highlighting the importance of fairness and justice. One of the main drivers of digital piracy (e. g. buying, downloading, copying, and sharing digital materials illegally) is overpriced products. It has led many Indonesians to believe that it is acceptable to purchase pirated software and illegal copies of CDs. Nonetheless, if companies are able to lower prices; thus make it affordable to consumers, consumers will perceive fairness and justice in purchasing original copies of software and CDs. Originality/value – There are very limited studies investigating factors impacting the purchase of pirated software and CDs in the developing countries specifically Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the world and one of the biggest markets for counterfeit products. This is one of first few studies exploring this issue in Indonesia. Griffith Business School, Department of MarketingFull Tex...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} digital piracy for {{commercial}} profit {{has received a}} lot of attention in the industrial organisation literature over the last few years. Illegal competition from pirates reduces the revenue of the legal firm and this has been a concern of the digital media and software industry globally. This thesis is motivated by the observation of three important gaps in the literature on <b>commercial</b> <b>piracy.</b> First, pirated products are usually imperfect substitutes of the legal product. This implies that the impact of a change in the legal product’s price on the demand for the pirated product will be different from the impact of a change in the price of the pirated product on the legal firm’s demand. The existing literature on product differentiation, however, does not consider such kind of asymmetric product differentiation. Second, empirical evidences show that firms often need to incur costs to document and report signs of piracy, and then the regulatory authority decides whether or not and how much to invest in monitoring which, in turn, affects the probability that the pirate is being caught and convicted. The implications of costly reporting by the legal firm and ex-post monitoring by the authority have not been investigated. Third, while the importance of piracy in affecting innovation has been widely recognised, there has not been much work that directly models the impact of piracy on firms that engage in competition for innovation. This thesis presents three theoretical essays that attempt to fill these gaps in the literature. The first essay analyses the effects of the degree of asymmetric product differentiation on the profit ordering of two competing firms in a Stackelberg model to investigate whether a leader earns a higher or a lower profit than a follower. The model captures asymmetric product differentiation by two cross-price effect parameters, and this two-dimensional model generates novel results that are absent in the literature on profit-ordering with symmetric product differentiation. For example, we find that for every level of the cross-price effect of the change in the leader’s price on the follower’s quantity there exists a critical value for the cross-price effect of the change in the follower’s price on the leader’s quantity, such that below this critical level the leader earns a higher profit than the follower, but the reverse is true above this critical value. The second essay introduces piracy in a market with asymmetric product differentiation. It examines the regulatory authority’s decision on whether to monitor piracy following the legal firm’s report of the presence of a pirate in the market. In the model, the authority decides whether or not and how much to invest in monitoring in order to maximise a politically motivated objective function. We show that with ex-post monitoring the government will monitor piracy under both price and quantity competition if the legal firm’s political influence is sufficiently high. We also find that, when holding the cross-price effect of the legal firm’s price on the pirate’s output constant, there exists a unique level of the cross-price impact of the pirate’s price on the legal firm’s output, above which monitoring will be higher under quantity competition, and below which monitoring will be higher under price competition. Moreover, we show that when the government can credibly commit to monitor piracy the legal firm’s investment on innovation is higher under quantity competition than under price competition. The last essay analyses the effect of piracy on innovation when two legal firms engage in R&D competition. When a single firm is deciding how much to invest in R&D which will stochastically determine whether innovation will be successful, piracy unambiguously retards innovation. However, we show that when two legal firms are engaging in a patent race, piracy may enhance innovation. We also show that if the difference between the efficiency parameters of the innovating firms is relatively large then piracy increases aggregate R&D investment and the profit of the less efficient firm...|$|E
