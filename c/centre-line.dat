5|$|Pre-dreadnoughts carried guns {{of several}} {{different}} calibres, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat. The main armament was four heavy guns, mounted in two <b>centre-line</b> turrets fore and aft. Very few pre-dreadnoughts deviated from this arrangement. These guns were slow-firing, and initially of limited accuracy; {{but they were}} the only guns heavy enough to penetrate the thick armour which protected the engines, magazines, and main guns of enemy battleships.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{low-pass}} design {{technique is}} {{to implement the}} shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line {{as shown in figure}} 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has a stub {{on both sides of the}} line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill defined. A stub that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its <b>centre-line</b> and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.|$|E

40|$|The {{installation}} and working test performance of four full-scale instrumented driven piles and their subsequent response to twin tunnels constructed below the pile bases are described. One pair {{was designed to}} be largely friction piles and the other pair end-bearing. Their locations relative to the new tunnels were carefully chosen to optimise understanding of pile responses at varying offsets from the <b>centre-lines.</b> The site conditions and the greenfield response to earth pressure balance machine tunnelling at the site were described in a companion paper that reported an expanding displacement field around the tunnels rather than the contracting fields usually observed. The field monitoring results indicated that, during construction, zones of influence existed around tunnels, where the ground and piles were subjected to different degrees and senses of relative vertical displacement. Redistributions of load along the pile lengths occurred as the tunnel boring machines approached, passed beneath and continued beyond the pile bases; lateral pile deflections and bending moments were also induced. Based on the results from this field study, implications for the capacity of existing piles (and design of new piles) subjected to tunnelling-induced movements are assessed for cases of expanding and contracting displacement fields...|$|R

40|$|Flow patterns, {{temperature}} distributions and steady-state heat transfers inwards {{across a}} horizontal annular, atmospheric-pressure, air-filled eccentric cavity have been determined. Several different configurations of two low-conductivity baffles (arranged symmetrically {{with respect to}} the vertical plane through the <b>centre-lines</b> of the pipes), inserted across the cavity and extending its whole length, were tested. With the horizontal inner pipe located at a vertical eccentricity of - 0 Â· 65 (i. e. in the lower region of the outer pipe), the optimal inclination of the two baffles, corresponding to the least rate of convective heat exchange, was achieved at Â± 140 Â° from the vertically downwards radius vector emanating from the centre of the inner pipe. This enabled a reduction of ~ 6 % in the steady-state convective heat leak to be achieved compared with that for the plain eccentric annulus under similar temperature differences between the pipes. However, by using a vertical baffle (i. e. at an angle of 0 Â°), an increase of ~ 14 % in the convective heat leak through the air occurred. The results agree qualitatively with those expected on the basis of previous studies for the inverse case (of a concentric annulus) with the heat flowing outwards. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the few-view reconstruction problem {{as it applies}} to imaging cerebral vasculature using digital subtraction angiography. A fully automated reconstruction algorithm is developed that circumvents the traditional 'correspondence problem' using only notions of consistency and connectivity. Here it is assumed that the object is a connected structure and that its <b>centre-lines</b> have been identified in 3 or more images. The first of three steps in the procedure involves generating a connected structure that represents the multiplicity of solutions that are consistent with any two (different) projections of the vascular tree. The second step assigns to each branch in this structure a measure of consistency based on its agreement with a third (or additional) view of the object. The problem then becomes one of propagating this information, via connectivity relationships and other consistency checks, throughout the above structure to distinguish between the branches comprising the imaged structure and the accompanying artifacts. This thesis also addresses the issue of how different imaging geometries affect the outcome of the reconstructed data. Here it is suggested that {{it may be possible to}} favourably affect the reconstruction by selecting certain projections based on what is known after two or more views. Simulations using mathematical models of varying complexity and experiments based on actual image data are used to validate the methods described here and demonstrate that it is possible to achieve adequate reconstructions with as few as three distinct views...|$|R
40|$|Gradient coil {{windings}} are typically constructed from either variable width copper tracks or fixed width wires. Excessive power dissipation within these windings during gradient coil operation limits the maximum drive current or duty {{cycle of the}} coil. It is common to design gradient coils {{in terms of a}} continuous minimum power current density and to perform a discretization to obtain the locations of the coil tracks or wires. However, the existence of finite gaps between these conductors and a maximum conductor width leads to an underestimation of coil resistance when calculated using the continuous current density. Put equivalently, the actual current density within the tracks or wires is higher than that used in the optimization and this departure results in suboptimal coil designs. In this work, a mapping to an effective current density is proposed to account for these effects and provide the correct contribution to the power dissipation. This enables the design of gradient coils that are genuinely optimal in terms of power minimization, post-discretization. The method was applied to the theoretical design of a variety of small x- and z-gradient coils for use in small animal imaging and coils for human head imaging. Computer-driven comparisons were made between coils designed with and without the current density mapping, in terms of simulated power dissipation. For coils to be built using variable width tracks, the method provides slight reductions in power dissipation in most cases and substantial gains only in cases where the minimum separation between track <b>centre-lines</b> is less than twice the gap size. However, for coils to be built using fixed width wires, very considerable reductions in dissipated power are consistently attainable (up to 60 %) when compared to standard approaches of coil optimization...|$|R

One of the major advantages of the Garratt form of articulation is the maintenance of the locomotive's centre-of-gravity over or inside the track <b>centre-line</b> when rounding curves.

40|$|The {{planning}} of roads {{is one of}} the most important activities in urban planning and design. Even at the early stage of planning, a planner must take the roads and their planar layout into account and should design them as soon as possible. Then he can use the roads as building blocks for further planning, such as land use, underground layout, detailed district planning and road design. In conventional manual design procedures and according to the “Norm of Transport Planning onUrban Roadi, it is a tedious task to draw property and side lines of the road network in a city or district and to link them properly at road crosses. With the help of computers, it will be possible to do it automatically. In this paper, the data structure we constructed for our PC software for road processing is first introduced. This data structure defines the road level, the widths of side and property lines, the orientation and topological link of one road with other roads. The procedural considerations for road processing are then given. They include the generation of the side lines and property lines, smooth linking between adjacent roads, rounding of arc road segments and all of the physical coordinates for the control points on both <b>centre-lines</b> and property lines. When using this system, a planner only needs to input the centre lines of roads and their width. The roads can be either inputted by using a digitizer or directly sketched on the display. The subsequent processing mentioned above is completed automatically, and the resulting geometric data associated with the road network is stored in a database with the same data structure. The specification on the road cross, which is required during the processing, can be changed interactively and globally, and once changed the regeneration of the above process will be finished very fast...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistics}} of the fluctuating concentration field within a plume {{is important in}} the analysis of atmospheric dispersion of toxic, inflammable and odorous gases. Previous work has tended to focus on concentration fluctuations in single plumes released in the surface layer or at ground level and there is a general lack of information about the mixing of two adjacent plumes and how the statistical properties of the concentration fluctuations are modified in these circumstances. In this work, data from wind tunnel experiments are used to analyse the variance, skewness, kurtosis, intermittency, probability density function and power spectrum of the concentration field during the mixing of two identical plumes and results are compared with those obtained for an equivalent single plume. The normalised variance, skewness and kurtosis on the <b>centre-lines</b> of the combined plume increase with distance downwind of the stack and, in the two-source configuration, takes lower values than those found in the single plumes. The results reflect the merging process at short range, which is least protracted for cases in which the sources are in-line or up to 30 ° and more, the plumes are effectively side-by-side during the merging process and the interaction between the vortex pairs in each plume is strong. Vertical asymmetry is observed between the upper and the lower parts of the plumes, with the upper part having greater intermittency (i. e. the probability that no plume material is present) and a more pronounced tail to the concentration probability distribution. This asymmetry tends to diminish at greater distances from the source but occurs in both buoyant and neutral plumes and is believed {{to be associated with the}} 'bending-over' of the emission in the cross-flow and the vortex pair that this generates. The results allowed us to identify three phases in plume development. The first, very near the stack, is dominated by turbulence generated within the plume and characterised by concentration spectra with distinct peaks corresponding to scales comparable with those of the counter-rotating vortex pair. A second phase follows at somewhat greater distances downwind, in which there are significant contributions to the concentration fluctuations from both the turbulence internal to the plume and the external turbulence. The third phase is one in which the concentration fluctuations appear to be controlled by the external turbulence present in the ambient flow. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R

[...] For the dominant mode this is on the <b>centre-line</b> of the broad face of the waveguide, but for some other modes it may need to be off-centre.

500|$|The turret {{was first}} used in naval combat on the USS Monitor in 1862, with a type of turret {{designed}} by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson. A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor Cowper Coles with a prototype of this installed on HMS Trusty in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes. Ericsson's turret turned on a central spindle, and Coles's turned on a ring of bearings. Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns, but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s. [...] The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging, so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean-going ironclads. [...] The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy. [...] Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret (guns and armor protection) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard. [...] The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armor. [...] Low freeboard, however, also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage—and therefore range of the vessel. [...] In many respects, the turreted, low-freeboard Monitor and the broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an 'Ironclad' was all about. [...] The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes, or 'squaring this circle', was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles: HMS Captain, a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail, and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870. Her half-sister [...] was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams.

He claimed that the Bf 109 was {{nearing the end of}} its useful service life and there was no replacement on the horizon. Milch and Albert Speer, the newly appointed armaments minister, could do little to develop the new aircraft as their energies were directed to increasing production of existing types in response to the growing Allied offensive.

The air battles of 1943 and 1944 were fought mostly by the old types that had first flown in the mid-1930s: the Bf 109, the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Ju 88, along with the early-war origin Fw 190.|$|E
