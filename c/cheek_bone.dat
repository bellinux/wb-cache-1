5|$|Zygoma implant; a long implant {{that can}} anchor to the <b>cheek</b> <b>bone</b> by {{passing through the}} maxillary sinus to retain a {{complete}} upper denture when bone is absent. While zygomatic implants offer a novel approach to severe bone loss in the upper jaw, {{it has not been}} shown to offer any advantage over bone grafting functionally although it may offer a less invasive option, {{depending on the size of}} the reconstruction required.|$|E
5|$|P. sinensis {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} species by numerous features of the skull. Adult skulls are smaller than those of P. mongoliensis and have less teeth. Uniquely, the premaxillary bone contacts the jugal (<b>cheek)</b> <b>bone</b> {{on the outside of}} the skull. The jugals flare out sideways, forming 'horns' proportionally wider than in any other known Psittacosaurus species except P. sibiricus and P. lujiatunensis. Because of the flared cheeks, the skull is actually wider than it is long. A smaller 'horn' is present behind the eye, at the contact of the jugal and postorbital bones, a feature also seen in P. sibiricus. The mandible (lower jaw) lacks the hollow opening, or fenestra, seen in other species, and the entire lower jaw is bowed outwards, giving the animal the appearance of an underbite. The skull of an adult P. sinensis can reach 11.5centimeters (4.5in) in length.|$|E
5|$|While he had {{no desire}} to be a manager, Liddell, as a shareholder, had wanted to become a Liverpool director; however, his {{repeated}} applications to board elections were unsuccessful. He continued to play football for a magistrates' team until he decided to focus on tennis after breaking a <b>cheek</b> <b>bone.</b> In 1967, Liddell and other footballing personalities appeared in a charity match to generate funds for Bankfield House Community Centre. More than 10,000 people watched Liddell play opposite retired Hungarian international Ferenc Puskás at South Liverpool's Holly Park ground, raising £1,100 in the process. He later became chairman of Littlewoods' Spot the Ball panel and president of the Liverpool FC Supporters Club. After being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in the early 1990s, Liddell resigned from the panel on the insistence of Phyllis. His wife had first noticed atypical behaviour on a visit to Anfield following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, when he did not appear able to register what had happened in Sheffield. When his condition worsened, Liddell moved to a nursing home in Mossley Hill. He died on 3 July 2001, within a week of the deaths of former Liverpool manager Joe Fagan and director Tom Saunders.|$|E

5|$|The {{front part}} of the skull is notably broad. As in Holochilus, the {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front portion of the <b>cheek</b> <b>bone,</b> is expansive and produced into a spinous process at the anterior margin. The jugal bone is small, but less reduced than in Holochilus. The interorbital region of the skull is narrow and flanked by high beads. The incisive foramina, which perforate the palate between the incisors and the upper molars, are long, extending between the molars. The palate itself is also long, extending beyond the posterior margin of the maxillary bones, and it is perforated near the third molars by conspicuous posterolateral palatal pits. As in all oryzomyines, the squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, {{the roof of the}} tympanic cavity, but Lundomys is unusual in that the squamosal and the tegmen tympani usually overlap when viewed from the side. In the mandible, the angular and coronoid processes are less well-developed than in Holochilus. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, near the coronoid process, is small. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their anterior edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E

25|$|The forbidding of shaving {{the corners}} of the head was {{interpreted}} by the Mishnah as prohibiting the hair at the temples being cut so that the hairline was a straight line from behind the ears to the forehead; thus it was deemed necessary to retain sidelocks, leading {{to the development of a}} distinctly Jewish form of sidelock, known as payot. As for the beard, more complicated views arose; {{the corners of}} the beard were explained to refer to five extremities in the Talmud. There are many opinions in mediaeval scholars as to what these five points are. For example, it may be a point on each cheek near the temples, a point at the end of the <b>cheek</b> <b>bone</b> towards the centre of the face, and the point of the chin. Or it may be 2 on the mustache, 2 somewhere on the cheek and one on the point on the chin. As a result, Shulchan Aruch prohibits the shaving of the entire beard and mustache.|$|E

Despite this, Long was selected in the Great Britain team to compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Australia he played at scrum half in the Lions' 44-4 loss. By 2005, Long had scored 2,000 points for St Helens.
