5000|$|Gun Captain : The Gunner's Mate(s) {{responsible}} {{for maintaining the}} mount. Daily, he goes {{through a process of}} checking fluid levels, lubricating bearings, <b>cleaning</b> <b>gun</b> sights, cycling powered equipment, testing firing systems, checking gas pressures, and verifying that all the equipment that will be needed in an action is in his mount. In twin mounts, there will be a gun captain assigned to each gun assembly. The gun captain usually stands on his foot high tool box welded to the mount's deck, and offset from the gun's centerline. (See the man in black standing on the box in the MK21 open mount picture.) This places him high and aft of the rammer motor. From there, he can watch the actions of the powder-man, projectile-man, breech block, and rammer. He can verify that the gun returns to battery before the next round is loaded. If something goes wrong, he is free to move around his gun to fix the problem. He knows everybody's job, and can step in if necessary. At the mount captain's command, he manually opens the breech block before the first round is loaded, and reports if the bore is clear. [...] His duties are the same in automatic or local control.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess {{postural}} risks associated with the current gun barrel cleaning method and to develop an ergonomic gun barrel cleaning method that could reduce such risks. The inner surfaces of gun barrels should be cleaned after use to maintain their firing function. The current method of <b>cleaning</b> <b>gun</b> barrels requires multiple soldiers to push and pull a long cleaning pole for 1 &# 8211; 3 hr. Such motions require both hands to be raised to shoulder height. The current manual method and a newly designed automated method were compared in terms of safety and effectiveness. Postural risk assessments were performed using OWAS, RULA, and REBA. Results: The manual cleaning method involves the highest postural risk level (Action Category/Level 4), requiring immediate intervention, and exposes multiple soldiers to life-threatening situations for a longer time during wartime. The postural risk associated with using the automated cleaning system was much lower (Action Category/Level 2). Once loaded into the gun barrel by a single soldier, the automated system takes approximately 20 min to complete cleaning. The automated cleaning method reduces musculoskeletal disorder risks associated with <b>cleaning</b> <b>gun</b> barrels and increases military power. The automated gun barrel cleaning method is an ergonomic solution {{that can be used for}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>gun</b> barrels within a short time without exposing soldiers to postural risks...|$|E

50|$|Pre-fab huts {{were built}} at Bibra Lake for the AWAS quarters.

Many {{of them were}} from other states and had only lived in towns, and were unused to living in a semi-rural location. They were troubled by dugites, and reported never seeing Bibra Lake itself which was probably because the whole area was bushland with only a dirt-track service road.|$|R
