5000|$|The plan of {{the church}} is {{composed}} of a central nave with aisles according to a frequent plan in Romanesque architecture of Poitou. The interior has the effect of a [...] "church agora" [...] on just one plane. The barrel vault has a slightly flattened silhouette, whereas the aisles are covered with a groined vault. Outside, the aisles were covered with a terrace punt, the roof being reserved for the nave: thus there was the effect of a basilica on two levels. This silhouette disappeared with the Gothic remodelling. A deambulatory with radiating chapels developed around the church which preserved a part of its murals. A crypt of the 11th century, dug a posteriori under the choir, also preserves frescos of the time. The plan does not have transepts, for good reasons: buildings were in the north, and the principal street passes to the south. The Romanesque gate is preserved in part to the south. Cut down by this stage, one found there before the Revolution, an equestrian statue representing Constantine. This statue was the counterpart of another, older statue destroyed by the Huguenots in 1562. It is not known if the identity of the first rider had been the same. Behind this statue, on the ground, a small vault dedicated to Saint Katherine was referred to during the Middle Ages. The bell-tower dates from the 11th century. In the beginning it was much more obvious: the first level is concealed today by the roofs.

Seaweb technology utilizes the commercially available telesonar modems {{that has developed}} link and network layer firmware to provide a robust undersea communication capability. Seaweb interconnects the underwater nodes through digital signal processing-based modem by using acoustic links between the neighboring sensors.

This protocol uses the range data and planar trigonometry principles to estimate {{the positions of the}} underwater sensor nodes. Moreover, for precise localization, we consider more realistic conditions namely, (a) small displacement of sensor nodes due to watch circles and (b) deployment of sensor nodes over non-uniform water surface. Once the nodes are localized, we divide the whole network field into <b>circular</b> <b>levels</b> and sectors to minimize the traffic complexity and thereby increases the lifetime of the sensor nodes in the network field.

40|$|X-linked {{lymphoproliferative}} disease (XLP) {{is characterized by}} abnormal im-mune responses to Epstein-Barr virus attributed to inactivating mutations of the SAP gene. Previous studies showed im-munoglobulin E (IgE) deficiency and low serum IgG levels in Sap-deficient mice before and after viral infections, which are associated with impaired CD 4 T-helper function. In the present work, we find that signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) –associated protein (SAP) is expressed in B cells and this expression is down-regulated after stimu-lation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin 4 (IL- 4). We demonstrate that B cells from Sap-deficient mice exhibit reduced IgG and IgA production in vitro.

If CP Tuc was a polar, as has been suggested, then the length of such a dip would make it unique amongst polars since in those polars in which a dip is seen in hard X-rays the dip lasts for only 0. 1 of the orbit.

The energy dependence of the dip is due to a combination of this self-eclipse and also the presence of an X-ray temperature gradient over the primary accretion region.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that the previously cloned type I duck interferon (DuIFN) cDNA encodes a homologue of mammalian interferon-alpha (IFN-α). Recombinant DuIFN-α {{was used to}} study the inhibition of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) replication in primary hepatocytes {{in order to determine}} the IFN-sensitive steps of the virus replication cycle. IFN-treated cells accumulated two- to threefold-lower amounts of viral RNA transcripts early during infection, when IFN was added before virus. This reduction was not due to inhibition of virus entry since initial covalently closed <b>circular</b> DNA <b>levels</b> were not decreased in IFN-treated cells. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of IFN on viral RNA levels was not observed in cells infected with a mutant DHBV that fails to synthesize core protein, suggesting that an uncharacterized core protein-mediated enhancing effect is blocked by IFN. When IFN was added at 4 days postinfection, encapsidated viral RNA pregenomes disappeared from infected cells within 3 days. This depletion was not simply due to conversion of pregenomes to DNA since depletion was not blocked by phosphonoformic acid, an inhibitor of the viral reverse transcriptase. The intracellular concentration of intact nucleocapsids was reduced, suggesting that in the presence of IFN pregenome-containing capsids were selectively depleted in hepatocytes. Thus, two steps in DHBV replication that involve the viral core protein were inhibited by DuIFN-α...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis due to {{hepatitis}} B virus reactivation after cytotoxic or {{immunosuppressive therapy}} {{is a serious}} cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. With the characterization of the underlying pathogenesis, much progress {{in the management of}} this important clinical problem has been made in the past 2 decades. By year 2008, it is mandatory to screen for hepatitis B surface antigen status before initiating intensive chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy. All those who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive should be started on preemptive nucleos(t) ide analogues. However, there remains important issues, such as the type and duration of nucleos(t) ide analogue therapy, which need to be understood. As not all hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients will suffer from HBV reactivation, it is therefore useful to identify risk factors related to HBV reactivation so that patients will not be treated unnecessarily with nucleos(t) ide analogues. To date, a high baseline level of viral replication, as reflected by high serum HBV DNA level, positive serum hepatitis B e antigen, and a high intrahepatic covalently closed <b>circular</b> DNA <b>level,</b> is the most important predictor for HBV reactivation.
