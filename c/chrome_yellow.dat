5|$|Since the Middle Ages, lead(II) nitrate {{has been}} {{produced}} as a {{raw material for}} the production of coloured pigments in lead paints, such as <b>chrome</b> <b>yellow</b> (lead(II) chromate), chrome orange (lead(II) hydroxide chromate) and similar lead compounds. These pigments were used for dyeing and printing calico and other textiles.|$|E
5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, <b>chrome</b> <b>yellow</b> was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of <b>chrome</b> <b>yellow</b> declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and <b>chrome</b> <b>yellow,</b> while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

30|$|To {{explain this}} difference, we {{examined}} the sulfur content of the yellow and orange paints as revealed by Raman spectroscopy. Recent investigations {{have found that the}} darkening of <b>chrome</b> <b>yellows</b> also depends on the chemical composition (PbCr 1 −xSxO 4) and crystalline structure (monoclinic or orthorhombic) of the material [22 – 24]. Sulfur-rich orthorhombic forms are more susceptible to browning. It has been postulated that PbCrO 4 and PbCr 1 −xSxO 4 are more soluble when in the orthorhombic phase, and thus more chromate ions are available for redox reactions [25].|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the effects of bead colour and sheen on the {{consolidation}} of one-trial passive avoidance learning tasks in day-old chicks. Laboratories have adopted a variety of training procedures using beads of varying sizes, colours and textures. We were interested in whether beads with aposematic colouration (bright 'warning' colouration) would alter memory consolidation of the weaker form (10 %MeA) of passive avoidance learning in chicks. Thus, day-old chicks were trained and tested using the standard Open University, UK protocol on the 'weaker' form of the task, but using beads that were <b>chrome,</b> black, <b>yellow</b> or black-and-yellow stripes. Chicks tested 24 hr following training with either <b>chrome,</b> black or <b>yellow</b> beads showed no avoidance of the training bead, whereas chicks trained on the black and yellow striped bead showed high levels of avoidance (and significant discrimination ratios) at test. These data, together with data from experiments in which chicks were all trained with the black-and-yellow striped bead and tested with either a black, <b>yellow,</b> <b>chrome</b> or black-and-yellow striped bead suggest that bead colouration, specifically aposematism, is a significant factor in the salience and thus recall of this task.

40|$|This study {{discuss the}} {{problems}} of displaying artworks containing <b>yellow</b> <b>chrome</b> pigments, reactive to the wavelengths in LED lights, often used in modern exhibitions. In the late 19 th century there where a variety of chrome pigments manufactured, such as lead chromate (PbCrO 4) and lead chromate mixed with lead sulphate (PbCrO 4 · PbSO 4). Studies have found that lead chromates with high content of sulphate and/or a certain crystal structure, tends to darken when exposed to light with short wavelengths. The main purpose has been to analyze two yellow paint samples from Vincent van Gogh’s Olive groove, Saint-Rémy - 1889, in Gothenburg art museum’s collection. Analysis with Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) confirmed {{the presence of a}} lead chromate, probably mixed with zinc white (ZnO). No complete characterization of potential sulphate content in the pigment could be made. The lack of sulphur in parts of the samples {{and the fact that the}} paint after 134 years in various lighting conditions still remain bright yellow, may indicate that it is not one of the most reactive type of lead chromates. As a supplement a series of oil colours containing <b>yellow</b> <b>chrome</b> pigments was made and artificially aged for 8 400 000 lx h, with a halogen spotlight and a “warm white” LED spotlight. The experiment simulated c. 19 / 25 years of exposure with 200 / 150 lux, with respect to the museums annual open hours. The lead chromates change in colour while a zinc chromate din not. The LED light caused no more darkening of this sulphur containing lead chromate, than the halogen light. As this experiment simulated exposure for a relatively short period of time with only one sulphur containing lead chromate, the reports on the potential danger of LED lights should not be neglected.

50|$|However {{the most}} damning {{evidence}} {{was linked to}} the effects on the workers’ health. Safety regulations introduced in 1893 had been ignored, and ineffective protective equipment in unventilated sheds left the employees exposed to the harmful chemical dust at all times. In the short term this led to widespread perforation of the septum in their noses and ‘chrome holes’ (ulcerations burnt into the flesh), as well as lung cancer, digestive disorders and skin diseases over longer periods. The exact number of workers affected is unknown due to unreliable figures and reluctance among authorities of the time to acknowledge and document any direct link between the chrome dust and the health dangers. The exposure to the dust was such that the workers were referred to locally as ‘White’s Dead Men’ or ‘White’s Canaries’ due to their bleached faces and <b>yellow</b> <b>chrome</b> dust-covered clothing. The pamphlets proved very popular and exposed the conditions at Whites works to the wider public. Another Glasgow tycoon of the day Thomas Lipton received similar treatment from Hardie in response to practices at his facilities.|$|R

[...] Rich colors such as <b>chrome</b> <b>yellow</b> and Turkey red became popular, and fabrics with large bold checkerboard or plaid patterns became fashionable, (another contrast with the previous fashion period, which had favored small delicate pastel prints).

30|$|XRF {{analysis}} performed in situ with portable instrument {{showed that the}} leaf adhered to the surface is composed of gold, copper, silver and zinc. The percentages of the different metals indicate the presence of two groups of alloys most likely used during two different steps of construction and/or restorations or due to small differences in the gold alloys. The XRF portable equipment provided important information about the external layers of the polychrome (not only about the gilding layer). However, chemical distribution of different layers showed difficulties. Obtaining information about the composition of all the layers of the gilding was necessary to perform the study by XRD. The XRD experiments performed on a fragment showed that a layer of lead chromate followed by a layer of gypsum were present under the gold. The lead chromate also contained {{a small portion of}} lead sulphate oxide. This pigment (lead chromate, <b>yellow</b> <b>chrome)</b> was used either as the mordant, in addition to linseed oil, under the gold layer or as false gold. The presence of this pigment in the gilding was only previously reported once in the literature. The portable XRF and XRD did not give information about the black paintings located on the golden layer. The μ-Raman and SEM-EDX analyses confirmed the presence of black carbon and ivory black because P was also detected. The presence of linseed oil was confirmed by mass spectrometry and FTIR.|$|R
30|$|Prussian blue is {{the primary}} blue pigment in both paintings. As stated above, very small amounts of {{vermilion}} red were found uniformly mixed into all Prussian hues. <b>Chrome</b> or cadmium <b>yellow</b> particles are also found mixed into Prussian blue paint in some samples (sample X 2, X 14). In the hidden portrait, Prussian blue is mixed with a carbon-based black (see, for example, sample X 7, layer 2). The dark blue color resulting from the mixture can be seen where a loss in the surface paint layers exposes the underlying paint near the sitter’s right elbow (see detail, Fig.  3 c). Carbon-based black, mixed with Prussian blue in sample X 4 and used pure in sample X 6, layer 3, was identified as bone black due to the detection of calcium and phosphorus by SEM-EDX analysis. In another sample—X 1, layer 6 —µFT-IR spectra identifies barium sulfate mixed with black (see Additional file 4 : Table S 4). A small but sharp peak around 985  cm− 1 is indicative of barium sulfate, although the combination of pigments appears to create a broad peak from 1250 to 900  cm− 1 which masks adjacent barium sulfate peaks. While corresponding peaks at ~ 1100  cm− 1 and between ~ 1400 and 1750  cm− 1 in the sample suggest bone black, a smaller peak at ~ 2150  cm− 1 is shifted {{too far from the}} standard for a positive assignment in this sample.|$|R
40|$|The use of Hyper-Spectral Imaging (HSI) as a {{diagnostic}} {{tool in the}} field of cultural heritage is of great interest presenting high potentialities, being non-destructive, non-invasive and portable. The obtained 2 D information (i. e. one spectrum for each pixel of the target image) can be thus used to characterize, map and monitor the materials constituting and artefacts of cultural interest.

The adoption of HSI techniques allows the acquisition of the spectra without a direct physical contact and/or sampling of material objects under investigations. This research is addressed {{to the development of a}} methodology to classify different pigments through HSI.

The obtained products were then applied on two different supports (i. e. canvas and wood) in order to obtain different combinations of pigment/support. The spectral changes of each pigment, according to the different supports, were preliminary evaluated with reference to the spectrum of the original powder pigment. The study was then addressed to verify, according to the information acquired in the different wavelength regions, the correlation existing between collected spectral signatures and sample characteristics related to the different utilized pigments, binders and supports. The resulting reference samples were acquired by HSI in the SWIR (1000 - 2500 nm) wavelength range. Data were processed adopting a chemometric approach based on the PLS_Toolbox (Version 7. 8, Eigenvector Research, Inc.) running inside Matlab® (Version 7. 5, The Mathworks, Inc.). The following chemometric methods were applied: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for exploratory data approach and Partial Least Square- Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) to build classification models.

6000|$|Among {{the social}} {{problems}} {{of the nineteenth century}} the tramp has always held an important position, but his appearance among the nineteenth-century poets is extremely remarkable.

It is entitled Low Down, by Two Tramps, and is marvellous even to look at. It is clear that art has at last reached the criminal classes.

As the painters are always pilfering from the poets, why should not the poet annex the domain of the painter and use colour for the expression of his moods and music: blue for sentiment, and red for passion, grey for cultured melancholy, and green for descriptions? The book, then, is a kind of miniature rainbow, and with all its varied sheets is as lovely as an advertisement hoarding. As for the peripatetics--alas! they are not nightingales.
