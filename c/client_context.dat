40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} call a {{context-aware}} service, a service requester has to reveal his contextual information to a service provider or a context manager, which may jeopardize his privacy and security. Moreover, if the <b>client's</b> <b>context</b> changes over time, a context-aware web service must be called frequently with the updated context values. In this paper, we propose a service customizer agent at the client's side and a service provider that generates general service responses and service customization knowledge. The customizer agent uses the knowledge to personalize the general service response based on the <b>client's</b> <b>context.</b> In addition to offering innovative context-aware services, the proposed approach improves the privacy and security features of web services...|$|R

Therefore, the design of scalable video distribution systems that on the one hand, improve the end-users experience and deal with theirs context heterogeneity and on the other hand, optimize the cost of these services, is becoming a very important and challenging issue. One common approach for this purpose is the server replication. Nevertheless, this approach brings new issues such as the server selection (how to direct the user request to the closest replica), the servers' placement, etc. This paper deals with the server selection issue. Thus, we present a two-level filtering based server selection.

It is also about the transition between the physical and the digital when interacting with those artefacts. Adding a digital layer allows us to pair static artefacts (like products) with dynamic experiences (like services). This opens up for countless opportunities for product-service systems that help people in completely new ways. As a development of the internet IoT is a techno-social phenomenon {{that has the potential}} to reveal and help to solve large-scale problems that are created by our connected lifestyle. More companies than ever are creating connected product-service systems mostly to disrupt the market. This inspires people across companies from R&D to CEO level to explore the new market sector. However it is difficult to talk about abstract connections between things and user experiences that don’t exist yet.   FACETS is designed to be a supporting tool for the design and innovation consultancy Veryday and other designers to approach the topic of IoT together with their (to be) client. The toolkit consists of four box-like modules to be used in different phases of a client meeting. Here the toolkit in a nutshell: 0.

40|$|Abstract. Software {{has jumped}} “out {{of the box}} ” – it {{controls}} critical systems, pervades business and commerce, and infuses entertainment, communication, and other everyday activities. These applications are constrained not only by traditional capability and performance considerations but also by economic, business, market and policy issues and the context of intended use. The diversity of applications requires adaptability in responding to client needs, and the diversity of <b>clients</b> and <b>contexts</b> requires the ability to discriminate among criteria for success. As a result, software designers must also {{get out of their}} boxes: in addition to mastering classical software development skills, they must master the contextual issues that discriminate good solutions from merely competent ones. Current software engineering education, however, remains largely “in the box”: it neglects the rich fabric of issues that lie between the client’s problem and actual software development. At Carnegie Mellon we address this major shortcoming by teaching students to understand both the capabilities required by the client and the constraints imposed by the <b>client’s</b> <b>context.</b> 1 The Changing Face of Software Software intensive systems have become essential to everyday activity and business in the global economy. Not only is public dependence on software increasing, but in addition the character of the software itself is changing – and with it the demands on the software developers.

The aim was to find out more information about the different types of Indian indigenous interventions that may currently be used by these professionals. The study also bridges the gap in the literature about the lack of research on the practical uses and applications of Indian indigenous counselling skills in the UK. The study reports data from six face-to-face open-ended semi-structured interviews with Indian counsellors who have been trained in Western psychotherapeutic approaches and have knowledge of Indian psychotherapeutic approaches. The research was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Firstly, the analysis concluded the use of several Indian indigenous interventions used by the participants, such as Prekshadhyan which can be used for psychosomatic pain relief, Jain virtue of forgiveness which can be useful for working with sexual abuse, use of spirituality and cultural beliefs for bereavement, and so on. Secondly, the analysis identified some of the most common barriers to therapy (e. g. stigmas and taboos) experienced by Indian clients in the UK, and it provided suggestions on how to overcome these. Finally, the analysis suggested factors that therapists should pay attention to (e. g. <b>client</b> <b>context</b> and use of Indian languages) in order to maximise Indian clients’ engagement in therapy and to minimise their exclusion from it...|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{the nature}} of courage has long been debated, it is only more {{recently}} that the psychology of courage has received attention. Although it is acknowledged that therapeutic courage informs counselling and psychotherapy, it is an underresearched and little understood phenomenon. This research sought to investigate {{the nature of}} therapeutic courage in a qualitative phenomenological study from the dual perspective of counsellors' personal therapy and their clinical practice. Semistructured {{interviews were conducted with}} four counsellors and psychotherapists and the study was evaluated using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Three master themes were established: 1) Courage as the nexus of therapy; 2) The synergy of courage in the therapeutic dynamic and 3) Protecting and enhancing the profession. Therapeutic courage was identified as a fundamental element informing all therapeutic endeavours and its nature was described as a mosaic of psychological, moral, creative and embodied courage for both client and therapist. Therapeutic courage was characterized as a conscious choice and action in the face of fear and as a catalyst to change, albeit with ambiguous qualities. The therapeutic process was shown to demand courage of client and therapist experienced intrapersonally and interpersonally within the therapeutic relationship, where the symbiosis of courage and safety was required for therapeutic growth. Therapist courage was shown to facilitate ethical practice and enable client courage. A range of client courage was identified through the client's tenacity in processing fear, choice, loss and reality. Multiple levels of therapeutic courage were shown to manifest in depth therapy, pivotal moments, <b>client</b> <b>context,</b> liminal thresholds and ethical practice. The findings emphasized the value of therapists' personal therapy in generating a cyclical relationship between experiencing therapeutic courage as a client and in developing an empathic, compassionate presence as a therapist. The findings also revealed potential gaps in contemporary counselling and psychotherapeutic training in relation to therapeutic courage, ethical decision-making and organizational context. The findings confer implications for clinical practice in understanding therapeutic courage through the micro-processes in therapy to the macro level of the professional at large. These findings support extant research, but also provide fresh interpretations and many opportunities for future research...|$|E
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) This thesis investigates if {{clients of}} {{management}} consulting interventions {{can be identified}} {{by the way the}} client organisation makes and enacts strategy, that it, the client's strategic posture. The developed typology identified four types of clients: proactive, interactive, reactive and crisis type clients. The client typology provides a method for identifying clients and formed the theoretical framework for the research. The typology also provides a means to investigate if the consulting intervention process is adapted for each of the client types. A review of the consulting intervention process steps is performed and the style of consulting used by the interventionist consultants to identify adaptation of the consulting intervention process to context of the <b>client.</b> <b>Context</b> of the client that inhibit the consulting intervention process are identified and if clients evolve in their strategic posture during a consulting intervention. A selection of ten management consultants from the Institute of Management Consultants (IMC) using a qualitative case research method provided eighteen cases to compare and contrast the four client types. A case research interview protocol developed using the steps in the consulting literature provided the basis for within case and across case analysis which investigated seven propositions developed for the research. The findings derived from the analysis make contributions to management consulting intervention knowledge and practice. The research provided empirical support for the use of strategic posture of the client as a method to identify types of consulting clients, adaptation of consulting intervention processes and styles for types of consulting clients. The research also provides partial explanation for the catalytic effect and pervasiveness of management consultants in all levels of business and government, particularly in decision making and strategy formation of consulting clients. Preferred styles of consulting for each client type are empirically supported. Adaptation of the preferred style of consulting as the client evolves in their strategic posture during a consulting intervention and the use of concurrency of the consulting intervention process steps to adapt the intervention process add to the body of knowledge and practice methods of management consulting...|$|E

40|$|Managing {{relationship}} {{capital in}} organisations {{may be seen}} as the only form of long-term strategic competitive advantage, since community-based relationships facilitate the exchange and creation of knowledge. Viewing knowledge as something that is socially constructed and inseparable from the communities of practice in which it is held is an alternative paradigm to the codification and storage strategy for knowledge management. Through a case study examination of consultants, a process-based model of the interpersonal knowledge exchange steps that take place was developed and is presented. By focusing on payload knowledge (a concept that emerged from the research data as comprising the mix of tacit and explicit knowledge required to solve problems for clients), the interpersonal knowledge exchange process is shown to be predicable in terms of passing through eight identifiable stages, yet unpredictable in terms of knowing how each community interaction will lead to payload knowledge. In this model, the process of sourcing, handover and implementation of payload knowledge is seen to be an artistic endeavour, characterised by social community based exchanges that hop the consultants toward their specific contextual need. A key advantage of the interpersonal process described is the decontextualisation and recontextualisation process that is carried out at both the request negotiation stage and the knowledge handover stage of the process. This process uses the community's shared language, mental models, social etiquette and cultural norms to compress and funnel the meaning of the knowledge into a form that can be transferred meaningfully to the requesting consultant (payload knowledge). Consultants prefer this interpersonal process primarily because the decontextualisation and recontextualisation process allows them to exchange payload knowledge that is directly and specifically relevant to their current <b>client</b> <b>context</b> and to the problems they need to solve. The process saves consultants time, and provides an opportunity to confirm their personal knowledge as up-to-date and relevant to the specific context. By using the interpersonal process, consultants abide by the community's social etiquette, which dictates an interpersonal process as the preferred exchange mechanism. The interpersonal process allows them to practice and learn the consulting community's professional artistry and, in the process, enjoy the exchange experiences. Through understanding the process and the reasons that consultants prefer the interpersonal knowledge exchange process, it is anticipated that managers will be better able to produce a knowledge-based sustainable competitive advantage for their firms based through improved relationship capital...|$|E

The Solar Decathlon is an international initiative and University competition sponsored by the U. S. Department of Energy, designed to stimulate research, industry and education to advance renewable energy technologies, with a specific focus on building-integrated photovoltaics. Now entering its fourth cycle, the Decathlon provides a unique opportunity to envision, fabricate and test the possibilities of highly efficient modern dwellings. Our team of architecture and engineering faculty and students under the direction of Professor Michael Garrison, Professor Samantha Randall, Professor Atila Novoselac, and Lecturer Russell Krepart constructed a completely stand-alone solar-powered home that serves as a catalyst for change, leading the residential housing industry toward more sustainable practices while addressing the need for well designed, appropriately diverse, economically viable, and environmentally responsible housing. Through use of solar power and energy efficient design, this project offers homeowners the means to directly participate in the energy economy, moving from energy consumers to energy producers. The Solar Decathlon completion occurs every two years and is run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which requires a portable structure of a fairly modest scale, with a dual prescription for both exhibition and inhabitation.
