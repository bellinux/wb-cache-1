DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Separating wood constituents from gases produced during wood processing comprises intensively contacting the <b>crude</b> <b>gas</b> produced from the wood processing {{at more than}} 40 deg. C and more than 0. 5 bar with a liquid to produce a material exchange between a gas a liquid phase which leads to an enrichment of resins, organic acids and dust particles in the liquid phase 1 (I); cooling the partially purified <b>crude</b> <b>gas</b> by a temperature difference of more than 10 deg. C with simultaneous condensation of the contents still in the <b>crude</b> <b>gas</b> to form a liquid phase 2 (II) consisting of water and different wood constituents such as materials of the substance groups terpene, methanol, ethanol and carboxylic acid present in dissolved form or as floating emulsified phase; and removing the terpenes and the floating phase from the liquid phase 2 (II) to leave a low charged water phase (fraction 3). An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for carrying out the process comprising a first stage (1) formed by a scrubbing column (4) with a cooling and/or heating sump (5) for the mixing and the material exchange of the gas phase formed by the <b>crude</b> <b>gas</b> and a liquid phase, and a circulating system for the liquid phase, and {{a connection to the}} circulating system to deviate a partial stream; a second stage (2) formed by a condenser (7) for cooling the partially purified <b>crude</b> <b>gas</b> with simultaneous condensation of condensable gas constituents, and a cooling container (8) for collecting the condensate with a run-off for the liquid phase and a gas outlet for the pure gas; and a third stage (3) formed as a cooling light material separator for removing terpenes from the liquid phase 2 (II). Preferred Features: The water phase (fraction 3) is worked up using a biological process, a membrane process, electrodialysis, wet oxidation or chemical oxidation. USE - Used for separating wood constituents from gases produced during wood processing. ADVANTAGE - The process is economical and is environmentally friendly...|$|R

Es wurden alle notwendigen reaktionskinetischen Basisdaten zur Auslegung einer katalytischen Rohgasaufbereitung erarbeitet, d. h. die entsprechenden systematischen kinetischen Untersuchungen in laborapparaturen durchgefuehrt. Anschliessend wurde auf der Basis dieser Daten ein technischer Reaktor zur chemischen Aufbereitung von Rohgasen aus der Verkokung und Vergasung fester Brennstoffe modelliert, um den maximalen Durchsatz zu bestimmen.

The gas through the separator can not be totally liquefied due to the special working mechanism of the separator. A novel liquefaction process with a supersonic swirling separator is presented and simulated. The process can liquefy all the <b>crude</b> <b>gas</b> by re-cycling the gas which is not liquefied at the outlet of the separator. The simulations show it can get relatively high energy efficiency and could be competitive in many cases...|$|R
