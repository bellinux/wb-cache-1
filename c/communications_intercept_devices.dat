5000|$|Special Intelligence (SI): Special Intelligence (so in the CAPCO manual, {{but always}} SI in {{document}} markings) is {{the control system}} covering communications intelligence. Special Intelligence is a term for <b>communications</b> <b>intercepts.</b> The previous title for this control system was COMINT, but this was deprecated in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Martin and Mitchell {{became friends}} during their Navy {{service at the}} Naval <b>communications</b> <b>intercept</b> {{facility}} at Kami Seya, Japan. They kept in touch as each returned to school after their Navy service and encountered one another again when each was recruited into the National Security Agency (NSA) in 1957.|$|R
50|$|Counterintelligence {{is a great}} {{challenge}} with the security of cell-based systems, since the ideal, but nearly impossible, goal is to obtain a clandestine source within the cell. Financial tracking can play a role, as can <b>communications</b> <b>intercept,</b> but both of these approaches need to be balanced against legitimate expectations of privacy.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, former Ontario lieutenant-governor, James Bartleman, {{testified at}} the Air India Inquiry on May 3 {{that he saw}} a CSE <b>communications</b> <b>intercept</b> warning of the June 22, 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182 before it occurred.

50|$|In 1987, {{a single}} Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Atlanique was {{operated}} by France as an airborne headquarters during Opération Épervier, the French intervention against Libyan military units {{which had been}} deployed into neighbouring Chad. <b>Communications</b> <b>intercepted</b> by the Atlantique were immediately decoded and translated before being used to conduct strikes upon Libyan forces with greater accuracy.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of 7 December 1941, the U.S. Navy <b>communications</b> <b>intercept</b> station at Fort Ward on Bainbridge Island, Washington, picked up a radio message being sent by the Japanese {{government}} to the Japanese embassy in Washington, D.C. It was the last in a series of 14 messages that had been sent over the previous 18 hours.|$|R
50|$|In April 1984, Libyan {{refugees}} in London protested against execution of two dissidents. <b>Communications</b> <b>intercepted</b> by MI5 show that Tripoli ordered its diplomats to direct {{violence against the}} demonstrators. Libyan diplomats shot at 11 people and killed British policewoman Yvonne Fletcher. The incident led to the breaking off of diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Libya for over a decade.|$|R

50|$|Ideal {{protection}} {{begins with}} nonproliferation treaties {{such as the}} Chemical Weapons Convention, and detecting, very early, the signatures of someone building a chemical weapons capability.

5000|$|The Bild am Sonntag {{newspaper}} subsequently {{reported that}} German intelligence indicated that Assad had likely not ordered the attacks. According to Bild, [...] "intelligence interception specialists" [...] relying on <b>communications</b> <b>intercepted</b> by the German vessel Oker said that Syrian military commanders had repeatedly been asking permission to launch chemical attacks for around four months, with permission always being denied from the presidential palace. The sources concluded that 21 August attack had probably not {{been approved by}} Bashar al-Assad.|$|R

500|$|On September 7, Japan and the United States jointly {{released}} {{a transcript of}} Soviet <b>communications,</b> <b>intercepted</b> by the listening post at Wakkanai, to an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council.

The move was seen by the Soviet leadership as confirmation of the West's bad intentions.|$|R

The nature of the RFI and the urgency placed on it may indicate that some collection types are unsuitable due to the time taken to collect or validate the information gathered. Intelligence gathering disciplines and the sources and methods used are often highly classified and compartmentalised, with analysts requiring an appropriate high level of security clearance.|$|R

50|$|World War II {{commenced}} {{before the}} station was completed. Newman was promoted to Commander and assigned to command the Harman facility from when it opened until 1941, when he was replaced as Officer-in-Charge. The station was commissioned into the RAN as the stone frigate HMAS Harman on 1 July 1943. Harman provided radio coverage of the Pacific Ocean during the war, and provided <b>communications</b> <b>intercepts</b> for the FRUMEL signals intelligence unit. Women of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS), formed in 1941, operated the equipment.|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} of the stored beam energy in future particle accelerators, such as the HL-LHC and the FCC, calls for a radical upgrade in the design, materials and instrumentation of Beam <b>Intercepting</b> <b>Devices</b> (BID), such as collimators Following successful tests in 2015 that validated new composite materials and a novel jaw design conceived for the HL-LHC collimators, a new HiRadMat experiment, named “HRMT 36 -MultiMat”, is scheduled for autumn 2017. Its objective {{is to determine the}} behaviour under high intensity proton beams of a broad range of materials relevant for collimators and beam <b>intercepting</b> <b>devices,</b> thin-film coatings and advanced equipment. The test bench features 16 separate target stations, each hosting various specimens, allowing the exploration of complex phenomena such as dynamic strength, internal damping, nonlinearities due to anisotropic inelasticity and inhomogeneity, effects of energy deposition and radiation on coatings. This paper details the main technical solutions and engineering calculations for the design of the test bench and of the specimens, the candidate target materials and the instrumentation system...|$|R
50|$|Throughout the war, foreign radio {{messages}} were being intercepted by Canadian Army, Navy (RCN), Air Force (RCAF) and Department of Transport (DOT) Radio Division stations, located {{in places such}} as Forest (and later Winnipeg), Manitoba and, Point Grey, British Columbia. Following the collapse of France in 1940 for example, the RCN continued to monitor French naval frequencies at Britain’s request {{in order to determine the}} fate of the French fleet. German <b>communications</b> <b>intercepted</b> by the Canadians also “helped the British in mounting” their “successful attack on” the famous battle-cruiser “Bismarck“ in May 1941.|$|R

40|$|This {{analysis}} considers outputs {{produced by}} Title III electronic wiretaps. Based on 1987 - 2005 data, wiretap productivity is assessed {{by examining the}} number of wiretaps, places wiretaps are installed, numbers of people whose <b>communications</b> are <b>intercepted,</b> the number of <b>intercepted</b> <b>communications,</b> the number of communications labeled incriminating, the arrests and convictions linked to wiretaps, and the relationships among arrests and convictions. Wiretapping is focused mostly on narcotics violations. The numbers of people, interceptions, and incriminating interceptions increased. One-fifth of <b>intercepted</b> <b>communications</b> were classified as incriminating. Incriminating information is linked to arrests and convictions that unfold over time. The more people intercepted, the more arrests result, but convictions decline over time. Arrests are driven {{by the number of}} intercepted persons. Convictions are driven by the number of incriminating interceptions. Two simultaneous but opposing operations were in place by 2005 : big increases in the number of <b>intercepted</b> <b>communications</b> in 2003 through 2005; and by 2005, overall declines in the measured productivity of wiretaps. ...|$|R
