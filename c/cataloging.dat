5|$|As {{a result}} of a new {{emphasis}} on observing, classifying, and <b>cataloging</b> nature, 16th century natural philosophers in Europe began to establish extensive collections of fossil objects (as well as collections of plant and animal specimens), which were often stored in specially built cabinets to help organize them. Conrad Gesner published a 1565 work on fossils that contained one of the first detailed descriptions of such a cabinet and collection. The collection belonged to a member of the extensive network of correspondents that Gesner drew on for his works. Such informal correspondence networks among natural philosophers and collectors became increasingly important {{during the course of the}} 16th century and were direct forerunners of the scientific societies that would begin to form in the 17th century. These cabinet collections and correspondence networks played an important role in the development of natural philosophy.|$|E
5|$|These {{features}} were absent from earlier Sumerian excavations. Sophisticated techniques of arrangement of texts, coupled with their composition, evidence the great antiquity of archival and library practices, {{which may be}} far older than {{was assumed to be}} the case before the discovery of the Ebla library. A sizable portion of the tablets contain literary and lexicographic texts; evidence seems to suggest the collection also served—at least partially—as a true library rather than a collection of archives intended solely for use by the kings, their ministers, and their bureaucracy. The tablets show evidence of the early transcription of texts into foreign languages and scripts, classification and <b>cataloging</b> for easier retrieval, and arrangement by size, form and content. The Ebla tablets have thus provided scholars with new insights into the origin of library practices that were in use 4,500 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Henry Edwards {{was born}} to Hannah and Thomas Edwards (c. 1794 – 1857) at Brook House in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, England, on August 27, 1827, and was christened on September 14. From his older brother William, he picked up an {{interest}} in examining insects. He collected butterflies as a hobby, and studied them {{under the tutelage of}} Edward Doubleday. His solicitor father intended a law career for his son, but after a brief period of unsuccessful study, Edwards took a position at a counting house in London, and began acting in amateur theater. He then journeyed to join his brother William who had settled in Australia, nine miles (14km) north-west of Melbourne along the bank of Merri Creek, a location then called Merrivale. Aboard the sailing ship Ganges from March to June 1853, he wrote descriptions of creatures such as the albatross that he encountered for the first time. After arriving in Melbourne, Edwards began collecting and <b>cataloging</b> the insects he found on his brother's land, and further afield. Within two years, he had gathered 1,676 species of insects, shot and mounted 200 birds, and pressed some 200 botanical specimens. This collection and that of William Kershaw were purchased by Frederick McCoy to form the nucleus of the new National Museum of Victoria.|$|E

5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months <b>cataloging</b> the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E
5|$|With {{all of the}} {{evidence}} of the Bay Harbor Butcher murders pointing to Doakes as the killer, the case is closed. Forensic investigator Vince Masuka (C. S. Lee) tells Dexter the gas in the cabin was turned on while the stove was lit, and when Dexter sees his own satellite navigation system while <b>cataloging</b> evidence, he realizes that Lila must have found the cabin. He meets with her at the aquarium and tells her that he, like her, has no emotion and lives a life devoid of feeling. They form plans to leave Miami together, though Dexter secretly intends to kill her. When he visits her apartment the next day, though, he finds Debra there, trying to persuade Lila to leave town. Dexter is forced to lie about running away with Lila in front of Debra, so a hurt Lila then leaves with what she recognizes as Dexter's bag of murder equipment. She goes to Rita's house and drugs the babysitter so that she can abduct the children, Astor and Cody (Christina Robinson and Preston Bailey). When Dexter realizes that Astor and Cody are missing, he goes straight to Lila's apartment, where she lights another fire and locks the three of them inside. Rita calls Debra for her help, and Debra decides to skip her flight to Oregon with Lundy to help with finding the children. Dexter manages to free Astor and Cody through a small window and eventually rams down a thin wall allowing him to escape.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Electronic <b>catalogs</b> (or e-catalogs), {{like their}} printed counter-parts, hold {{information}} about {{the goods and services}} offered or requested by the market participants and, consequently, form the basis of the in-formation phase of electronic commerce. As electronic malls as well as e-catalogs made by each of them rapidly increase in number, there are some emerging problems in dealing with e-catalogs such as the <b>catalog</b> heterogeneity and the redundant investment in the making of <b>catalogs.</b> In this paper, to achieve <b>catalog</b> interoperability and <b>catalog</b> sharing, we propose an extended <b>catalog</b> model of e-catalogs and present a view-integrated architecture for an electronic <b>catalog</b> library, named Cata-logStop.
