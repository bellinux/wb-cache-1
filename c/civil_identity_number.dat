40|$|Introduction: There is {{uncertainty}} {{regarding the}} completeness of death recording by civil registration and by health centres in South Africa. This paper aims to compare death recording {{by the two}} systems, in cohorts of South African patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART). Methods: Completeness of death recording was estimated using a capture–recapture approach. Six ART programmes linked their patient record systems to the vital registration system using <b>civil</b> <b>identity</b> document (ID) <b>numbers</b> and provided data comparing the outcomes recorded in patient files and in the vital registration. Patients were excluded if they had missing/invalid IDs or had transferred to other ART programmes. Results: After exclusions, 91, 548 patient records were included. Of deaths recorded in patients files after 2003, 94. 0 % (95 % CI: 93. 3 – 94. 6 %) were recorded by civil registration, with completeness being significantly higher in urban areas, older adults and females. Of deaths recorded by civil registration after 2003, only 35. 0 % (95 % CI: 34. 2 – 35. 8 %) were recorded in patient files, with this proportion dropping from 60 % in 2004 – 2005 to 30 % in 2010 and subsequent years. Recording of deaths in patient files was significantly higher in children and in locations within 50 km of the health centre. When {{the information from the}} two systems was combined, an estimated 96. 2 % of all deaths were recorded (93. 5 % in children and 96. 2 % in adults). Conclusions: South Africa's civil registration system has achieved a high level of completeness in the recording of mortality. However, the fraction of deaths recorded by health centres is low and information from patient records is insufficient by itself to evaluate levels and predictors of ART patient mortality. Previously documented improvements in ART mortality over time may be biased if based only on data from patient records...|$|R

50|$|People {{who have}} no Swedish {{personal}} <b>identity</b> <b>number</b> can receive a co-ordination number (samordningsnummer) instead. It is issued by the Tax Agency {{at the request of}} a public agency. It is used for contact between a person and an agency which would otherwise require the use of a personal <b>identity</b> <b>number,</b> for example for people have their main residence less than a year in the country or don't reside at all but needs authority contacts, e.g owning a summer house, or for Swedish citizens who have never been residents of Sweden. It is structured along the same lines, but with the day in the date of birth advanced by 60 (giving a number between 61 and 91). The reason for this routine {{is that there is a}} risk of running out of personal <b>identity</b> <b>numbers.</b> It is easier to get a co-ordination number than a personal <b>identity</b> <b>number</b> because the latter require evidence of work or education which would last at least a year, so many students or workers get a co-ordination number first and later a personal <b>identity</b> <b>number.</b> A Swedish <b>identity</b> card require personal <b>identity</b> <b>number,</b> while a bank account is troublesome to get with only a co-ordination number.|$|R

40|$|Results of the {{empirical}} research directed on check of a hypothesis of existence {{of types of}} <b>civil</b> <b>identity,</b> caused by various combinations of level of extremist and patriotic self-identity, and the assumption of distinctions of ethnic identity of data of groups are presented. Residents of Smolensk and Smolensk region of the Russian nationality without experience {{of participation in the}} extremist organizations took part in research. Empirical research was conducted in the form of questioning. Techniques of psychological diagnostics were used: scales of definiteness, scales of valency of ethnic identity and scales of level of an interethnic intolerance (N. M. Lebedeva, A. N. Tatarko), a questionnaire "Types of ethnic identity" (G. U. Soldatova, S. V. Ryzhova) and author's scale of level of extremist and patriotic self-identity. Mathematical processing was executed in program the Statistica 6. 0 (methods of descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U-test). As a result of research 5 types of <b>civil</b> <b>identity</b> are found. The most numerous types: «patriot-no extremist» and «the fluctuating patriot-no extremist». Other types («patriot-the fluctuating extremist», «no patriot-no extremist» and «the fluctuating patriot-the fluctuating extremist») aren't numerous. Distinctions of ethnic identity of the revealed types are described. The type «patriot-no extremist» is norm of <b>civil</b> <b>identity.</b> Results of research can be used for regional and federal programs of prevention of extremism and improvement of system of patriotic education, at training of specialists for work with youth, in psychological diagnostics, psychological prevention and psychological correction.
