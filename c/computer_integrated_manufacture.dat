40|$|The {{integration}} {{of information technology}} into industrial development and manufacturing is a worldwide phenomenon, the technical and economic effects of which are of great importance for the continued development in this area in {{all corners of the}} globe. Functional hardware and software components with integrated production facilities are already available, improved hardware and software (databases, networks) allow existing separate solutions to be linked together. CIM is, however, not an organizational and technological advance which can be achieved overnight. Once initial developments have been completed they must be integrated and partly updated. For a successful CIM installation, therefore, a modular concept, specific to the firm in question must be developed. The aim of the "Fabrik 2000 " CIM demonstration (Factory 2000) by the Fraunhofer-Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation (IPA) is, therefore, to demonstrate practical and concrete solutions of <b>computer</b> <b>integrate</b> d <b>manufacture</b> and its advantages especially for the potential users in medium-sized firms, on order to enable the intorduction and application of <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> manufacturing. On the basis of a demonstration manufacturing plant with a continuous production process, CIM demonstrations, seminars and training programmes and conversion support are to be carried out. With the help of the installed and deliberately heterogeneous manufacturing and computer systems, various solutions for closed CIM chains, from the design through manufacture and assembly up to quality assurance must be implemented, in order to enable a general representation of the individual subareas of 'computer integrated manufacture'...|$|R

40|$|<b>Computer</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>manufacture</b> {{has brought}} about great {{advances}} in manufacturing technology and its recognition is world wide. Cold roll forming of thin-walled sections, {{and in particular the}} design and manufacture of form-rolls, the special tooling used in the cold roll forming process, is but one such area where <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>manufacture</b> can make a positive contribution. The work reported in this thesis, concerned with the development of an integrated manufacturing system for assisting the design and manufacture of form-rolls, was undertaken in collaboration with a leading manufacturer of thin-walled sections. A suit of computer programs, written in FORTRAN 77, have been developed to provide computer aids for every aspect of work in form-roll design and manufacture including cost estimation and stock control aids. The first phase of the development programme dealt with the establishment of CAD facilities for form-roll design, comprising the design of the finished section, the flower pattern, the roll design and the interactive roll editor program. Concerning the CAM facilities, dealt with in the second phase, an expert system roll machining processor and a general post-processor have been developed for considering the roll geometry and automatically generating NC tape programs for any required CNC lathe system. These programs have been successfully implemented, as an integrated manufacturing software system, on the VAX 11 / 750 super-minicomputer with graphics facilities for displaying drawings interactively on the terminal screen. The development of the integrated system has been found beneficial in all aspects of form-roll design and manufacture. Design and manufacturing lead times have been reduced by several weeks, quality has improved considerably and productivity has increased. The work has also demonstrated the promising nature of the expert systems approach to <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>manufacture...</b>|$|E

40|$|Within the {{manufacturing}} domain {{the most important}} area of research related to pattern recognition is that of machine feature identification. The ability to correctly identify features in a design is the gateway to <b>Computer</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Manufacture</b> (CIM). The capability to take a computer constructed drawing or sketch and generate a program for a Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machined to produce the part. This has been an active research field since the mid 1990 ’s evolving from simple 2 D features to the recognition of prismatic parts. The research presented in this chapter looks to identify approaches and methodologies for complex freeform, curved and interacting feature often associated with elements found in casting moulds and dies. The chapter identifies the needs related to moulds and dies and presents an overview of related technologies current employed. The approaches identified are demonstrated via figures of parts or elements taken from productions dies and moulds. These approaches and methods are critically appraised and their limitations highlighted.

40|$|Abstract — In the {{industry}} computer assisted technologies are being implemented very fast. Most companies {{support the use}} of the new computer assisted technologies as a fully integrated digital policy. Currently, due to the high number of available alternatives in the market, the integration analysis of the computer assisted conception and production technologies is a critical study, in order to establish the potential for a full implementation of a CIM (<b>Computer</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Manufacture)</b> strategy. The technology developments in the area of computer assisted project and production of prototypes is reviewed in this paper. The text is divided in five main topics, namely: i) an introduction to the characteristics of actual markets requirements and demands of clients that lead to the need of new methods and equipments to be used by the production companies, ii) a review about the available capabilities on computer assisted conception and production technologies (computer-aided design / engineering / manufacturing and rapid prototyping); iii) an analysis about product designer standards and requirements (an example concerning the making of working drawings is used to illustrate the actual constraints in the computer assisted technologies); and iv) conclusions regarding {{the state of the art}} and future developments preview in the area.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to document part of a collaborative research program undertaken by the Centre for <b>Computer</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Manufacture</b> (CIM Centre) at Swinburne University of Technology in Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia and Australian Defence Industries (ADI) Ltd in the field of 'non-contact inspection'. This research program is one of two collaborative programs between the CIM Centre and ADI Ltd, related to inspecting the quality of components in an automated fashion, without the use of contacting sensors. There are a number of techniques currently being investigated at the CIM Centre, including lasers, vision, acoustic emission and X-ray based methods. This particular paper focuses on the research work undertaken by the first author in the detection of internal surface defects in forged, hollow cylindrical workpieces. The case study presented for consideration and discussion herein is related to the detection of cavity defects in forged pressure vessels. The paper provides a background into the range of alternative non-contact inspection techniques that are available (including lasers, ultrasonics, etc.) and the reasons why some of these failed to provide the functionality that was offered by the vision approach ultimately adopted. There is nothing unique about the application of vision systems in the detection of surface defects. However, in this research program, a number of factors have considerably complicated the application. These include lighting problems and the difficulties encountered in acquiring images within a confined cylindrical space. This paper documents the techniques that have been used to resolve some of these practical image acquisition and processing problems and the relative merits of each approach. The paper also examines some of the algorithmic problems involved in detection of particular surface anomalies in components through a range of techniques and concludes that the one most suited to the surfaces in the pressure vessel case-study is the so-called 'region-growing' approach...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project undertaken at Swinburne University of Technology was a collaborative study between the University Library and the Office of Research. The information needs of academic staff and postgraduate research students were investigated in two University research centres: the Centre for Applied Colloid and BioColloid Science and the Centre for <b>Computer</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Manufacture,</b> including the School of Innovation and Enterprise. The {{aims of the}} study were to identify {{the ways in which the}} researchers find, use and store information and the formats used. This study was carried out from the researchers' point of view so that the most effective ways of support could be determined. A multi-method approach to data collection was adopted, using observation, semi-structured interviews with selected staff and postgraduate research students and a questionnaire distributed to all researchers in the designated centres. Because of the collaborative nature of the research, and because a broad definition of information was used, information needs were also identified which were not related to the Library or the Office of Research. These were passed on to the relevant management body within the University. Although the study highlighted differences between the research cultures of the centres, it also demonstrated common issues and needs. It was found that there was a marked disparity in access to and use of electronic networked information, and that most researchers, although eager to do so, were unable to gain immediate advantage from new developments in this area. The management of electronic networked information was seen to be critical. Other findings included: the value placed by a high percentage of researchers on personal collections of photocopies and reprints and the need expressed to improve the organisation and storage of this material; the importance of journal literature, including articles from older journals; time constraints of academic staff involved with teaching and administration as well as research; the role of 'gatekeepers' and 'peer coaches' in the informal dissemination of information; requirements of postgraduate students situated in industrial workplaces and the general need for a more developed research culture...|$|E
