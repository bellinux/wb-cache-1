50|$|The {{national}} ID registration in Zimbabwe {{is managed}} by the Registrar Generals Office. The National ID number is an eleven character alphanumeric code in which the 2 digit prefix denote the district in which the applicant resides or registered for the national document. The next six digits denote the unique personal code for the applicant and a <b>check</b> <b>letter</b> then the last 2 digits denote the district of origin usually from the paternal side, {{this would be the}} prefix code on the parents national ID number. so the number would look something like 12 345678 A90 if this person were to have a child his or her national id would then look like this 12 876543 B12. Starting in the early 2000 the National ID number is now assigned at birth and is printed on the long birth certificate by default. Upon reaching the age of 16 the applicant then has to go to the registrar generals offices in their district to obtain a national ID. Foreigners in Zimbabwe have their ID number with the district of origin as 00 meaning they are foreigners so their ID number would look like 12 345678 A00. Zimbabweans who are not of black race also get a district of origin shown as 00, even those who are of mixed race.|$|E
5000|$|AA - The {{lettering}} is unconfirmed, but AA is {{the most}} likely position if the old tradition is accepted that a mint irregular block of 4 was discovered back in the 1870s (AB, AC and BA are known to exist) and split into individual stamps. AA is the logical missing stamp. In 1868 Judge Philbrick refers to a trial sheet of penny plates printed in 1863 an example of which lettered AA came into his possession. He said [...] "It is finely printed in very red carmine. There is nothing to distinguish it as a proof and except from the source from which it came into our collection we should hardly have supposed it to be such". Bacon didn't know what plate it came from and said he thought {{it must have been a}} stamp from the [...] "imprimatur" [...] sheet. Now, could that stamp have been from plate 77?! [...] "AA" [...] or whatever stamp it was, was in the collection of William Hughes-Hughes who was one of the founder members of the Royal Philatelic Society London. He was a Barrister of the Inner Temple and his collection was started around 1859 and discontinued about 1874. When interviewed by the Stanley Gibbons Monthly Journal in January 1896 (when the stamp was bought from him by Gibbons as part of his [...] "Great Collection") he stated that the whole collection had only cost him £69 as most of his stamps had been obtained [...] "through influential connections". The article also mentions that all of the stamps are [...] "stuck down tight and have to be cut out" [...] so presumably this example would have been sold unused rather than mint! Although Bacon mentions this stamp as being in the Ferrary collection I can find no evidence of this (it didn't appear among the listed items sold at the Ferrary sales in Paris so maybe the example of plate 70 said to have been bought by him has been confused with a 77? In fact it was sold to stamp dealer Herbert L'Estrange Ewen who in turn sold it to Henry J Crocker in America (see The Philatelic Record June 1902 page 132) where it was lost in a fire that followed the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 so it's most unlikely that this stamp will ever reappear. I would be interested to hear if anyone has any references from American publications to do with this occurrence and any reference to the <b>check</b> <b>letter</b> position would be great! This stamp is also referred to in the 29th February 1908 issue of [...] "The Postage Stamp" [...] as follows - [...] "Gibbons' catalogue after stating that a specimen of plate 77 is in the Tapling collection adds [...] "and we have had a second". This second copy Mr Ewen in his Weekly Stamp News informs us was bought by him and sold to Mr HJ Crocker, being burnt along with the rest of the latters collection of British stamps in the San francisco collection. The Tapling copy is therefore unique." [...] In the 28th March 1908 issue of [...] "The Postage Stamp" [...] Mr N V le Gallais points out that he has a used copy of Plate 77. He is referring to LL.|$|E

40|$|With {{a view to}} {{canvassing}} {{the principal}} potential problems in advising upon letters of credit, this article considers the following topics: (i) the documents of a typical credit transaction; (ii) the doctrine of autonomy; (iii) the doctrine of strict compliance and incidence of non-complying documents; (iv) the documents used to <b>check</b> <b>letter</b> of credit terms; (v) the types of fraud; and (vi) the level of burden of proof required in establishing fraud. In particular, this article by looking at case law raises three questions. First, is the doctrine of strict compliance effective when in a majority of transactions the documents tendered are discrepant due to actual fraud and mere fraud? Secondly, what is the appropriate degree of burden of proof used by the courts to justify non-payment for standby credits given the case of perpetrating fraud there under? And lastly, what has caused {{the demise of the}} traditional bill of Lading to a more electronic mode of negotiability?...|$|E

25|$|The Penny Black lasted {{less than}} a year. A red {{cancellation}} {{was hard to see}} on the black design and the red ink was easy to remove; both made it possible to re-use cancelled stamps. In February 1841, the Treasury switched to the Penny Red and began using black ink for cancellations instead, which was more effective and harder to remove. However, people still reused stamps by combining the uncancelled parts of two stamps to form an unused whole, so in 1864 as a further safeguard the top corner stars on the Penny Red were replaced by the lower corner <b>check</b> <b>letters</b> in reverse order.|$|R

Results in general indicated that differences between good and poor readers at these grades lie in the reaction times required to perform the discriminations, and sometimes the patterns across various tasks, rather than in error rates.

50|$|BA is an unused (no gum) stamp {{now in the}} British Library {{from the}} Tapling collection. Its centreing is {{consistent}} with AB and AC. When viewed from the back the Large Crown watermark (Type II) is very slightly high of centre and slightly left of centre. I am confident that this stamp is from the original plate 77. This confidence {{is based on the}} fact that I have examined every single stamp with the <b>check</b> <b>letters</b> BA from ALL the plates in between 71 and 225 and NONE of the positions match the Tapling stamp although 81 is the closest by far. It's still not a match though. This proves that some stamps were printed from plate 77. BA is the first plate 77 to be recorded in the public arena as it became part of Tapling's collection prior to 1891 when he died and it was bequeathed to the British Museum.|$|R

Because of a need for greater quantities of $1 FRN's, the BEP sent out a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes {{within the confines of}} their current (1985) 14th & C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous roll of paper. The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio Web press printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was actually designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems, operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996.
