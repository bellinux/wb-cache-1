5|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Navy had <b>competitively</b> {{evaluated}} three foreign submarine designs, it {{selected the}} Germaniawerft 506d design, {{also known as}} the Type UD, for its new U-7 class of five submarines. The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913.|$|E
5|$|Mortimer began {{swimming}} at age two; {{her mother}} is a co-owner of the Oakville Swim Academy. At age nine, she began swimming <b>competitively.</b> As {{a member of the}} Hamilton Aquatic Club and the Golden Horseshoe Aquatic Club, Mortimer competed at the 2008 Canadian Olympic Trials for the Beijing games.|$|E
5|$|Gourley became {{involved}} in high level Paralympic skiing {{as a result of}} Australian talent identification efforts, taking up the sport <b>competitively</b> in 2002 as an eleven-year-old. He was classified as LW6/8-2, the classification for athletes with an impairment to one arm, and made his Australian national team début in 2006, as a fifteen-year-old. He has held scholarships with the Victorian Institute of Sport and the Australian Institute of Sport.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined the}} British Army in 1904, {{becoming}} a private in the Manchester Regiment. The pseudonym Issy Smith was {{adopted in the}} process of enlisting at the behest of a recruiting sergeant. Smith completed his training, serving in South Africa and India with the 1st Battalion. He boxed <b>competitively,</b> winning the British Army's middleweight championship, and played football. While in India, Smith was present at the Delhi Durbar parade, in which the 1st Manchesters participated, and was thus awarded the Delhi Durbar Medal.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Kent Hughes {{was part}} of the Oxford Ski Team visit to Europe, during which he became the first Australian to ski <b>competitively</b> overseas. Following his {{graduation}} from Oxford, he married Edith Kerr, a wealthy American heiress to a thread manufacturing empire, on 3 February 1923 in Montclair, New Jersey. He subsequently returned to Melbourne to work as a director in his father's publishing company Ramsay Publishing Pty Ltd while sizing up a career in politics.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{is married}} to Shauna Martin and has three children, Karrick, Kalycia, and Mykaela. Karrick curls <b>competitively,</b> most {{recently}} as the alternate for his father at the 2013 Tim Hortons Brier, and as the lead for Brendan Bottcher, winner of the 2017 Alberta men's championship to represent the province at the 2017 Tim Hortons Brier, with Kevin as coach.|$|E
5|$|Since Aberdeen's re-emergence {{as one of}} the {{top teams}} in Scotland, Aberdeen's rivalry with Celtic has {{increased}} both <b>competitively</b> and between supporters. There have been minor incidents at games, mainly relating to political disturbances by Celtic supporters at games between the clubs, including the disruption of minute's silences and the display of banners showing support for the 1981 Irish hunger strike.|$|E
5|$|The University {{offers a}} variety of {{professional}} and specialized programs, including the only schools of law and medicine in the state of North Dakota. Its best known college is perhaps its John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences, which is the first in the country to offer a degree in unmanned aircraft systems operations, and is <b>competitively</b> ranked as one of the world's top schools of aviation and aerospace.|$|E
5|$|The club first participated <b>competitively</b> at the 1884 Montreal Winter Carnival {{ice hockey}} tournament (considered the Canadian {{championship}} at the time) wearing {{red and black}} uniforms. Future Ottawa mayor Nelson Porter is recorded as the scorer of the club's first-ever goal, at the 1884 Carnival. Frank Jenkins was the first captain of the team; he later became {{the president of the}} hockey club in 1891 and of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHA or AHAC) in 1892.|$|E
5|$|U-2 {{was built}} {{as part of}} a plan by the Austro-Hungarian Navy to <b>competitively</b> {{evaluate}} foreign submarine designs from Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland. The Austro-Hungarian Navy ordered plans for U-2 (and sister ship U-1) in 1906 from the Lake Torpedo Boat Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut. U-2 was built at the Pola Navy Yard and was launched on 3 April 1909.|$|E
5|$|U-3 {{was built}} {{as part of}} a plan by the Austro-Hungarian Navy to <b>competitively</b> {{evaluate}} foreign submarine designs from Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland. The Austro-Hungarian Navy authorized the construction of U-3 (and sister ship, U-4) in 1906 by Germaniawerft of Kiel, Germany. U-3 was laid down on 12 March 1907 and launched on 20 August 1908. After completion, she was towed via Gibraltar to Pola, where she arrived on 24 January 1909.|$|E
5|$|When {{there is}} more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are {{produced}} in the fruits and the fruits are larger with greater likelihood of maturation, an effect called xenia. <b>Competitively</b> grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of seeds in the fruit, which increases the fruit size; this pollination requires skilled technique. Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of C.pepo.|$|E
5|$|After racing {{airplanes}} <b>competitively</b> {{during the}} 1950s, Cummings and her husband, Howard Critchell, {{helped found the}} Bates Aeronautics program at Harvey Mudd College in 1962. They ran it together until he retired in 1979, at which point Iris continued alone until the program's end in 1990. A long-time certified FAA Pilot Examiner, she {{is the recipient of}} several international aviation awards {{and is a member of}} the National Flight Instructors Hall of Fame. In her later years, she has remained active as a lecturer, consultant, and curator of the Aeronautical Library Special Collections at Harvey Mudd.|$|E
5|$|Elgato {{introduced}} a Thunderbolt docking station in June 2014. A computer is {{plugged into the}} dock using a Thunderbolt port {{in order to gain}} access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was <b>competitively</b> priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
5|$|In {{the episodes}} {{following}} the break up, Rachel and Ross are initially hostile towards each other. The exes continue to harbor feelings for each other. During a beach house vacation with their friends, Rachel and Ross briefly reconcile when he ends {{his relationship with}} Bonnie (Christine Taylor), only to break up once again due to a disagreement. During season four, Rachel dates her customer Joshua (Tate Donovan), while Ross dates her boss' niece Emily (Helen Baxendale), to whom he eventually gets engaged. <b>Competitively,</b> Rachel proposes to recent divorcee Joshua, frightening him off. Rachel indirectly contributes {{to the demise of}} Ross and Emily's relationship when he accidentally utters Rachel's name while exchanging their wedding vows. Ross ultimately divorces a jealous Emily, choosing his friendship with Rachel instead.|$|E
5|$|Indo-Caribbean {{music plays}} {{a vital role}} in various annual festivals like the springtime phagwa, where chowtal is {{traditionally}} performed <b>competitively</b> and in teams. Indo-Caribbean Shia Muslims celebrate Hosay (Muharram) with floats accompanied by barrel drums called tassa. Wedding music is another important part of Indo-Caribbean music, and is dominated by tan singing. Tan singing is accompanied by the dholak drum and dhantal, and sometimes includes verbal duels influenced by picong. Indo-Caribbean popular music gained international attention in the late 1980s, with the rise of chutney music. Chutney is a dance music, in its modern form accompanied by soca instrumentation, such as synthesizers and pressure drums. This style is called chutney-soca.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible {{competitive}} antagonists also involve {{competition between}} the agonist and antagonist of the receptor, but the rate of covalent bonding differs and depends on affinity and reactivity of the antagonist. For some antagonist, {{there may be a}} distinct period during which they behave <b>competitively</b> (regardless of basal efficacy), and freely associate to and dissociate from the receptor, determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. But, once irreversible bonding has taken place, the receptor is deactivated and degraded. As for non-competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive antagonist drugs, there may be a shift in the log concentration–effect curve to the right, but, in general, both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{publications}} {{were rarely}} luxury goods: he priced his merchandise <b>competitively,</b> but always within {{the reach of}} the middle class, the audience he most wanted to serve. One way that he reduced costs was by printing texts in the provinces and then importing them to London; many of Priestley's works, for example, were printed locally in Birmingham. Johnson did not take great care with the printing of many of his books; they are full of errors and poorly bound. But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of {{modulating}} immune function in the gut through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development of healthy gut microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM may be that its structure {{is similar to that}} of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to <b>competitively</b> inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contests}} between {{animals are}} now regarded as sports for example, horse racing {{is regarded as}} both a sport and {{an important source of}} entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on Melbourne Cup Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, camel racing requires human riders, while greyhound racing does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race <b>competitively,</b> whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like cockroaches.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. Joust 2 introduced a transformation ability that morphs the player's bird into a pegasus, which provides better offensive capabilities while on ground but poor flight capabilities. A second player can join the game. The two players can either cooperatively complete the waves or attack each other while <b>competitively</b> defeating enemies.|$|E
5|$|TWR had {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of these racing V12 engines during the 1980s and they had been raced <b>competitively,</b> with a 7-litre version of this engine featuring in the Le Mans winning Silk Cut Jaguar XJR-9. Five of these engines still existed, all of which were fitted with dry sump lubrication. These engines were chosen and considered to be especially useful as the dry sump would lower the vehicle's centre of gravity. The displacement of the V12 was set at 6.2 litres (6222cc) for the XJ220. The engine fitted to the XJ220 concept had titanium connecting rods.|$|E
5|$|Tan {{lives in}} a four-room HDB flat in western Singapore, {{together}} with his father (a mechanic), mother (a housewife) and younger sister (a research analyst); {{he does not have}} a girlfriend. Despite his success, he continues to take public transport, eat at hawker centres and go out with friends. He enjoys bowling and was one of only two totally blind Singaporeans who played the sport <b>competitively,</b> even winning a competition organised by the blind associations of Singapore and Perth. In 2012, he picked up running, joined RunningHour (a running club for people with disabilities) and participated in the 10km run of the Singapore Marathon. His other hobbies include travelling to Kuala Lumpur, playing Street Fighter, chatting online with friends and updating his Twitter account.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{continued}} swimming <b>competitively</b> {{into his}} 40s until {{he retired in}} 1926. He also played water polo for England. During his career he won over 35trophies and 300medals. He suffered a setback when the public house, the Nudger, he owned in Dobcross was closed due to financial difficulties. Taylor became an attendant at Chadderton Baths. To raise money, Taylor was forced to sell most of his prizes. He died in obscurity aged65 on 28 February 1951, at lodgings in Brierley Street, Chadderton, he was penniless and unmarried. He was cremated and his remains were scattered at Rochdale Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The Brabham BT46 is a Formula One {{racing car}} {{designed}} by Gordon Murray for the Brabham team, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, for the 1978 Formula One season. The car featured several radical design elements, {{one of which}} was the use of flat panel heat exchangers on the bodywork of the car to replace conventional water and oil radiators. This concept did not work in practice and was removed before the car’s race debut, never to be seen again. The cars, however, powered by a flat-12 Alfa Romeo engine, raced <b>competitively</b> with modified nose-mounted radiators for most of the year, driven by Niki Lauda and John Watson, winning one race in this form and scoring sufficient points for the team to finish third in the constructors championship.|$|E
5|$|When Hurricane Hugo {{destroyed}} the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989, Duncan {{was forced to}} swim in the ocean and he quickly lost his enthusiasm for swimming because of his fear of sharks. Duncan was dealt another emotional blow when his mother {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and died one day before his 14th birthday. In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's refusal to leave college early. Duncan never swam <b>competitively</b> again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law to turn to basketball.|$|E
5|$|While Forrest is in {{recovery}} for {{a gunshot wound}} to his buttocks received while saving his platoon-mates, he discovers a talent for ping pong. He becomes a ping pong celebrity and plays <b>competitively</b> against Chinese teams in ping pong diplomacy. At an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C., Forrest briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a hippie lifestyle. While in D.C. in 1972, Forrest meets president Richard Nixon and is put up in the Watergate hotel, where he accidentally reveals the Watergate scandal, ultimately forcing Nixon to resign.|$|E
5|$|Yip started {{swimming}} <b>competitively</b> {{when she}} was twelve years old. After losing her ability to kick, Yip switched from the front crawl to the backstroke and was reclassified from the S5 to the S3 category (lower numbers indicate more severe disabilities). Her coach is former Singaporean Olympic swimmer Ang Peng Siong, while fellow Paralympic swimmer Theresa Goh is her close friend and role model. Besides competitive swimming, Yip has participated in events {{to raise awareness of}} disabled sports, such as the Interschool Swimming Meets and Montfort Secondary School Track and Field Meet 2007.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War Millwall's {{form was}} {{poor and the}} club dropped into the Third and Fourth Division of the Football League. West Ham have never played below the Second Division in their history and often played a league or two above Millwall. The two sides did not play each other <b>competitively</b> between 13 October 1959 and 7 October 1978, making the 1960s the only decade the teams have not met. Despite the infrequency of their meetings, both sets of {{supporters}} still consider the other club their major rival. During these years, the Hammers enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup in 1964, 1975 and 1980. They also won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965. Over four decades the sides were only in the same tier of the Football League for three seasons, in 1946–47, 1947–48 and 1978–79. They played two cup games {{against each other in}} the Southern Professional Floodlit Cup in 1959 and the Full Members Cup in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the competition, it was {{reported}} that Domenech was considering changing up the style of play in the team's 4–3–3 formation with Malouda possibly moving from the winger role into the midfield. Following Malouda's relegation to the bench for insubordination, Diaby was inserted in his place and made his World Cup debut in the team's opening group stage match against Uruguay. The match ended 0–0 with Diaby playing the entire match. He was credited by Scottish newspaper The Scotsman as being the team's best performer in the goalless draw. Diaby featured as a starter in both of France's remaining group stage matches against Mexico and South Africa. France lost both matches as the competition ultimately ended in disastrous <b>competitively</b> and personally due to the players going on strike in response to its disagreement over the expulsion of striker Nicolas Anelka from the team. As a result of the players' mutiny, Diaby, along with the 22 other members of the team, were suspended for the team's friendly match against Norway.|$|E
5|$|During high school, Williams played several sports <b>competitively.</b> He {{attended}} Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, {{and graduated}} with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and economics in 1937. He served as the vice-president of his senior class {{and was a member}} of the Kappa Alpha Order. Like his older brother, Manning Holland Williams, he earned his degree after three years and was admitted to Phi Beta Kappa. At the age of 19, Williams enrolled at Harvard Business School, receiving his Master of Business Administration degree two years later. Following his graduation from Harvard Business School, Williams worked in the loan department at Manufacturers Trust Company in New York City for two years. Williams traveled to Europe, in 1937 and 1939, visiting Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. Prior to this experience, Williams was an avowed pacifist, but after visiting Nazi Germany he felt obligated to enlist in the United States Navy.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Cummings {{was called}} back to USC to develop and teach a {{curriculum}} on civilian aviation for returning veterans. She {{spent much of the}} 1950s as a housewife, raising her children, but remained active as a part-time flight instructor, as well as helping develop curricula for Federal Aviation Administration institutions. She also raced airplanes <b>competitively</b> during this period and won the 1957 Powder Puff Derby, capturing the first prize pot of $800 (approximately $ in present-day terms). In 1962, she joined Harvey Mudd College and, in association with the Bates Foundation, founded the school's Bates Aeronautics Program. She ran the program with her husband until he retired in 1979, and continued alone until the program ended with her 1990 retirement. She continued teaching classes on aeronautics, however, until 1996. Her students include astronauts George Nelson and Stanley G. Love. She also served as an FAA Pilot Examiner for over two decades and was named the organization's Flight Instructor of the Year for the Ontario district in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5 (initially {{referred}} to as Guitar Hero V) is a music rhythm game and the fifth main entry in the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players {{across a range of}} skill levels {{to be able to play}} cooperatively and <b>competitively</b> against each other both locally and online.|$|E
