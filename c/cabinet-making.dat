At 12, he began {{applying}} his earnings to flying lessons, soloing after 5 hours and 45 minutes of instruction. He achieved his student license and logged 35 hours in four years of instruction, before suspending his flying lessons because of a newfound interest in girls. While attending Cameron Junior College, Johnson resumed flying in the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPT), and accumulated 100 hours total flight time by his second year. Johnson gave up his full-time job to allow for his varied interests, but continued to hold a series of part-time jobs, including as a firefighter with the Lawton Fire Department.|$|E
25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of <b>cabinet-making.</b> He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time {{he went back to the}} drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E
500|$|During the {{following}} two years Waugh taught at schools in Aston Clinton (from which he was dismissed for the attempted drunken seduction of a school matron) and Notting Hill in London. He considered alternative careers in printing or <b>cabinet-making,</b> and attended evening classes in carpentry at Holborn Polytechnic while continuing to write. A short story, [...] "The Balance", written in an experimental modernist style, became his first commercially published fiction, when it was included by Chapman and Hall in a 1926 anthology, Georgian Stories. An extended essay on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was printed privately by Alastair Graham, using by agreement the press of the Shakespeare Head Press in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was undergoing training as a printer. This led to a contract from the publishers Duckworths for a full-length biography of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, which Waugh wrote during 1927. He also began working on a comic novel; after several temporary working titles this became Decline and Fall. Having given up teaching, he had no regular employment except for a short, unsuccessful stint as a reporter on the Daily Express in April–May 1927. That year he met (possibly through his brother Alec) {{and fell in love}} with Evelyn Gardner, the daughter of Lord and Lady Burghclere.|$|E

[...] His father, a carpenter, had built a {{successful}} <b>cabinet-making</b> and decorating business on Castle Street, the main thoroughfare in Carlisle. [...] A year later another son, James, was born to the couple and in 1846, a daughter, Mary, who died before the year was out. [...] In 1849, another daughter, Mary Ellen (Polly) was born and the following year Sarah Creighton died unexpectedly. [...] Robert, who never remarried, and never spoke of his wife again, raised the children with help from his unmarried sister who {{came to live with}} the family.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{has been}} written about scene as a {{cultural}} document of an important period when many immigrants were coming to America. In fact, the picture was taken on a cruise to Europe from America, and for that reason some critics have interpreted it as recording people who were turned away by U.S. Immigration officials and were forced to go back home. Although some of the passengers might have been turned back because of failure to meet financial or health requirements for entrance, {{it is more likely that}} most of them were various artisans who worked in the booming construction trade of the time. Workers who were highly skilled in crafts such as <b>cabinet-making,</b> woodworking and marble laying were granted two-year temporary visas to complete their jobs and then returned to their homelands when the work was complete.|$|E
2500|$|The War of 1812 with England began {{about this}} time. There were many embargo laws then {{enforced}} and basically little trading with Europe in general. His <b>cabinet-making</b> business {{was all but}} rubbed out as the New England economy was in a recession at the time. It turned out little importation of European products came to America because of the war. There was a sharp incentive to make items in New England that were normally made in Europe. Many products were scarce and much rewarded for those that could produce them in America. Munroe figured {{there had to be}} a way to exploit this concept so thought of some ideas of things he could make. Being practical he first produced cabinetmaker’s squares since he already had skills in this area and it would be easy for him to make these. He did his level best selling them at a fair price, however competition eventually made his business decline. He then noticed the scarcity of imported pencils and the high price that people paid for them. Munroe figured that making these for people was a financial opportunity. He learned of earlier users that were successful in selling them, like Benjamin Franklin who promoted pencils in the Pennsylvania Gazette in 1729. It is not known for sure if Munroe was inspired by Franklin's expression Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing, however he did point out, ...|$|E

I must have it up at the turning-shop {{in the village and}} do it there, for I've no convenence for turning at home. If you'll send it to Mr. Burge's shop i' the morning, I'll get it done for you by Wednesday. I've been turning it over in my mind," [...] he continued, looking at Mr. Poyser, [...] "to make a bit more convenence at home for nice jobs o' <b>cabinet-making.</b> I've always done a deal at such little things in odd hours, and they're profitable, for there's more {{workmanship}} nor material in 'em. I look for me and Seth to get a little business for ourselves i' that way, for I know a man at Rosseter as 'ull take as many things as we should make, besides what we could get orders for round about." ...|$|E

What I've got to do is to work as well as I can with the tools and mater'als I've got in my hands. If a good chance comes to me, I'll think o' what you've been saying; but till then, I've got nothing to do but to trust to my own hands and my own head-piece. I'm turning over a little plan for Seth and me to go into the <b>cabinet-making</b> a bit by ourselves, and win a extra pound or two in that way. But it's getting late now--it'll be pretty near eleven before I'm at home, and Mother may happen to lie awake; she's more fidgety nor usual now. So I'll bid you good-night." ...|$|E

He taught me many things about which the kinsfolk of my mother know very little. You must not suppose that because some of us are only half-civilised we can do nothing neatly or well. Many of our men are skilful workers in metal, and we owe much of our power in that way to English missionaries, who brought Christian mechanics to the capital. There is hardly anything in the shape of wrought iron-work that we cannot execute if we have a model or pattern. We can work also in copper and brass. But it is not only in metals that we can work fairly well--indeed very well, if we are to take the word of some of your own countrymen who have seen and judged our work--we are also pretty good at pottery and <b>cabinet-making.</b> As you have seen, we can weave good cloth of cotton and silk, and some of our ingenious men have even tried their hands at clock-making and musical instruments." ...|$|E
