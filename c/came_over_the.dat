5|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> area {{to make an}} airdrop. The planes mistakenly dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E

5|$|The Charlemagne-class ships did not {{function}} {{well in a}} head sea. Stormy weather in the Bay of Biscay in 1900 caused the captain of Gaulois to complain that the ship's forward gun turret and casemates were flooded out and that the ship generated enormous sheets of spray when water <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bow. Like most French capital ships of the period, they had pronounced tumblehome. Gauloiss captain also said that his ship was a steady gunnery platform and manoeuvered well in tight spaces but he criticized the armour layout as not high enough to prevent munitions from penetrating above the main armour belt and detonating below the secondary armament positions.|$|E
5|$|Al Ward {{replaced}} Ewbank {{as general}} manager in 1975. The Jets won four of their five preseason games, though sportswriter Gerald Eskenazi, in his history of the Jets, notes that the wins were secured by playing first-string players while the other teams were trying out rookies and backups. When the regular season started, the Jets lost seven of their first nine games, and Winner was fired. Offensive coordinator Ken Shipp became interim head coach, and the Jets finished {{with a record of}} 3–11. Running back John Riggins, who became the first 1,000-yard rusher in franchise history during the season and made the Pro Bowl, departed for the Washington Redskins as he felt the Jets' Namath-led offense passed the ball too often. New York hired North Carolina State coach Lou Holtz. With New York enduring the second of three consecutive 3–11 seasons (two wins <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 2–12 Bills and a third over the 0–14 expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Holtz—who went on to great success at Notre Dame—resigned with one game left in the season to become head coach at the University of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} December 2011, Miller {{had contributed}} to the school's first ever 130 start and a school-record tying 13-game winning streak. Prior to the 13th victory on December 28, which <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> (15 AP/14 Coaches) Mississippi State Bulldogs, the team (6 AP/7 Coaches) had already reach the highest rankings in school history in the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's {{basketball}} rankings. On January 14, Miller posted 21 points as Baylor (4 AP/4 Coaches) defeated Oklahoma State, raising their record to 170. Miller had 17 points when (3 AP/3 Coaches) Baylor suffered its first loss to (7 AP/7 Coaches) Kansas on January 16. He had a career-high 29 points in a January 21 8988 loss to (5 AP/5 Coaches) Missouri. On February 18, he posted another double-double with 12 points and 11 rebounds against Kansas State. Following the 2011–12 Big 12 Conference men's basketball season, he was named the Big 12 co-Freshman of the Year (with Le'Bryan Nash) and was recognized as an honorable mention All-Big 12 and a Big 12 All-Rookie Team selection by the league's coaches. Miller was also selected as the Big 12 Freshman of the Year by The Sporting News.|$|E

On lap 134, Johnson moved back on track, however he returned to pit road eight laps later as the green flag pit stop period began. Hamlin gained the lead on lap 146. After pit stops, Kyle Busch reclaimed the first position. Drivers reported track conditions were changing as cooler air <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> circuit by lap 148. Jeff Gordon reported seeing debris at turn one on the 165th lap, which triggered the third caution. Some of the leaders chose to make pit stops during the caution as race officials cleaned the debris. Kyle Busch maintained his lead at the restart, ahead of Kurt Busch and Earnhardt.|$|E
5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass.

25|$|Those {{who took}} the California Trail usually left Missouri River towns in early April and arrived in California 150–170 days later—late August or early September.

25|$|If the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{is to be}} believed, {{the various}} Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which {{eventually}} merged to become England were founded when small fleets of three or five ships of invaders arrived at various points around the coast of England to fight the Sub-Roman British, and conquered their lands.

25|$|The superhumeral, worn {{throughout}} the history of Byzantium, was the imperial decorative collar, often forming part of the loros. It was copied by at least women of the upper class. It was of cloth of gold or similar material, then studded with gems and heavily embroidered. The decoration was generally divided into compartments by vertical lines on the collar. The edges would be done in pearls of varying sizes in up to three rows. There were occasionally drop pearls placed at intervals to add to the richness.

25|$|Resistance to the 3rd Marine Regiment advance was strong, {{with all}} three battalions engaged with the Japanese.
