These failures are attributed to {{the difference in the}} mechanical properties across the weld, the coefficients of thermal expansion of the two types of steels and the resulting creep at the interface.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{of current}} collector materials in MoltenCarbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) is investigated. The essential aimsof this investigation were {{to study the}} corrosion behaviour ofdifferent materials, in varying cathode and anode MCFCenvironments, and to study the <b>contact</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistancesbetween the MCFC current collector and electrodes. For thesepurposes, pure iron, iron-chromium binary alloys and severalcommercial steels were investigated in molten carbonate meltswithin the pot-cell laboratory set-up. In addition, the contactcorrosion resistances, between an AISI 310 current collectorand two cathodes (NiO and LiCoO 2), were studied in a laboratory fuel cell. Post-tests were done to study the corrosion products formed atthe surfaces. In cathode environments, corrosion potential increased overtime as a protective corrosion layer slowly formed. Eventually,the potential reached a stable value close to the cathodeoperating potential. The main cathode reaction, as corrosionpotential increased, changed from water reduction to oxygenreduction. Corrosion rate under the operating cathode conditiondepended on the chromium content; the higher the concentrationof chromium, the lower the corrosion rate. The corrosion ratesof ferritic steels, with high chromium content, and AISI 310 were higher at the so-called outlet operating condition incomparison to the standard and so-called inlet conditions. Thecorrosion rate was higher {{at the beginning of}} the exposure,which resulted in a relatively fast corrosion layer growth thatslowed as the protective layer was formed. It was shown thatthe corrosion layers, formed on iron-chromium alloys, AISI 310 and ferritic high chromium-containing steels, consisted of twolayers. The outer layer was porous and iron rich, while theinner layer was quite compact and rich in chromium and/oraluminiumTherefore, the corrosion behaviour was dependent onthe corrosion layer structure at the metal surface. In anode environments, the beneficial behaviour of aluminiumin ferritic alloys, with high aluminium contents, was due tothe formation of aluminium oxide and/or lithium aluminium oxideat the surface. The corrosion rates at the standard and outletconditions were of the same order of magnitude, while thecorrosion rates at the inlet conditions were considerablyhigher. The lower temperatures and higher carbon dioxideconcentrations in the inlet conditions appeared to result in asurface layer deficient in aluminium. A modified theoreticalmodel was developed to evaluate the corrosion current densitiesfrom experimental polarisation curves or linear polarisationresistance measurements in anode environments. The fittingswere found to be very good. An experimental method was developed forin-situmeasurements of the contributions to the totalohmic losses at the cathode in a laboratory scale MCFC. Thecontact resistance between the cathode and current collectorcontributed quite a large value to the total cathodepolarization. The corrosion layer, formed between the LiCoO 2 cathode and AISI 310 current collector, wasiron-rich and more porous, and contained a small amount ofcobalt. This was deemed to consist of a two-phase oxide, whichresulted in a lower conductivity. The corrosion layer, formedbetween the NiO cathode and AISI 310 current collector, wasrich in nickel. The corrosion layers on the AISI 310, incontact with the cathode, had a different composition comparedto samples immersed in carbonate melts.

40|$|There is {{a general}} demand to {{decrease}} the weight of vehicles. This fact has to be considered by current and future body concepts. State of the art car body concepts require a high structural performance combined with a low weight of the component. This demand can be met by hybrid parts, which offer {{the advantage of a}} material mix, combining the advantageous properties of the composite partners. The high freedom of construction and geometric shape in primary shaping processes enables joining sheet metal structures to a complex cast structure stiffening the hybrid component and increasing the structural performance. The topic {{of this paper is to}} identify casting alloys, steel sheets and steel sheet coatings which enable the production of high quality hybrid structures for body applications in wet area. Therefore the materials have to achieve defined requirements. Casting alloys which have to be used for thin wall hybrid structures need to have a very well castability, a good corrosion resistance, good mechanical properties including a good ductility and a good weldability. To save costs and to reduce residual stress in hybrid components alloys have to be used which show a self-hardening effect. Because of stiffening the hybrid component an almost defect-free casting component is needed. Therefore casting alloys which have been used for composite castings have to show a good castability. The casting alloys AlMg 5 Si 2 Mn and AlSi 9 Mn seem to have the potential to achieve these require-ments. A comparison of both alloys showed that the alloy AlSi 9 Mn has some advantages over the alloy AlMg 5 SiMn. The alloy has a higher castability and causes less residual stress in hybrid components. Casting ribs which are given to stabilize hybrid structures often show characteristic shrinkage porosity with a thread-shaped morphology when the alloy AlMg 5 Si 2 Mn was used. A higher residual stress caused by the alloy AlMg 5 Si 2 Mn is believed by the alloys higher thermal expansion coefficient. Because of the advantages of the alloy AlSi 9 Mn towards the alloy AlMg 5 Si 2 Mn the alloy AlSi 9 Mn was preferred for the production of hybrid components. Beside the choice of a casting material the micro-alloyed steel ZStE 420 was chosen. This steel material is often used for crash relevant structure parts and shows in combination with coatings a good corrosion resistance. Furthermore the micro-alloyed steel shows a hot temperature resistance for short term which is important when the steel material gets into contact with the molten casting alloy. Using hybrid parts in wet area both materials, casting and steel alloy, need to show a good corrosion resistance itself. To avoid <b>contact</b> <b>corrosion</b> it is necessary that a corrosion current between both materials cannot take place. Therefore it can be very helpful to realize a complete metallic continuity between both materials. To create a metallic continuity a sufficient diffusion time between the material partners is needed. Using technical casting processes like the high pressure die casting process there is only a very limited solidification time and therefore a very limited diffusion time. To overcome this problem defined coating systems were checked. It could be shown that especially Zinc-coatings (electrogalvanising and hot-dip galvanizing) are able to create a metallic continuity between steel and casting component. Nevertheless a complete metallic continuity was not received. Furthermore mechanical tests were conducted to analyze the failure mechanism of hybrid structures with and without metallic continuity. It could be shown that at early deformation trajectories hybrid structures without metallic continuity take up more energy than hybrid structure with metallic continuity.

The candidate materials of {{construction of the}} waste packages and drip shields while highly corrosion resistant are extremely expensive and components made from these materials will require complex and expensive fabrication methods to assure their integrity. A proposed, second generation operating concept and waste package design, is intended to permit more efficient and less costly operation of the repository while maintaining waste package integrity. Major reductions in waste package costs can be realized by {{increasing the number of}} fuel assemblies stored in each waste package, eliminating the reference titanium drip shield and fabricating the outer container from low alloy “weathering ” steels. These steels have outstanding resistance to general corrosion and are localized corrosion. The second generation waste package is proposed for implementation after the initial licensing and operation of the reference Yucca Mountain design. Implementation would follow a regulatory process analogous to that used to implement plant life extensions and power uprates of commercial light water nuclear reactors. The proposed concept capitalizes on the benefits of hot, dry storage to minimize potential for <b>contact</b> and <b>corrosion</b> of the waste package metallic surface by liquid electrolytes. The merits and feasibility of this approach have been investigated analytically at UNR (1, 2) and testing of th...|$|R
40|$|During Phase I of West Valley Demonstration project waste remediation, an {{estimated}} 95 % of the zeolite currently in tank 8 D- 1 will {{be transferred to}} tank 8 D- 2, leaving behind residual Cs-loaded zeolite which will require treatment to remove the Cs. After phase I vitrification, tank 8 D- 2 will contain residual waste from PUREX and THOREX and spent Cs-loaded zeolite. The residual waste will require treatment. Oxalic acid has been proposed for eluting Cs from zeolite in tank 8 D- 1 and dissolving radionuclides in tank 8 D- 2. Laboratory tests were performed to determine optimum Cs elution and sludge dissolution conditions and to evaluate effects of multiple contacts, long-term <b>contacts,</b> presence of <b>corrosion</b> products, lack of agitation, temperature of tank contents, and oxalic acid concentration. Mild steel corrosion tests were also conducted...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} focused on the {{interests}} and limits of EIS, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, to establish the electrochemical behaviour of a tribosystem during friction between copper and aluminium in acid solution. EIS measurements are performed before, during and after friction for understanding electrochemical surface reaction evolution. For each material, calculated capacitance in high frequencies range allows getting further information about the double layer state. The Potential of Zero Charge (PZC) is defined such as the potential value associated to the lowest capacitance. PZC was calculated for copper sample precisely and it was associated to a potential range for aluminium. PZC value of each material is discussed as a key parameter of sliding contact in considered media. Finally, impedance diagrams illustrate a parallel contribution of aluminium and copper during static <b>contact.</b> During wear <b>corrosion</b> tests, EIS results, at high frequencies, are related to the evolution of adsorbed water molecules...|$|R
40|$|Fretting {{corrosion}} {{of medical}} devices is of growing concern, yet, {{the interactions between}} tribological and electrochemical parameters are not fully understood. Fretting corrosion of CoCr alloy was simulated, and the components of damage were monitored {{as a function of}} displacement and <b>contact</b> pressure. Free <b>corrosion</b> potential (Ecorr), intermittent linear polarisation resistance and cathodic potentiostatic methods were used to characterise the system. Interferometry was used to estimate material loss post rubbing. The fretting regime influenced the total material lost and the dominant degradation mechanism. At high contact pressures and low displacements, pure corrosion was dominant with wear and its synergies becoming more important as the contact pressure and displacement decreased and increased, respectively. In some cases, an antagonistic effect from the corrosion-enhanced wear contributor was observed suggesting that film formation and removal may be present. The relationship between slip mechanism and the contributors to tribocorrosion degradation is presented...|$|R
