5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, <b>crankshafts,</b> gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E

This happens due to the elevated load concentrated on that <b>crankshaft</b> journal. Determination of forces and torques that act on the <b>crankshaft</b> journals can be derived from various methods that can be found in literature. Determination of forces and torques that act on the <b>crankshaft</b> journals firstly requires determination of forces that act on components of engines mechanism: piston, connecting rod and crankpins of the <b>crankshaft.</b> In this paper, calculation of reactions on <b>crankshaft</b> journals is done according to literature [1], where in computation of reactions on the <b>crankshaft</b> journals; the effects of detached parts of the <b>crankshaft</b> is taking into consideration by substituting them with torques located above the supporters, in the analyses rod.

25|$|Wankel engines {{generally}} {{are able to}} reach much higher engine revolutions than reciprocating engines of similar power output. This {{is due to the}} smoothness inherent in circular motion, and the absence of highly stressed parts such as <b>crankshafts,</b> camshafts or connecting rods. Eccentric shafts do not have the stress related contours of <b>crankshafts.</b> The maximum revolutions of a rotary engine is limited by tooth load on the synchronizing gears. Hardened steel gears are used for extended operation above 7000 or 8000rpm. Mazda Wankel engines in auto racing are operated above 10,000rpm. In aircraft they are used conservatively, up to 6500 or 7500rpm. However, as gas pressure participates in seal efficiency, racing a Wankel engine at high rpm under no load conditions can destroy the engine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:The <b>crankshaft</b> {{accidents}} due to vibration become severe {{with increasing}} number of rows of reciprocating compressors. The <b>crankshaft</b> vibration needs to be studied thoroughly to promote development of the reciprocating compressor. Early calculations of <b>crankshaft</b> torsional vibration was mainly with discretization method, the <b>crankshaft</b> is discretized {{into a series of}} lumped inertia and lumped stiffness,then calculate the swing angle of <b>crankshaft</b> in the gas force and inertia force,but because of the simplified calculation,which has low precision. The currently calculation method of <b>crankshaft</b> torsional vibration is simplified into an equivalent system model,the model is composed of a lumped mass disc,massless elastic shaft and a damping. In calculation the torsional natural frequency and forced vibration usually adopt the Holzer method and transfer matrix method,due to this method only calculation the <b>crankshaft</b> torsional direction, so it can only obtained the <b>crankshaft</b> natural frequency and vibration characteristics in the direction. To make the <b>crankshaft</b> torsional vibration calculation more accurately,we proposed a new calculation model based on the flexible multibody dynamics theory. The process of the model establishment and solving by ADAMS was introduced. The torsional vibration of a <b>crankshaft,</b> which often suffers from the crankpin fracture,was calculated before and after the structure change. Results show that before the structure change,the <b>crankshaft</b> natural frequency was closed to the excitation frequency,so that the tortional vibration amplitude of the <b>crankshaft</b> is very large. The stress of piston pins in the first and second row increase so rapidly along the directionof the cylinder center line that the impact factor ofthe crank pin bearing reache the upper limit,thus the oil film of it is damaged. After the structure change,the natural frequency of <b>crankshaft</b> is away from the excitation frequency,the vibration amplitude of the <b>crankshaft</b> torsional vibration decrease substantially,and the crankpin fracture does not happen anymore. This is a successful validation of the proposed calculation method...|$|R

25|$|In 1980, the 2.25-litre petrol {{and diesel}} engines {{received}} five main bearing <b>crankshafts</b> to increase rigidity and the transmission, axles and wheel hubs were strengthened. This {{was the culmination of}} a series of updates to the transmission that had been made since the 1960s to combat the all-too-common problem of the rear axle half-shafts breaking in heavy usage. This problem was partly due to the design of the shafts themselves. Due to the fully floating design of the rear wheel hubs, the half shafts can be removed very quickly without even having to jack the vehicle off the ground. The tendency for commercial operators to overload their vehicles exacerbated this flaw which blighted the Series Land Rovers in many of their export markets and established a reputation that continues in many markets to the present day. This is despite the 1982 re-design (mainly the increase of driving-splines from 10 to 24 to reduce stress) that all but solved the problem.|$|E
