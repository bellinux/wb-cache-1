500|$|... "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" [...] {{continues}} to be used today by journalists in the media, as a reference for historical information on the Church of Scientology. In April 2007, <b>CNN</b> <b>anchor</b> Anderson Cooper interviewed former Office of Special Affairs director Mike Rinder, in a live piece on Anderson Cooper 360° titled [...] "Inside Scientology". The CNN story was prompted by the May 2007 airing of a BBC Panorama investigative program, [...] "Scientology and Me". In the interview, Anderson Cooper quoted directly from [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" [...] article, when asking Rinder {{about the history of}} Operation Snow White, and if those tactics were currently used by the Church. Rinder answered by stating that the individuals involved with Operation Snow White were no longer involved in Church of Scientology activities, and that the incident was [...] "ancient history". Cooper then again referenced the Time magazine article noting that Behar asserted that he was illegally investigated by Scientology contacts during research for his article. Cooper questioned Rinder on the dismissed lawsuit against Time Warner, and Rinder acknowledged that all of the Church of Scientology's appeals against Time Warner were eventually rejected.|$|E
