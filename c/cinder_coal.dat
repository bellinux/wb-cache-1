40|$|Abstract. In this study, adding <b>coal</b> <b>cinder</b> {{to bottom}} of solar pond {{as a means}} of {{increasing}} temperature of the solar pond is presented. A series of small-scale tests are conducted in the simple mini solar ponds. These small-scale tests include the temperature evolution comparisons of this mode with other normal modes; the comparisons of the material added to LCZ and the comparisons of the different soaking times for <b>coal</b> <b>cinder.</b> In addition, a numerical calculation on predicting temperature evolution in large area of salt gradient solar pond is also given. Both of the experimental and numerical results suggest that adding porous media with low thermal diffusivity (e. g. <b>coal</b> <b>cinder)</b> could significantly increase the temperature {{in the vicinity of the}} bottom of the pond. From the view of long-term, this effect is supposed to enhance the average temperature of the solar pond...|$|R
40|$|A new micellar {{electrokinetic}} chromatography (MEKC) method using beta-cyclodextrin (ß-CD) as the electrophoresis additive {{has been}} developed for the simultaneous determination of dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP) and di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in environmental samples. To improve the sensitivity of cyclodextrin-modified MEKC (CD-MEKC), a flow injection procedure using a micro-column packed with <b>coal</b> <b>cinder</b> as the solid-phase extractant was also investigated for the preconcentration and separation of DMP, DEP and DEHP in environmental samples. Parameters affecting CD-MEKC separation and <b>coal</b> <b>cinder</b> flow injection solid-phase extrac-tion were systematically researched. In {{the presence of the}} running buffer [5 mmol/L of borax, 5 % (v/v) methanol and 25 mmol/L of sodium dodecyl sulfate at pH 9. 5], the addition of 14 mmol/L ß-CD greatly improved the separation efficiency. The analytes were quanti-tatively adsorbed by <b>coal</b> <b>cinders</b> and readily desorbed quantitatively with 0. 2 mL of 10 % (v/v) methanol– 10 mmol/L disodium hydrogen phosphate. Under the optimum conditions, the enrichment factor of <b>coal</b> <b>cinder</b> was 60, and the determination limits of DMP, DEP and DEHP were 3. 07, 2. 07 and 4. 06 ng/mL, respectively. The presented procedure was successfully applied to determine DMP, DEP and DEHP in landfill leachate and water samples with satisfactory results...|$|R

40|$|A new micellar {{electrokinetic}} chromatography (MEKC) method using beta-cyclodextrins (-CDs) and 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphates (ionic liquids) as additives {{was successfully}} developed for determination of para-, meta-, and ortho-phenylenediamines isomers (p-P, m-P, and o-P) in hair dyes. To improve {{the sensitivity of}} the MEKC-UV, a simple and cheap flow injection (FI) technique using a micro-column packed with <b>coal</b> <b>cinders</b> (the by-products from combustion in a boiler) as solid-phase extractant was also investigated. In the presence of 20 mmol L(- 1) phosphates at pH 5. 5, addition of 12 mmol L(- 1) ionic liquids and 8 mmol L(- 1) -CDs greatly improved the separation efficiency. The three analytes could be quantitatively adsorbed by <b>coal</b> <b>cinders,</b> and desorbed readily with 0. 15 mL of 0. 01 mol L(- 1) NaOH. Under the optimum conditions, an enrichment factor (EF) of 33. 3 was obtained, and determination limits of p-P, m-P, and o-P were 1. 9710 (- 7), 0. 9910 (- 7), and 0. 6110 (- 7) mol L(- 1), respectively. The adsorption capacities of the <b>coal</b> <b>cinders</b> micro-column for p-P, m-P, and o-P were all 1. 20 mg g(- 1).

40|$|A novel magnet bioreporter {{device was}} {{developed}} in this research for soil toxicity assessment, via magnetic nanoparticles functionalized whole-cell bioreporters. The whole-cell bioreporter ADPWH-recA kept response capability to DNA damage after magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) functionalization, and could be harvested from soil samples by permanent magnet to reduce the soil particle disturbance. Compared to conventional treatments applying bioreporter directly in soil-water mixture (SW-M treatment) or supernatant (SW-S treatment), MNPs functionalized bioreporter via the magnet device (MFB) treatment achieved high sensitivity to evaluate the toxicity and bioavailability of chromium contamination in soils from 10 mg/kg to 5000 mg/kg soil dry weight. The MNPs functionalized bioreporter also achieved high reproducibility with pH value from 5. 0 to 9. 0, salinity from 0 % to 3 % and temperature from 20 °C to 37 °C. A case study was carried out on the ecological toxicity assessment of heavy metal contamination at the <b>coal</b> <b>cinder</b> site via the magnet bioreporter device. The heavy metal toxicity declined with the increasing distance to the <b>coal</b> <b>cinder</b> point, and a significant accumulation of heavy metal toxicity was observed along the vertical distribution. No direct link {{was found between the}} pollution load index (PLI) and heavy metal toxicity, and the results suggested the bioreporter test monitored the toxicity of heavy metals in soils and was an important approach for ecological risk assessment. Magnet bioreporter device also offered the high throughput biological measurement and was feasible for in situ monitoring...|$|R

They were on the borders of the illimitable West, whose lands stretch like a sea beyond the hilly Ohio shore; but as yet this vastness, which appalls and wearies all but the born Westerner, had not burst upon them; they were still among heights and hollows, and in a milder and softer New England.|$|R

40|$|Overfishing, reduced {{access to}} {{spawning}} sites (due to dam construction), {{and destruction of}} habitat have decreased lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens, Figure 1) in the Great Lakes to less than 1 % of their former abundance; in Michigan, they are threatened with extinction (Hay-Chmeilewski and Whelan 1997). In the Detroit River, four years of set line fishing captured only 86 lake sturgeon (Caswell 2003 a, b). Underwater video surveys in 1998 and 1999 showed that, due to gravel removal and silt deposition, only two of nine historic spawning sites in this river had substrate with enough interstitial space for incubation of sturgeon eggs and that no sturgeon used those sites (McClain and Manny 2000).

With respect to the minute splinters of glass and particles of hair, I observed that the secretion slowly spread itself a little over their surfaces, by which means they were likewise drawn downwards or sideways, and thus one end, or some minute [page 30] prominence, often came to touch, sooner or later, the gland.|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to a request by the Union Planters Bank of Chattanooga, Tennessee, the Jeffrey L. Brown Institute of Archaeology, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, conducted a Phase I archaeological survey of a parcel of land situated at {{the southeast corner of}} Cowart and West Thirteenth Streets in the downtown area of Chattanooga. The purpose of the survey was to determine if archaeological resources potentially eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places were present on the parcel, consonant with provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Documentary research on the property was limited to inspection of readily available historic maps and fire insurance plats of the property that illustrated the nature of improvements or other land uses through time. The cartographic overview permitted identification of features for targeted excavation in the field. Research suggests that the property was vacant until the mid- 1880 s. A small structure at the southeast corner of the project area is illustrated on Sanborn fire insurance maps in 1885, and an historic aerial view of 1886 also depicts the structure. The building was a warehouse associated with the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad. This structure was razed c. 1888 and two new one-story utility railroad structures were erected along the tracks situated south of the project area. These structures were associated with the Alabama Great Southern Railroad. These two structures were razed by 1917 and the project area remained vacant until 1954 - 69, during which period a small tin-clad utility building was erected on the railroad frontage of the lot. Archaeological survey of the parcel consisted of the excavation of three backhoe search trenches at 10 m (332 ̆ 7) intervals across the width of the trapezoidal lot. The trenches were two feet (0. 6 m) in width and carried to a uniform depth of five feet (1. 5 m). Unstable soils and groundwater flooding of the trenches prevented detailed recording of soil stratigraphy and features. Two limestone wall foundations and one abandoned 242 ̆ 2 ceramic sewer line were encountered during the testing. The wall foundations appear {{to be associated with the}} c. 1885 railroad warehouse. Soil stratigraphy was dominated by deep accumulations of <b>coal</b> <b>cinder</b> and clinker, and deposits of mixed, redeposited clays and brick rubble. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The Jeffrey L. Brown Institute of Archaeology, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, {{conducted}} archaeological and {{documentary research}} on the Union Railyards and Union Stockyards Sites in downtown Chattanooga, Tennessee, during 1979 - 1981. The reconnaissance testing and data recovery programs at the sites were aimed at assessing the eligibility of the resources {{for inclusion in the}} National Register of Historic Places and to mitigate adverse impact on the cultural resources in the project tracts. The research was performed under contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority. The archaeological and documentary resources examined pertained principally to a tract of land where the Western and Atlantic and Nashville and Chattanooga Railroads and their successors maintained terminal yards from c. 1850 to c. 1978, when the project area was acquired by the Tennessee Valley Authority for urban redevelopment. The areas examined archaeologically were the maintenance and freight yards adjoining the Union Depot, a large jointly owned passenger facility. A tract of land adjoining the railyards and used during the 19 th century as a stockyard was also tested archaeologically. The research design for the investigations proposed generating: (1) a site-specific documentary history of the development of the yards and concommitant archaeological documentation of the railroad-related structures and features in the yards, (2) information concerning the shift from wrought iron to steel rail hardware, and the shift from wood to coal locomotive fuel, (3) information concerning the nature and distribution of industrial waste at the sites, (4) documentation concerning the ecology of the site, particularly the flora-supporting characteristics of artificial soil (<b>coal,</b> <b>cinder,</b> and clinker), and (5) an examination of 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 versus 2 ̆ 2 ideal 2 ̆ 2 construction practices, comparing archaeologically-observed material behavior with ideal engineering construction practice as evidenced by engineering textbooks and related literature. Excavations at the Union Railyards Site generated site-specific data on site formation processes, railroad architecture and yard layout. Railroad-related artifacts were recovered, but not in great volume. Archaeologically, the transition from wood to coal combustion in locomotives, and the shift from wrought iron to steel rail hardware was not well represented. The nature of locomotive ash and cinder accumulations as a site formation process and the archaeological correlates of the wood to coal fuel transition are discussed. Industrial site ecology was not examined in any depth, but a floral profile of the recently-abandoned railyards was obtained. [URL]...|$|R
