5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} of the Treaty of Versailles, hyperinflation spread across Germany and many lost their life savings. Halle was not spared. By 1921, few townspeople there <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> musical education at Bruno Heydrich's conservatory. This led to a financial crisis for the Heydrich family.|$|E
5|$|Relations between Argentina and Uruguay worsened, {{and both}} nations {{came close to}} declaring war on each other, {{although}} neither <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> direct military conflict. Argentina had only recently emerged from a long civil war, and was still struggling to suppress a Federalist rebellion in its western province of La Rioja. Uruguay was too weak militarily {{to engage in a}} fight unaided.|$|E
5|$|Hitler envisioned {{widespread}} car ownership {{as part of}} the new Germany and {{he arranged}} for designer Ferdinand Porsche to draw up plans for the KdF-wagen (Strength Through Joy car), intended to be an automobile that every German citizen <b>could</b> <b>afford.</b> <b>A</b> prototype was displayed at the International Motor Show in Berlin on 17 February 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the factory was converted to produce military vehicles. No production models were sold until after the war, when the vehicle was renamed the Volkswagen (people's car).|$|E

5|$|Andry Rajoelina {{was born}} on 30 May 1974 to a {{relatively}} wealthy family in Antananarivo. His father, now-retired Colonel Roger Yves Rajoelina, held dual nationality and fought for the French army in the Algerian War. At the age of 13, Rajoelina became the 1987 junior-class national karate champion. While still in high school, Rajoelina began working as a disc jockey at parties and clubs in Antananarivo to earn pocket money. Although Rajoelina's family <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> college education for their son, he opted to discontinue his studies after completing his baccalaureat to launch a career as an entrepreneur.|$|E
5|$|The Moreno {{family was}} poor, but <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> house and some slaves. Ana María Valle y Ramos, Mariano's mother, {{was one of}} the few literate women in Buenos Aires. Mariano Moreno was the firstborn of {{fourteen}} children. Mariano moved to Chuquisaca with his brother Manuel Moreno and their friend Tomás Guido once the family raised the money. The long and difficult journey gave Mariano a rheumatism attack; he had to stay in bed for fifteen days on arrival. He had further attacks years later. Moreno met María Guadalupe Cuenca in this city, after seeing a miniature portrait of her at a silversmith's house. Both Moreno and María were expected by their families to follow religious studies, and Moreno's father did not authorize a change. Moreno studied laws all the same, and married María in secret to avoid family resistance. They had a single son, named Mariano like the father.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{allowed to}} be shown in the Soviet Union in 1948 because of its {{depiction}} of the plight of people under capitalism, it was subsequently withdrawn because audiences were noticing that, {{as shown in the}} film, even the poorest Americans <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> car.|$|E

50|$|The {{plan was}} foiled when another {{passenger}} on their charter flight (uninvolved in the plot), who had boarded on a stop-over, was caught with illegally imported fruit. This {{meant that the}} Seychellois customs were going to commence checking every single bag, which was not something the mercenaries <b>could</b> <b>afford.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the AK-47s were removed prematurely, and an armed skirmish ensued, in which the men hijacked an Indian jumbo jet to fly to South Africa. Hoare and the other mercenaries spent several years in South African prisons for their troubles.|$|R
50|$|Until 1860, {{private schools}} existed in Montgomery County {{for those who}} <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>an</b> education. Montgomery County Public Schools was {{established}} in 1860 for white children. The school system {{got off to a}} shaky start—the Civil War caused local schools to be disabled, vandalized and closed. Depredations by both Union and Confederate armies caused schools to close in 1862 and they didn't reopen until 1864.|$|R
25|$|On 9 February 2016, a {{day after}} Australia lost the Chappell-Hadlee series to New Zealand, Nevill was named as the wicketkeeper of choice for ICC World T20 after Matthew Wade was dropped for poor glovesmanship.

25|$|Despite media {{censorship}} {{regarding the}} event, {{news of the}} crash was widely circulated in China. The incident was also later reported on major international media, including the Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Online Chinese-language communities also questioned how Ling Gu <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> car worth some $500,000 when his parents had government jobs. The crash and subsequent suppression {{was said to have}} led to Ling Jihua's demotion in August 2012, and his wife Gu Liping's removal from her job in January 2013.|$|E
25|$|Fomin {{acquired}} a solid reputation, {{but did not}} have an architect’s license yet. He returned to St.Petersburg in 1905 and completed Leon Benois' course at the Academy of Arts in 1909, winning a one-year study tour to Greece, Egypt and Italy. At this time, Neoclassical Revival became the leading style in St. Petersburg, and the most technologically advanced. Banks and department stores, who favored the style, <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> steel frame and concrete slab floors. A combination of money and technology allowed the mix of classical columns and arches with large glass surfaces.|$|E

La Guardia and his Park Commissioner Robert Moses demolished the Casino in 1936 and built the Mary Harriman Rumsey Playground over the site of the former restaurant.|$|R
25|$|With {{three sons}} {{already in the}} army and another already put up for the 7th Queen's Own Hussars, Byng's father did not think he <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> regular army {{commission}} for his youngest son. Thus, at the age of 17, Byng was instead sent into the militia and on 12 December 1879 commissioned as a second lieutenant into the 2nd (Edmonton) Royal Middlesex Rifles. He was promoted to lieutenant on 23 April 1881. During this period, Byng also developed a liking for theatre and music halls, and by the age of twenty had taken an interest in the banjo.|$|E
25|$|Polygamy (specifically polygyny) {{had been}} practised in Chinese {{societies}} {{for thousands of}} years. Since the Han Dynasty, Chinese men {{have been able to}} legally have only one wife. It was common for privileged Chinese men to have a wife and various concubines, however. For those who <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> dowry and support a family of multiple concubines and children, polygyny provided a better chance of issuing heirs. The importance of this was apparent in the imperial court, which usually housed hundreds of concubines. Aside from concubinage, having multiple wives with equal status was also accepted prior to the ban on polygamy.|$|E
25|$|Frege's course exposed him to Bertrand Russell's work on {{logic and}} philosophy, which put {{a sense of}} the aims to his studies. He {{accepted}} the effort to surpass traditional philosophy with logical innovations that inform the sciences. He wrote a letter to Russell, who responded by copying by hand long passages from his Principia Mathematica for Carnap's benefit, as neither Carnap nor his university <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> copy of this epochal work. In 1924 and 1925, he attended seminars led by Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology, and continued to write on physics from a logical positivist perspective.|$|E

She staffed her restaurant with single mothers, saying that they were hard workers and reliable. For many years, Chris' Steak House was the only upscale restaurant in New Orleans with an all-female wait staff.|$|R

25|$|Maga's {{economic}} policies during his chairmanship helped quiet union leaders whose protests during his presidency had been intense. He {{helped create a}} tax plan that would finance their salaries by cutting expenditures and cracking down on tax evasion. In 1970 Dahomey witnessed a surplus of 429 million CFA francs, rising to a 570million CFA franc surplus the following year. With the national economy in a favorable position, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin {{and the rest of}} the council <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> number of luxuries, including three houses and three Mercedes-Benz 300 automobiles to be shared amongst themselves, and festivals for the anniversary of the founding of the triumvirate.|$|E
25|$|When voters {{approved}} connection to state water supplies in 1991, {{parts of the}} city, especially outlying areas, resumed growth, but more slowly than during the boom period of the 1950s and 1960s. While the slow growth preserved {{the quality of life}} for most residents and prevented the urban sprawl notorious in the Los Angeles basin, housing in the Santa Barbara area was in short supply, and prices soared: in 2006, only six percent of residents <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> median-value house. As a result, many people who work in Santa Barbara commute from adjacent, more affordable areas, such as Santa Maria, Lompoc, and Ventura. The resultant traffic on incoming arteries, particularly the stretch of Highway 101 between Ventura and Santa Barbara, is another problem being addressed by long-range planners.|$|E
500|$|Playford {{was known}} for his lack of funding for education, {{regarding}} it as a distraction from the industrialisation of the state. During this period, only the financial elite <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> university education, and {{less than one percent of}} the population had a degree by the time Playford left office. Despite this, university attendance more than tripled, and secondary and technical school enrolments more than quintupled, far outstripping the 77% population growth during his time in office, as incomes—and hence access to education—rose steadily as the need for teenagers to find a job to help support the family declined. Although the government expenditure on education increased from 10 to 17% from 1945 to 1959, the number of teachers had only doubled by the time he left office, so class sizes increased. The premier's education policy was criticised for being too conservative and lacking in innovation. Playford also did not allow the teaching of languages other than English in schools on the grounds that [...] "English is good enough". Howell said that Playford's [...] "prejudices...served to limit the capacity of many able South Australians to participate in trade negotiations or diplomatic work." [...] University academics and Public Examinations Board called for the inclusion of biology and the broadening of senior high school curriculum to better prepare students for tertiary education, but were rebuffed. In 1963 the minimum school leaving age was raised to 15, but this was still lower than most states in Australia.|$|E
