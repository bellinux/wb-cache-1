40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} if latex coated polypropylene mesh {{leads to}} less adhesions formation. METHODS: 90 rats were distributed in three groups. Group I (control) was submitted to median laparotomy and posterior synthesis; Group II (polypropylene) was {{submitted to a}} segment resection of the abdominal wall, and the defect was corrected with a polypropylene mesh; Group III using the new material (latex coated polypropylene). After 45 days the euthanasia procedure was done and the adhesions were evaluated in 2 ways: 1) <b>classification</b> <b>in</b> a <b>grading</b> system; 2) evaluation of the adhesion area, which was calculated by resection of the adhesions after dying with Indian blue ink. RESULTS: The <b>classification</b> <b>in</b> a <b>grading</b> system showed that Group III animals had less adhesions formation (P 0. 05). The severe complications (fistula, evisceration and obstruction), which were lethal, were not reduced by the latex coated material. CONCLUSION: Latex coated polypropylene causes fewer adhesion formations than polypropylene alone, although it does not diminish the severe early complications...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Understanding motivational classifications around math as {{a content}} area for {{adolescent}} students {{is a good}} first step toward facilitating interventions aimed at improving the STEM education-career pipeline. Prior research has posited that achievement motivation can be represented by four major factors: performance-approach, mastery-approach, performance-avoidance, and mastery-avoidance orientations. The present study tests whether there are distinct math motivation <b>classifications</b> <b>in</b> <b>grades</b> 9 and 11. Classifications at each grade level were tested using responses on seven math motivation 4 -point rating scale items from a nationally representative sample of N = 23, 503 (15, 605 with complete data at both grades) high school students who participated in the 2009 High School Longitudinal Survey (HSLS: 09). Both k-means cluster analysis (CA) and latent class analyses (LCA) were used to examine the number and nature of classifications at each grade level separately; next, a latent transition analysis (LTA) was used to test class membership patterns across the two grade levels. LCA results indicated that there were three classes for each grade level, and that the class types appeared to simply quantify sections of a normally distributed motivation factor (low, moderate, and high motivation), rather than qualitatively different classes; the LCA findings were also comparable to the non-model-based CA results. The LTA results showed that, while many adolescents remained stable within their classifications from grade 9 to 11, students in the extremes of grade 9 (low and high motivation classes) tended to move toward moderate motivation by grade 11. Ultimately, a latent growth model treating motivation as continuous rather than nominal had the best fit to the data. Limitations and future research directions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Bladder {{transitional}} {{cell carcinoma}} (BTCC) {{is the fourth}} most frequent neoplasia in men, clinically characterized by high recurrent rates and poor prognosis. Availability of urinary tumor biomarkers represents a convenient alternative for early detection and disease surveillance because of its {{direct contact with the}} tumor and sample accessibility. Results We tested urine samples from healthy volunteers and patients with low malignant or aggressive BTCC to identify potential biomarkers for early detection of BTCC by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatics analysis. We observed increased expression of five proteins, including fibrinogen (Fb), lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), apolipoprotein-A 1 (Apo-A 1), clusterin (CLU) and haptoglobin (Hp), which were increased in urine samples of patients with low malignant or aggressive bladder cancer. Further analysis of urine samples of aggressive BTCC showed significant increase in Apo-A 1 expression compared to low malignant BTCC. Apo-A 1 level was measured quantitatively using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and was suggested to provide diagnostic utility to distinguish patients with bladder cancer from controls at 18. 22 ng/ml, and distinguish patients with low malignant BTCC from patients with aggressive BTCC <b>in</b> two-tie <b>grading</b> system at 29. 86 ng/ml respectively. Further validation assay showed that Apo-A 1 {{could be used as a}} biomarker to diagnosis BTCC with a sensitivity and specificity of 91. 6 % and 85. 7 % respectively, and classify BTCC <b>in</b> two-tie <b>grading</b> system with a sensitivity and specificity of 83. 7 % and 89. 7 % respectively. Conclusion Taken together, our findings suggest Apo-A 1 could be a potential biomarker related with early diagnosis and <b>classification</b> <b>in</b> two-tie <b>grading</b> system for bladder cancer. </p...|$|R

40|$|Although {{classification}} of astrocytic tumors is standardized by the WHO grading system, which is mainly based on microscopy-derived, histomorphological features, {{there is great}} interobserver variability. The main causes {{are thought to be}} the complexity of morphological details varying from tumor to tumor and from patient to patient, variations in the technical histopathological procedures like staining protocols, and finally the individual experience of the diagnosing pathologist. Thus, to raise astrocytoma grading to a more objective standard, this paper proposes a methodology based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) derived images made from histopathological samples in combination with data mining techniques. By comparing AFM images with corresponding light microscopy images of the same area, the progressive formation of cavities due to cell necrosis was identified as a typical morphological marker for a computer-assisted analysis. Using genetic programming as a tool for feature analysis, a best model was created that achieved 94. 74 % <b>classification</b> accuracy <b>in</b> distinguishing <b>grade</b> II tumors from grade IV ones. While utilizing modern image analysis techniques, AFM may become an important tool in astrocytic tumor diagnosis.

40|$|Renal {{injuries}} are classified, {{based on the}} American Association for the Surgery of Trauma <b>classification,</b> <b>in</b> to five <b>grades</b> of injury. Several imaging modalities have been available for assessing the grade of renal injury, each with their usefulness and limitations. Currently, plain radiographs and intravenous urography have {{no role in the}} evaluation of patients with suspected renal injury. Ultrasonography (USG) has a limited role in evaluating patients with suspected retroperitoneal injury; however, it plays an important role during follow up in patients with urinoma formation. USG helps to monitor the size of a urinoma and also for the drainage procedure. The role of selective renal arteriography is mainly limited to an interventional purpose rather than for diagnostic utility. Retrograde pyelography is useful in assessing ureteral and renal pelvis integrity in suspected ureteropelvic junction injury and for an interventional purpose, like placing a stent across the site of ureteric injury. Magnetic resonance imaging has no role in acute renal injuries. Multidetector computed tomography is the modality of choice in the evaluation of renal injuries. It is also useful in evaluating traumatic injuries to kidneys with preexisting abnormalities and can help to define the extent of penetrating injuries in patients with stab wounds in the flank region.
