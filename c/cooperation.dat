5|$|Croatia and Hungary {{have agreed}} to the Cultural <b>Cooperation</b> Programme, which defines <b>cooperation</b> and {{cultural}} exchange {{in the fields of}} music, theatre and dance, and with respect to the arts, museums, galleries, literature, publishing, libraries, archives, film and cultural-heritage protection. The programme was agreed to on 7 November 2011 in Budapest by secretaries of the Croatian Ministry of Culture and the Hungarian Ministry of National Resources. The programme pertains to the 20122014 period and represents a continuation of cultural <b>cooperation</b> through cultural exchange, outside the framework of formal agreements. Cultural, educational and scientific <b>cooperation</b> between the two countries is covered by a treaty of 16 March 1994, with additional treaties regulating diploma recognitions since 16 June 1997 and additional treaties and protocols on scientific and technological <b>cooperation</b> signed in 2002 and 2009. The scientific and educational <b>cooperation</b> entails the awarding of scholarships and bilateral research projects.|$|E
5|$|Such <b>cooperation</b> within {{species may}} have evolved {{through the process}} of kin selection, which is where one {{organism}} acts to help raise a relative's offspring. This activity is selected for because if the helping individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity, it is likely that its kin will also contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on. Other processes that may promote <b>cooperation</b> include group selection, where <b>cooperation</b> provides benefits to a group of organisms.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{identify}} the functional contributions of <b>cooperations</b> among transcription factors on regulatory DNA {{is critical for}} understanding transcription activation. But so far {{there is a great}} lack of effective identifying methods. Here we describe a novel strategy, based on comprehensively perturbed experiments and a computational model, to {{identify the}} <b>cooperations</b> among NF-κB (p 65), CREB, and AP- 1 in transcription activation of human cytomegalovirus major IE 1 promoter/enhancer (MIEP). In this strategy, functional profiles of protein–MIEP association and RNA synthesis are achieved through comprehensively perturbing the association of p 65, CREB or AP- 1 with MIEP and then subjected to the computational model. Consequently, the ‘real’ <b>cooperations</b> contributing to MIEP activation are found to comprise five but not seven types of potential <b>cooperations.</b> Thus, our research provides a facile systematic approach to identifying the DNA-organized <b>cooperations</b> among transcription factors and understanding transcription activation...|$|R

These <b>cooperations</b> are characterized by highly dynamic structures and complex heterogeneities, frequently leading to problems and conflicts among the participants of these <b>cooperations.</b> In order to avoid these undesired consequences, we propose a component-based, distributed, and adaptable software platform, which should cope with the described problems of networked <b>cooperations.</b> We argue that such platform should support a decentral Peer-to-Peer architecture, that is, a network consisting of independent hosts (peers) without a single server. Furthermore, we introduce awareness and coordination concepts, regulating the collaboration of participants using the platform...|$|R

40|$|Our study puts special {{attention}} to the fact that R&D <b>cooperations</b> in the pharmaceutical industry are formed at different stages throughout the drug development process. We study if the timing to engage in R&D <b>cooperations</b> in the pharmaceutical industry has different impacts on the technology and product markets. Using a comprehensive dataset on the pharmaceutical industry, and estimating a heterogeneous treatment effects model (Heckman et al., 2006) our results show that R&D <b>cooperations</b> formed at the early stages increase the number of R&D projects and the number of drugs launched on the product market. Most interestingly, late stage R&D <b>cooperations</b> significantly reduce the number of drugs launched on the market, even though they increased firms 2 ̆ 019 activity in the technology markets. This result highlights the fact that firms re-optimize their drug development portfolio to avoid wasteful duplication and cannibalizing the sales of the jointly developed drug in R&D <b>cooperations.</b> Our study show that firms cooperating in late stage collaborations re-optimize their individual drug development portfolios, which significantly reduces the number of drugs offered on the market...|$|R
