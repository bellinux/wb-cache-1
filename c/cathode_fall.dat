40|$|The {{role of the}} {{electric}} arc in the consumption of electrodes in submerged arc furnaces has long been debated. The hostile environment in the furnace does not make direct measurement feasible, so simulation {{has been used to}} evaluate the arcs contribution to the erosion. Magnetofluiddynamic (MFD) electric arc simulations and a cathode / anode sub-model developed in order to provide boundary condition to the arc model have been used for this purpose. The cathode / anode sub-model provides current distributions and <b>cathode</b> / anode <b>fall</b> voltages for the arc and temperature distribution for the electrode surface, which is paramount to the ero-sion rate which in turn is calculated from the Clausius Clapeyron equation and the Hertz Knudsen formula for the vapour transport. In the case of high-current industrial AC arcs, arc currents are typically ~ 100 kA, phase voltages ~ 100 V and total furnace power ~ 10 – 60 MW. The results show that although enormous amounts of material is evaporated, much of it recondenses on the surface. Furthermore the results show that the arc erosion increases strongly with the arc current. If a single arc is present its contribution to erosion is close to the actual total erosion in the furnace. Results from this analysis indicate that there are possibly more than one arc present in the crater, in which case less than 40 % of the total erosion would be due to the arc, the rest is chemical erosion. 1...|$|R

In addition, the time-dependent <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> voltage was measured using an improved band method. The model combines a kinetic part for the electrons with a fluid part for the barium atoms and ions. Both parts are spatially resolved in spherically symmetric geometry. The space-dependent electron Boltzmann equation yields the electron density and the ionization rate coefficient of barium as functions of the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> voltage. These results are used to solve the time-dependent particle balance equations of barium atoms and ions which include the ionization of barium as gain and loss terms, respectively.

Our aim is to gain physical insight into the operation of this device, in particular in the current rise time and the Ohmic dissipation losses in the spark gap. To this end, two separate models have been made: a simple, analytical model of the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> and a complex, numerical model of the conductive arc. The qualitative agreement between the models and experimental results is satisfactory. The models suggest that rise time of the arc conductivity is much longer than the formation time of the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> and therefore determines the switching time...|$|E
40|$|In this contribution, a photoconductively {{switched}} high-voltage {{spark gap}} {{with an emphasis}} on theswitching behavior is modeled. It is known experimentally that not all of the voltage that is present at the input of the spark gap is switched, but rather a fraction of it drops across the spark gap. This voltage drop depends on the voltage that is present at the input of the spark gap with higher voltages resulting in a smaller drop. We have investigated two possible causes of this: the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> and the resistance of the plasma arc. Using an analytical model of the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall,</b> we have established that the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> can be excluded as the cause of the observed voltage drop. A one-dimensional, time-dependent non-local thermal equilibrium fluid model of the arc plasma has been made.

A good qualitative match between the observed and the simulated dissipation in the gap was found. This indicates that the finite arc resistance is the cause of the observed voltage drop...|$|E

Switched dc and sinusoidal currents are applied with amplitudes of several amps and operating frequencies being varied between 10 Hz and 10 kHz. The temperature is deduced from the grey body radiation of the electrode being recorded with a spectroscopic measuring system. Phase resolved {{values of the}} electrode tip temperature T tip and of the power input P in are determined comparing the measured temperature distributions with the integral of the one dimensional heat balance with these parameters as integration constants. They are supplemented by phase resolved measurements of the sum of <b>cathode</b> and anode <b>fall</b> called electrode sheath voltage. If a switched dc current is applied {{it is found that}} both quantities are within the cathodic phase only marginally higher than for a cathode being operated with a dc current. T tip and P in start to decrease for low currents and to increase for high currents {{at the beginning of the}} anodic phase. But with increasing operating frequency the deviations from the cathodic phase are reduced until they cannot be resolved for frequencies of several kHz. A more pronounced modulation but the same tendencies are observed with a sinusoidal current waveform.

40|$|The cathode and the {{anode fall}} of the DC arcs are {{measured}} by fast oscilloscope for Ag-CdO contacts over a range of gap-lengths from 0. 05 mm to 1 mm, and currents of 4 - 10 Amps at atmospheric pressure, with a known electrode closing speed, using the Moving Electrode Method. It was observed that the anode fall can occur in a few places within the arc voltage waveform, and is dependent of the electrodes' surface condition. Both <b>cathode</b> and anode <b>falls</b> increase with gap-length and decrease with current. It was found that when arc length is shorter than electrode separation, discontinuity within the arc voltage waveform during closure is caused, in many cases, by vapourisation of the first point of contact or by a high electric field set up between the two electrodes. These discontinuities are named as Voltage Step Phenomena. These voltage steps {{are related to the}} <b>cathode</b> and anode <b>fall</b> voltages, and their regular occurrences are a function of surface roughness. The fluctuations in the arc voltage waveform are thought to originate mainly from the cathode. A technique has been developed to measure the temperature of the electrodes accurately by using a T-type thermocouple, 0. 075 mm diameter, in conjunction with a DC amplifier with a gain of 247. The thermocouple is placed as close as possible under the electrode surface (200 µm). This enables the temperature of the contact to be measured, after breaking contact, for an arc-duration even as short as 1 ms. The time-constant of the probe (contact containing the thermocouple) is measured to be approximately 18 ms. With this technique the temperature of the electrodes are measured for currents and gap-lengths ranging 4 - 10 Amps and 0. 05 - 1 mm respectively. The effect of contacts being new and change of polarity have been investigated. From these results it is concluded that the co-existence of layers of foreign material on one, or both, surfaces causes the temperature of the electrodes to be high for the first 50 - 100 operations, before reaching to steady-state conditions. Change of polarity suggests that the moving electrode, either anode or cathode, due to the effect of air movement over its surface, is cooled relative to when fixed. The power transfer to the electrodes is calculated for various currents and gap-length using thermal analogue formulae derived from the transient response of an RC circuit to a d. c. pulse. The results show that below 0. 2 mm the sum of the anode and cathode power is approximately equal to the arc power, and hence losses are negligible. At around 0. 125 mm, for currents of about 6 A and 12 A, they both receive an equal amount of power from the arc. This has been related to the thermal energy of the electrons being negligible, at such separation, at the anode end of the plasma column. The power balance equations are solved to calculate the positive ion current to the cathode, and the thermal energy of the electrons in the plasma column, under various test conditions. In the investigation of erosion, the S. E. M. studies show that most of the power dissipated {{on the surface of the}} electrodes is used in melting and evaporation.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a digital pixel sensor array, {{which is the}} first stage of an ongoing project to produce a CMOS image sensor with on-chip image processing. The analogue to digital conversion is performed at the pixel level, with the result stored in pixel memory. This architecture allows fast, reliable access to the image data and simplifies the integration of the image array and the processing logic. Each pixel contains a photodiode sensor, a comparator, memory and addressing logic. The photodiode sensor operates in integrating mode, where the photodiode junction capacitance is first charged to an initial voltage, and then discharged by the photodiode leakage current, which is comprised mainly of optically generated carriers. The analogue to digital conversion is performed by measuring the time taken for the photodiode <b>cathode</b> voltage to <b>fall</b> from its initial voltage, to the comparator reference voltage. This triggers the 8 -bit pixel memory, which stores a data value representative of the time. The trigger signal also resets the photodiode, which conserves the charge stored in the junction capacitance, and also prevents blooming. An on-chip control circuit generates the digital data that is distributed globally to the array. The control circuit compensates for the inverse relationship between the integration time and the photocurrent by adjusting the data clock timing. The period of the data clock is increased {{at the same rate as}} the integration time, resulting in a linear relationship between the digital data and the photocurrent.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is {{concerned}} with the development of computational models for two types of atmospheric technological plasmas with background applications in material processing (waste disposal and production of nano-scale powders) and formation of nano-scale carbon structures (formation of carbon nano-tubes and fullerenes).. The twin torch system consists of two electrode assemblies, each of which has a central electrode surrounded by a nozzle to confine the shielding gas. The two electrodes are configured to have an angle between their axes. The arcing environment is truly three dimensional (3 D) and thus requires a three dimensional model to simulate the arcing process. Representation of 3 D shape in the computational domain is a challenging issue and needs to be addressed before a sensible solution is obtained. In the present model a novel numerical scheme is developed to conveniently and automatically allocate cells (each cell is a finite volume in the solution procedure) to a 3 D shape. This has greatly enhanced the adaptability of the model to cope with complex geometries encountered in arc plasma systems. One of the key issues in 3 D arc modelling is the correct calculation and application of the Lorentz force terms in the momentum equation. For a symmetric arcing case, such as a free burning arc between a conic cathode and a plate anode, slight asymmetry in the distribution of Lorentz force can substantially affect the arc flow hence resulting in a non-symmetric arc column. Validation of the numerical method has been carried out using the free burning arc case by comparing the model predictions with measurements and other available simulation results. It has been shown that the present 3 D model produces satisfactory results. Since the two electrodes of the twin plasma system are water cooled, erosion of the electrode material is minimal and can be neglected. It has been found that the coupling of the two jets is through a thin, tissue like, conducting layer between the two jets. The cross sectional shape of the two jets is deformed by the Lorentz force. The jets are never completely merged. The Lorentz force induced by the arc current and the combined magnetic field of the two jets tends to move the point of separation away from the electrode tips. It is the strong Ohmic heating, resulting from the high temperature (high electrical conductivity) and high electric field in the coupling zone, that heats up the incoming cold gas to a conducting temperature and thus stabilises the electric current path and subsequently the point of separation of the two jets. It is also shown that the change in flow rate does not have significant influence on the parameters of the plasma. The predicted arc voltage is found to be higher than the measurement. The difference is partly attributed to the statistically high frequency fluctuation of the jet coupling zone. The use of a simple turbulence model brings the prediction closer to the measurement at low current, however results in an excessive reduction in arc voltage at high current. Therefore the use of a conventional turbulence model with a fixed turbulence parameter c to simulate the effect of fluctuations of the jet coupling zone may not be appropriate. The carbon arc simulated in Chapter S is confined by liquid water and bums in the gap between a conic anode and a plate cathode. Such an arrangement aims at maximising the anode erosion rate for the formation of solid carbon Ã‚Â·structures (carbon nanotubes and fullerenes). A mathematical model has been developed to simulate the dynamics of bubble growth and development of the ~c column. A novel numerical scheme is employed to detennine the speed of bubble surface expansion. To simulate the removal of gas from within the domain associated with bubble detachment from the discharge zone, an exit is imposed on the bubble surface when its radius reaches 9 mm. Results show that there is large pressure change within the first half millisecond of the discharge. The pressure can be as high as 38 bar. Under such a high pressure the water surrounding the bubble is accelerated which leads to an increasing speed of bubble growth. The rapid growth of bubble size under its inertia caused the pressure inside the bubble to rapidly decrease. The arc voltage, which is an indication of the total electrical power input into the domain, settles down in the first millisecond and then maintains a value of SV. The arc temperature at initiation is 24000 K within a thin hot column~ This temperature is quickly reduced to l 1000 K in SJ. lS as a result of radiation loss from the arc column. The axis temperature inside the arc column at 30 ms is 8 S 00 K which is higher than the experimental value measured using a spectroscopic method. The possible reason for this difference could be the instability of the arc column which makes the measured temperature as an average value of the arc column. There exists a relatively large area around the arc core whose temperature is within the range of 4 S 00 K to 7000 K which is the temperature range from measurement. A quasi-steady state of arcing is reached within 30 ms of arc initiation. The loss of carbon vapour from the computational domain resulting from formation of solid carbon matters is considered by a flux controlled model. Results show that the major loss of the carbon species is at the arc edge which accounts for 99 % of the total carbon loss. The predicted arc column voltage is SV which is different from the measurement of 16 V. The difference is contributed to the <b>cathode</b> voltage <b>fall</b> which is in the order of the ionisation energy of carbon atoms (11. 26 eV). Taking this aspect into consideration, the prediction falls into the expected range. The biggest difference between the prediction and measurement is the water evaporation rate. The arc model prediction is only a very small fraction of the measurement. However, it is shown that the measured rate of water evaporation may be incorrect since even when the total electrical power input at the measured arc voltage is used, the amount of water vapour that can be created is only 12. 5 % of the measured value. This renders the water evaporation rate comparison invalid and further measurements are required. Future work is discussed {{at the end of the}} thesis. Three aspects have been identified that need to be addressed. The instability of the twin torch jet coupling may need to be simulated by a transient model. The cathode sheath is important in determining the whole arc voltage and therefore needs to be simulated using kinetic theory. The effectiveness of three dimensional modelling suffers enormously from the prohibitively long computing time because of the strong reiaxation that has to be used to obtain converging results. This naturally requires parallel processing given that high processing power PCs (2. lGHz Pentium Core Duo) have already been used for the present work.

These relatively new atmospheric plasmas are nonequilibrium plasmas with gas temperature around 100 °C and electron temperature in the 1 – 10 eV range. Their appearance is characteristically diffuse and uniform, and their temporal features are repetitive and stable. Of the reported numerical studies of atmospheric glow discharges, most are based on the hydrodynamic approximation in which electrons are assumed to be in equilibrium with the local electric field.

40|$|Surface discharges, as {{a special}} kind of barrier discharges, occur in {{arrangements}} with small but extended high-voltage electrodes on one side of a dielectric layer and a plane counter electrode on its reverse side. Surface discharges are used e. g. in excimer lamps, in plasmadisplays, for surface treatment of plastic foils and for plasma-chemical applications like ozone production. This work has the aim to model the dynamics of surface discharges and to simulate the spatial and temporal resolved discharge development in oxygen and air at atmospheric pressure. The discharge development is investigated at negative and positive polarity of the surface electrode as well as at AC voltage. Based on the results of the discharge simulation the ozone generation in surface discharge arrangements is analysed. The simulation results reveal a stepwise development of the discharge on the dielectric surface at both polarities in good agreement with experimental findings. In each discharge step, the accumulation of charge carriers on the dielectric surface leads to a reduction of the field strength and the decay of the discharge step. At increased voltage a further step can develop. The discharge development at negative polarity is dominated by a <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> mechanism at the metallic surface electrode. In the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> a maximum reduced field strength of about 2400 Td is found. The propagation of the discharge along the dielectric surface is combined with a field strength maximum of about 260 Td {{at the tip of the}} discharge. At positive polarity a positive streamer propagates along the dielectric surface in each discharge step. At the streamer head, a maximum reduced field strength of about 700 Td is found. In the streamer channel the field strength drops to about 10 Td. A <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> is found as well, which appears near the streamer head on the dielectric surface and has comparable properties as that with negative polarity.

At negative polarity this happens in the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall,</b> at positive polarity at the streamer head. Because of local over-temperatures of up to 80 K found at both polarities nearby the surface electrodes, nitrogen oxides are produced, which destroy effectively ozone in catalytic reaction chains.

The model describes the principle relations between the voltage, current, plasma density, and the axial structure of the discharge. Contrary to standard DC discharges, this discharge does not require electron multiplication in the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> to produce ions, but rather to satisfy the electron energy balance. A self-sustainment condition is obtained from the energy balance per electron-ion pair. From this, it follows {{that there is a}} maximum voltage at which the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> thickness tends to zero and the current density tends asymptotically to infinity. The discharge develops axial non-uniformity and an axial electric field in order to evacuate the created electrons to the anode, such that the characteristic time for transport losses is the same for electrons as for ions. The axial profiles of the current density, plasma density, and potential are obtained from the electron continuity equation. It is shown that additional energy absorption from the axial field, similar to electron heating in DC positive columns, modifies the self-sustainment condition and thus leads to a shift in the voltage-current characteristic, depending on the cathode length...|$|E

The definitive version (doi: 10. 1088 / 0022 - 3727 / 39 / 20 / 014) is available at: [URL] and ion kinetics in a micro hollow cathode discharge are investigated by means of two-dimensional axisymmetric particle-in-cell Monte Carlo collision simulations. Argon discharges at 10 and 300 Torr are studied for various driving currents. Electron and ion energy probability functions (IEPF) are shown at various times and locations to study the spatio-temporal behaviour of the discharge. The electron energy probability function (EEPF) evolves from the Druyvesteyn type {{in the early stages of}} the discharge into a two (or three) temperature distribution when steady state is reached. In steady state, secondary electrons accelerated across the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> populate the high energy tail of the EEPF while the low energy region is populated by trapped electrons. The IEPF evolves from a Maxwellian in the negative glow (bulk) to a two temperature distribution on the cathode surface.

Their design in based on pd (pressure 3 characteristic dimension! scaling; smaller dimensions are enabled by higher operating pressures with typical devices operating with pd 51 – 10 Torr cm. MD devices have exhibited behavior that resemble both Townsend and hollow-cathode discharges, with bulk and beam electrons providing the dominant excitation, respectively. In this article, {{results from a}} two-dimensional computational study of MD devices operating in neon using a pyramidal cathode structure are discussed. Pressures of 400 – 1000 Torr and device dimensions of 15 – 40 mm are investigated. The onset of behavior resembling negative glow discharges with decreasing pressure correlates with an extension of <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> accelerated beam electrons into the bulk plasma. For constant applied voltage, peak electron densities increase with increasing pressure as the beam electrons are slowed in more confined regions. The MD devices typically require higher applied voltages to operate at lower pressures, and so resemble discharges obeying Paschen’s curve for breakdown.

40|$|The {{negative}} glow of an {{abnormal glow discharge}} with a large-area cold magnesium cathode was investigated. In this kind of discharge an electron beam is formed in the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> region, the energy ranging between 1 keV and 2 keV. This beam produces a cold, nearly field-free plasma at a high density. A Langmuir probe was applied {{in order to measure}} the electron density, the electron temperature, and the plasma potential. In all cases when noble gases are used two groups of electrons are found. The cold group in helium exhibits a temperature of 0. 06 eV at densities between 10 " 1 " 6 m"-" 3 and 10 " 1 " 7 m"-" 3. The density of the fast electrons falls about three orders below that of the cold group; the temperature is about 3 eV. The electric field strength was obtained from the plasma potential. It does not exceed 50 V/m in the {{negative glow}} and increases to 400 V/m towards the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall.</b> The ion and also the electron beam current could be determined from the electron density gradient {{at the edge of the}} negative glow and from the current to the cathode. By solving the diffusion equation having incorporated the production by the beam electrons the density distribution of the cold group was obtained and agreement was found with the experimental results.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{presents}} a new approach {{to the understanding of the}} collision processes which occur in the vicinity of the cathode of the "cold cathode" arc of which Hg and Cu are taken as examples. The temperature at the cathode spots of such arcs is too low for electrons to be emitted thermionically. None of the theories hitherto suggested, such as the field emission and thermal ionisation theories, can account satisfactorily for the well-established features of the arc: the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> in potential which is often lower than the ionisation potential of the cathode vapour; the concentration of current at the cathode into a small spot where the current density is very large; the short re-ignition tins; the force on the cathode; the evaporation of the cathode substance; the light emitted from the spot; the temperature of the cathode under the spot and the heat losses from the arc, and also the transition to the arc from the glow discharge. Because of the abundance of experimental information which exists, particularly about the mercury arc, this study is essentially a theoretical one. The starting point in the study is to consider the density distribution in the space above the cathode of the metal vapour originating from the spot. Whereas it was previously thought that atoms evaporating from the spot would cross the evacuated vessel without collisions before condensing on the walls, it is suggested here for the first time that the evaporation is controlled by back-scattering of atoms and hence is a diffusion problem. In setting up the equation of diffusion for the steady state, allowance is made for the variation of the diffusion coefficient with the density of the vapour. The solution shows that a large density, corresponding perhaps to 10 atmospheres or more can exist close to the evaporating surface although the density elsewhere in the vessel is very low. Both the magnitude of the force on the cathode and of the net evaporation from the spot are consistent with this picture. The excitation and ionisation processes in the cathode region are consequently regarded as taking place In a dense vapour. On account of the low <b>cathode</b> <b>fall,</b> collisions between electrons and neutral atoms can only lead to excitation: ionisation can therefore occur only by step-wise processes. Electrons from the cathode gain sufficient energy in the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> to excite neutral atoms within a few mean free paths. Elastic losses are shown to be negligible. A large density of excited atoms is produced close to the cathode and these diffuse back to the cathode surface. Since the transit times of the excited atoms are shorter than their free life, they reach the cathode without losing their energy by radiation and there release electrons. This leads to a self-sustaining arc discharge. From a simultaneous consideration of energy balance and number balance, the yield for the emission of electrons by excited atoms is es- timated. It compares favourably with existing experimental and theoretical evidence. Since the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> of a mercury arc is larger than the resonance potential, electrons which have lost energy in an exciting collision can gain further energy in the remainder of the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall.</b> It is shown that because of strong interaction between the electrons an energy distribution is established, so that each electron from the cathode produces, on the average, more than one excited atom in the vapour. Since the density of excited atoms is high, collisions between them are shown to produce electrons and molecular positive ions. The reverse process, that is recombination of ions and electrons to form ex- cited atoms approximately balances the former process. A small difference is sufficient to account for the current of positive ions to the cathode. This current is associated with a positive space charge which predominates close to the cathode, and the ensuing electric field causes the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> in potential. From the known values of current density and <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> and the calculated density distribution of neutral vapour it has been possible to derive how the concentration of electrons, positive ions and excited atoms, and also the axial electric field vary as a function of the distance from the cathode. The transition of the glow discharge into the arc is discussed. It is shown that the final size of the cathode spot can be found from sta- bility considerations associated with the flow of excited atoms to the cathode. The short reignition time is explained in terms of the rapid neutralisation of the positive space charge near the cathode and the subsequent inability of the space-charge region to form when the external potential is re-applied. The light from the cathode region is attributed to the radiation from excited atoms which have diffused up into regions of lower vapour density. The observed spectrum of the spot is re-interpreted on the basis of the new picture. The above treatment can be applied to arcs other than the mercury arc with certain minor modifications. The copper arc is taken as an example. The second part of the thesis presents a new theory of the motion of a cathode spot in a transverse magnetic field. It is known that under certain conditions the spot will move in a direction contrary to Ampere's rule. This reverse motion usually occurs when the ambient gas or vapour pressure is low. If the pressure is increased, the direction of notion changes to the correct, or Ampere direction. The pressure at which the change of direction occurs is the greater the stronger the magnetic field and the lower the current. The effect is found only in cold-cathode arcs. From these observations it is proposed that the apparent violation of Anpere's rule is due to a local reversal of the magnetic field in the cathode region. The magnetic field acting at the cathode spot it thought to consist of two components. The first is the externally applied field, and the second is an opposing field due to the current loop in the deflected positive column. It is shown that the magnitude of the latter may exceed the applied field and thus the spot will be driven in the reverse direction. The behaviour of the arc at low pressure and with argon admitted is explained qualitatively. It is shown here that the reverse driving effect is not confined to low-pressure arcs, but occurs in open air between closely spaced copper electrodes. The separation of the electrodes is shown to be an important parameter of the effect, which supports the view that it is due to a distortion of the arc column rather than to some process occurring in the <b>cathode</b> <b>fall</b> region. </p...|$|E
