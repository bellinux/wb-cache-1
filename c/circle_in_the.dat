5|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional torus or donut shape. Consider a circle on this surface that goes once through the hole of the donut. An example is the red <b>circle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> figure. There are infinitely many circles like it on a torus; in fact, the entire surface is a union of such circles.|$|E
5|$|The musical began previews at Broadway's <b>Circle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Square Theatre on March 27, 2015, with an {{official}} opening on April 19, 2015. Gold directed {{the show on}} Broadway, with the same production team as the Off-Broadway production, including Zinn, Mefford and Stanton. The Off-Broadway cast reprised their roles on Broadway, except for the actors playing Medium Alison, John and Christian Bechdel. In December 2015, eight months after opening on Broadway, the show recouped its capitalization and began to make a profit. Costs for the show were relatively low due to a small cast and orchestra. The production closed on September 10, 2016, after 26 previews and 582 regular performances.|$|E

He continued to pursue stage work, landing an understudy job in 1969 in the Off-Broadway gay-themed play And Puppy Dog Tails, making his Broadway debut in 1970 in the Native American-themed production Brave and a co-starring role in the off-Broadway <b>Circle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Water, also in 1970.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} break into the Newcastle first team, Elliott joined Third Division club Darlington on 21 July 2000. He made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Rochdale on 12 August 2000. His first goal in the {{professional}} game came against First Division team Nottingham Forest in a first round first-leg League Cup tie on 22 August 2000 after scoring a penalty kick. In the second-leg on 6 September 2000, Elliott scored with a 50-yard strike from the centre <b>circle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 85th minute, which gave Darlington a 2–1 away win over Forest, and 4–3 on aggregate. He made 33 appearances and scored four goals before moving to Plymouth Argyle on a free transfer on 8 March 2001. Elliott's debut came in a 3–0 home win over Third Division league leaders Chesterfield on 10 March 2001 and he finished 2000–01 with 12 appearances for Plymouth.|$|E

Every point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane, except for the shared center, belongs to exactly one of <b>the</b> <b>circles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pencil.

5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The <b>circle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E
5|$|At this point, DE 18 heads east {{concurrent}} with DE 404 along Seashore Highway {{through a}} mix of farmland and woodland with some residences, crossing the Nanticoke River and passing through tracts of the Redden State Forest. Farther east, DE 18/DE 404 heads into Georgetown, running {{to the north of}} Delaware Technical Community College's Jack F. Owens Campus. The road intersects US 113 and the western terminus of DE 404 Truck in a commercial area and continues east. The two routes head southeast onto North Bedford Street, passing homes and businesses. The road intersects US 9 at a traffic circle called The <b>Circle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of Georgetown, where the Sussex County Courthouse is located. Here, DE 18 reaches its eastern terminus.|$|E

As the Doctor addressed them, the Royal Albert Hall audience shouted back responses. Manuscript paper fell to the stage as the Doctor was seen to feed his sheet music to the orchestra. When the Graske sneaked through the portal, he appeared in the audience carrying the Doctor's water pistol and squirting members of the audience. A cellist had to defend himself from an attack by the Graske who promptly exited as, on screen, the Doctor pulled him back to the TARDIS. The Graske in the audience was Jimmy Vee in costume and prosthetics.|$|E

5|$|The {{conjugation}} of the {{new field}} colours, especially the use of green, was not traditional in the Portuguese national flag's composition and represented a radical republican-inspired change that broke the bond with the former monarchical flag. Since a failed republican insurrection on 31 January 1891, red and green had been established as the colours of the Portuguese Republican Party and its associated movements, whose political prominence kept growing until it reached a culmination period following the Republican revolution of 5 October 1910. In the ensuing decades, these colours were popularly propagandized as representing {{the hope of the}} nation (green) and the blood (red) of those who died defending it, as a means to endow them with a more patriotic and dignified, therefore less political, sentiment. Although the flag flown from the Oporto city hall in the morning of 31 January 1891, symbol of the republican uprising was red and green.
