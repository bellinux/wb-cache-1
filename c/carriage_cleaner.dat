5000|$|On {{the evening}} of the 23 December 1901 a motor on a train pulling into the station fused, causing large amounts of sparking, which ignited a stack of wooden {{sleepers}} by the railside. The resulting fire spread to the train carriages and station and resulted in the deaths of six people; the train's guard and driver, the station foreman, a <b>carriage</b> <b>cleaner,</b> and two passengers. The general manager of the railway stated that the fusing would [...] "scarcely have caused Â£5 worth of damage" [...] if not for the wind which was blowing into the tunnel and fanning the flames. The station was closed for more than a year.|$|E
