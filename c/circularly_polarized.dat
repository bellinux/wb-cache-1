5|$|By that time, Reinitzer had {{discovered}} and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): {{the existence of}} two melting points, the reflection of <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light, {{and the ability to}} rotate the polarization direction of light.|$|E
5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E
5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E

25|$|Circular polarizers, also {{referred}} to as circular polarizing filters, can be used to create <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light or alternatively to selectively absorb or pass clockwise and counter-clockwise <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light.|$|E
25|$|First {{note that}} a quarter-wave plate always {{transforms}} <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light into linearly polarized light. It is only the resulting angle of polarization of the linearly polarized light that {{is determined by the}} orientation of the fast and slow axes of the quarter-wave plate and the handedness of the <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light. In the illustration, the left-handed <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light entering the polarizer is transformed into linearly polarized light which has its direction of polarization along the transmission axis of the linear polarizer and it therefore passes. In contrast right-handed <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light would have been transformed into linearly polarized light that had its direction of polarization along the absorbing axis of the linear polarizer, which is at right angles to the transmission axis, and it would have therefore been blocked.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to create <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light, the {{cheapest}} and most common involves placing a quarter-wave plate after a linear polarizer and directing unpolarized light through the linear polarizer.

It is demonstrated that a square aperture can mediate diffraction limited <b>circularly</b> or elliptically <b>polarized</b> radiation into an optical spot with circular or elliptical polarization beyond the diffraction limit.

25|$|The Faraday {{effect is}} caused by left and right <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> waves {{propagating}} at slightly different speeds, a property known as circular birefringence. Since a linear polarization can be decomposed into the superposition of two equal-amplitude <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> components of opposite handedness and different phase, {{the effect of a}} relative phase shift, induced by the Faraday effect, is to rotate the orientation of a wave's linear polarization.|$|E

The advantage of ROA, over conventional Raman, is the far more prominent stereochemical sensitivity. In the case of the Glasgow instrument ROA is achieved by measuring the small difference between the Raman intensities in incident <b>circularly</b> right <b>polarized</b> and <b>circularly</b> left <b>polarized</b> light.

40|$|Motivated by {{developments}} at HIGS at TUNL {{that include}} increased photon flux {{and the ability}} to <b>circularly</b> <b>polarize</b> photons, we calculate several beam-polarization/target-spin dependent observables for elastic Compton scattering on the deuteron. This is done at energies of the order of the pion mass within the framework of Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory. Our calculation is complete to O(Q^ 3) and at this order there are no free parameters. Consequently, the results reported here are predictions of the theory. We discuss paths that may lead to the extraction of neutron polarizabilities. We find that the photon/beam polarization asymmetry is not a good observable for the purpose of extracting α_n and β_n. However, one of the double polarization asymmetries, Σ_x, shows appreciable sensitivity to γ_ 1 n and could be instrumental in pinning down the neutron spin polarizabilities.

25|$|As a {{specific}} example, {{refer to the}} <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> wave in the first animation. Using this convention that wave is defined as right-handed because when one points one's right thumb {{in the same direction}} of the wave’s propagation, the fingers of that hand curl in the same direction of the field’s temporal rotation. It is considered clockwise <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> because {{from the point of view}} of the source, looking in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, the field rotates in the clockwise direction. The second animation is that of left-handed or anti-clockwise light using this same convention.|$|E
25|$|Although now obsolete, CRT {{computer}} displays {{suffered from}} reflection {{by the glass}} envelope, causing glare from room lights and consequently poor contrast. Several anti-reflection solutions were employed to ameliorate this problem. One solution utilized the principle of reflection of <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light. A circular polarizing filter {{in front of the}} screen allows for the transmission of (say) only right <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> room light. Now, right <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light (depending on the convention used) has its electric (and magnetic) field direction rotating clockwise while propagating in the +z direction. Upon reflection, the field still has the same direction of rotation, but now propagation is in the −z direction making the reflected wave left <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized.</b> With the right circular polarization filter placed in front of the reflecting glass, the unwanted light reflected from the glass will thus be in very polarization state that is blocked by that filter, eliminating the reflection problem. The reversal of circular polarization on reflection and elimination of reflections in this manner can be easily observed by looking in a mirror while wearing 3-D movie glasses which employ left- and right-handed circular polarization in the two lenses. Closing one eye, the other eye will see a reflection in which it cannot see itself; that lens appears black. However the other lens (of the closed eye) will have the correct circular polarization allowing the closed eye to be easily seen by the open one.|$|E
25|$|On {{the right}} is an {{illustration}} of the electric field vectors of a <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> electromagnetic wave. The electric field vectors have a constant magnitude but their direction changes in a rotary manner. Given {{that this is a}} plane wave, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the axis. Specifically, given that this is a <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> plane wave, these vectors indicate that the electric field, from plane to plane, has a constant strength while its direction steadily rotates. Refer to these two images in the plane wave article to better appreciate this. This light is considered to be right-hand, clockwise <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> if viewed by the receiver. Since this is an electromagnetic wave each electric field vector has a corresponding, but not illustrated, magnetic field vector that is at a right angle to the electric field vector and proportional in magnitude to it. As a result, the magnetic field vectors would trace out a second helix if displayed.|$|E

40|$|I {{show that}} Bruhn’s {{criticism}} of my {{article is based}} on misunderstandings on his part. Most of the criticisms of the Evans articles were given first in my works and in private communications to them. In ref. [1] G. W. Bruhn claims that he found errors in my articles [2, 3]. For instance, the following statements are made by Bruhn: “Since B(3) is merely the longitudinal component of a field B that has an additional transversal component B ^ Dvoeglazov’s result contradicts the well-known Lorentz transform of the electromagnetic field where the longitudinal component remains unchanged. ” “This result proves that V. V. Dvoeglazov Equ. (11 b) cannot be true. ” However, in actual fact, I frequently called B(3) “the so-called magnetic field”—note the inverted commas in the words “magnetic field ” (first line, page 228 of [3]). Next (see the 5 th line of page 230 of [3], just before equation (11 b), which Bruhn doubts) I state: “The 3 -vector B(3) (which is defined by (1) [by Evans indeed]) may not be the entry of the antisymmetric tensor field; it is [...] . the entry of some 4 -vector provided that the Evans’s definitions for <b>circularly</b> <b>polarize...</b>|$|R
25|$|In the {{instance}} just cited, {{using the}} handedness convention {{used in many}} optics textbooks, the light is considered left-handed/counter-clockwise <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized.</b> Referring to the accompanying animation, it is considered left-handed because if one points one's left thumb against the direction of travel, ones fingers curl in the direction the electric field rotates as the wave passes a given point in space. The helix also forms a left-handed helix in space. Similarly this light is considered counter-clockwise <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> because if a stationary observer faces against the direction of travel, the person will observe its electric field rotate in the counter-clockwise direction as the wave passes a given point in space.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{relatively}} straightforward way to appreciate why a polarizer which creates a given handedness of <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light also passes that same handedness of polarized light. First, given the dual usefulness of this image, begin by imagining the <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light displayed at the top as still leaving the quarter-wave plate and traveling toward the left. Observe that had the horizontal component of the linearly polarized light been retarded by a quarter of wavelength twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been linearly polarized light that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally polarized light were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the linear polarizer section of the circular polarizer it would clearly pass through given its orientation. Now imagine the <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light which has already passed through the quarter-wave plate once, turned around and directed back toward the circular polarizer again. Let the <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light illustrated at the top now represent that light. Such light is going to travel through the quarter-wave plate a second time before reaching the linear polarizer and in the process, its horizontal component {{is going to be}} retarded a second time by one quarter of a wavelength. Whether that horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength in two distinct steps or retarded a full half wavelength all at once, the orientation of the resulting linearly polarized light will be such that it passes through the linear polarizer.|$|E
25|$|When {{determining}} if {{the wave}} is clockwise or anti-clockwise <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized,</b> one again takes {{the point of}} view of the receiver and, while looking toward the source, against the direction of propagation, one observes the direction of the field’s temporal rotation.|$|E
500|$|Spiral coils, formed of helicoidally stacked {{cellulose}} microfibrils, create Bragg {{reflection in}} the [...] "marble berries" [...] of the African herb Pollia condensata, resulting in the most intense blue coloration known in nature. The berry's surface has four layers of cells with thick walls, containing spirals of transparent cellulose spaced so as to allow constructive interference with blue light. Below these cells is a layer two or three cells thick containing dark brown tannins. Pollia produces a stronger colour than the wings of Morpho butterflies, {{and is one of}} the first instances of structural coloration known from any plant. Each cell has its own thickness of stacked fibres, making it reflect a different colour from its neighbours, and producing a pixellated or pointillist effect with different blues speckled with brilliant green, purple and red dots. The fibres in any one cell are either left-handed or right-handed, so each cell <b>circularly</b> <b>polarizes</b> the light it reflects in one direction or the other. Pollia is the first organism known to show such random polarization of light, which, nevertheless does not have a visual function, as the seed-eating birds that visit this plant species are not able to perceive polarised light.

25|$|Generally speaking, and {{not making}} direct {{reference}} to the above illustration, when {{either of the two}} polarizations of <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> light enters the first quarter-wave plate, one of a pair of orthogonal components is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength relative to the other.

The linear polarizer sandwiched between the quarter wave plates is oriented so that it will pass one linear polarization and block the other.
