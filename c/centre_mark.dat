25|$|In 1975, {{in one of}} {{the most}} memorable grand finals ever, the Arthur Beetson captained, Jack Gibson coached Eastern Suburbs Roosters, {{defeated}} St. George 38–0 to win the premiership. That Roosters team is considered one of the best sides ever assembled and the eight tries to nil scoreline remained a record winning margin in a grand final until the 2008 NRL Grand Final played between Manly Warringah and the Melbourne Storm, Manly winning by the tune of 40–0. However, the game was famous for reasons other than the scoreline. St George's Captain-coach Graeme Langlands played with a misdirected pain killing injection that made his right leg go numb and prevented him from playing anywhere near his best. Easts were without two of their stars, rookie fullback Russell Fairfax and <b>centre</b> <b>Mark</b> Harris, and coach Jack Gibson gambled on an unknown player to help fill the void – John Rheinberger – who played in his first only first grade game in the Grand Final. Leading by only 5–0 at half-time, the Roosters scored an avalanche of tries after the interval to humiliate the Dragons. Earlier in the same season, the Roosters recorded the longest winning streak of any first grade rugby league football club – 19 matches. It was the Eastern Suburbs Roosters' eleventh premiership victory and their second in succession.|$|E

They {{did not use}} it, instead trading the pick to the Buffalo Sabres for their first round selection, 21st overall, and a second round selection, 42nd overall. With the 21st overall pick, the Flames chose <b>centre</b> <b>Mark</b> Jankowski from Stanstead College, in Quebec's high school program. [...] The pick was {{considered}} [...] "off the board", as Calgary selected Jankowski much higher than scouts predicted. [...] Jankowksi's rating by scouting services had been rising however, and the Flames were convinced {{that he would not}} be available to them when they made their second round selection. [...] Assistant General Manager John Weisbrod, who made the pick, said Jankowski was the most physically talented player available in the draft, while General Manager Jay Feaster predicted that he could become the best player taken in the draft.|$|E
