5000|$|The Alde Feanen {{is part of}} the {{municipalities}} Leeuwarden, Smallingerland and Tytsjerksteradiel. Its size {{is about}} 25 km2. Part of the national park is the lake area Princenhof (or Princehof). The Alde Feanen contains morasses, lakes, forests, peat and meadows. In the area at least 450 plant species and 100 bird species can be found. A very prominent bird is the white stork (<b>Ciconia</b> <b>ciconia).</b> Tall wooden poles have been installed so that the storks can build nests. Another attraction is provided by Shetland ponies. Some of the paddocks can be entered so that ponies can be petted by visitors.|$|E
50|$|In {{the coastal}} belt, bird species {{recorded}} are American flamingo on the beaches, and also many birds of prey. Migratory birds pass through Libya, and are seen mostly along the coastline. The most notable ones are the flamingo, Kentish plover in the Bengazi Reserve. Houbara bustard and the European white stork {{are reported in}} the Kouf National Park and in the beaches and lagoons. In the oases, desert larks, desert sparrows, and spotted sandgrouse have been reported. Other notable species reported are Aquila chrysaetos, Alectoris barbara, Pterocles spp. and Chlamydotis undulata with herons, ducks, waders, Ciconia nigra, <b>Ciconia</b> <b>ciconia,</b> and Milvus milvus (red kite) from the brackish lagoons.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} cultural and environmental features of Ribe. Among the cultural highlights are notable churches and museums. The flora and fauna, while depleted {{in large part}} from the man-made development and surrounding agricultural land conversion, retain notable aspects of the natural environment. The Ribe River flows through town and hosts certain elements of riparian habitat. Certain notable birdlife is found in and near the town; the European white stork, <b>Ciconia</b> <b>ciconia,</b> {{is one of the}} historic inhabitants of the town, choosing to build nests atop chimneys. This bird has steadily declined in population throughout Western Europe due to agricultural land conversion as well as droughts in its wintering range in Africa.|$|E
5000|$|The park {{is renowned}} for its {{abundance}} of birds with some 300 different species in total. Pallid harrier (Circus macrourus) and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) are occasionally recorded {{and there are a}} few isolated records for lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotus). Fox kestrel (Falco alopex) is not uncommon, while the African swallow-tailed kite (Chelictinia riocourii) is a not uncommon dry season visitor. The booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus) has also been recorded here. BirdLife notes that [...] "the Pendjari is notable for large conspicuous species such as African openbill stork (Anastomus lamelligerus), Abdim's stork (Ciconia abdimii), saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), and seasonally, flocks of up to 60 European white storks (<b>Ciconia</b> <b>ciconia).</b> The African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer) and Pel's fishing-owl (Scotopelia peli) can also be found." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{white stork}} (<b>Ciconia</b> <b>ciconia)</b> {{is a large}} bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. Its plumage is mainly white, with black on its wings. Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and measure on average 100 - 115 cm from beak tip to end of tail, with a [...] wingspan. The two subspecies, which differ {{slightly}} in size, breed in Europe (north to Finland), northwestern Africa, southwestern Asia (east to southern Kazakhstan) and southern Africa. The white stork is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to {{as far south as}} South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west, because the air thermals on which it depends do not form over water.|$|E

50|$|Despite its {{preference}} for ground-dwelling avian prey, a surprisingly {{considerable number of}} water birds may also be attacked. Waterfowl known to be attacked include the 1.18 kg South African shelduck (Tadorna cana), 1 kg yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), the 4.43 kg spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis) (Africa’s largest waterfowl species) and especially the peculiar, overly bold and aggressive 1.76 kg Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca), {{which is one of}} the main prey species for martial eagles in Kruger National Park. Larger wading birds are also fairly frequently attacked including herons and egrets, flamingoes storks, ibises, spoonbills and cranes. The diversity and number of storks taken is particularly impressive. They are known to take 8 species of stork, ranging from the smallest known species, the 1.08 kg African openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus), to the tallest species in the world, the 6.16 kg, 1.5 m-tall saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis). One naturalists observed up to a half dozen attacks in different parts of Africa on 3.45 kg white storks (<b>Ciconia</b> <b>ciconia).</b> Short of three attacks on spotted thick-knees (Burhinus capensis), which weigh about 0.42 kg, so far as is known small waders or shorebirds are ignored as prey. Other assorted avian prey may consists of ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks (frequently resulting in the immediate ire of protective ostrich parents), sandgrouse, pigeons and doves, hornbills and crows. Beyond occasional captures of other birds of prey (covered later), one other impressive avian prey species is the southern ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), which at 3.77 kg is probably the world’s largest hornbill. At the other end of the scale, some martial eagles may capture a few small social species of passerine, which are exceptionally small prey (the smallest recorded prey species for the eagle overall), potentially consisting of the 18.6 g red-billed queleas (Quelea quelea) and the 27.4 g sociable weavers (Philetairus socius), as practically every meat-eating bird in Africa may be attracted to these species’ colonial abundance.|$|E

40|$|Since 1991, a {{large-scale}} satellite traclung study of White Stork <b>Ciconia</b> <b>ciconia</b> has followed 75 individuals {{along the eastern}} migration route, which passes across Israel into eastern Africa.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in South-Western Wielkopolska, an area of 837 km 2. The area is highly diverse with regard to differences in land surface, the density of the hydrographical network, woodland cover and landuse. Field observations from 1973 to 2005 were conducted when White Stork <b>Ciconia</b> <b>ciconia</b> fledglings were leaving the nest, usually between the 10 th and the 25 th of July. The number of nests (HPa) on the study site fluctuated between 30 and 64. The mean density (StD) amounted to 6. 42 ± 0. 90 pair/ 100 km 2. A significant decline in breeding pairs was noticed, with a simultaneous increase in the mean number of nestlings per breeding pair. The most frequent reason for nestling death were adverse weather and fights for the nest with other storks. During the 33 -year research study great changes were noticed in the location of nests. The tendency to place nests on buildings and thatched buildings was declining. An increasing tendency appeared in the case of nests placed on poles and chimneys. In this paper we also present informa-tion on breeding colony extinction and a preliminary analysis of recovery information about ringed storks.
