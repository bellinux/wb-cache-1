25|$|One summer {{afternoon}} in 1895, his father <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> a fever and died later that day. Sanders' mother obtained {{work in a}} tomato cannery, and the young Harland was required to look after and cook for his siblings. By the age of seven, he was reportedly skilled with bread and vegetables, and improving with meat; the children foraged for food while their mother was away {{for days at a}} time for work. When he was 10, Sanders began to work as a farmhand.|$|E
25|$|The {{book also}} {{describes}} other farm work duties and events, {{such as the}} birth of a calf, and the availability of milk, butter and cheese, gardening, field work, hunting, gathering, and more. Everyday housework is also described in detail. When Pa went into the woods to hunt, he usually <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> a deer then smoked the meat for the coming winter. One day he noticed a bee tree and returned from hunting early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the honey. When Pa returned in the winter evenings, Laura and Mary always begged him to play his fiddle, as he was too tired from farm work to play during the summertime.|$|E

25|$|Rollini {{continued}} {{with music and}} by age 14 he was leading his own group composed of neighborhood boys, in which he doubled on piano and xylophone. Rollini left high school in his third year. He cut piano rolls for the Aeolian company on their Mel-O-Dee label, and the Republic brand in Philadelphia. When he was 16, he joined Arthur Hand's California Ramblers. Rollini was equally skilled at piano, drums, xylophone, and bass saxophone, which gained him the respect of Hand, who transferred the band to Rollini when he later retired from the music field. According to Arthur Rollini's book Thirty Years with the Big Bands, Adrian <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> a bass saxophone one day and in a week knew how to play it.|$|E
25|$|That {{summer and}} fall, the Ingalls again plant a garden and fields, and store {{food for the}} winter. Pa trades labor with other farmers so that his own crops will be {{harvested}} faster when it is time. Not all work was farming. Hunting and gathering were important parts of providing for the Ingalls as well. When Pa went into the woods to hunt, he usually <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> a deer and then smoked the meat for the coming winter. One day he noticed a bee tree and returned early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the honey. When he returned in winter evenings, Laura and Mary always begged him to play his fiddle; he was too tired from farm work to play during summer. In the winter, they enjoyed the comforts of their home and danced to Pa’s fiddle playing.|$|E
25|$|At Atlanta, Earnhardt Jr. <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> another third-place {{finish and}} at Las Vegas, he {{finished}} fourth, scoring his third Top 5 finish after taking two tires during green flag pit-stops with 30 laps to go. At Phoenix, {{he had his}} worst finish of the year, with a last place finish after a tire-blowout. At Auto Club, he finished 6th. At Martinsville, he also ran inside the Top 20 until a tire-blowout made him {{get involved in a}} massive pileup that destroyed the front end of his car. Because of this crash, he would go on to finish 36th. At Texas, he narrowly was beaten by Kevin Harvick for second place. At Bristol, he ran as high as third until a loose wheel put him down two laps down. Although he never got them back, he was able to bring home a 16th-place finish only two laps down. At Richmond, he ran in the Top 10 all day until he and Tony Stewart made contact but managed to finish 14th.|$|E

25|$|The Stanley Cup Finals {{were against}} the Edmonton Oilers, {{the first time}} in NHL history that two former WHA franchises had played against one another in the finals. The Hurricanes rallied from a 3–0 deficit in Game 1 to win 5–4 after Rod Brind'Amour scored with 30 seconds left. In Game 2, the Hurricanes shelled the Oilers 5–0 to take a two-game lead. The Oilers won Game 3 in Edmonton, 2–1, as Ryan Smyth scored the game-winning goal with 2:47 left to play. Carolina rebounded in Game 4 with a 2–1 victory, and <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> a chance to win the Cup on home ice. However, Game 5 saw the Oilers come back with a {{stunning}} 4–3 overtime win on a shorthanded breakaway by Fernando Pisani. In Game 6 in Edmonton, Carolina was soundly defeated 4–0; the only bright point for the Hurricanes was the return of forward Erik Cole from a broken neck that had sidelined him since March. In Game 7, before the second-largest home crowd in franchise history (18,978), the Hurricanes won 3–1, sealing the Hurricanes' first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history. Ward was honored with the Conn Smythe Trophy for the playoffs' most valuable player, becoming just the fourth rookie to be honored with the award. Several Hurricanes raised the Cup for {{the first time in}} their long NHL careers; Rod Brind'Amour and Bret Hedican had both played over 15 years without winning the Cup, while Glen Wesley – the last remaining Hartford Whaler on the Hurricanes' roster – had waited 18 seasons.|$|E

[...] Although Eckfeldt would have preferred to apply steam to the existing coin presses, a new one was built for steam power, and commemorative medals were the first pieces struck by steam at the Philadelphia Mint, in early 1836.|$|E

Charlene told Madge a story, so convincing that Madge believed {{she had become a}} grandmother. However, Charlene soon revealed that the baby was actually her half-brother Sam (Thomas Hamston; Scott Wealands). She explained to Madge that she had been helping to care for him, after his mother Susan (Gloria Ajenstat), turned to Charlene for help. Susan had had an affair with Charlene's father Fred, until he threw her out. Charlene knew Madge would not be happy looking after another woman's child, so she claimed he was her son. Soap Box author Hilary Kinglesy noted the situation helped expose Charlene's [...] "soft heart" [...] and her sensitive side.|$|E

A brief visit to Liège in September was {{followed}} immediately by a three-month round trip, to Scandinavia, Germany, Austria and Hungary, returning to England via Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, Berlin and Amsterdam. Her [...] "orgy of musical experiences" [...] included a Mozart pilgrimage in Salzburg, [...] performances of Der Rosenkavalier and Die Entführung aus dem Serail at the Vienna State Opera, Bach in Berlin and Mahler's Seventh Symphony in Amsterdam. On 1 February 1932 she departed again, this time for Italy. After a two-month tour Imogen <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> mixed views on Italian music-making. She concluded that [...] "the Italians are a nation of singers... But music is a different language {{in that part of}} the world".

2500|$|The IBM {{archives}} of Frequently Asked Questions notes an inquiry {{about whether he}} said in the 1950s that he foresaw a market potential for only five electronic computers. The document says no, but quotes his son and then IBM President Thomas J. Watson, Jr., at the annual IBM stockholders meeting, April 28, 1953, as speaking about the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which it identifies as [...] "the company's first production computer designed for scientific calculations". He said that [...] "IBM had developed a paper plan for such a machine and took this paper plan across the country to some 20 concerns that we thought could use such a machine. I would like {{to tell you that the}} machine rents for between $12,000 and $18,000 a month, so it was not the type of thing that could be sold from place to place. But, as a result of our trip, on which we expected to get orders for five machines, we <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> orders for 18." [...] Watson, Jr., later gave a slightly different version of the story in his autobiography, where he said the initial market sampling indicated 11 firm takers and 10 more prospective orders.|$|E
2500|$|Ian Botham {{was born}} on 24 November 1955 in Heswall, on the Wirral, to Herbert Leslie ("Les") Botham and Violet Marie, [...] Collett. Ian's father {{had been in the}} Fleet Air Arm for twenty years {{spanning}} the Second World War; his mother was a nurse. The family moved to Yeovil before Ian's third birthday after his father got a job as a test engineer at Westland Helicopters. Both his parents played cricket: his father for Westland Sports Club while his mother captained a nursing services team at Sherborne. Ian developed an eagerness for the game before he had started school: he would climb through the fence of the Yeovil Boys' Grammar School to watch the pupils play cricket. At the age of around four, he <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> a cricket ball and asked his mother [...] "Do you know how to hold a ball when you're going to bowl a daisy-cutter?" [...] He subsequently demonstrated the grip and went away to practise bowling it. He attended Milford Junior School in the town and it was there that his [...] "love affair" [...] with sport began. He played both cricket and football for the school's teams at the age of nine; two years earlier than most of his contemporaries. Playing against the older boys forced Botham to learn to hit the ball hard, and improve to their standard. At the same age he went to matches with his father, who played for Westland Sports Club, and if one of the teams was short, he would try to get a match. His father recalled that though he never got to bowl, and rarely got to bat, he received praise for the standard of his fielding. He joined the Boys' Brigade where more sporting opportunities were available. By the time he was nine, he had begun to [...] "haunt" [...] local recreation grounds with his kit always ready, looking to play for any team that was short of players. By the age of twelve he was playing occasional matches for Yeovil Cricket Club's second team.|$|E
