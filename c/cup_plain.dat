From 1937-1969, Finch Field was the home to many minor league teams. Hall of Famers such as Eddie Mathews once played for the High Point-Thomasville HiToms of the original Coastal Plain League.|$|R
5000|$|The Warroad Lakers {{are only}} the second American team in Allan Cup history to be Canadian National Senior [...] "AAA" [...] Champions. They won the 1994 Allan Cup on home ice, the next year they won the 1995 Allan <b>Cup</b> in Stony <b>Plain,</b> Alberta, and then won the 1996 Allan Cup in Unity, Saskatchewan to become the only team in history to win three {{consecutive}} Allan Cups. A season later, the Lakers failed to defeat the Powell River Regals in the 1997 Allan Cup final, which would have given them four in a row if won.|$|R
5000|$|The Maher Cup was {{donated by}} Edward John (Ted) Maher in May 1920 to the Tumut Rugby Union. Maher {{had just arrived}} in Tumut, from Young, as the new {{licensee}} of the Wynyard Hotel. [...] The <b>Cup</b> was rather <b>plain</b> and {{looked as though it}} should have a lid. It became known as 'The Old Tin Pot'. Although only Tumut and Gundagai competed in the first two years, it was an instant success. [...] After just three challenges under union rules, it was decided to change to rugby league, a newer, faster, more entertaining form of the game which had swept through the region from 1910. By 1922 crowds of 3,000 were common.|$|R
40|$|Research into {{a sample}} of Roman glass vessels {{represented}} in the York assemblages from the fortress, garrisoned cAD 71 -c 410, and from the canabae - the industrial area outside the fortress - provides both an insight into the usage and function of the York fortress vessels throughout almost all the Romano-British period, and a case study for future research. Investigations were carried out into the usage dates of the vessels in relation to those elsewhere in Britain, and, where applicable, elsewhere in the Roman Empire. The vessels functions were both discussed generally, and with reference to then fortress contexts. Many of the patterns {{were found to be}} common to both military and major settlement sites assemblages in Roman Britain. Analysis suggests that most of the vessels are of first to second century date; that utihtarian vessels and unguentaria play a minor part, mainly in the first to third century; and that the majority throughout the period are tableware, and comprise both highly decorated vessels and/or imports as well as those with lesser degrees of decoration. Uncommon patterns offer evidence for military use of glass vessels. They point to the bias in favour of beakers and cups, normally associated with villa sites; and of a preference for <b>plain</b> <b>cups</b> in the Flavian period; and for highly decorated first to second century beakers. The representation of a comparatively large number of good quality fourth century beakers and <b>cups,</b> both comparatively <b>plain,</b> and highly decorated imports, is, however, unparalleled on British sites elsewhere. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that while very highly decorated vessels, and/or imports, were used by the officers in the first to second century, in the later third to fourth century they may have been used mainly by the general soldiers...|$|R
500|$|The Hoxne Hoard {{comes from}} the later part of a century (c. 350â€“450) from which an unusually large number of hoards have been discovered, mostly from {{the fringes of the}} Empire. Such hoards vary in character, but many include the large pieces of silver {{tableware}} lacking in the Hoxne Hoard: dishes, jugs and ewers, bowls and <b>cups,</b> some <b>plain,</b> but many highly decorated. Two other major hoards discovered in modern East Anglia in the last century are from the fourth century; both are now in the British Museum. The Mildenhall Treasure from Suffolk consists of thirty items of silver tableware deposited in the late fourth century, many large and elaborately decorated, such as the [...] "Great Dish". The Water Newton Treasure from Cambridgeshire is smaller, but is the earliest hoard to have a clearly Christian character, apparently belonging to a church or chapel; the assorted collection probably includes items made in Britain. The Kaiseraugst Treasure from the site at Augusta Raurica in modern Switzerland (now in Basel) contained 257 items, including a banqueting service with sophisticated decoration. The Esquiline Treasure, found in Rome, evidently came from a wealthy Roman family of the late fourth century, and includes several large items, including the [...] "Casket of Projecta". Most of the Esquiline Treasure is in the British Museum, as are bowls and dishes from the Carthage Treasure which belonged to a known family in Roman Africa around 400.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 1997-98 {{campaign}} {{fan support}} was dismal for the Admirals {{who had to}} share the market with the popular London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League. To bolster the team for its second campaign, the Admirals took on a sponsorship deal from MacMaster Chevy in London. Despite finishing third {{in the league in}} 1998-99, London still had a record of 18-7-0-3. They won the right to compete in the national playdowns again and ended up in the 1999 Allan <b>Cup</b> in Stony <b>Plain,</b> Alberta. In the first game, the hometown Stony Plain Eagles flattened London 8-3. In the second game, the Powell River Kings avenged their 1998 loss with an 8-1 blowout over London. In the third game of the round robin, the London MacMaster Chevys lost 4-3 to Saskatchewan's Lloydminster Border Kings to close out the Allan Cup tournament without a win. This would be the last game London would ever play.|$|R
40|$|Purpose of the study. -Most {{studies have}} {{reported}} {{a significant decrease in}} periacetabular bone stock one year after implantation of a cementless cup. The purpose of this work was to study the bone-implant interface of the tantalum <b>cup</b> using <b>plain</b> X-rays and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Material and methods. -This retrospective analysis concerned 42 patients with a tantalum cup, Trabecular Metal (TM) (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA). All hips had primary implantations, performed by one surgeon via the same approach and with the same postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Minimum follow-up was two years. The Harris clinical score, and radiographic (lucent lines and acetabular position) and densitometric (analysis of 3. 3 mm of periacetabular bone in the three DeLee and Charnley zones) were recorded. Results. -At follow-up, the mean Harris score was 81. There were no implant malpositions (horizontal, vertical, inclination). Lucent lines were noted for 14 % of the cups. Bone mineral density (BMD) was higher than generally observed with cementless cups (1. 290 +/- 0. 309 g/cm(2)). Discussion. -The clinical and radiographic results are similar to data in the literature regarding correct implant position. The higher rate of lucent lines around the tantalum cup is also reported in the literature and {{is the result of the}} pressfit, resolving at one year. The greater BMD in zone 1 might reflect better force transfer to the weight-bearing zone. Conclusion. -As biomaterial recently introduced in orthopedic surgery, tantalum appears to provide a better force transfer to the central part of the iliac bone and thus possibly better preservation of pelvic bone stock.

50|$|Timber {{racing is}} {{conducted}} over solid and immovable wooden rail fences that, {{in the most}} extreme case, may reach five feet (1.5 m) high. The distances are longer, ranging from three to four miles (6 km), and the jumping effort required of the horse is much different. Because {{of the size of}} the fences and their solid and unyielding construction, a timber horse is trained to jump with an arc, unlike a hurdle racer. An important factor in success at timber racing is for the horse to land in stride, so that it can carry its speed forward on the flat part of the race course. This is harder than in hurdle races because the nature of the obstacle being jumped - if a horse hits a timber fence hard enough, it can bring it almost to a complete stop. Most notable US timber races include the Maryland Hunt Cup in Glyndon and the Virginia Gold <b>Cup</b> in The <b>Plains.</b> Timber races currently are not held at any major US tracks (since the fences are not portable) but can be found at almost all steeplechase meets.|$|R
40|$|Most {{mechanical}} {{failures of}} acetabular fixation within {{ten years of}} primary cemented hip replacement are attributable to a failure to achieve good initial fixation of bone and cement. Several {{studies have suggested that}} to achieve good fixation between bone and cement between 3 mm and 5 mm of cement penetration into bone is desirable. Whilst several acetabular cement pressurisation systems exist, {{little is known about the}} effects of cement pressurisation on the pattern of pen-etration of cement into cancellous bone within the pelvis. The current paper assesses the penetration of bone cement into bovine acetabular bone by various pressurisation techniques. We found that pressurisation with the use of a swab in glove or the DePuy pressuriser led to improvement in cement penetration both in terms of maximum depth and also percentage cover of the cup by cement (p < 0. 05). There was no significant difference in mean maximal penetration between the use of the pressuriser and the swab in a glove technique (p = 0. 3). If only a <b>plain</b> <b>cup</b> was used as a pressuriser, the penetration achieved was significantly lower in comparison to use of a pressuriser (p < 0. 02). When compared to previously documented acrylic models, the pattern of intrusion noted in the bovine model was different: penetration was lower at the equatorial and base regions of the acetabulum...|$|R
60|$|He mixed the {{shortening}} {{with the}} flour, and, adding water, {{he began a}} thorough kneading. When {{the consistency of the}} mixture appeared to satisfy him he took a handful of it, rolled it into a ball, patted and flattened it into a biscuit, and dropped it into the oven he had set aside on the hot coals. Swiftly he shaped eight or ten other biscuits and dropped them as the first. Then he put the heavy iron lid on the pot, and with a rude shovel, improvised from a flattened tin can, he shoveled red coals out of the fire, and covered the lid with them. His next move was to pare and slice potatoes, placing these aside in a pan. A small black coffee-pot half full of water, was set on a glowing part of the fire. Then he brought into use a huge, heavy knife, a murderous-looking implement it appeared to Carley, with which he cut slices of ham. These he dropped into the second pot, which he left uncovered. Next he removed the flour sack and other inpedimenta from the table, and proceeded to set places for two--blue-enamel plate and <b>cup,</b> with <b>plain,</b> substantial-looking knives, forks, and spoons. He went outside, to return presently carrying a small crock of butter. Evidently he had kept the butter in or near the spring. It looked dewy and cold and hard. After that he peeped under the lid of the pot which contained the biscuits. The other pot was sizzling and smoking, giving forth a delicious savory odor that affected Carley most agreeably. The coffee-pot had begun to steam. With a long fork Glenn turned the slices of ham and stood a moment watching them. Next he placed cans of three sizes upon the table; and these Carley conjectured contained sugar, salt, and pepper. Carley might not have been present, for all the attention he paid to her. Again he peeped at the biscuits. At the edge of the hot embers he placed a tin plate, upon which he carefully deposited the slices of ham. Carley had not needed sight of them to know she was hungry; they made her simply ravenous. That done, he poured the pan of sliced potatoes into the pot. Carley judged the heat of that pot to be extreme. Next he removed the lid from the other pot, exposing biscuits slightly browned; and evidently satisfied with these, he removed them from the coals. He stirred the slices of potatoes round and round; he emptied two heaping tablespoonfuls of coffee into the coffee-pot.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{time was}} 11.30pm. We reached the {{premises}} of HQ 'Operation Combine'. There were many officers of other services too. We were conducted to the conference table where Rohana Wijeweera was seated. I was given a chair just opposite Wijeweera across the table. I commenced {{having a conversation with}} him. Mr Ernie Wijesuriya, director, National Intelligence Bureau, his deputy and some others were present. I spoke to Rohana Wijeweera at length.Whenever I questioned him in English, he answered in Sinhalese. In fact, he asked me whether I knew the Russian language. I replied in the negative. Rohana Wijeweera told me that his second language was Russian. He told me all about his personal life, initially at Bandarawela and later at Ulapane in Kandy. He was reluctant to talk about the activities of the JVP.While this discussion was going on, the 'Operation Combine' commander was with his deputy in the adjoining room, which was his office. Just past midnight, the deputy Defense Minister General Ranjan Wijeratne walked in and sat {{at the head of the}} conference table. Gen Wijeratne asked few questions, but Rohana Wijeweera did not respond. Gen. Wijeratne joined the 'Operation Combine' commander in his office. We continued with our conversation. We had many <b>cups</b> of <b>plain</b> tea (dark tea), while talking. I made a request to Rohana Wijeweera to advise his membership to refrain from violence. He agreed after persuasion. So we managed to record his words and also his picture in still camera.After some time, a well-known Superintendent of Police arrived at the HQ Operation Combine. As the police officer walked in, he held Rohana Wijeweera's hair from the rear and gave two taps on Wijeweera's cheek. Wijeweera looked back, and having identified the officer said, 'I knew it had to be a person like you'. The police officer joined the Minister and Operation Combined Commander. We continued with our conversation. Wijeweera related a few interesting stories. One day, a group of JVP activists had visited the residence of Nimal Kirthisri Attanayake Wijeweera at Ulapane. They demanded money for their movement. Wijeweera responded quickly by giving Rs 100. The youngsters did not have a clue about their leader. Wijeweera was full of smiles when he divulged this story.The time was around 3.45am on 13 November 1989. I was informed to conclude the questioning and to take Rohana Wijeweera downstairs. Together we walked downstairs and were close to each other. Wijeweera held my hand and said, 'I am very happy I met you even at the last moment. I may not live any longer. Please convey my message to my wife'. Rohana Wijeweera's message contained five important points. They were all very personal matters concerning his family.Moments later, Wijeweera was blindfolded and helped into the rear seat of a green Pajero. Two people sat on either side of Wijeweera. There were others at the rear of the vehicle. Just then a senior police officer arrived near the vehicle. I politely rejected his invitation to join them. The Pajero took off. I joined Col Lionel Balagalle standing near the main entrance of the Operation Combine HQ building. We were having a brief chat when a senior officer came downstairs to get into his car. We greeted him. He was in a very good mood. But the atmosphere changed all of a sudden. A military police officer appeared in front of us. The senior officer blasted him for not accompanying Wijeweera and party. The military officer dashed towards his vehicle and sped away. The senior officer departed. We also went home thinking of a good sleep.Late in the morning I was busy getting Wijeweera's photograph printed. No one would recognise Wijeweera without his beard. So I had to seek help and add the beard to Wijeweera's photograph. It was done very well. Late in the afternoon there was a press conference at the Joint Operation Command. Minister Ranjan Wijeratne briefed the press. 'Wijeweera and HB Herath JVP leader had been taken to a house just outside Colombo, where the JVP had hidden part of their treasure. While the search was in progress, Herath pulled out a pistol and shot Wijeweera dead'. The minister went on to give more details. Subsequent to the killing of Wijeweera, violence by the JVP ceased gradually and there was peace in the country, except in the north and east." ...|$|R
