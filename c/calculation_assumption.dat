As we repeatedly emphasize, this material is not novel. Our intent is to provide a concise and rigorous summary of the WBE theory that is scattered across the literature. Minimization of energy loss to dissipation Lagrange multiplier <b>calculation</b> <b>Assumption</b> 6 of West, Brown, and Enquist (WBE) posits that natural selection has minimized the energy required for pumping blood through the vascular network. The benefit, presumably, is to free up as much energy as possible for other actions that might affect fitness, such as foraging, growth, and reproduction [1, 2]. In this section, we focus on minimizing power lost to dissipation that results from friction between blood and vessel walls.

40|$|Abstract. Extracting {{knowledge}} from gene expression data {{is still a}} major challenge. Relative expression algorithms use the ordering rela-tionships for a small collection of genes and are successfully applied for micro-array classification.

We have designed several spe-cialized genetic operators that search for the best tree structure and the splits in internal nodes which involve pairwise comparisons of the gene expression values. Preliminary validation performed on real-life micro-array datasets is promising as the proposed solution is highly compet-itive to other relative expression algorithms and allows exploring much larger solution space...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the issue}} of the European Directive on the “Energy {{performance}} of buildings ” estensive international research activities have been carried out on the elaboration and adoption of standards containing common methodologies for building energy performance assessment. One important item concerns the definition of a simplified method for the calculation of energy use for space heating and cooling (ISO/FDIS 13790). A simplified quasi-steady state calculation method is presented in this standard. A further validation is needed to apply this method to different building typologies and to different climatic conditions, and this should include comparison with detailed simulations as well as the analysis of different case studies. The results of a research activity that has been concentrated on the validation of this simplified quasi-steady state method, is presented in this paper.

Steel shell is pin supported along the edges, rectangular in the plan. Pin supported open shells along both sides, as the most frequently used in the construction have not yet been investigated.

40|$|Rotor discs for gas {{turbines}} are heavy components usually designed following a safe-life approach, where the low-cycle fatigue design {{is based on}} life curves with suitable probabilistic margins. However, in such a component, there is the possible occurrence of undetected defects that can propagate at each startup-shutdown cycle, and therefore, defect acceptance criteria have to be defined for the different rotor regions (considering stress distribution and temperature). Moreover, the failure risk should be evaluated considering static fracture at overspeed as a potential failure mode. In order to make such an assessment for a turbine rotor disc, a semi-probabilistic approach for the integrity assessment-based current standards has been developed. The approach has then been implemented into a code able to process axis-symmetric Finite Element (FE) analyses of the disc and to produce maps for the expected life (for a given defect size) and for the acceptable defect (for a target life). The probabilistic assessment of turbine rotor discs is first discussed together with a sensitivity study about the most significant <b>calculation</b> <b>assumptions.</b> Then, details of the semi-probabilistic code are shown together with application to a turbine disc...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is {{controlling}} {{the behavior of the}} bridge supports of the motorway viaduct WA- 164 on strengthened subsoil using soil-cement columns made in DSM technology. Monitoring of the construction was carried out for a period of 16 months by measuring the settlement and rotation of the structure. The settlements were measured by means of the geodesic precision leveling method. Changes in the rotation of the supports were recorded using a inclinometer sensors installed {{on the walls of the}} abutments. For mapping of the construction work, numerical models of span and abutments were performed. The abutment was modeled in computer program SOFiSTiK. The stiffness of subsoil was calibrated with regard to the measured settlement of the abutment on DSM columns. The results of field measurements shows that after backfilling the abutments, it leaned in the embankments direction. This is also confirmed by numerical analysis. Monitoring conducted in 2014 showed that settlement is stabilized, and the measured values are safe and lower than the SLS limit stage.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the potentials of zero total and free charge, pztc and pzfc respectively, were made in a wide pH range by using the CO displacement method and the same <b>calculation</b> <b>assumptions</b> used previously for Pt(1 1 1) electrodes in contact with non-specifically adsorbing anions. Calculation of the pzfc involves, in occasions, long extrapolations that lead us {{to the introduction of}} the concept of potential of zero extrapolated charge (pzec). It was observed that the pztc changes with pH but the pzec is independent of this parameter. It was observed that the pztc > pzec at pH > 3. 4 but the opposite is true for pH > 3. 4. At the latter pH both pzec and pztc coincide. This defines two different pH regions and means that adsorbed hydrogen has to be corrected in the “acidic” solutions at the pztc while adsorbed OH is the species to be corrected in the “alkaline” range. The comparison of the overall picture suggests that neutral conditions at the interface are attained at significantly acidic solutions than those at the bulk.
