5|$|Proto-Mayan {{is thought}} to have had a basic verb–object–subject word order with {{possibilities}} of switching to VSO in certain circumstances, such as <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> sentences where object and subject were of equal animacy and when the subject was definite. Today Yucatecan, Tzotzil and Tojolab'al have a basic fixed VOS word order. Mamean, Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek and one dialect of Chuj have a fixed VSO one. Only Ch'orti' has a basic SVO word order. Other Mayan languages allow both VSO and VOS word orders.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that the audience would not be offended by any elementary language, {{but the most important}} parts were clear and easily understood.|$|E

50|$|Romanian has {{terminology}} {{and rules}} for phrase syntax, which describes the way simple sentences relate {{to one another}} within a single <b>complex</b> <b>sentence.</b> There are many functions a simple sentence may take, their number usually being determined {{by the number of}} predicates. It is also noteworthy that Romanian terminology for the terms simple <b>sentence,</b> <b>complex</b> <b>sentence,</b> and phrase is somewhat counterintuitive. The Romanian term propoziție means as much as simple sentence (or clause). To describe a <b>complex</b> <b>sentence</b> (or compound sentence), Romanian uses the word frază, which can cause confusion with the English word phrase, which describes not a <b>complex</b> <b>sentence,</b> but a grouping of words. In consequence, Romanian doesn't have terms for the English noun phrase, or verb phrase, preferring the more commonly understood term predicate for the latter. The former has no formal equivalent in Romanian.|$|R
25|$|Child-directed speech also {{catches the}} child's attention, and in {{situations}} where words for new objects are being expressed to the child, this form of speech may help the child recognize the speech cues and the new information provided. Data shows that children raised in highly verbal families had higher language scores than those children raised in low verbal families. Continuously hearing complicated sentences throughout language development increases the child's ability to understand these sentences and then to use complicated sentences as they develop. Studies have shown that students enrolled in high language classrooms have two times the growth in <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> usage than students in classrooms where teachers do not frequently use <b>complex</b> <b>sentences.</b>|$|E

25|$|While {{there is}} no {{complete}} cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more <b>complex</b> <b>sentences.</b> Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often elicited {{as a result of}} stuttering, and consequently exacerbates stuttering symptoms. This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker's life.

Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly <b>complex</b> <b>sentences.</b> Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E
25|$|Elderspeak is a {{specialized}} speech style used by younger adults when addressing older adults. The speaker makes accommodations that include producing shorter, less <b>complex</b> <b>sentences,</b> using simpler vocabulary, filler words, fragmented sentences, lexical filters, and repetition. Elderspeak also includes using {{terms that are}} overly endearing, asking closed questions that prompt an answer, and using the collective “we”. Young people tend to speak at a slower rate and include more pauses when communicating with elders. This speech style is often patronizing in nature and resembles baby talk. Elderspeak stems from a reliance on stereotypes about cognitive abilities of older persons, and its use may {{be a result of}} or contribute to ageism, a form of discrimination based on age differences. Young people tend to believe that aging is associated with cognitive declines, including declines in language processing and production. However, this speech pattern is primarily based on stereotypes, as evidenced by its use in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. When conversing with older persons, younger people often accommodate their speech based on their personal evaluation of their conversation partner’s ability, rather than their actual ability. Working to overcome elderspeak through awareness and self-monitoring as well as through formal educational programs are strategies individuals and other care providers can use to promote successful aging for older clients. Therefore, although some aspects of elderspeak may be beneficial for some recipients, it is generally seen as inappropriate and can hinder intergenerational communication.|$|E

500|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>sentences</b> {{are formed}} in Khmer by the {{addition}} of one or more clauses to the main clause. The various types of clauses in Khmer include the coordinate clause, the relative clause and the subordinate clause. Word order in clauses is the same for that of the basic sentences described above. Coordinate clauses do not necessarily have to be marked; they can simply follow one another. When explicitly marked, they are joined by words similar to English conjunctions such as [...] ("and") and [...] ("and then") or by clause-final conjunction-like adverbs [...] and , both of which can mean [...] "also" [...] or [...] "and also"; disjunction is indicated by [...] ("or"). Relative clauses can be introduced by /deal/ ("that") but, similar to coordinate clauses, often simply follow the main clause. For example, both phrases below can mean [...] "the hospital bed that has wheels".|$|E

500|$|Khmer is {{primarily}} an analytic language with no inflection. Syntactic relations are mainly determined by word order. Old and Middle Khmer used particles to mark grammatical categories {{and many of}} these have survived in Modern Khmer but are used sparingly, mostly in literary or formal language. Khmer makes extensive use of auxiliary verbs, [...] "directionals" [...] and serial verb construction. Colloquial Khmer is a zero copula language, instead preferring predicative adjectives (and even predicative nouns) unless using a copula for emphasis or to avoid ambiguity in more <b>complex</b> <b>sentences.</b> Basic word order is subject–verb–object (SVO), although subjects are often dropped; prepositions are used rather than postpositions. Topic-Comment constructions are common and the language is generally head-initial (modifiers follow the words they modify). Some grammatical processes are still not fully understood by western scholars. For example, it's not clear if certain features of Khmer grammar, such as actor nominalization, should be treated as a morphological process or a purely syntactic device, and some derivational morphology seems to be [...] "purely decorative" [...] and performs no known syntactic work.|$|E

500|$|Latin uses {{morphology}} {{to express}} the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of inverse word order in questions, which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase [...] "John is talking to Lucy" [...] is turned into a question, it becomes [...] "Who is John talking to?", and not [...] "John is talking to who?". The latter example {{may be used as}} a way of placing special emphasis on [...] "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> are structured by grouping words together in units, called phrases, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels. To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence [...] "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.|$|E

40|$|Primary {{progressive}} aphasia (PPA) {{is characterized}} by distinct patterns of left-lateralized neural degeneration and declining language functioning. Although deficits in grammatical processing (e. g., <b>complex</b> <b>sentence</b> production and comprehension, production of grammatical morphology) are primarily seen in the agrammatic variant (PPA-G), subtle impairments also may be observed in the logopenic (PPA-L) and semantic (PPA-S) variants (see Wilson, et al., 2012; Thompson & Mack, in press, for a review). In cognitively healthy individuals, production and comprehension of syntactically complex structures involves both the left middle temporal cortex (Ben-Shalom & Poeppel, 2008; Indefrey & Levelt, 2004) and the left inferior frontal and motor cortices (Friederici, 2002; Kielar et al., 2011; Shapiro, et al., 2012; Tyler et al., 2005), with similar regions engaged for production of grammatical morphology. However, impaired <b>complex</b> <b>sentence</b> production and comprehension in PPA has been linked primarily to atrophy in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (Amici et al., 2007; Rogalski et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2011) and atrophy patterns associated with deficits in grammatical morphology have not been previously studied. The present study aimed to identify the cortical areas of atrophy associated with deficits in <b>complex</b> <b>sentence</b> production, <b>complex</b> <b>sentence</b> comprehension, and production of grammatical morphology in PPA.

2500|$|By early 1975 Genie showed {{comprehension}} of simple and <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> where {{the object was}} the relative clause, such as [...] "The boy {{is looking at the}} girl who is frowning", or sentences where the subject was the relative clause and did not end in a noun phrase, such as [...] "The boy who is frowning is looking at the girl". However, when interpreting a complex sentence in which a relative clause ending in a noun phrase came before the main verb, such as [...] "The boy who is looking at the girl is frowning", she interpreted the noun closest to the verb as the subject. The scientists wrote that this meant that she was using a word order strategy, which they considered progress because her earlier responses to them were clearly guesses. By this time Genie could only consistently count as high as 7 in sequential order, which came at the expense of her ability to do so via gestalt perception.|$|E
2500|$|Unusually {{for a first}} {{language}} learner, Genie never engaged {{in any kind of}} experimentation with language. Sometimes if Genie mastered an aspect of grammar she would not use it in everyday interactions, such as imperatives, and with many others, such as past tense or plural words, she only used the correct words or markers if separately and specifically asked. If someone asked Genie a yes or no question she often repeated part of the question or said [...] "no" [...] even if she clearly meant yes and shook her head the correct way, which Curtiss concluded was Genie simply repeating the last word of the sentence. By contrast, she frequently understood and responded to highly complex questions that she could not on tests, especially sentences requiring some degree of inference and sentences performing both a locutionary and illocutionary act. Her comprehension of other <b>complex</b> <b>sentences</b> remained inconsistent, although beginning in November 1973 researchers recorded slow but noticeable improvement.|$|E

His chronicles combined elements of literary portraiture, dramatic narration, and a dioramic scope. His poetry contained [...] "fresh and astonishing images along with deceptively simple sentiments". As an orator (for he made many speeches) he was known for his cascading structure, powerful aphorisms, and detailed descriptions. More important than his style is how he uses that style to put into service his ideas, making [...] "advanced" [...] convincing notions. Throughout his writing he made reference to historical figures and events, and used constant allusions to literature, current news and cultural matters. For this reason, he may be difficult to read and translate.|$|E
