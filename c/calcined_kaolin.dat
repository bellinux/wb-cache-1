Modification of the kaolin with an aminosilane coupling agent lowered its surface energy so that it was comparable with that of the polymer matrix and changed the surface from being acidic to being predominantly basic. The surface of the nylon was also found to be basic but susceptible to hydrogen bonding. Incorporation of the kaolin into nylon changed the mechanical properties and raised the modulus and toughness of the materials. Better results were achieved for the coated kaolin than the uncoated material and this correlated with the surface energy measurements. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT：Kaolin {{has been}} used as a raw {{material}} for the synthesis of NaY zeolite by in-situ crystallization technique. Three steps are involved in the reaction: (1) Aqueous slurry of fine kaolin is prepared. The spray-dried slurry is used to obtain the precursor microspheres with particle sizes 40 - 80 mesh. (2) The precursor microspheres are calcined to produce calcined microspheres. (3) Hydrothermal treatment of the mixture of calcined microspheres with aqueous alkali can yield zeolite NaY. The inherent properties of <b>calcined</b> microspheres of <b>kaolin</b> affect the crystallinity of NaY zeolite.

So it's necessary to improve the properties of concrete using fine particles such as mineral additions as a solution. These are currently used in the concrete to develop its performance and reduce consumption of clinker. This reduction will contribute to economic and easy way to solve problems related to the environment. In this work, an experimental rheological investigation was conducted to evaluate the performances of Algerian metakaolin MK on cement pastes. The latter is obtained from <b>calcined</b> natural <b>kaolin</b> found in large amounts in eastern Algeria (Tamazert- Milia).

At present the market price of MK in the country is about 3 – 4 times that of cement. Therefore the use of metakaoiln proves economical over that of silica fume. Previously, researchers have shown {{a lot of interest in}} MK as it has been found to possess both pozzolanic and microfiller characteristics (Poon et al. 2001; Wild and Khatib 1997; Wild et al. 1996).

40|$|Ordinary Portland cement {{concrete}} {{is a very}} popular construction material used in developed/underdeveloped countries. The basic ingredients of concrete are cement, fine and coarse aggregates bounded by water. Fine and coarse aggregates are generally inert materials which do not react with cement during hydration process rather act as filler material. Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete is good for normal construction; however, for industrial construction OPC concrete may {{come in contact with}} different types of aggressive environment such as acid producing or acid based industries, fruit and vegetable processing industries, underground structures subjected to water logging and salinity which results in degradation of concrete. Corrosion of reinforcement for exposed portion of conrete structure is also very important especially in case of concrete highway bridges or other important heavy structures. <bSupplementary cementing materials (SCM&# 8217;s) are commonly used to improve strength and durability of concrete. The incorporation of these materials also reduces the cost of the concrete. The most commonly used SCM&# 8217;s are silica fume, fly ash, blast furnace slag, metakaolin, rice husk ash etc. These SCM&# 8217;s are finer than cement and hence improve the packing of the concrete mixture, resulting in increased compressive strength. The durability of concete containing SCM&# 8217;s is improved due to the chemical reaction of various compounds present in supplementary cementing material with cement during the hydration process. The increase in replacement level SCM&# 8217;s by weight with the cement also influencethe strength and durability properties of concrete. Kaolin clay, a source of metakaolin; has been frequently used in pottery industry and it is abundantly available in Pakistan; however, it has never been used as supplementary cementing material by local construction industry.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} {{the extraction of}} alumina from <b>calcined</b> <b>kaolin</b> by leaching with boiling RCI in a train of three 50 -gal continuous, stirred reactors. Slurry discharged from the reactors con-tained an excessive amount of fines, which impeded solid-liquid separation. Autogenous grinding of coarse solids that accumulated in the reactors {{was the source of}} the fines. This report describes modifications to the reactors and to the operations that led to decreased fines generation and improved solid-liquid separation. Modifications to the reactors included custom-made impellers, the addition of a baffle system, a subsurface slurry discharge system, and slower rotation of the impellers. Concurrent testing of a continuous horizontal belt filter showed that the form filtration rates were increased from 350 to almost 1, 000 Ib/h+ ft- 2 when the modified reactors were used...|$|E
40|$|A B S TRA C T: An {{investigation}} of the acid-leaching of a <b>calcined</b> <b>kaolin</b> was made to compare the reaction kinetics of hydrochloric, nitric, and sulphuric acids. The acid concentrations u ed were 5. 9 and 8 - 6 normal. Reaction temperatures u ed were 95 ~ 80 ~ and 60 ~ C. Particular attention was given to finding a reaction equation which would mathe-matically represent the kinetic data. A nucleation rate equation of the general form, 1 In = kt ~, was found to represent these data. Values of m varied from 1. 10 to 1 [...] x 1 " 55 depending on the experimental conditions. Under the conditions employed the rate of alumina leaching is fastest with hydro-chloric acid, slower with sulphuric acid, and slowest with nitric acid. The rate controlling steps are proposed from the experimental evidence...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThermally {{activated}} clays, especially kaolinitic clays, {{are today}} revaluated {{as a source}} of supplementary cementitious materials to reduce the CO 2 emissions and energy consumption originated in cement production. In this work, the influence of different thermal treatments on the pozzolanic activity of raw kaolin with 98 % kaolinite and ordered structure was studied. Results show that pozzolanic activity of <b>calcined</b> <b>kaolin</b> decays when using a thermal treatment at high temperatures (800 ¡C) and high periods of residence (30 minutes). Furthermore, low calcination temperature (700 ¡C) must be corresponding with a residence time that guarantees a high dehydroxylation percentage. Sample treated during 10 minutes (94 %DH) was less reactive than the one treated during 30 minutes (96 %DH). Results contribute to the industry purposes to reduce the energy consumption, the CO 2 emission and to contribute with new alternatives of sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|Glassy carbon {{electrodes}} modified with Zeolite “A” {{were studied}} {{in order to}} evidence the adsorption of 2 -chlorophenol. Synthesis of zeolite was undertaken by a hydrothermal method using <b>calcined</b> <b>kaolin</b> as raw material. The zeolite was first exchanged with calcium ions. Then, it was modified with the cationic surfactant CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) or the non-ionic surfactant Triton X- 100 (t-octylphenoxy-polyethoxyethanol). Adsorption of 2 -chlorophenol was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, once it was adsorbed onto the modified electrode. Electrochemical {{results indicated that the}} films surfactant-zeolites were able to adsorb the 2 -chlorophenol from an aqueous alkaline medium. The best results were achieved when the cationic surfactant CTAB was used. The importance of electrode surface cleaning to guarantee the complete adherence between the vitreous carbon and the modified surfactant zeolite was determinated. Polishing and cleaning processes depend on the type of surfactant used...|$|E
