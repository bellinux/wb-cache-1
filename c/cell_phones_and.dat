5|$|Coordination {{of rescue}} efforts August 29 and August 30 were made {{difficult}} by {{disruption of the}} communications infrastructure. Many telephones, including most <b>cell</b> <b>phones,</b> <b>and</b> Internet access were inoperable because of line breaks, destruction of base stations, or power failures, even though some base stations had their own back-up generators. In a number of cases, reporters were asked to brief public officials on the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them any other way.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest II was remade for Japanese NTT DoCoMo brand {{cell phones}} in 2005. The remakes size was four times {{bigger than the}} {{original}} Dragon Quest port, and since phone capacity was limited, the game was divided into two parts. The first part was pre-installed in <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> the second part could be downloaded for free. The world map was provided by a pre-installed PDF file. In 2006 Japanese mobile companies BREW and SoftBank also started selling the game on their mobile platforms.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the game's {{mechanisms}} for contacting players grew more complex.

5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
5|$|Since his death, {{multiple}} {{people have}} been arrested for helping Clemmons {{during and after the}} Lakewood shooting. Authorities claim the accomplices misled police about his whereabouts, gave him <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> money, applied first aid to his gunshot wounds and tried to help him leave the state. Among those arrested were Clemmons' sister, who bandaged his wounds and provided him transportation. Authorities arrested five other people for assisting Clemmons: Letricia Nelson, Quiana Williams, Douglas Davis, Eddie Davis, and Ricky Hinton. Darcus Allen {{was arrested and charged with}} aggravated first-degree murder for his alleged role as Clemmons' getaway driver. Allen claims he did not know Clemmons' plans when he drove him to the coffee shop, but authorities argued he had known for days that Clemmons planned to murder police officers.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{studies have}} shown that exposing human semen samples to <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> {{radiation}} leads to a significant decline in sperm parameters. In daily living, a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> is usually kept in proximity to the groin, such as in a trouser pocket, separated from the testes by multiple layers of tissue. The aim {{of this study was to}} calculate the distance between <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> semen sample to set up an in vitro experiment that can mimic real life conditions (<b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> in trouser pocket separated by multiple tissue layers). For this reason, a computational model of scrotal tissues was designed by considering these separating layers, the results of which were used in a series of simulations using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. To provide an equivalent effect of multiple tissue layers, these results showed that the distance between a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> semen sample should be 0. 8 cm to 1. 8 cm greater than the anticipated distance between a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> the testes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} (i) {{the prevalence of}} conversing on a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> while driving in New Zealand, (ii) respondents' perception of risk regarding this behaviour and (iii) attitudes towards legislation banning <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use while driving. In addition, the study examined the association between the prevalence of conversing on a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> risk perception. Anonymous, self-reported, survey data was collected via the internet from 1057 drivers nationwide regarding the frequency of conversing on a <b>cell</b> <b>phone,</b> including hands-free <b>and</b> hand-held conversing, risk perception, views on legislation, and demographic information. A positive relationship {{was found between the}} frequency of conversing on a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> risk perception; that is, as the frequency of conversing on a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> increased, the perceived risk of this behaviour decreased...|$|R
