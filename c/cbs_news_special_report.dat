40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interaction}} capability of online news and presents an approach for modelling the presentation format preferences of different usage groups and {{for evaluating the}} differences among these groups. The paper demonstrates the influence of different interactivity attributes on the presentation format preferences of different usage groups. A site may present news in five different formats: instant <b>news,</b> <b>special</b> <b>report,</b> photo gallery, video-on-demand, and TV news. Interactivity is classified using three attributes: active control, synchronicity, and two-way communication. The models are tested with the data collected from 9, 653 members of a leading Taiwan-based news website and their 17, 731 choices. The {{results show that the}} readers are most likely to choose instant <b>news</b> followed by <b>special</b> <b>report,</b> TV <b>news,</b> video-on-demand, and photo gallery. The three interactivity attributes all significantly affect the choice probability. Synchronicity in particular has a relatively higher impact.

5000|$|A 2005 {{study by}} {{political}} scientists Tim Groseclose of UCLA and Jeff Milyo of the University of Missouri at Columbia attempted to quantify bias among news outlets using statistical models, {{and found a}} liberal bias. The authors wrote that [...] "all of the news outlets we examined, except Fox <b>News’s</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Report</b> and the Washington Times, received scores {{to the left of}} the average member of Congress." [...] The study concluded that news pages of The Wall Street Journal were more liberal than The New York Times, and the news reporting of PBS was to the right of most mainstream media. The report also stated that the news media showed a fair degree of centrism, since all but one of the outlets studied were, from an ideological point of view, between the average Democrat and average Republican in Congress. In a blog post, Mark Liberman, professor of computer science and the director of Linguistic Data Consortium at the University of Pennsylvania, critiqued the statistical model used in this study. The model used by Groseclose and Milyo assumed that conservative politicians do not care about the ideological position of think tanks they cite, while liberal politicians do. Liberman characterized the unsupported assumption as preposterous and argued that it led to implausible conclusions.|$|R

40|$|Communication {{has become}} {{increasingly}} multi-semiotic and particularly more visual. The shift from a culture dominated by texts to a visual culture is particularly observable in journalism. Besides images, design is coming into play as a crucial semiotic mode for making meaning. In <b>news</b> features, <b>special</b> <b>reports,</b> or data visualizations, {{we can find a}} rich and complex interplay of different semiotic modes, e. g., text, image, and layout, which constitute the meaning-making process. However, the multimodal interplay also entails tensions since design and journalism are different disciplines with different semiotic resources, practices, and ways of thinking. In our paper, we focus on the relationship between these two disciplines by using a multimodal approach for our empirical analysis based on social semiotics. In a case study, we will examine the role of design as a semiotic mode in journalistic artifacts and discuss challenges and opportunities of the relationship bet...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the hypermedia narrative of the <b>special</b> <b>news</b> <b>report</b> Battle of Belo Monte, published in the Folha de S.

The objective of the study is to identify the elements used in the composition of the hypermedia narrative and to check the level of interactivity that it offers users. As for the methodology, we focus on web content analysis techniques, from which two categories are established: narrative elements and levels of interactivity. The results of the study indicate that the absence of links on the textual part limits the public’s path through the hypermedia narrative, which could be much more dynamic. Although a higher level of interactivity occurs with an informative game inserted in the first chapter of the special, the other interactivity options is selection, in which the user chooses whether or not to view videos and photo galleries...|$|R
