5|$|John Eardley Wilmot (c.1749 – 23 June 1815) was Member of Parliament for Tiverton (1776–1784) and Coventry (1784–1796), and in 1783 led the Parliamentary Commission {{investigating}} {{the events that}} led to the American Revolution. He also led the processing of <b>compensation</b> <b>claims,</b> and the supply of basic housing and provisions, for the 60,000Loyalist refugees who arrived in England after the independence of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Not {{included}} in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning (brought on {{by the use of}} gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying <b>compensation</b> <b>claims.</b> The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached , enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases. A total of 42workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia Airlines {{would still}} be {{vulnerable}} to civil lawsuits from passengers' families. Compensation awarded (or settlements reached out-of-court) during civil trials will likely vary widely among passengers based on country of the court. An American court could likely award upwards of US$8–10million, while Chinese courts would likely award {{a small fraction of}} that. Despite the announcement that Flight 370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean, it was not until 29 January 2015 that the Malaysian government officially declared Flight 370 an accident with no survivors, a move that would allow <b>compensation</b> <b>claims</b> to be made. The first lawsuit related to the disappearance was filed in October 2014–before Flight 370 was declared an accident–on behalf of two Malaysian boys whose father was a passenger, for negligence in failing to contact the aircraft soon after it was lost and for breach of contract for failing to bring the passenger to his destination. Additional lawsuits against Malaysia Airlines have been filed in China and Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their normal weight counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' <b>compensation</b> <b>claims</b> as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year.|$|E

25|$|The legal {{circumstances}} {{regarding the}} Stolen Generations remain unclear. Although some <b>compensation</b> <b>claims</b> are pending, a court cannot rule {{on behalf of}} plaintiffs simply because they were removed, because, at the time, such removals were authorised under Australian law. Australian federal and state governments' statute law and associated regulations provided for the removal from their birth families and communities of known mixed-race Aboriginal children, or those who visibly appeared mixed.|$|E
25|$|After the British peace treaty, Eastman {{exchanged}} {{notes with}} the Thai negotiator, Prince Wiwathanachai Chaiyan, confirming that a separate treaty with Australia would be signed {{no later than}} 3 April. The government in Canberra considered withdrawing him from Bangkok at that point, but he urged his retention {{so long as the}} process for determining <b>compensation</b> <b>claims</b> lasted. He was not withdrawn until ratifications of the peace treaty were exchanged in May. In 1950 Thailand agreed to pay £6 million in compensation to the governments of Britain and Australia for wartime damage to their tin mining operations. The Australian share amounted to just over £1 million.|$|E

25|$|The mine {{returned}} to profitability during the 1920s but was beset {{by a series}} of difficulties, and then a falling lead price in the 1930s. A reservoir dam collapsed in 1927, sending a catastrophic flood through Glenridding village. Fortunately no one was killed, but <b>compensation</b> <b>claims</b> cost the company over £4,500, several years' worth of profits. A replacement reservoir dam, built at a cost of nearly £11,000, also failed in August 1931 and the reservoir was then abandoned. In the same month one of the shafts in the mine collapsed, and collapsed again in December 1933. The falling lead price led to a {{reduction in the number of}} employees, from 68 to 53 in February 1931, and down to 40 in July 1932.|$|E
25|$|Carmen {{decided to}} attend Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles and after graduating was {{accepted}} to Loyola Law School. During his attendance {{he was a}} member of the Phi Delta Phi fraternity. While in law school he became engaged to Geraldine Giesler, the daughter of prominent criminal defense lawyer Jerry Giesler. On January 5, 1955 Milano was admitted to the State Bar of California. Afterwards Milano moved back to Cleveland to pursue a career as an attorney. Mafia associate and burglar Phil Christopher described parties Milano would host at the Italian American Brotherhood Club in Little Italy, Cleveland in the late 1970s. The club was owned by Carmen's father and were attended by mobsters, businessman and politicians alike. During the 1970s Milano was paid a retainer for few, if any, legal services to Teamsters Local 410 and 436, which are labor unions that were allegedly controlled by Milano's father. Milano eventually was disbarred from practicing law in an incident involving fraudulent workers' <b>compensation</b> <b>claims.</b>|$|E
25|$|Galway's District Court is {{the main}} court of summary {{jurisdiction}} and hears minor cases without a jury. It is responsible for hearing small civil claims, certain family law cases, administers the liquor licensing laws and is responsible for indicting the accused and sending them forward for trial at the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court. The Circuit Court in Galway tries all indictable offences (those cases triable by a judge and jury), except murder, rape, treason, piracy and genocide, which are reserved to the Central Criminal Court. It can also hear appeals from the District Court. Its decisions can be appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Civilly, the court is limited to <b>compensation</b> <b>claims</b> of not more than €75,000. Both parties may waive this amount and grant the court unlimited jurisdiction. Divorce, Judicial Separation and probate cases can be heard provided they are within the financial parameters of the courts jurisdiction. Decisions in civil cases can be appealed to the High Court.|$|E
30|$|We {{calculated}} the following work-related statistics of injury risk, {{relative to the}} population of BC: (13) relative risk of work injury <b>compensation</b> <b>claim,</b> expected from occupational categories, and (14) relative risk of work injury <b>compensation</b> <b>claim,</b> expected from industry categories. We defined these two markers as in a previous report focused on worker compensation injuries. These two markers summarize the hazardousness {{of the distribution of}} the labour force among occupational and industrial categories. We also created four interaction variables, calculated as each of the employment-related risk markers (13 and 14 above) multiplied by the proportion of the population who were employed, and by the proportion who were in the labour force.|$|R

25|$|The route was {{finalized}} in the City of New York in 1890 and in Long Island City by 1891. Construction {{was started}} on June 7, 1892, as a NY project, {{and the bottom}} of the tunnel shaft was reached in December of the same year. As Steinway was the NY's biggest stockholder, the tunnel was named after him. However, soon after the start of construction, there were many complications. The project was difficult due to complex geological formations beneath the river, and there were frequent blowouts and floods. It was curtailed for a little while when five people were killed on December 28, 1892. At the corner of Vernon Boulevard, Jackson Avenue and 50th Avenue, a -deep shaft was dug, and on December 28, during an attempt to heat frozen dynamite in the shaft, an uncontrolled explosion claimed five dead and twelve injured. Numerous surrounding houses were heavily damaged. Due to high <b>compensation</b> <b>claims,</b> the Company was financially ruined. Attempts to raise additional funds failed because of the stock market crash of 1893. Work was stopped as a result, and it was boarded up. Investors refused to fund the tunnel because they feared that it was unsafe. Until Steinway died in 1896, some attempts were occasionally made to resume construction.|$|E
500|$|Although the Second World War {{forced the}} {{cancellation}} of many events, and {{made it difficult to}} feed all the zoo's animals, it was nevertheless very lucrative for the gardens. Profits steadily increased, and the company made several <b>compensation</b> <b>claims</b> for the requisitioning of its facilities. It was granted £4,000 in 1941 (...) and £7,242 in 1942 (...) in gratitude for the latter, the company presented the Civil Defence Service with a new mobile canteen.|$|E
500|$|Arnold {{then began}} {{preparing}} {{to evacuate the}} American garrison from Montreal. [...] Pursuant to instructions from the Congressmen he began seizing supplies from local merchants, issuing receipts for the goods that the merchants could use in <b>compensation</b> <b>claims</b> later. [...] These goods, which were marked to identify they supplying merchant, were shipped to Fort Chambly in early June. [...] Hazen, who owned property {{in the area and}} was in command at Chambly, refused to store the goods, believing them to be goods seized improperly from merchants he knew.|$|E

500|$|All {{states in}} the program require {{physicians}} to report pesticide-related injuries and illnesses; however, most states collect {{the majority of their}} data from workers’ <b>compensation</b> <b>claims,</b> poison control centers, and state agencies with jurisdiction over pesticide use, such as state departments of agriculture. [...] When they receive a report, health department officials review the information to determine whether it was pesticide related. [...] If it was, they request medical records and try to interview the patient (or a proxy) and anyone else involved in the incident (e.g. supervisors, applicators, and witnesses). [...] The data is compiled each year and put into a national database.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Senator Jesse Helms {{attempted}} {{to cut off}} financial aid to Nicaragua. [...] In his report to the Senate, he stated that the Sandinistas were still controlling much of the Nicaraguan administration and suggested that the Nicaraguan government replace all former Sandinista officers with ex-Contras, replace all judges, and return all property that was taken from US citizens during the revolution. [...] Chamorro's administration denied Helm's allegations while still trying to comply with his demands. [...] Helms managed to sway opinion in Congress and the US government denied Nicaragua the $104 million that had been promised for that year. The aid was cut-off and Helms' demands were put forward the month after Chamorro withdrew the <b>compensation</b> <b>claims</b> associated with the Nicaragua vs. United States verdict.|$|E
500|$|The {{management}} professor Peter Drucker credits Kafka {{with developing}} the first civilian hard hat while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute, {{but this is}} not supported by any document from his employer. His father often referred to his son's job as an insurance officer as a , literally [...] "bread job", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating <b>compensation</b> <b>claims,</b> writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums. He would compile and compose the annual report on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors. Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed. Kafka's father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store. In his later years, Kafka's illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term [...] ("The Close Prague Circle") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him.|$|E
