In the last group game, Germany drew 3–3 against Brazil; by conceding a last minute equalizer, Germany failed to win the group and subsequently {{had to face the}} hosts in the quarter-final. With 54,642 people in attendance, among them U.S. President Bill <b>Clinton,</b> <b>the</b> crowd at the Jack Kent Cooke Stadium was the biggest the German team had ever played in front of. Despite leading twice, they lost 2–3 to the eventual World Cup winners.|$|E

5|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, {{like most}} of the New York State Democratic establishment, Brown was a {{supporter}} of Hillary <b>Clinton,</b> <b>the</b> United States Senator from New York. This marked a break from his earlier political organization, Grassroots, which supported Barack Obama from the outset. He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In July 2008, Golisano announced that he would attempt to create change in Albany by spending $5million on targeted campaigns. During the New York state September primary elections for state office, The New York Times alleged that Brown was aiding Golisano's attempt to unseat Sam Hoyt in the New York State Assembly.|$|E

This began a two-month search process to fill her vacant Senate seat. Under New York law, the governor appoints a replacement.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado, {{large-scale}} search and rescue operations took place in the affected areas. A major disaster declaration was signed by President Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>the</b> following day (May 4), allowing for the state to receive federal aid. In the following months, disaster aid amounted to $67.8 million. In light of the fatalities that occurred under highway overpasses, the notion of them being safe areas to seek shelter was dismissed, and they were from then on considered {{to be one of the}} most dangerous places to be during a tornado. Reconstruction projects in subsequent years led to a safer, tornado-ready community. In May 2013, similar areas adjacent to the 1999 storm's track were again devastated by an EF5 tornado, resulting in 24 fatalities and extreme damage in the South Oklahoma City/Moore area.|$|E
5|$|Kenilworth Castle {{was founded}} in the early 1120s by Geoffrey de Clinton, Lord Chamberlain and {{treasurer}} to Henry I. The castle's original form is uncertain. It {{has been suggested that}} it consisted of a motte, an earthen mound surmounted by wooden buildings; however, the stone great tower may {{have been part of the}} original design. Clinton was a local rival to Roger de Beaumont, the Earl of Warwick and owner of the neighbouring Warwick Castle, and the king made <b>Clinton</b> <b>the</b> sheriff in Warwickshire to act as a counterbalance to Beaumont's power. Clinton had begun to lose the king's favour after 1130, and when he died in 1133 his son, also called Geoffrey, was only a minor. Geoffrey and his uncle William de Clinton were forced to come to terms with Beaumont; this set-back, and the difficult years of the Anarchy (1135–54), delayed any further development of the castle.|$|E

5|$|On Election Day, Perot {{finished}} {{in third place}} behind <b>Clinton</b> (<b>the</b> winner) and Bush. Perot received 19,743,821 votes, which accounted for 18.91% of the popular vote. He failed to win any states in the Electoral College because of the relatively even distribution of his support, but did win over 30% {{of the vote in}} Maine and 27% in Utah, finishing second in both states. Perot was the first third party candidate since George Wallace in 1968 to finish first in a county, winning counties in Alaska (divided into boroughs), California, Nevada, Colorado, Kansas, Texas and Maine. He won his largest percentage in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska and Loving County, Texas with over 40%. According to exit polls, 52% of Perot's supporters were male, 94% were white, 63% were aged between 18 and 44, and about 2/3 had not received a college degree. The income of supporters mirrored the general public. In terms of ideology, 53% identified as moderates, 27% were conservative and 20% were liberal, while two-thirds were either members of the Democratic Party or were politically independent.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary <b>Clinton.</b> <b>The</b> plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E
