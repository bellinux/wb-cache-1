5|$|The outer, {{light-emitting}} {{layer of}} a star {{is known as the}} photosphere. Temperature estimates of the photosphere of Wolf 359 range from 2,500 K to 2,900 K, which is sufficiently <b>cool</b> <b>for</b> equilibrium chemistry to occur. The resulting chemical compounds survive long enough to be observed through their spectral lines. Numerous molecular bands appear in the spectrum of Wolf 359, including those of carbon monoxide (CO), iron hydride (FeH), chromium hydride (CrH), water (H2O), magnesium hydride (MgH), vanadium(II) oxide (VO), titanium(II) oxide (TiO) and possibly the molecule CaOH. Since there are no lines of lithium in the spectrum, this element must have already been consumed by fusion at the core. This indicates the star must be at least 100 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to <b>cool</b> <b>for</b> one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E
40|$|Two commercially {{available}} egg yolk–based semen extenders, one marketed for human semen freezing (HEYE) and one marketed for canine semen freezing (CEYE), {{were used to}} cryopreserve semen from single ejaculates of 11 different dogs. For each extender, a 30 - and a 60 –min cooldown period was used prior to {{the addition of the}} extender containing glycerol and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen vapours. Sperm motility was measured using a computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) system. Sperm intact membranes were measured using SYBER- 14 and propidium iodide. Semen in the HEYE <b>cooled</b> <b>for</b> 60 min had a significantly greater percentage of intact membranes than the semen in the HEYE <b>cooled</b> <b>for</b> 30 min (p = 0. 02). Semen in the HEYE <b>cooled</b> <b>for</b> 60 min had significantly greater total motility (p = 0. 007) and progressive motility (p = 0. 004) than semen <b>cooled</b> <b>for</b> 60 min in the CEYE and semen <b>cooled</b> <b>for</b> 30 min in the HEYE (total motility p = 0. 02 and progressive motility p = 0. 02).

5|$|Winthrop Rutherfurd died in March 1944 {{after a long}} illness. Lucy {{continued}} to meet with Roosevelt {{in the months that}} followed more frequently. In June 1944, Franklin requested of his daughter Anna, who was then managing some White House social functions and acting as hostess, that she help him arrange to meet Lucy without Eleanor's knowledge. Aware of Rutherfurd's role in her parents' early marriage, Anna was at first angry that her father had put her in such a difficult position. However, she ultimately relented and set up a meeting in Georgetown. To her surprise, Anna found that she liked Lucy immediately, and the pair became friends. There were supposedly several dinners in the White House's second floor private quarters during Roosevelt's last year which were attended by Rutherfurd in a group with Anna's presence and obvious acceptance. When Eleanor discovered shortly after FDR's death from the female cousins of Anna's role in arranging for these meetings, the relationship between Eleanor and Anna became strained and <b>cool</b> <b>for</b> some time.|$|E

25|$|Another {{less obvious}} error can also occur when heating the dies. After being {{taken out of}} the {{annealing}} furnace, the dies must <b>cool</b> <b>for</b> 24 to 36 hours. They are usually given an oil bath to cool them more quickly, but the dies must still <b>cool</b> <b>for</b> a period of several hours. When the dies are cooling, if they are not stored properly or not allowed to fully cool before being used, the result is a much softer die. When the die is subjected to the hubbing press again and work hardened again, it will be softer and more susceptible to wear. If the die is softer because it was not fully cooled, it will not harden to the same standard as a die which has received proper treatment. However, {{there will not be a}} noticeable difference between a good die and a bad die; the change in the structure of the die does is not apparent until it is used for a period of time.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern {{part of the}} Sierras, {{from the}} Villa General Belgrano area to the Punilla Valley, was {{generally}} considered to be too cool and humid, following the old Argentine stereotype of hot-desert wine-making. Over the last decade, however, boutique wineries have discovered the potential of the exceptional variety of soils and micro-climates in the area, producing wines that have won significant national awards (some near La Cumbrecita, an alpine town that would have been considered too <b>cool</b> <b>for</b> vines recently). The scale of production remains minimal, but large numbers of new producers are experimenting with grape varieties and techniques to make wines that are significantly different from the stereotypical Mendoza Malbecs, often with great success. The large variation in elevation in the Sierras make them suitable for high-altitude wine experimentation, similar to what producers have done in Mendoza.|$|E
25|$|Through {{much of the}} {{few minutes}} {{after the big bang}} during which {{nucleosynthesis}} could have occurred, the temperature was high enough that the mean energy per particle was greater than the binding energy of weakly bound deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed. This situation is known as the deuterium bottleneck. The bottleneck delayed formation of any helium-4 until the universe became cool enough to form deuterium (at about a temperature equivalent to 100 keV). At this point, there was a sudden burst of element formation (first deuterium, which immediately fused to helium). However, very shortly thereafter, at twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the universe became too <b>cool</b> <b>for</b> any further nuclear fusion and nucleosynthesis to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, with the only change as some of the radioactive products of big bang nucleosynthesis (such as tritium) decay. The deuterium bottleneck in the formation of helium, together with the lack of stable ways for helium to combine with hydrogen or with itself (there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of five or eight) meant that an insignificant amount of carbon, or any elements heavier than carbon, formed in the Big Bang. These elements thus required formation in stars. At the same time, the failure of much nucleogenesis during the Big Bang ensured that there would be plenty of hydrogen in the later universe available to form long-lived stars, such as our Sun.|$|E

[...] The George Washington athletics website received the second-most views from Japan in terms of pageviews by country, behind only the United States.

They are thinking it's more difficult for Japanese to play in NCAA, but I'm playing right now, so I want to make other people come to the United States." [...] Although Asian players such as Matsui, Jeremy Lin, and Yuki Togashi had been the subject of racist comments in the past, Watanabe was yet to receive racial remarks in his first few years in the United States.

500|$|Bizet's {{next major}} {{assignment}} came from Carvalho, {{who was now}} managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872–73, Bizet supervised preparations for {{a revival of the}} still-absent Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at the Opéra-Comique.

500|$|Not One Less was Zhang Yimou's ninth film, {{but only}} the second not to star long-time {{collaborator}} Gong Li (the first was his 1997 Keep <b>Cool).</b> <b>For</b> this film, he cast only amateur actors [...] whose real-life names and occupations resembled those of characters they played in the film—as The Philadelphia Inquirers Steven Rea described the performances, the actors are just [...] "people playing variations of themselves {{in front of the}} camera". For instance, Tian Zhenda, who played the mayor, was the real-life mayor of a small village, and the primary actors Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike were selected from among thousands of students in rural schools.
