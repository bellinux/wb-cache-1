However, the changing landscape resulting from globalisation in the real and financial sectors call for a complementary framework {{based on the principle}} of nationality in order to shed light on new types of financial risks associated with international financial operations. The BIS has been collecting and disseminating data on international banking positions and flows for over half a century. This is done {{under the auspices of the}} BIS Committee on the Global Financial System on which the central banks of the most important financial centers are represented. The data include balance sheet positions of internationally active banks on both a residency and nationality basis with key breakdowns that are not available for other capital flow data, for instance in terms of currency as well as the country and sector of counterparty. Recently a number of enhancements have been agreed to the BIS data, such as the separate identification of non-bank financial institutions and non-financial corporation as the <b>counterparty</b> <b>sector.</b> Additional data will also show banks ’ domestic positions (and thus their total balance sheet). The new data will allow policy makers and market analysts to monitor banking positions and flows- and associated risks- in much more detail...|$|E

As we can see from Fig.  11, since QE, while bank lending activity(represented in red) has increased by the 5.83 %, bank financial exposures via debt securities (represented in blue) and equity (represented in yellow) to the euro area economy have decreased by 17.39 % and 6.26 %, respectively. Since the increase in bank lending activity was one of the intended intermediate objective of APP, we may interpret the increase in bank loans as a positive feedback of the implementation of Quantitative Easing. However, we wonder whether this increase is not too scarce against an injection of money into the banking system, that, at the end of June 2017, was equivalent to about 7 % of Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem total financial assets. Concerning debt securities, the decrease in bank security holdings, observed since QE, is not surprising, considering the massive purchases of private and public securities by the Eurosystem from the banking system. About the equity market, evidence on the Quantitative Easing implemented by the Fed suggests that the decrease in the returns of bonds, generated by the purchase programmes implemented in the US, made equity investments more attractive for investors, creating a great appeal for the equity market. [...] Despite the fact that our analysis does not allow us to observe the decline in the returns of bonds as a consequence of ECB’s QE, we can state that the decrease in euro area bank equity holdings seems to suggest that euro area Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem have not been subject to the aforementioned increased appeal for the equity market. As regards bank financial exposures via the analysed financial instruments broken down by <b>counterparty</b> <b>sector,</b> as shown in Figs.  12, 13 and 14, our estimate of growth rates of loans and deposits, debt securities, and shares and other equity held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem and received/issued by the different institutional sectors operating in the euro area provide us with the following findings. With particular reference to loans and deposits, as we can see from Fig.  12, since the implementation of QE, on the one hand, loans and deposits granted byMonetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem to i)Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, ii)Non-Financial Corporations, iii)General Governments, and iv)Other Financial Institutions and Non-MMF Invesment Funds have decreased by 9.07 %, 1.42 %, 5.22 %, and 6.81 %, respectively. On the other hand, Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds, Households, and theEurosystem have benefited from an increase in bank loans and deposits by by 3.17 %, 3.51 %, and 513.42 %, respectively. Consequently, the empirical evidence provided by our results on loans and deposits allows us to state that there has been an increase in bank lending activity, but mostly addressed to the Eurosystem. [...] Moreover, aggregated estimates on bank interactions with the financial sector and the real sector via loans and deposits provide us with empirical evidence on the increase of bank exposures to the financial sector by 14.71 %, and on the slight increase of bank exposures to the real economy by 1.28 %. Concerning debt securities, Fig.  13 suggests that, since the implementation of QE, only bank debt securities issued by Non-Financial Corporations have increased (by 14.84 %), while security holdings issued by all the other institutional sectors (i.e., General Governments, Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, Other Financial Institutions, and Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds), have decreased (by 14.26 %, 28.63 %, 11.46 %, and 18.07 %, respectively). [...] Moreover, a comparison between intra-financial and financial-real exposures via securities suggests that, since QE, bank interactions with the financial sector decreased by 21.44 %, while bank interactions with the real sector increased by 14.84 %. Lastly, estimates on bank equity holdings by issuing <b>counterparty</b> <b>sector,</b> represented in Fig.  14, suggest that, on the one hand, bank financial exposures via equity to Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem and Other Financial Institutions have increased by 14.40 % and 72.90 %, respectively. On the other hand, bank equity holdings issued by Non-MMF Investment Funds, Non-Financial Corporations, and Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds have decreased by 1.11 %, 22.42 %, and 22.41 %, respectively. Further, with reference to bank-financial interactions versus bank-real interactions via equity, it is worth mentioning that, while bank exposures to the financial sector have increased by 1.03 %, bank exposures to the real sector have decreased by 22.42 %. All in all, the empirical evidence coming from our investigation of the time evolution of financial linkages in the multilayer macro-network of the euro area reveals two main findings. First, since QE, there has been a comprehensive increase in the extent of bank interactions via loans and deposits, debt securities and equity with the different institutional sectors operating in the euro area. In particular, while both bank debt security and equity holdings have decreased, only bank lending activity has slightly increased. However, this increase is mainly due to the increased bank loans and deposits to the Eurosystem, rather than to the increased lending activity addressed to the real economy. Second, since QE, there has been an increase in bank exposures to the financial sector(by 3.56 %) and a very slight increase in bank exposures to the real sector (by 0.55 %).|$|E

40|$|We use data on {{loan loss}} {{provisions}} and total loans over the period spanning 1995 until 2009 to estimate a stress testing model for the Luxembourg banking sector. The sample encompasses the recent global crisis and covers {{a period in which}} the average probability of default of the Luxembourg banking <b>sector?s</b> <b>counterparties</b> is observed to increase significantly. A joint model, consisting of several macroeconomic variables and the logit-transformed probability of default, is specified and estimated via seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). The results suggest that counterparty default rates are significantly affected by the euro area real GDP growth rate, the real interest rate and a domestic property price index. Conversely, changes in the Luxembourg real GDP growth rate have a much smaller effect on counterparty risk. We attribute this to the large number of foreign subsidiaries operating within Luxembourg. The estimated model is then used to simulate values of the probability of default and the macroeconomic variables over a horizon of 10 quarters. This allows us to construct distributions for the probability of default under both baseline and adverse scenarios. From the results of these simulations stressed Basel II tier 1 capital ratios are calculated and compared to their associated unstressed capitalization levels. Our calculations suggest that, under all the given adverse macroeconomic scenarios, the aggregate Luxembourg financial sector remains above the 4 % minimum Basel II tier 1 capital requirement. Repeating the exercise on a limited sample of 5 individual banks produces similar results. financial stability; stress testing; Luxembourg banking sector; tier 1 capital ratio; counterparty risk...|$|R
40|$|Global real {{interest}} rates were driven {{up in the}} 1980 s, partly to encourage disinflation, while subsequently structural and conjunctural factors have driven rates to lower levels. The increase in the global pool of savings and the fiscal correction associated with the long economic expansion from 1992 to 2007 had put downward pressure on real rates and the extraordinary monetary policy responses since 2008 have sustained that trend into negative territory. The initial consequences of low real rates {{in the early part}} of this century had been to elevate asset prices, promote leverage in financial institutions and, as a <b>counterparty,</b> increase private <b>sector</b> indebtedness. The management of deleveraging by policymakers implies setting a low path for real rates along the yield curve by using a combination of traditional and non-traditional monetary and fiscal policies for as long as the economic dislocation persists. Facing a public and private debt overhang, low real rates help the adjustment of global balance sheets but cannot be driven low permanently by policymakers. My analysis suggests that there are two regimes for real rates; those for normal times are positive and vary with the global economic cycle, while those that deal with economic dislocation are negative. Once growth is secured, real rates will rise quickly to more normal levels, not least because, in order to limit any increase in funding costs that may result from capital inadequacy (apparent or real), banks themselves have a considerable appetite for capital, and that will also start to crank up real rates given a fixed pool of savings. It therefore seems likely that, over the medium term, real yields are likely to be in the range of 2 - 4 %, rather than their current levels...|$|R
40|$|Enhanced BIS {{statistics}} on credit risk transfer 1 From June 2011, the BIS credit derivatives statistics provide more granular {{information on the}} types of risks transferred through credit default swaps by different groups of counterparties. The new data suggest that reporting dealers have used some hard-tovalue credit derivatives to transfer credit risk to shadow banks, possibly exposing these counterparty groups to valuation risks. The data also show that some financial counterparties have sold protection against defaults in the same sector on a net basis. JEL classification: C 82, G 18. The BIS CDS statistics were enhanced in two phases First, a finer breakdown of financial counterparties was introduced Second, the types of risks exchanged with counterparties were decomposed Opacity about the location of exposures to failing financial institutions exacerbated the recent financial crisis. In particular, there was a shortage {{of information about the}} web of credit risk transfers through over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. To reduce that data gap, the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) proposed two sets of enhancements to the semiannual credit default swaps (CDS) statistics compiled by the BIS (CGFS (2009)). These have been implemented in two phases. The first set of enhancements, introduced with the June 2010 statistics, provides a finer classification of the counterparties of reporting derivatives dealers (Vause (2010)). The new data showed net credit risk transfers from hedge funds to reporting dealers and from reporting dealers to all other sectors. 2 This pattern persisted in December 2010 and June 2011 (Graph 1). The second set of enhancements, first applied to the June 2011 data, makes two further improvements. It decomposes total credit risk transfers with each counterparty group according to characteristics of the underlying debt (sector, rating and maturity). It also reveals the market values of credit risk transfers with <b>counterparties</b> in different <b>sectors</b> after netting of any bilateral CDS positions with offsetting market values. This identifies counterparty groups 1 The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS.
