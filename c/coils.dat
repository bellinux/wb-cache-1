5|$|As sensor <b>coils</b> {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} <b>coils,</b> but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the <b>coils.</b> The <b>coils</b> are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor <b>coils</b> placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor <b>coils</b> can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Early EMA {{systems like}} Hixon's had {{problems}} with accounting for tilting of the tongue during use as tilting of the sensor <b>coils</b> causes changes in the induced current that can skew data. In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three transmitter <b>coils</b> (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software to triangulate the position of sensor <b>coils</b> and account for tilt. However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for tilting of sensors past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if sensor <b>coils</b> are moved off the centerline of the mouth. In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that {{would be able to}} measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009. Zierdt's conceptualization placed six transmitter <b>coils</b> equidistant from each other. Because sensor <b>coils</b> are dipoles, when they are perpendicular to a transmitter coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the transmitter <b>coils</b> so that for any given rotation of a sensor coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three transmitter <b>coils</b> allowing for at least three transmitter <b>coils</b> to triangulate the position of the sensor.|$|E

5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading <b>coils</b> at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading <b>coils</b> and the line capacitance forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading <b>coils.</b> This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, a glance at the circuit diagram of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stent-assisted <b>coiling</b> and balloon-assisted <b>coiling</b> are 2 {{well-established}} {{techniques for}} treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms.

Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed. Sharper cut-offs and higher stop-band rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell were described by Zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.|$|E
