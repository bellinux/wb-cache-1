25|$|In the {{southern}} region, most farmers transplant around boundaries to the flood plains {{or on the}} plains between mountains. Farming {{in the region is}} slower than other regions because the rainy season <b>comes</b> <b>later.</b> The popular rice varieties in this area are the Leb Nok Pattani seeds, a type of Jao rice. Its paddy has the color of thatch and it can be processed to make noodles.|$|E

25|$|During {{her care}} visits, Charlotte {{talks about her}} {{religious}} beliefs to Ambrose. She believes strongly in all the vengeful parts of the Old Testament, {{but also in the}} forgiveness that <b>comes</b> <b>later.</b> Ambrose, for his part, reveals that his father was thrown out by his mother when he was young, and he only saw him again after his mother died – a possible atonement for his years of estrangement. Arthur's behaviour never improves, and he insults Charlotte for being ugly. Finally, on the third evening, Charlotte promises Arthur something he won't forget, and enters his room wearing a skimpy outfit looking mischievous. But as she leaves, she looks uneasy about what she has just done.|$|E

500|$|Cú Chulainn's {{appearance}} is occasionally remarked {{on in the}} texts. He is usually described as small, youthful and beardless.

500|$|Smart's A Song to David is {{an attempt}} to bridge poetry written by humans and Biblical poetry. The Biblical David plays an {{important}} role in this poem just as he played an important role in Jubilate Agno However, David in Jubilate Agno is an image of the creative power of poetry whereas he becomes a fully realised model of the religious poet. By focusing on David, Smart is able to tap into the [...] "heavenly language." [...] Many critics have focused on the role of David as planner of Solomon's Temple and his possible role with the Freemasons. However, the true life of the poem <b>comes</b> <b>later</b> when Christ is introduced as the major subject. After Christ is introduced, Smart attempts to [...] "reach to heaven" [...] and the final passages, to Neil Curry, represent a [...] "final rush for glory." ...|$|E
