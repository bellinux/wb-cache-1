Previous literature shows that contingent methods of payment other than stocks (e. g. <b>contingent</b> <b>value</b> <b>rights,</b> earnouts or convertible securities), even if they do not solve the information asymmetry problems, can mitigate their consequences. In this chapter, I examine the motivations and the effects of the inclusion of a contingent payment method the use of which has not been studied yet, the warrant.

We find statistical evidence of more affirmative responses in the referendum treatment relative to the individual contribution treatment, some weak statistical evidence of more affirmative responses in the referendum treatment relative to the provision point treatment, and no statistical evidence of more affirmative responses in the provision point treatment relative to the individual contribution treatment. The relative credibility of the three payment mechanisms is also examined. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Forested landscapes {{displaying}} {{evidence of}} timber harvesting have often induced conflicts between forest managers and the public. Potential conflicts with neighboring homeowners {{also has been}} increasing because of growing environmental concern and increasing numbers of neighbors. Analysis of previous studies suggests that people's reaction toward forested landscapes will be different depending on the attributes of scenes (including type of harvest method) and the settings. Previous studies also suggest that scenic beauty will be positively correlated to economic value. Values of forested landscapes were measured by surveying neighboring homeowners of Oregon State University's Research Forest and it's adjacent private forests. The survey was done by personal interviews using the scenic beauty estimate (SBE) and <b>contingent</b> <b>value</b> method (CVM). In the SBE survey, {{respondents were asked to}} rate the scenes of four types of timber harvests (clearcut, patch cut, two storied stand, and thinning) in both unspecified and backyard settings. In the CVM survey, respondents were asked whether they would make payments for scenic easements to prevent clearcutting along their boundary. Four types of easements were considered, corresponding to four alternatives to the clearcutting (original backyard scene, patch cut, two storied stand, and thinning). The result of the survey suggests that thinnings were most preferred, clearcuts were least preferred, and patch cuts and two-story were intermediate in both settings. The results also suggest that other attributes (i. e. tree density, stump, and bareground) affect the ratings of scenery. In the same type of harvest, the ratings of backyard settings were lower than those of unspecified settings. Only thinning was acceptable {{for more than half of}} the respondents in backyard settings of the four types of harvest methods. In the <b>contingent</b> <b>value</b> survey, about half of the respondents agreed to each scenic easement. However, the ratings of scenery and responses to the CVM survey were not correlated in this study...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{temporal}} stability of dichotomous choice (DC) <b>contingent</b> <b>values</b> and models and the implication of time related aspects for benefits transfer as a viable valuation method. From a practical point of view, time {{plays an important role}} in benefits transfer. Results are used from studies often carried out years ago and the obvious question is to what extent the estimated values and models stand the test of time. In the case of value function transfer, this implies testing the robustness of the estimated coefficient estimates over time. The novelty of the temporal stability work presented here is that two identical DC contingent valuation (CV) studies of the health risks associated with bathing water quality were carried out before and during extreme weather conditions causing the closure of bathing locations for public health reasons. Differences in <b>contingent</b> <b>values</b> and models before and during the extreme event are tested. The extreme event causes the seasonal good in question to become temporarily scarcer and marginal WTP is therefore expected to be higher during the extreme event than before, but not that underlying preferences have changed. Hence, basically two things are tested: the effect of time on stated preferences for a seasonal good and the effect of the extreme event on these preferences. WTP values before and during the event appear to be robust, also when accounting for substitution effects. The results before and during the extreme event remain transferable when accounting for theoretically expected factors in a simple multivariate transfer model. However, when introducing additional and contextual 'ad hoc' factors in the model, the estimated models and their random components become significantly different and hence not transferable, suggesting that unobserved preferences may not have been randomly distributed across the two surveys after all. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Past {{research}} has recognized the <b>contingent</b> <b>value</b> of corporate political ties but largely neglects their heterogeneity. Drawing {{on the political}} embeddedness perspective and literature on emerging economy political institutions, we develop hypotheses regarding how political networks comprising managerial and government ownership ties may have different valuation effects {{in the face of}} adverse political shocks. Examining stock market responses to an unanticipated, high-profile political event in China, we find a negative valuation effect of managerial ties to municipal government, but an insignificant effect of government ownership ties. Further, companies combining managerial and ownership ties experienced less post-shock reduction in market value than those holding only managerial political ties. These findings shed light on the values of different configurations of corporate political ties and inform firms of potential ways to manage ubiquitous political hazards in emerging economies...|$|R

40|$|Elicitation of valid {{statements}} of <b>contingent</b> <b>value</b> requires survey participants {{who are familiar}} with the environmental resource change. A primary purpose of the contingent market must be to assure familiarity by providing information. Information about resource quality is important when incompletely informed respondents, say nonusers, perceive resource quality which diverges from true quality. Differences in perceived quality and true quality can be influenced as respondents learn from information in the contingent market. By presenting survey participants with information about four wetlands of varying qualities we test for information effects in a dichotomous choice contingent market for wetlands allocation. We find that information about quality is a determinant of willingness to pay for wetland preservation. Information about resource quality presented in contingent markets will result in more valid valuations of changes in allocations of environmental resources. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the final}} speech of Plato's Symposium, the young, aristocratic Alcibiades accuses Socrates of being {{characteristically}} hybristu. This is a startling claim that requires explanation, in relation {{both to the}} rest of the Symposium and to Plato's broader ethical and metaphysical concerns. Previous interpretations of the meaning and purpose of Alcibiades' speech miss the main point: namely, the notion of a philosphical or Socratic hybris complements the discussion by Socrates-Diotima of the ideal nature of eros. Just as all desire in fact aims at eternal ends, so the Platonic philosopher acts 'hybristically', by typically asserting his own activity and insights vis-a-vis temporal, <b>contingent</b> <b>values.</b> Therefore, Alcibiades' speech should be understood in the context of a more general Platonic 'revaluation of values' that reorients traditional words and concepts towards ideal ends...|$|R

Furthermore, the availability of internal resources can either complement or substitute for collaboration depending {{on the level of}} collaboration. In particular, we find that availability of internal resources mitigates the effect of academic collaboration on knowledge creation when collaboration is moderate and complements it as collaboration becomes excessive. Thus, our study reveals the <b>contingent</b> <b>value</b> of collaboration and the interplay between internal and network resources.
