50|$|Downings Harbour in <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay</b> is fast {{becoming}} a world class big game fishing destination. Each autumn, sport fishing charter boats use Downings as the launching point for giant bluefin tuna fishing charters. See http://www.rosguill.com/fishing for additional information.|$|R
5000|$|Dunfanaghy (...) {{is a small}} town, former fishing port, and {{commercial}} centre in County Donegal, Ireland. It lies on Donegal's North West coast, specifically {{the west side of}} <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay,</b> on the N56 road (the West Donegal Coastal Route).|$|R
50|$|Glen Lough is fed {{mainly by}} the Owencarrow River {{entering}} at its southern end. The lake drains northwards into the Lackagh River, {{which in turn}} enters <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay.</b> The Owencarrow connects the lake with its southern neighbour, Lough Beagh.|$|R
50|$|The small harbour is {{protected}} on 3 sides {{and has a}} relatively short slipway which is used by fishing and pleasure boat owners, particularly during summer months. It provides access for boat owners to beaches in <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay,</b> {{many of which are}} only accessible on foot or by sea.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay</b> (Cuan na gCaorach) is a broad, shallow inlet on {{the north}} coast of County Donegal, Ireland. Bounded by the peninsulae of Rosguill, {{to the east and}} Horn Head (Corran Binne) to the west, the bay is {{relatively}} protected from the full force of the Atlantic Ocean, and has supported a vibrant herring fleet.|$|R
5000|$|Portnablagh ( [...] , meaning, {{depending}} on translation, either 'port of the flowers' or 'harbour of the buttermilk', possibly from the rough seas in the area) {{is a small}} village in County Donegal, Ireland. Portnablagh (also written in English as Port-na-Blagh) is located on Donegal's North West coast, specifically {{the west side of}} <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay.</b> It is on the N56 road.|$|R
5000|$|Creeslough ( [...] ; [...] , meaning ‘The Gorge’ or ‘Throat Lake’) is {{a village}} in County Donegal, Ireland, which is located 12 km south of Dunfanaghy on the N56 road, 54 m above sea level and {{overlooking}} an arm of <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay.</b> It is a small village, with {{the population of the}} surrounding area engaged mainly in agriculture, mostly livestock rearing, as little of the surrounding land is suitable for tillage.|$|R
50|$|Downings {{used to be}} a {{significant}} fishing port with a substantial herring fleet. Today, however, the economy survives on tourism, and only three crab boats make a traditional living from the sea. Situated as it is in <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay,</b> one of the safest anchorages on the northwest Irish coast, Downings has begun to cater for international game fishermen, the northwest of Ireland being on the migration route of bluefin tuna and other game species.|$|R
50|$|Doe Castle, or Caisleán na dTuath, at <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay</b> near Creeslough, County Donegal, was {{historically}} a {{stronghold of}} Clan Suibhne (Clan Sweeney), with architectural parallels to the Scottish tower house. Built in the 16th century, {{it is one}} of the better fortalices in the north-west of Ireland. It was here that Owen Roe O'Neill returned in 1642 to lead the Ulster Army of the Irish Confederate forces during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.|$|R
50|$|Horn Head House, or Landlord's House {{as it is}} locally known, {{stands on}} the <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay</b> side of Horn Head. The Horn Head estate was bought in 1700 by Captain Charles Stewart, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Boyne, who {{commissioned}} William Wray of Ards to build the present house in 1701, when it was the largest house in the Dunfanaghy area. Stewart was appointed High Sheriff of Donegal for 1707-08. It remained the seat of the Stewarts of Horn Head, several of whom were also High Sheriffs, from then until 1935. It has been empty since then.|$|R
50|$|Rosguill (Irish {{language}} and official name: Ros Goill) is a peninsula situated in north-north-west County Donegal, Ireland. Lying between the peninsulae of Fanad {{to the east}} and Horn Head to the west, Rosguill is a dichotomy of heathland and ocean. With the great <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay</b> with its mellow waters and pure-white strands on the one hand, and the treacherous sand banks of Mulroy Bay on the other. Between, a mixture of bog, hill and pastureland, the ancient walls, remnants of cattle enclosures, and the various evidences of fortification are proof of the area's use since antiquity. The Parish of Rosguill is an alternative name for the Parish of Mevagh, which covers the peninsula and an equally sized hinterland.|$|R
50|$|At {{the request}} of John Devoy, {{the leader of the}} Clan na Gael, and Tom Clarke, the {{architect}} of the Easter Rising, James returned to Ireland in 1915, while recovering from Typhoid fever He served as a company captain, recruiter, organiser, trainer and the Commandant of the Doe Battalion in Donegal County. In February, 1916, in an effort to improve morale and attract new recruits to the Volunteers, James, along with IRB member Daniel Kelly, organised a rally at Doe Castle at <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay,</b> near Creeslough. Patrick Pearse, the spokesman of the Rising, was scheduled to attend, however the planning of the forthcoming events in Dublin prevented him from travelling at that time. Two months later, on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, during the Easter Rising, Contrary to instructions from Eoin MacNeill, James and Daniel mobilised a group of 33 men in Creeslough and awaited further orders, which never arrived. Due to poor communication and conflicting commands, the group never mobilised. Although similar groups formed throughout the country, the bulk of the fighting was contained within the city limits of Dublin.|$|R
50|$|The {{forest park}} is {{situated}} on the small Ards Peninsula. It sits {{on the shores of}} <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay</b> on the northern coastline of County Donegal, Ireland. It's to be found on the N56 road, between Creeslough and Dunfanaghy. Ards Forest Park was formerly part of the Ards Estate, a country estate purchased by Alexander Stewart in the 1780s. The Ards Estate, centered on Ards House (demolished in the early 1960s), was owned by the Stewart family up until the early 1930s. The last member of the Stewart family to own the estate was Lady Ena Stewart-Bam, who inherited from her grandfather around 1904. She was the wife of Lt. Col. Sir Pieter C. van B. Stewart-Bam, Kt., O.B.E., a South African soldier, politician and businessman whom she married in 1910. Today, the forest park is 481 hectares in area and contains a range of wildlife and plant forms. It also has nature walks, sandy beaches, viewing points as well as a picnic and play area. The forest park is now owned by Coillte, a State body.|$|R

40|$|Doe Castle a National Monument {{has been}} {{considered}} by {{many people in the}} local community as a built heritage that has potential to be further developed in the interest of tourism and {{for the benefit of the}} local people in <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay.</b> It is acknowledge that heritage can bring economic benefits to rural regions, and the development of Doe Castle into a heritage centre would heighten the profile of this area and bring greater tourism acclaim by further enhancing the offerings to visitors that visit or may consider visiting County Donegal and this region. This dissertation focuses on the understanding of heritage, the features of a heritage tourist, the importance of management and sustainability and how marketing plays an overall role in the development of a heritage site. A further focus is on the importance of stakeholders working together in partnership, understanding that there can be conflicts within this partnership that must be managed if a successful outcome is to be achieved. An extensive study was carried out on relevant literature and practical research was implemented, the latter involved three methods of primary research, a survey, semi-structure in-depth interviews and focus group interview. The survey findings gave an overview of the profile, perceptions and views of visitors that visited Glenveagh National Park, a destination that is both a natural reserve and a place of heritage, it provided an understanding of the relationship that the heritage/cultural tourist has with the visited site and reinforced opinions taken from the literary review. It also confirmed that when a site is managed well visitors return again and promote the site by word of mouth a most powerful marketing tool. Appreciating the views of the various stakeholders both the government bodies that have charge of the site and the local communities have shown that small steps will be necessary over several years to achieve the full potential development of Doe Castle. The willingness of all the stakeholders to consider development ideas and work together was a positive finding. The conclusion shows that the stakeholders including potential visitors will gain positively from the development of Doe Castle. The government bodies directly in charge of the site will benefit from further conservation/preservation, the local community from extra visitors and another local attraction, and Failte Ireland from an improved offering in <b>Sheephaven</b> <b>Bay</b> which will further enhance Donegal’s future as a vibrant tourist destination. II If sustainability is to be achieved at the site it will require a good story, excellent management, the right target market and overall marketing. It was discovered that some visitors to Glenveagh National Park were interested in Doe Castle and the Park would be willing to partner with the site in the future. The recommendations are to bring together members of the local community and various government bodies interested in this project. Create a long term vision for Doe Castle with short term gains along the way that will help advance the project gradually and sustainably. Gain understanding of the target market that would suit the site and how they can be reached and further investigate similar sites in Ireland or abroad and learn from their experiences...|$|R

50|$|Six torpedoes {{fired by}} Ghazi are avoided by S21 through simple depth {{changing}} manoeuvers. Ghazi by now has depleted its aft torpedoes. After Ghazi's sixth aft torpedo is fired, the critically damaged S21 dives to 350m {{so that it}} is no longer within Ghazi's sonar range. This is despite the S21 being only designed for a maximum of 250m depth. S21 also has very limited battery support for it to stay hidden from Ghazi. Captain Razak also decides to play the waiting game, although he is not aware of S21's dire situation. With time running out, Arjun decides to instigate Ghazi into attacking by transmitting his crew singing 'Saare Jahaan se Achchha' and the Indian National Anthem. Riled up by S21's defiance, Razak orders another torpedo attack on S21, for which Ghazi will have to turn by 180 degrees so that it can use it's bow torpedoes. Unknown to Razak, with this manoeuver Ghazi is now inside S21's extremely restricted aft torpedoes firing path. However, S21's aft torpedoes by now only can be launched manually due to <b>Compartment</b> <b>1</b> being totally flooded. Arjun, decides to dive into <b>Compartment</b> <b>1</b> to manually trigger the torpedoes, knowing that he might drown in the process. Arjun dives into <b>Compartment</b> <b>1</b> and successfully triggers an aft torpedo. Ghazi also launches its bow torpedo at the same time. The Ghazi torpedo misses S21 narrowly, but it is hit by S21 aft torpedo and disintegrates in water, thus ending the stand-off. Arjun is later saved alive from the flooded <b>Compartment</b> <b>1.</b> The movie ends with XO Devraj waving the national flag on a surfaced S21, signalling an Indian Navy Vessel. The epilogue indicates that the day after the Ghazi incident, Pakistani fighters bomb Indian airfields, marking the beginning of the 1971 Indo-Pak war for liberation of Bangladesh.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} β-amyloid {{aggregates}} on activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) {{which is responsible}} for synthesizing acetylcholine (ACh) in human brain is investigated through the two-enzyme/two-compartment (2 E 2 C) model where the presynaptic neuron is considered as <b>compartment</b> <b>1</b> while both the synaptic cleft and the postsynaptic neuron are considered as compartment 2 through suggesting three different kinetic mechanisms for the inhibition effect. It is found that the incorporation of ChAT inhibition by β-amyloid aggregates into the 2 E 2 C model is able to yield dynamic solutions for concentrations of generated β-amyloid, ACh, choline, acetate, and pH in addition to the rates of ACh synthesis and ACh hydrolysis in <b>compartments</b> <b>1</b> and 2. It is observed that ChAT activity needs a high concentration of β-amyloid aggregates production rate. It is found that ChAT activity is reduced significantly when neurons are exposed to high levels of β-amyloid aggregates leading to reduction in levels of ACh {{which is one of the}} most significant physiological symptoms of AD. Furthermore, the system of ACh neurocycle is dominated by the oscillatory behavior when ChAT enzyme is completely inhibited by β-amyloid. It is observed that the direct inactivation of ChAT by β-amyloid aggregates may be a probable mechanism contributing to the development of AD...|$|R
