25|$|The SS20 <b>Cervo</b> {{received}} a very minor facelift in 1978, consisting mainly of interior upgrades. In June 1982, the rear-engined <b>Cervo</b> was discontinued {{in favor of}} a more conventionally laid out replacement, the SS40. In Chile the <b>Cervo</b> was originally only sold with the 970cc F10A engine; a May 1979 drastic lowering on tariffs on cars of less than 850cc meant that the 797cc F8A inline-four became available in that market. The chassis code of this model is SC80. This was sold alongside a better equipped model with the 1 litre F10A as used in the SC100.|$|E
25|$|The Suzuki <b>Cervo</b> is a kei car {{manufactured}} by Suzuki Motor Corporation. Introduced in 1976 as {{the successor to}} the Suzuki Fronte Coupé, the <b>Cervo</b> name was originally affixed to a kei sports coupe, and then to models derived from the Suzuki Alto. The nameplate was retired between 1998 and 2006, and again in March 2010, {{although it may be}} revived for the Indian market in 2013.|$|E

It is surrounded by the parishes of Ardãos (to the north), Sapiãos (to the south and east), and <b>Cervos</b> (to the west, in the municipality of Montalegre). Its 14.7 km² area includes the villages/localities of Bobadela and Nogueira, which are located seven kilometres from the municipal seat.|$|R
50|$|Celt colonies {{began to}} appear afterward, {{constructing}} castros {{in many of the}} places that developed into formal settlements. With the arrival of the Roman, bridges and formal roads {{began to appear}}, while many of the castros began to be converted into Roman encampments, later the nuclei of formalized settlements. Remains of the Roman civitas are still common: Praesidium (in Vila da Ponte, popularly known as Sabaraz) and Caladunum (in <b>Cervos).</b>|$|R
25|$|In November 2006, Suzuki reintroduced the <b>Cervo</b> name. The modern, Alto-based <b>Cervo</b> {{is still}} a kei car but is much more luxurious than its predecessor. The <b>Cervo</b> {{originally}} came equipped with the 658cc K6A engine (54hp in the normally aspirated VVT G version, 60hp in the turbo T and TX version). It is only available as a five-door with a four-speed automatic (with a manual mode in the turbo cars), and is marketed as a more masculine alternative to the MR Wagon. The nicer grade Cervos came with keyless entry and Bluetooth. In June 2007 a G Limited normally aspirated model was added, with the fourteen-inch alloys and rear spoiler of the TX.|$|E
25|$|After a {{hiatus of}} over a year, Suzuki {{returned}} to the sports minicar market with the new <b>Cervo</b> in October 1977. The SS20 <b>Cervo</b> was mainly a JDM model (although it was also sold as a LHD in Chile) with a 539cc three-cylinder, two-stroke engine. The SS20 used the chassis from the 1976 Fronte 7-S, but was equipped with the larger T5A engine (this was the rear-mounted version of the LJ50 used in the Jimny and Fronte Hatch, {{also known as the}} T5B in the FF Alto/Fronte). The body was based on the Giugiaro designed Fronte Coupé, but with a bulge in the front and bigger bumpers which led to the loss of some of the original's grace. Instead of square headlights, the <b>Cervo</b> received round items. The new rear glass hatch added convenience.|$|E
25|$|By May 1997, as the Wagon R (itself {{based on}} the <b>Cervo</b> Mode) was {{stealing}} ever more of the Cervo's sales, the turbocharged versions were discontinued as the lineup was shrunk to the S-Limited (42, 52 or 55PS) and the M Selection (52/55hp). The 52PS (55 in the AT 4WD version) 3-door SR joined in January 1998, attempting {{to fill the gap}} left by the Turbocharged models. By October 1998, with new regulations looming, the <b>Cervo</b> was once again discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the <b>Cervo’s</b> generous mean {{discharge}} of about [...] at its confluence with the Sesia, its regime is sharply torrential. The {{highest rates of}} flow occur with the melting of the prealpine snows in the late spring, and above all with the autumn rains. The latter can lead to such disastrous floods as occurred in 1968 and 2002. In the summer, however, the discharge is much diminished and significant tracts may dry up completely {{as a result of}} the heavy exploitation of its water.|$|R
5000|$|Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, {{stating that the}} film [...] "plays like a private joke best shared among movie buffs" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "ultimately little more than an accomplished but empty formalist exercise, devoid of the genuine feeling that distinguished Achard's previous, [...] "Demented"." [...] Film4 gave the film a negative review of two stars out of five, stating that the film [...] "is very forgettable. It’s a shame that <b>Cervo’s</b> great performance hangs limply on a wobbly script full of poor choices." [...] Time Out London gave the film a rating of two stars out of five, calling it [...] "out-and-out preposterous, a soulless essay that’s livened by a smattering of striking imagery and a few neat juxtapositions, but nothing to really sink your teeth in to." [...] Screen Daily referred to the film as a [...] "humourless little slasher" [...] and wrote that it was [...] "Neither scary nor engrossing, it is just unnecessarily repetitive." ...|$|R
25|$|With Kei {{car sales}} {{shrinking}} overall and the <b>Cervo</b> losing market share, sales were dropping precipitously. In February 1987 the second-generation <b>Cervo</b> received its {{third and final}} update. The Turbo was discontinued and the lineup rationalized to two versions, the sporty CS-G with a 5-speed manual and the lower grade CS-D with either a 4-speed manual or the 2-speed automatic. As further rationalization, all models now had roll-type safety belts (hitherto, CS and CS-D versions had come with fixed belts), front disc brakes and air conditioning.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, the <b>Cervo</b> {{received}} the Good Design Award, and the SR version was introduced. This had a new, 64hp direct injection turbo engine and a seven-step CVT transmission, {{the first time}} for such a combination to be available. With front-wheel drive, this car achieved a remarkable 23.0km/l (54 mpg) on the test cycle. The <b>Cervo</b> also received some minor updates across the line, with new liquid seal engine mounts and suspension changes. In May 2008 the range received more minor updates, with new colors being added and a new limited edition model, the G Limited II, which featured alcantara interior and a sporty exterior. Other models received new aero parts and other equipment, gas discharge headlights were now available on the SR.|$|E
25|$|In March, {{three models}} with the world's first {{electric}} power steering (CGPF/CGPL/CGPJ) {{were added to the}} lineup, at a juicy ¥150,000 surcharge. Actress and pop idol Yuka Ōnishi (大西結花) was the spokesperson for the ad campaign, while an all female motorcycle racing team (Team Angela) raced a Turbocharged <b>Cervo</b> in the Safari Rally. However, it was all to no avail: The rivals, Daihatsu's new Leeza and Mazda's Autozam Carol both sold much better. Combined with the removal of certain tax breaks for small cargo vehicles, this meant that the Cervo's already narrow slot in the market had essentially disappeared. When the new 660cc Kei regulations were introduced, Suzuki decided to call it quits rather than {{spend a lot of money}} to update such a slow-selling vehicle and <b>Cervo</b> production ended in May 1990.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Cervo</b> {{was a bit}} sportier than it {{appeared}} at first sight, however. The hottest version (the SR-Four) was the first Kei car to have a four-cylinder, 16-valve DOHC Turbo Intercooler engine (F6B), and {{was also the first}} to be equipped with Pirelli P700 tires as standard. ABS was optional, as was Full-time 4WD.|$|E
25|$|The Franciscans {{arrived in}} Cuernavaca in 1529 and founded their 5th monastery in New Spain there. This first group {{included}} Martín de Lua, Francisco Martínez, Luis Ortiz, Juan de <b>Cervo,</b> Francisco de Soto, Andrés de Córdova, Martín de Jesús, Juan Juárez, Juan de Motolinía, and Juan García de <b>Cervo.</b> Originally they {{lived at the}} San Francisquito hermitage, but later they constructed the open-air chapel, Capilla Abierta, at the Church of San José in Tlaltenango. They extended their presence into the neighboring communities of Tetecala, Jiutepec, and Tlaquiltenango, among others, eventually forming the province of Santo Evangelio, which {{would be part of}} the province of Mexico in 1543. In 1646, this province was reorganized several times. Cuernavaca and Cuautla became high mayorships which answered directly to the viceregal authorities in Mexico City. In 1786, New Spain was divided into twelve provinces and in 1824, Cuernavaca was initially a district of Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a CS-M / CS-QM special edition (based on the CS-D) in either an all-white or an all-red paint scheme with a black-and-red {{interior}} (¥633,000 / ¥673,000). The CS-G was aimed at a more masculine clientele, {{and was the first}} SS40 <b>Cervo</b> to use male models in the advertising. The CS-F had a very high 5th gear and offered a 5% gas mileage improvement over other Cervos.|$|E
25|$|And then, {{only six}} months later, Suzuki's longest running {{nameplate}} was laid to rest. When Japanese tax laws for vehicles in the kei class were changed in April 1989, kei commercial vehicles were no longer quite as favored as before. But, since the Alto had long had a much larger market share than the Fronte, {{it was decided to}} drop the Fronte name and focus marketing efforts on the Alto, which now became available as a five-door and three-door sedan as well as a three-door van. With the 796cc engine, the CN11S Fronte was built in China as the Anchi 6330. The CN11 was never exported to Europe, as they received the <b>Cervo</b> Mode (labelled as an Alto) instead. However, South Korea's Daewoo built the car under license as the Tico, and this model saw a great deal of sales particularly in Eastern Europe.|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the sports}} monuments, Milan–San Remo is among the highest-rated races in {{professional}} cycling. The 2016 route was set to be [...] long. Generally considered a sprinters' classic, the race ran from the Via della Chiesa Rossa in Milan to the traditional finish on San Remo's Via Roma. The final part of the race included the climbs of the Cipressa and the Poggio, which usually proved decisive for the race outcome. Across the road, the riders also had to tackle the [...] climb of the Passo dello Turchino, {{although it was not}} considered to be a key point in the race. After the Turchino, the route followed the Aurelia road along the coast from Genoa {{all the way to the}} finish in San Remo. With a little over [...] left to go, the first of the coastal climbs started with the Capo Mele, the Capo <b>Cervo</b> and the Capo Berta, before meeting the final two climbs leading to the finish.|$|E
2500|$|By January 1988, a new <b>Cervo</b> {{had been}} {{presented}} and the SS40C was discontinued shortly thereafter. Due to its lesser sales, the SS40C never received as many technical improvements as its Alto sister model. The Alto Turbo gained fuel injection and other technologies, but the ostensibly sporty <b>Cervo</b> {{had to make}} do with a carburetted [...] These days, many <b>Cervo</b> owners modify their cars by bolting on parts from later Altos, making the <b>Cervo</b> live up to its sporty appearance.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1982, an all-new <b>Cervo</b> was presented. Based on the {{underpinnings}} {{of the recently}} changed Alto/Fronte, the <b>Cervo</b> now sported front-wheel drive with a transversally mounted four-stroke engine. The F5A engine {{was the same as}} used in the SS40 Fronte. A twin-choke carb meant a whopping [...] was available, rather than the [...] in the [...] "cooking" [...] Alto/Mighty Boy. The <b>Cervo</b> offered a lower, much more sporty driving position than its Alto/Fronte sister cars. Anyone over 172cm (5ft 8 in) would certainly hit their head on the ceiling. Strangely, considering its supposedly sporty character, the <b>Cervo</b> was higher geared than its Fronte sister car. Top speed, however, either remained the same as the [...] of the Fronte (according to one source), or a little bit higher, at , according to another. To distinguish the <b>Cervo</b> from the other SS40 versions, its model code was SS40C (Alto: SS40V, Fronte: SS40S, Mighty Boy: SS40T).|$|E

2500|$|June 1976 [...] Discontinued. In October 1977 the <b>Cervo</b> {{replacement}} arrived.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1996 the retro-look <b>Cervo</b> C (for [...] "Classic") appeared, {{following}} {{the success of}} Subaru's Vivio Bistro and Mitsuoka's original Viewt. The <b>Cervo</b> C came as a well-equipped five-door with the [...] F6A engine (55PS in the automatic 4WD version). A high-powered AM/FM cassette stereo was standard, as were power windows and locks as well as wooden details on the dash and steering wheel. Automatic transmission and/or four-wheel drive were optional. The metal bodywork {{was the same as}} on the <b>Cervo</b> Mode, but the front assembly was entirely different and chromed bumpers, mirrors and doorhandles added to the classic look. In May 1997 a three-door version joined the lineup. Production ended in October 1998, when the <b>Cervo</b> Mode sister model was discontinued. Also launched in India as the [...] "Zen Classic" [...] it was not well received, becoming a huge flop in the Indian market.|$|E
2500|$|Again {{targeting}} the female demographic, the <b>Cervo</b> nameplate made a return in July 1990. Now, however, reflecting the new Kei Jidosha standards, the engine had grown by 110cc {{and it was}} [...] longer. More shockingly, the car was of a traditional two-box design, sold initially only as a 3-door hatchback. Eventually, the <b>Cervo</b> Mode developed into {{a full range of}} cars, coinciding with the discontinuation of the Fronte which had left a niche above the [...] "regular" [...] Alto. Reflecting the desired clientele, heartthrob Yūji Oda (織田裕二) appeared in the marketing campaign. [...] The <b>Cervo</b> Mode was initially only available with turbocharged 660cc engines of either 3- or 4-cylinder configurations. In November 1990 a 5-door version followed, along with lesser engines. The Mode looked more pedestrian than previous Cervos, with the Maruti built version (the [...] "Zen") in fact being marketed as the Alto in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2009, the <b>Cervo</b> {{received}} {{its most recent}} upgrade. The T model was discontinued, the TX received the [...] "aero" [...] front dam of the SR while the gas mileage of the G version was improved to meet the 15% gas mileage improvement goals for Japanese fiscal year 2010. The very efficient SR is the only turbocharged Kei car {{to qualify for the}} lower tax grades for especially environmentally friendly vehicles, combining this with being the most powerful version. The <b>Cervo</b> was discontinued by Suzuki during March 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The new <b>Cervo</b> {{benefitted from}} various {{technical}} improvements {{made to the}} Alto/Fronte, fitting the new F5B SOHC 12-valve three-cylinder (carbureted). [...] at a peaky 7,500rpm was available from 547cc. Three well-equipped models were available: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Fronte Coupé {{was simply}} {{referred}} to as the Suzuki LC10W in export markets, where it received a [...] 356cc engine. The Fronte Coupé was resurrected in a revised and larger form as the Suzuki <b>Cervo</b> in October 1977, after Kei car regulations were changed in January 1976.|$|E
2500|$|The {{series was}} held in Gage Roads off Fremantle, Western Australia during the Australian summer months between October 1986 and February 1987. The Royal Perth Yacht Club was the {{defending}} club and the organiser of the defence series. [...] Yacht Club Costa Smeralda of Porto <b>Cervo,</b> Sardinia was appointed the challenger of record and hence the organiser of the challenger series.|$|E
2500|$|The French name Cervin, {{from which}} the Italian term Cervino derives, stems from the Latin Mons Silvanus (or Mons Sylvanus), where silva means forest; this was {{corrupted}} to Selvin and then Servin. The change of the first letter [...] "s" [...] to [...] "c" [...] is attributed to Horace Bénédict de Saussure, who thought the word was related to [...] "deer" [...] (French: cerf and Italian: <b>cervo).</b>|$|E
2500|$|After several meetings, 46 {{interested}} individuals (led by Luigi Marzo and Luigi <b>Cervo)</b> {{gathered at}} the Alhambra Room on what is now Rua do Riachuelo, and founded a sports club for all Italian-Brazilians named [...] "Palestra Italia". Ezequiel Simone was named club president. The Italian Consulate in São Paulo {{became interested in the}} new club because it would help spread the word among Italians that their country now had one flag and one anthem.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1983, {{less than}} a year after introduction, the <b>Cervo</b> {{received}} a light facelift. In light of new regulations, wing mirrors were moved to the doors and the screw holes on the fenders were covered up. The mechanical changes were light: a slightly adjusted cam profile, the compression rate was upped to 9,7:1 (previously 9,5), the EGR and catalytic converter were improved and the engine received an automatic choke and transistor ignition. Power remained [...] There were also radial tired versions introduced, and disc brakes for the top-of-the-line CS-G. The lineup also received an overhaul, now looking as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1988, the new CN11S Fronte debuted. The {{previous}} generation {{was not as}} roomy as the competition due to its comparably short wheelbase, but the new version addressed this issue by having it stretched out by [...] to [...] A sleeker looking body, with rear side windows that wrapped {{around the edge of}} the roof, also helped sales. Apart from the very cheapest variants, the Fronte got front disc brakes and 12inch radial tyres. The Fronte also received the 547cc 12-valve SOHC F5B engine from the Suzuki <b>Cervo,</b> developing [...] at a lively 7500rpm. There was no three-door version this time, but a 4WD variant (CP11) was available.|$|E
2500|$|The new more {{aerodynamic}} body {{looked a}} bit more plain than its sharp predecessor, but the fastback shape echoed Giugiaro's original design. The headlights were square, there was more glass than on the SS20 (but with a broad B-pillar) and the larger rear glass hatch (still not a proper hatch) now offered better access to a much more usable luggage space. The rear seat folded; some versions even offered a remote opening mechanism and heated rear window. The SS40 {{was also the first}} <b>Cervo</b> to offer automatic transmission, a two-speed. This all reflected a steady move away from the original [...] "mini Gran Turismo" [...] concept towards a much softer [...] "Personal Car".|$|E
2500|$|In September 1971 the seminal, Giugiaro-designed Fronte Coupé arrived, the {{predecessor}} {{to the well}} known <b>Cervo</b> range. Giugiaro's original concept was a revised version of the one-box design he had already used for the [...] "Rowan Elettrica" [...] city car of 1967. Suzuki then modified the design considerably, changing the proportions and adding ornamentation. Based on the Stingray [...] "LC10 II" [...] model, the Fronte Coupé was only ever offered with the water-cooled rear-mounted LC10W engine. While initially only available as a two-seater, these were gradually replaced by four-seater versions. At first only two versions were available, the regular GE and the luxurious GX (or GER/GXR for models fitted with radial tires), both with a [...] version of the LC10W. Model changes: ...|$|E
2500|$|For export, Suzuki {{transformed}} the <b>Cervo</b> into the SC100, first introduced in April 1978. The SC100 {{was known in}} the UK by the nickname [...] "Whizzkid". The three-cylinder engine {{was replaced by a}} rear-mounted 970cc four-cylinder F10A engine (later used in the SJ410) developing [...] Top speed was [...] in a contemporary test. The body differed from the Cervo's in that the windshield was not as steeply raked, necessitating a different doorframe and side window as well. Square headlights were used in European markets, with either round or square ones used elsewhere. In European markets the grille incorporated the chunky indicator lenses, which were normally positioned in a space underneath the bumper – these openings were blanked with plastic grilles.|$|E
