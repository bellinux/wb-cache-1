40|$|Microvascular proliferation, a {{hallmark}} of malignant brain tumors, represents an attractive target of anticancer research, especially because of the quiescent nonproliferative endothelium of the normal brain. Cerebral neoplasms sequester copper, a trace metal that modulates angiogenesis. Using a rabbit brain tumor model, normocupremic animals developed large vascularized VX 2 carcinomas. By contrast, small, circumscribed, relatively avascular tumors {{were found in the}} brains of rabbits copper-depleted by diet and penicillamine treatment (CDPT). The CDPT rabbits showed a significant decrease in serum copper, <b>copper</b> <b>staining</b> of tumor cell nuclei, microvascular density, the tumor volume, endothelial cell turnover, and an increase in the vascular permeability (breakdown of the blood-brain barrier), as well as peritumoral brain edema. In non-tumor-bearing animals, CDPT did not alter the vascular permeability or the brain water content. CDPT also inhibited the intracerebral growth of the 9 L gliosarcoma in F- 344 rats, with a similar increase of the peritumoral vascular permeability and the brain water content. CDPT failed to inhibit tumor growth and the vascularization of the VX 2 carcinoma in the thigh muscle or the metastases to the lung, findings that may reflect regional differences in the responsiveness of the endothelium, the distribution of copper, or the activity of cuproenzymes. Metabolic and pharmacologic withdrawal of copper suppresses intracerebral tumor angiogenesis; angiosuppression is a novel biologic response modifier for the in situ control of tumor growth in the brain...|$|E

40|$|New {{therapeutic}} concepts {{developed in}} rodent models should ideally be evaluated in large animal models prior to human clinical application. COMMD 1 -deficiency in dogs leads to hepatic copper accumulation and chronic hepatitis representing a Wilson’s disease like phenotype. Detailed {{understanding of the}} pathogenesis and time course of this animal model is required to test its feasibility as a large animal model for chronic hepatitis. In addition to mouse models, true longitudinal studies are possible due {{to the size of}} these dogs permitting detailed analysis of the sequence of events from initial insult to final cirrhosis. Therefore, liver biopsies were taken each half year from five new born COMMD 1 -deficient dogs over a period of 42 months. Biopsies were used for H&E, reticulin, and rubeanic acid (<b>copper)</b> <b>staining.</b> Immunohistochemistry was performed on hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation marker (alpha-smooth muscle actin, a-SMA), proliferation (Ki 67), apoptosis (caspase- 3), and bile duct and liver progenitor cell (LPC) markers keratin (K) 19 and 7. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western Blots were performed on gene products involved in the regenerative and fibrotic pathways. Maximum copper accumulation was reached at 12 months of age, which coincided with the first signs of hepatitis. HSCs were activated (a-SMA) from 18 months onwards, with increasing reticulin deposition and hepatocytic proliferation in later stages. Hepatitis and caspase- 3 activity (first noticed at 18 months) increased over time. Both HGF and TGF-b 1 gene expression peaked at 24 months, and thereafter decreased gradually.

30|$|Light {{calcareous}} stone {{materials used}} in connection with cultural heritage objects, such as pedestals, or used as wall facings in connection with bronze statues or joints often show green staining due to the corrosion products from the bronze elements. The green stains alter {{the appearance of the}} monument and thus disrupt the original intention. Due to this, several cleaning methods, often involving ammonia, have been developed for removal of <b>copper</b> <b>stains</b> from stone surfaces. This paper describes a new, highly efficient method for cleaning <b>copper</b> <b>stains</b> from calcareous stone by introducing the chelating agent ethylenediamine in a poultice consisting of Laponite® RD, Arbocel® BC 1000 and CMC.|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} the bidentate ligand {{ethylenediamine}} (en, ethane- 1, 2 -diamine) {{will be introduced}} as an effective cleaning agent for removal of <b>copper</b> <b>stains</b> on calcareous stone.

30|$|A {{mixing ratio}} of Laponite® RD/Arbocel® BC 100  =  1 : 1  +  5  % CMC in 0.1  M {{ethylenediamine}} solution gave a fast and efficient cleaning of <b>copper</b> <b>stained</b> calcareous stone {{material in the}} laboratory. The laboratory conditions represent ambient temperature in the summer months in the Nordic countries, the normal period for cleaning of outdoor stone monuments. The use of this poultice-mixing ratio at lower temperatures and higher RH resulted in longer drying time of the poultice, hence a longer cleaning time. Lowering of the CMC content {{in order to increase}} the drying time is possible; however, the workability of the poultice is less satisfactory and results in longer application time and poorer adherence to the stone surface. Even though it is possible to remove <b>copper</b> <b>stains</b> on outdoor monuments at temperature lower than 20 – 25  °C, working in the warm summer months gives the best conditions for application and drying of the poultice and hence the fastest cleaning results.|$|R
30|$|For {{evaluation}} of protein production levels, samples of cell crude extracts were analysed by {{sodium dodecyl sulphate}} polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and stained with copper chloride 0.3 [*]M (Lee et al. 1987). Evaluation of protein expression levels in the different bacterial cell cultures {{was carried out by}} direct comparison between samples normalized for the same cell density. For normalisation, 1 [*]ml of cell culture was collected, centrifuged and resuspended in 100 [*]μl of TE buffer (50 [*]mM Tris, 1 [*]mM EDTA at pH 8.0) and supplemented with an additional 25 [*]μl of sample loading buffer (10 %[*]w/v SDS, 10 [*]mM beta-mercapto-ethanol, 20 %[*]v/v glycerol, 0.2 [*]M Tris–HCl pH 6.8, 0.05 %[*]w/v bromophenol blue). Samples were kept at 4 °C for 30 [*]minutes and centrifuged at the same temperature for 20 [*]minutes at 14, 000 ×g. For electrophoresis, the volume of the total soluble cell crude extract (supernatant) to be applied in each lane was calculated according to the following formula: ODi/ODf = Vi/Vf, where ODi is the OD 600 of the cell culture, ODf is 0.05 (this value was optimized for <b>copper</b> <b>staining),</b> Vi is 125 (100 [*]μl of TE + 25 [*]μl of sample loading buffer) and Vf is the volume of supernatant (μl) to apply. In the case of samples applied in the same gel, protein expression was visually estimated, supported by area calculation with the image processing software ImageJ (Rasband 1997 – 2011) and expressed as a relative percentage of the highest value. Whenever there was the need to compare expression levels in different gels, analysis was carried out by visually comparing band intensity/thickness. The same volume of 3 [*]μl of molecular weight marker was used in every gel. No modifications were made to the images other than cutting, pasting and resizing.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Histological {{study of}} 69 cases of cirrhosis, 9 of severe {{generalised}} hepatic fibrosis, and 19 of hepatocellular carcinoma showed an association with alcohol, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or a 1 -antitrypsin bodies in, respectively, 41 (cirrhosis), 5 (fibrosis), and 9 (carcinoma). Eight of the cirrhotic cases {{and two of}} the carcinoma cases had double associations, HBsAg being present in all. Orcein and aldehyde fuchsin staining gave both false positive and false negative results when compared with immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase methods for HBsAg. Large amounts of copper were found in four cirrhotic livers, and moderate amounts in 13 : the diagnostic value of <b>copper</b> <b>staining</b> is questioned. In 1973 MacSween and Scott found that 62 %Y. of 520 cases of cirrhosis in Glasgow were cryptogenic. Since that time methods for the identification of hepatitis B infection and al-antitrypsin deficiency have been developed, permitting the demonstration of aetiological factors in a larger proportion of cases. Because of the probability of sampling errors in needle biopsy specimens of liver, we decided to use postmortem material to investigate the contribution of histology in the diagnosis of the aetiology of cirrhosis, hepatic fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Material and methods The hospital necropsy records for the 15 years ending August 1976 were searched for cases of cirrhosis, severe generalised hepatic fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Sections were cut at 4,u from the paraffin blocks of the livers of these cases and stained by the following methods. Fibrosis or cirrhosis secondary to large duct obstruction or to cardiac failure was excluded. Examination of sections stained by haematoxylin and eosin and for reticulin yielded 69 cases of cirrhosis, 9 of severe generalised hepatic fibrosis, and 19 hepatocellular carcinomas.

30|$|A {{standard}} ligand {{used for}} the removal of <b>copper</b> <b>stains</b> from stone surfaces is ammonia, NH 3, due to the formation of the well-known blue tetraamminecopper(II) complex [10]. NH 3 can be applied either from an aqueous solution of ammonia or from a solution of ammonium carbonate ((NH 4) 2 CO 3) [2], which forms an ammonium/ammonia buffer in solution. The hexadentate ligand edta (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) has also been used, although its affinity towards Ca 2 + is troublesome [2, 3]. Recently the use of the amino acids alanine (ala), cysteine (cys) and tyrosine (tyr) has been investigated, and the mixture of alanine + ammonia in a poultice of sepiolite and Arbocel® BC 1000 has shown effective cleaning results [2].|$|R
30|$|Ethylenediamine is a dibasic amine (pKb 1  =  3.8 and pKb 2  =  6, 7) [12], and pH in a 0.1  M {{solution}} can {{be calculated}} to pH =  11.6. During the cleaning reaction, the pH value {{is likely to increase}} due to release of hydroxide anions from the basic copper(II) salts. The application of ethylenediamine on calcareous stone can therefore be performed without addition of a basic buffer. The chelate complex [Cu(en) 2] 2 + has a characteristic dark violet colour, making the cleaning easy to follow when the solubilized <b>copper</b> <b>stains</b> are extracted into the poultice.

50|$|Dimension stone {{requires}} some specialized methods for cleaning and maintenance. Abrasive cleaners {{should not be}} used on a polished stone finish because it will wear the polish off. Acidic cleaners can not be used on marble or limestone because it will remove (i.e. dissolve) the finish. Textured finishes (thermal, bush-hammered) can be treated with some mildly abrasive cleaners but not bleach or an acidic cleaner (if marble or limestone). Stains are another consideration; stains can be organic (food, grease, or oil) or metallic (iron, <b>copper).</b> <b>Stains</b> require some special removal techniques, such as the poultice method. A new method of cleaning stone on ancient buildings (medieval and renaissance) has been developed in Europe: sulfur-reducing bacteria are used on the black gypsum-containing crusts that form on such buildings to convert the sulfur to a gas that dissipates, thus destroying the crust while leaving the patina produced by aging on the underlying stone. This method is still in development and not yet commercially available.|$|R

30|$|A {{microscopic}} {{examination of the}} amount of copper salts remaining in the stone material has not been performed as the presence of copper salts is slightly visible in the deeper areas. In the previous study on cleaning of rust discolouration from marble it was shown from cross sections that the cleaning depth was depending on the porosity of the stone material [3]. Similarly, a spectroscopic examination of any dissolution of calcium ions from the stone material has also been omitted. Future investigations of these questions would answer whether this method can be used on precious artwork. The cleaning method is meant to be used on stone material placed in outdoor environment where natural weathering of the surface is occurring. However, the method was tested on high gloss polished marble and no etching was observed by comparing it to the untreated neighbouring areas. This, likely, reflects, the yet undetermined, very low stability constant between Ca 2 + and ethylene diamine. In addition to this, ethylene diamine is cost effective as the price is around 30 euros per liter (in 2016) [22], and cleaning of unattractive <b>copper</b> <b>stains</b> from a surface facing will extend its life time and thereby be an economic benefit.|$|R

Their small excavations produced large amounts of pottery shards, {{the remains of the}} first engraved shell cup found at Cahokia, and fragments of repousséd copper plates. In 1956 the mound underwent further excavations by Gregory Perino, funded by the Gilcrease Museum. He uncovered numerous shell fragments and a bed of charcoal he thought was for [...] "ceremonial fires". He also found an area littered with copper fragments, several <b>copper</b> <b>stained</b> posts and described the area as turning green upon exposure to the air. He described the feature as a possible copper workshop. In the late 1990s archaeologists began examining Perinos field notes and artifacts collected from Mound 34 in order to further refine the Mississippian Art and Ceremonial Complex, define its connection to Cahokia, and find the theorized copper workshop. The site of the mound was relocated (poor mapping by past archaeologists and agricultural flattening had made the exact location tenuous), and an extensive series of excavations were begun at the site from 1998 to 2012. Excavations in 1999 discovered several raw copper nuggets and more pieces of worked copper, confirming the location as a copper workshop, the first confirmed find of this sort at any Mississippian site.|$|R
