50|$|From the above, a hole (1) {{carries a}} {{positive}} <b>charge,</b> <b>and</b> (2) responds to electric and magnetic fields {{as if it}} had a positive <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> positive mass. (The latter is because a particle with positive <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> positive mass responds to electric and magnetic fields {{in the same way as}} a particle with negative <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> negative mass.) That explains why holes can be treated in all situations as ordinary positively charged quasiparticles.|$|R

5|$|After the game, the NBA {{suspended}} nine {{players for}} a total of 146 games, which led to $11 million in salary being lost by the players. Five players were also charged with assault, and eventually sentenced to a year of probation and community service.

40|$|The {{transport}} of <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> spin at finite energies is studied for the Hubbard chain in {{a magnetic field}} {{by means of the}} pseudoparticle perturbation theory. In the general case, this involves the solution of an infinite set of Bethe-ansatz equations with a flux. Our results refer to all densities and magnetizations. We express the <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> the spin-diffusion currents in terms of elementary currents associated with the <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> spin carriers. We show that these are the α,γ pseudoparticles (with α = c,s and γ = 0, 1, 2, 3, [...] .) and we find their couplings to <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> spin. We also study the ratios of the pseudoparticle <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> spin transport masses over the corresponding static mass. These ratios provide valuable information on the effects of electronic correlations in the transport properties of the quantum system. We show that the {{transport of}} <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> spin in the Hubbard chain can, alternatively, be described by means of pseudoparticle kinetic equations. This follows from the occurrence of only forward-scattering pseudoparticle interactions at all energies...|$|R
