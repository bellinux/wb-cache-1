40|$|Powder compact forging {{was used}} to produce Ti and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V rocker arms using {{pre-alloyed}} and blended elemental powders. Green powder compacts with high relative density were manufactured by warm compaction.

As a rapid consolidation process, the densification rate was enhanced by powder compact forging due to pore collapsing caused by material flow driven by a large amount of localized plastic deformation. <b>The</b> degree of <b>powder</b> consolidation of powder compact forging using HDH Ti, HDH and GA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powders were studied by characterising their porosity distributions, microstructure, mechanical properties and fracture behaviour.

Compressibility of <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures</b> were observed by using Kawakita and Lüdde equation. Normal fruit <b>powder</b> <b>mixture</b> was more compressible rather than fruit <b>powder</b> <b>mixture</b> with effervescent agent. Dissolution test was carried out in the dissolution medium of distilled water and simulated saliva fluid at room temperature and 37. 5 °C temperature, respectively. Fruit powder effervescent tablet was dissolved faster in simulated saliva...|$|R

A mixture consisting of components with high and low melting temperatures is studied. Within the suggested model, several numerical experiments {{have been carried out}} and their results analyzed. The process of the propagation of the melting and the solidification fronts has been investigated. A conclusion and a criterion have been obtained for the melting front of <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures</b> to be non-evolutionary in the gravity field. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|R

40|$|Selective {{metal powder}} {{sintering}} is a layer-by-layer manufacturing system producing metallic parts with good mechanical properties. Describes why an Fe-Cu <b>powder</b> <b>mixture</b> {{has been selected}} as the basic material for the process. Deals with <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> deposition issue and proposes a mechanism which can deposit thin powder layers {{on top of a}} recipient. Shows that <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> deposition mainly depends on <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> properties. States that <b>the</b> required <b>powder</b> properties are partially compatible with the specifications set by the technology of selective sintering but that some properties are in conflict with one another. Discusses the resulting compromises needed in <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures</b> and <b>the</b> required modifications to the deposition mechanism. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of various synthesis techniques on the dispersion {{and evolution of}} multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in titanium (Ti) metal matrix composites (TMCs) prepared via powder metallurgy routes has been investigated. The synthesis techniques included sonication, {{high energy ball milling}} (HEBM), cold compaction, high temperature vacuum sintering and spark plasma sintering (SPS). <b>Powder</b> <b>mixtures</b> of Ti and MWCNTs (0. 5 wt. %) were processed by HEBM in two batches: (i) ball milling of the mixtures (Batch 1) and (ii) ball milling of Ti powder alone, followed by a further ball milling with sonicated MWCNTs (Batch 2). Both batches of <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures</b> were pressed at 40 MPa into green compacts and then sintered in vacuum. Batch 2 <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures</b> were also consolidated using SPS. The crystallinity and sp² carbon network of the MWCNTs were characterized through analyzing the characteristic Raman peak ratio (ID/IG) of each processed sample. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used for phase identification. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the morphology of the MWCNTs in <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> <b>mixtures.</b> <b>The</b> evolution of MWCNTs during the fabrication process and mechanical properties of <b>the</b> sintered <b>compacts</b> were discussed in conjunction with the formation of nano-crystalline TiC. 11 page(s...|$|R
