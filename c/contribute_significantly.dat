5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to <b>contribute</b> <b>significantly</b> to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious.|$|E

The research population were all teachers of State Islamic High School Tanah Datar which consist of 121 teachers and 53 teachers were selected as a research sample by using stratified proportional random sampling. Research data were collected through questionnaire. The first, and second hypothesis were tested by using simple correlation and regression, and the third hypothesis was tested by using multiple regression. The result showed that a) the training <b>contributed</b> <b>significantly</b> (26, 50 %) toward the teachers’ professionalism; b) the teachers’ teaching experience <b>contributed</b> <b>significantly</b> (26, 00 %) toward the teachers’ professionalism; and c) simultaneously, the training and the teaching experience <b>contributed</b> <b>significantly</b> (40, 70 %) toward the teachers’ professionalism.

Both countries coordinate the development of cross-border infrastructure. Pan-European corridors Vb and Vc connect Budapest to the Adriatic Sea via Zagreb and Osijek.

5|$|Temple-building in Egypt {{continued}} {{despite the}} nation's decline and ultimate loss of independence to the Roman Empire in 30BC. With {{the coming of}} Christianity, traditional Egyptian religion faced increasing persecution, and temple cults died out during the fourth through sixth centuries CE. For centuries, the ancient buildings suffered destruction and neglect. At {{the start of the}} nineteenth century, a wave of interest in ancient Egypt swept Europe, giving rise to the discipline of Egyptology and drawing increasing numbers of visitors to the civilization's remains. Dozens of temples survive today, and some have become world-famous tourist attractions that <b>contribute</b> <b>significantly</b> to the modern Egyptian economy. Egyptologists continue to study the surviving temples and the remains of destroyed ones as invaluable sources of information about ancient Egyptian society.|$|E
5|$|The World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Conservation Union (IUCN) are {{non-profit}} {{organizations that}} provide funding and other support to off site and on site conservation efforts. The wise use of crop genetic diversity in plant breeding and genetic modification can also <b>contribute</b> <b>significantly</b> to protecting the biodiversity in crops. Crop varieties can be genetically modified to resist specific pests and diseases. For example, a gene {{from the soil}} bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces a natural insecticide toxin. Genes from Bt can be inserted into crop plants to make them capable of producing an insecticidal toxin and therefore a resistance to certain pests. Bt corn (maize) can however adversely affect non-target insects {{closely related to the}} target pest, as with the monarch butterfly.|$|E

The value of the relative uncertainty by the data of CODATA of 2014 is given, and is expressed in the relative uncertainty of the significant factors, noted with ur(constant). An approximately equals sign (≈) is used if an uncertainty is only approximated by the expression. This is due to unsignificant factors or rounding errors.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose was {{a smaller}} {{community}} during the war, but it kept going. Once again, union with Lincoln College was discussed: {{but in other}} areas, temporary merger was more appropriate; thus, Brasenose and Christ Church fielded single sports teams. The College hosted military personnel {{as it had in}} the First World War; a Nissen hut was even set up in Deer Park. Brasenose sent a flood of undergraduates into the forces; in particular, the college's sporting, masculine ethos meant many joined the Royal Air Force. This would <b>contribute</b> <b>significantly</b> to a high death total– 123 for the Allies and 1 for the Germans– more than in the First World War, although proportionately less. Many of Brasenose's sporting heroes died; among survivors were future Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie and cricketer Pieter van der Bijl.|$|E

Given its eclectic architecture and broad availability of film services and crew members, Montreal is a popular filming location for feature-length films, and sometimes stands in for European locations. The city is also home to many recognized cultural, film and music festivals (Just For Laughs, Just For Laughs Gags, Montreal International Jazz Festival, Montreal World Film Festival, and others), which <b>contribute</b> <b>significantly</b> to its economy.
