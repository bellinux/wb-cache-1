40|$|Pilomatricoma (also {{known as}} pilomatrixoma) {{is a rare}} benign skin tumor arising from hair {{follicle}} stem cells; it {{is also known as}} <b>calcifying</b> <b>epithelioma</b> of <b>Malherbe.</b> A definitive diagnosis can be made by histopathological examination.

The tumor can cause diagnostic difficulty {{not only for the}} clinician but also for the cytologist. Case A 62 -year-old woman presented with a right submandibular swelling of 4 months 9 ̆ 2 duration. The clinical findings were highly suspicious for malignancy. A fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed. Three preliminary differential diagnoses were offered: mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the submandibular salivary gland, squamous cell carcinomatous deposit in a submandibular lymph node and calcifying odontogenic tumor. Computed tomography demonstrated no bony lesion. No primary site of squamous cell carcinoma could be identified. An excisional biopsy of the swelling was performed, and the histologic diagnosis of pilomatrixoma was made. Conclusion: The cytologic presentation of pilomatrixoma of the right submandibular region can masquerade as that of a malignant tumor, in this case mucoepidermoid carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or odontogenic tumor.

40|$|SUMMARY-Tumors {{similar to}} human <b>calciFying</b> <b>epithelioma</b> of <b>Malherbe</b> were induced in C 3 HjBi mice by {{inoculation}} of polyoma virus. Histological and ultrastructural resemblance of these tumors {{to the human}} counterpart, including calcification of cortical cell type of tumor cells, was striking. Electron microscopically the so-called basophilic cells were premature corti-cal, cuticular, and inner root-sheath cells. Predominant, however, was the inner root-sheath cell (Huxley and Henle cells). Hyalinized and calcified cortical cells, imbricate cuticular cells, and typical outer root-sheath cells were identified. Virus particles were found only in tumor cells with the differentiation toward inner root-sheath cells. Visible viral particles {{first appeared in the}} nucleus where they were closely related to the nuclear chromatin, and, after proliferation in the nucleus, spread into the cytoplasm and eventually, with the destruction of the host cells, disappeared.

CASE REPORT The patient is {{a young woman who}} was first seen at the Ulster Hospital in 1968 when she was aged 11 years. She was found to have hard swellings behind her right ear and behind the sterno-mastoid process on the right side. A tonsillar lymph gland was palpable on the right side but there was no other lymphadenopathy. The patient was subsequently admitted to hospital in 1972 for investigation of subcutaneous swellings of her neck and back.

40|$|Abstract Backround <b>Calcifying</b> <b>epithelioma</b> of <b>Malherbe,</b> or Pilomatricoma, is {{considered}} an uncommon cutaneous neoplasia, normally occurring in children as a solitary, firm, asymptomatic, hard, subcutaneous, slowly growing nodule on the face, neck, or proximal upper extremity. In literature, two Pilomatricoma ultrasound patterns are described: the totally calcified nodule and the hypoechoic nodule with internal calcific foci. High frequency ultrasound {{has not yet been}} applied for routine diagnosis of Pilomatricoma. The aim {{of the study was to}} retrospectively identify specific ultrasound features. Methods We retrieved 124 histologically Pilomatricoma cases: 28 patients with 32 lesions were preoperatively evaluated with ultrasound. Results 22 / 32 have shown a solid formation, hypoechoic, with a sharp outline. Of these 22, 10 lesions were completely calcifying and 12 partially calcified. In 3 / 32 lesions with uncertain diagnosis, ultrasounds showed a complex/mixed pattern with pseudo-fluid areas and microspots. 7 / 32 lesions with US different diagnosis included 3 complex lesions, 2 cystic lesions and 2 solid nodular lesions. Conclusion In addition to well-known ultrasound patterns (completely calcified and partially calcified) we identified three new, not yet described, patterns that constitute the 31 % of the cases: complex, pseudocistyc and pseudotumoral. </p...|$|R
40|$|The various {{structural}} {{components of}} pilomatrixoma (<b>calcifying</b> <b>epithelioma</b> of <b>Malherbe)</b> were studied for {{the expression of}} hair-specific (trichocytic) cytokeratins as well as epithelial cytokeratins, using immunoperoxidase as well as epithelial cytokeratins, using immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence microscopy of frozen sections as well as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Trichocyte-type cytokeratins were detected in only a minor subpopulation of basophilic cells but more prominently in most “transitional” cells as well as in “shadow” cells. in contrast, antibodies against certain epithelial cytokeratins (including antibody KA 1 against cytokeratins of stratified squamous epithelia and antibodies against cytokeratin 19) revealed an extensive but heterogeneous staining of basophilic cells. In regions of squamoid cells, epithelial cytokeratins in an unusual pattern were found. An antibody against vimentin was negative on pilomatrixoma cells. An antibody against desmoplakins decorated true desmosomes in basophilic and transitional cells. biochemically, trichocytic cytokeratin polypeptides as well as epithelial cytokeratins 5, 6, 14, 16, 17, and 19 were positively detected. These results provide evidence in support of the notion of a trichocytic differentiation and probably derivation of pilomatrixoma. According to the cytokeratin expression patterns the majority of pilomatrixoma cells resemble the normal hair cortex lineage but some enter a pathway of squamous cell differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Background and Design: Pilomatrixoma <b>calcifying</b> <b>epithelioma</b> of <b>Malherbe</b> is a rare, benign, limited, calcifying {{epithelial}} neoplasm {{that arises}} from the hair pluripotent precursor matrix cells. It is usually seen {{in the head and}} neck and the upper extremities, in the dermis or subcutaneous tissues as an asymptomatic nodule. In this study, we discuss the epidemiology of the tumor, clinical and histopathological findings, differential diagnosis and treatment outcome of pilomatrixoma in the light of our experiences with 20 cases. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated a total of 20 cases diagnosed with pilomatrixoma with a pathology evaluation after excisional biopsy of the subcutaneous mass at pediatric surgery clinics between 2005 and 2012. Results: Our 20 patients consisted of 12 females (60 %) and 8 males (40 %). The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 9. 6 years. There was a single nodule in 18 cases (90 %) and two nodules in separate places in 2 cases (10 %). The tumor localization was {{in the head and neck}} in 54. 5 %, the extremities in 31. 8 %, and the trunk in 13. 6 %. Conclusion: Pilomatrixomas are rare but usually seen in children and adolescents and this benign skin tumor can be treated with surgical excision. Histopathological and clinical features should be evaluated carefully to prevent missing the malignant form that carries a risk of recurrence and even metastasis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Pilomatrixoma, {{also known}} as Malherbes’s <b>calcifying</b> <b>epithelioma,</b> known to occur in children, is not common {{especially}} in middle aged and those below 10 years of age. Pilomatrixoma presents as a firm skin nodule on eye lid or eye brow, so {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis of such lesions involving eyelids. Case: A 45 -year-old male presented with a swelling in the left upper lid for the last 4 months. There was firm to hard non tender nodule measuring 1. 5 cm. x 1. 5 cm in size on the lateral aspect of the left upper eye lid, involving the lid margin with variegated appearance of overlying skin with a few ulcerated areas on the surface. A presumptive diagnosis of meibomian gland carcinoma was made and an excision biopsy with primary lid repair was carried out. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of pilomatrixoma.

40|$|To the Editors: We {{present a}} case of pilomatrixoma {{appearing}} in the upper quadrants of the left breast in a 61 -yearold female. There was a firm nodule that had grown slowly and progressively during the previous year, producing skin retraction. Ultrasonographic study revealed a lesion that measured 1. 8 by 1. 4 cm. The nodule was well defined and superficial, with a nonhomogeneous echostructure that suggested carcinoma. In addition, lymphoadenopathy was found in four lymph nodes in the left axilla. Mammography showed a nodular image that, in the superior- external area of the left breast, was 1. 8 cm in diameter {{but that was not}} as well defined in the anteriorsuperior area (Figure 1). Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology was performed due to a clinical suspicion of malignancy. The smears were very cellular (Figure 2), with flat or three-dimensional groups of basaloid cells and occasional calcifications. There was loss of cohesiveness in some of these groups, with release of cells with cytoplasm (Figure 3) as well as many nude cells. The basaloid cells had poorly defined cytoplasm, large nuclei with indentations and prominent nucleoli (Figure 4). Tissue was observed in which ghost cells (Figure 5); anucleated, flaky cells; and foreign body multinucleated giant cells were identified. The histopathologic diagnosis of the surgical specimen was pilomatrixoma (Figure 6). Primary benign and malignant lesion cytology of the breast has been studied extensively, and many detailed descriptions have been given, with very well defined criteria of malignancy for the lesions. Rarely are adnexal tumors observed in the breast; they generally arise from the sweat glands. Pilomatrixoma, or <b>calcifying</b> <b>epithelioma</b> of <b>Malherbe,</b> is a subepidermic tumor that arises from the external radicular shaft of the hair root. 1 - 3 The mass occurs most frequently {{in the first decade of}} life, and its most frequent site is the head and neck, followed by the upper limbs. 4 Its location in the breast is quite rare and more frequent in males. 5 - 7 Pilomatrixoma cytologic samples are characterized by generally very high cellularity, with cells arranged in small groups, with very cohesive tissue fragments (in our case, loss of cohesiveness in some cell groups). The cells are small and have little cytoplasm. The nuclei are relatively large and surrounded by granular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The isolated cells usually have so little cytoplasm that they present the image of naked cells. With Papanicolaou stain in FNA, the ghost cells seen in the histologic sections are observed as a cell mass that is mildly eosinophilic; that is the diagnostic clue. Remains of acellular, eosinophilic material and some giant multinucleated cells can also be found. 5, 8 - 10 This case is of interest for several reasons. Due to the rarity of pilomatrixoma in the breast, the possibility of this type of lesion is often overlooked. From the clinical point of view, it presents as a breast tumor with malignant characteristics, such as hardness, fixation of the skin and sometimes inflammatory signs. 7 The roentgenographic and ultrasonographic findings generally suggest that the lesion is benign due to its superficial location and good delimitation, but in some cases, as in ours and others, 6 they can be confusing since malignancy is suspected. Finally, although the high cellularity of the smears and cell groups has generally been described as cohesive, in our case, cells with cytoplasm were found. Thus, the diagnostic clues to this type of tumor must be adequately studied in order to prevent false positive results. Ghost cells are highly characteristic, but, unfortunately, they are not also observable due to their poor affinity with the stain and the presence of amorphic cellular remains...|$|R

40|$|This {{article will}} deal {{exclusively}} with cutaneous adnexal tumors. From {{the viewpoint of}} diagnosis of adnexal tumors, embryologic and histologic considerations will be given priority. A good understanding of hair germ structure and normal histology of the hair follicle, which comprises the hair matrix (matrical cells), {{the inner and outer}} root sheaths, isthmus and infundibulum, is a fundamental need in managing follicular diseases. Hair germrelated benign tumors are trichoblastoma and trichoepithelioma, their malignant counterpart being basal cell carcinoma (<b>epithelioma).</b> <b>Calcifying</b> <b>epithelioma</b> is a tumor closely related to the hair matrix (matrical cells) and so has recently been termed "pilomatrixoma". In sebaceous lesions, it is essential to detect sebocytes and the sebaceous duct. In contrast to sebaceous hyperplasias, sebaceous neoplasms always exhibit seboblast proliferation. In sebaceous carcinoma, the sebaceous differentiation is sometimes obscured. A sweat "gland" tumor actually shows sweat "duct" differentiation with a glandular structure consisting of inner cuticular cell and outer poroid cell linings. Poroma is a neoplasm consisting of pores covered by cuticular cells. Its poroid cells proliferate, mimicking normal acrosyringium. Cutaneous mixed tumor, the tumors include differentiation towards a hair follicle, bone, cartilage, fat, etc. In this case, a "mixed tumor" is truly mixed...|$|R
