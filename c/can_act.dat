5|$|Natural {{selection}} <b>can</b> <b>act</b> {{at different}} levels of organisation, such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species. Selection <b>can</b> <b>act</b> at multiple levels simultaneously. An example of selection occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called transposons, which can replicate and spread throughout a genome. Selection at a level above the individual, such as group selection, may allow the evolution of cooperation, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of RNA-based {{biological}} catalysts called ribozymes exist, which again <b>can</b> <b>act</b> alone or in complex with proteins. The most common {{of these is the}} ribosome which is a complex of protein and catalytic RNA components.|$|E
50|$|Early {{microcontrollers}} {{often have}} some pins that <b>can</b> only <b>act</b> as an input, other pins that <b>can</b> only <b>act</b> as a push-pull output, {{and a few}} pins that <b>can</b> only <b>act</b> as an open collector input/output. A typical modern microcontroller has many three-state general-purpose input/output pins that can be programmed to act as any {{of those kinds of}} pins.|$|R

5|$|Although {{combat in}} the game follows a {{strictly}} turn-based formula, the turn sequence of the characters you have are calculated based on the speed statistic of the character, {{and in some cases}} characters are allowed to strike before enemies <b>can</b> <b>act</b> if they possess sufficient speed. Different attacks can take varied periods of time to execute.|$|E
5|$|Birds <b>can</b> <b>act</b> as vectors for {{spreading}} {{diseases such}} as psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, mycobacteriosis (avian tuberculosis), avian influenza (bird flu), giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis over long distances. Some of these are zoonotic diseases that can also be transmitted to humans.|$|E
5|$|In many bacteria, an S-layer of rigidly arrayed protein {{molecules}} {{covers the}} outside of the cell. This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and <b>can</b> <b>act</b> as a macromolecular diffusion barrier. S-layers have diverse but mostly poorly understood functions, but are known to act as virulence factors in Campylobacter and contain surface enzymes in Bacillus stearothermophilus.|$|E

5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and <b>can</b> <b>act</b> as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} several recipes, each listing preparation times, {{ingredients and}} courses. In addition, What's Cooking? {{can be used}} as a shopping list to remind players what items to purchase, and it <b>can</b> <b>act</b> as a timer to count down from a specified time and make an audible sound when it is done.|$|E
5|$|The phone <b>can</b> <b>act</b> as a hotspot, sharing its {{internet}} connection over WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB, and also accesses the App Store, an online application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple. The service {{allows users to}} browse and download applications from the iTunes Store that were developed with Xcode and the iOS SDK and were published through Apple.|$|E

5|$|A {{computer}} <b>can</b> <b>act</b> as one or {{all three}} of these components at the same time. The Xgrid protocol provides the basic infrastructure for computers to communicate, but is not involved in the processing of the specified calculation. Xgrid is targeted towards time consuming computations that can be easily segregated into smaller tasks, sometimes called embarrassingly parallel tasks. This includes Monte Carlo calculations, 3D rendering and Mandelbrot maps.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that <b>can</b> <b>act</b> as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|Freelancer {{features}} a multiplayer mode, allowing up to 128players to play {{together in a}} game. Multiplayer games are hosted on game servers; personal computers that meet the requirements for the game <b>can</b> <b>act</b> as a server. Gameplay {{is similar to the}} single-player mode, but is absent of story-driven quests. The server keeps individual records of the players' progress, and they can resume their game on their next log on to this server. A persistent virtual galaxy is thus maintained for them.|$|E

5|$|Hormones <b>can</b> <b>act</b> as immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of}} the immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|In {{studies of}} {{molecular}} and cellular biology {{it is often}} desirable to artificially induce fusion. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing B-cells with myeloma cells. The resulting “hybridoma” from this combination expresses a desired antibody {{as determined by the}} B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the melanoma component. Fusion can also be artificially induced through electroporation in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during electroporation, which <b>can</b> <b>act</b> as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Waylon Smithers {{finally comes}} out as gay {{to his boss}} Mr. Burns, who rejects his love. Other {{characters}} attempt to find a boyfriend for Smithers, and he falls for Julio. Meanwhile, Milhouse competes against a new boy for the lead role in a school production of Casablanca, so he <b>can</b> <b>act</b> alongside his own unrequited love, Lisa. Openly gay actor George Takei makes a cameo as himself, and the episode features a variety of cultural references, including to Grindr, Vladimir Putin, Equus and the films of Humphrey Bogart.|$|E

5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base <b>can</b> <b>act</b> as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E
5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a {{regulatory}} system similar to RNA interference. Antisense RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, {{but a few}} are activators of transcription. One way antisense RNA <b>can</b> <b>act</b> is by binding to an mRNA, forming double-stranded RNA that is enzymatically degraded. There are many long noncoding RNAs that regulate genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one X chromosome in female mammals and inactivates it.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} <b>can</b> <b>act</b> on any heritable phenotypic trait, {{and selective}} pressure {{can be produced}} by any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and competition {{with members of the}} same or other species. However, this does not imply that natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E
