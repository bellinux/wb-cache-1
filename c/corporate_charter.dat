5|$|Around 1935, {{despite the}} Depression, a few breeders started to linebreed and inbreed cream-colored horses to fix their color and type. In particular, C.T. Rierson began buying cream-colored mares sired by Silver Lace and {{developing}} the American Cream breed in earnest. In 1944, a breed association, the American Cream Association, {{was formed by}} 20 owners and breeders and granted a <b>corporate</b> <b>charter</b> {{in the state of}} Iowa. In 1950, the breed was finally recognized by the Iowa Department of Agriculture, based on a 1948 recommendation by the National Stallion Enrollment Board.|$|E
5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated <b>corporate</b> <b>charter</b> business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Ruby {{founded the}} Colorado Ranger Horse Association (CRHA), and {{was granted a}} <b>corporate</b> <b>charter</b> for the {{association}} in 1938. Ruby remained president of the organization from 1935 {{until his death in}} 1942. The registry initially imposed a 50-member limit, and many Ranger horses, whose breeders were not allowed to become members, were instead registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club. The member limit was lifted in 1964, and since then pedigree research has continued to find and register horses with Ranger breeding that are un-registered or registered as Appaloosas. During the 1980s, some Lusitano blood was allowed into the breed, but this practice has been discontinued. The CRHA states that up to 1 in 8 registered Appaloosas may have Colorado Ranger blood, and as such be eligible for registry with the CRHA. As of 2005, there were more than 6,000 horses registered with the CRHA, with between 100 and 125 new horses registered annually. While originally bred in the western US, today many Colorado Rangers are found in the midwest and eastern parts of the country, including the states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. They are also found in Canada, where {{there is at least one}} large breeding farm.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{corporations}} are directly governed by state laws, while the exchange (offering and trading) of securities in corporations (including shares) {{is governed by}} federal legislation. Many US states have adopted the Model Business Corporation Act, but the dominant state law for publicly traded corporations is Delaware, which {{continues to be the}} place of incorporation for the majority of publicly traded corporations.

25|$|Until the 1975 {{retirement}} of the Cessna 182, Paralift continued to operate parachuting flights. However, it increasingly focused on ad hoc and <b>corporate</b> <b>charter.</b> It targeted a growing market for executive charters using smaller twin-prop aircraft. Although slightly slower, they {{were significantly more}} economical that corporate jets. Paralift was able to operate many routes cheaper than scheduled services given that the entire aircraft was filled up. In addition, nonstop flights were available on any conceivable route combination, unlike scheduled services. Paralift was therefore successful at targeting smaller groups of executives traveling as a group.|$|E

25|$|A {{group that}} uses {{the book is called}} a deliberative assembly.

An organization may have rules which could include a <b>corporate</b> <b>charter,</b> a constitution or bylaws, rules of order (special rules of order and parliamentary authority), standing rules, and customs. To conduct business, groups have meetings or sessions that may be separated by more than or be within a quarterly time interval.

25|$|The {{city has}} changed its {{boundaries}} {{as well as}} the geographic limits of its quarters several times, principally as a result from destructions of the town by surrounding Hindu and Muslim powers. For instance, Golkonda forces under General Mir Jumla conquered Madras in 1646, massacred or sold into slavery many of the Christian European inhabitants and their allied Indian communities, and brought Madras and its immediate surroundings under his control. Nonetheless, the Fort and its surrounding walls remained under British control who slowly rebuilt their colony with additional colonists despite another mass murder of Europeans in Black Town by anti-colonialists agitated by Golkonda and plague in the 1670s. In 1674, the expanded colony had nearly 50,000 mostly British and European colonists and was granted its own <b>corporate</b> <b>charter,</b> thereby officially establishing the modern day city. Eventually, after additional provocations from Golkonda, the British pushed back until they defeated him.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{corporate}} law {{background of the}} Necessary and Proper Clause. It turns out that <b>corporate</b> <b>charters</b> of the colonial and early federal period bristled with similar clauses, often attached to grants of rulemaking power. Analysis of these <b>corporate</b> <b>charters</b> suggests that the Necessary and Proper Clause does not create independent lawmaking competence; does not confer general legislative power; does not grant Congress unilateral discretion to determine the scope of its authority; requires {{that there be a}} reasonably close connection between constitutionally recognized ends and the legislative means chosen to accomplish those ends; and requires that federal law may not, without adequate justification, discriminate against or otherwise disproportionately affect the interests of particular citizens vis-à-vis others...|$|R

50|$|Under the {{direction}} of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, the Supreme Court weighed in {{on a number of}} important economic cases. In the 1837 case of Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, for instance, Taney wrote the majority opinion, arguing for strict construction of <b>corporate</b> <b>charters</b> and effectively restraining the implications of the Marshall Court’s 1819 ruling in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, which had recognized <b>corporate</b> <b>charters</b> as contracts under constitutional protection. Thereafter, the slight majority of Jacksonian Democrats on the bench became uneasy supporters of corporate privilege, bound to respect rights that were expressly granted in <b>corporate</b> <b>charters</b> and effectively limiting state control over intrastate internal improvements. Moreover, in 1844, the Taney Court had expanded upon the Marshall Court’s 1809 decision in Bank of the United States v. Deveaux and upheld in Louisville v. Letson (1844) that regardless of where its shareholders resided, a corporation could claim citizenship in the state of its incorporation and thereby bring suit to the federal court under diversity jurisdiction. Although the Taney Court quickly reversed the precedent in Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio Transportation & Railroad Company (1854) and ruled that corporations in fact derive their citizenship from their shareholders and not from the states themselves, diversity jurisdiction still applied to corporations.|$|R
500|$|Svalbard Airport, Longyear, located [...] from Longyearbyen, is {{the only}} airport {{offering}} air transport off the archipelago.

Finnair announced commencement of service from Helsinki, operating three times a week starting 1 June 2016 and lasting until 27 August 2016, but Norwegian authorities did not allow this route, citing the 1978 bilateral agreement on air traffic between Finland and Norway.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the statutory laws of the relevant jurisdiction, corporations are subject to common law in some countries, and various laws and regulations affecting business practices.
