Those lying in Annex 1 are large scale developments such as motorways, chemical works, bridges, powerstations etc. These always require an EIA under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85,337,EEC as amended). Annex 2 {{projects are}} smaller in scale than those {{referred to in}} Annex 1. Member States must determine whether these project shall be made subject to an assessment subject {{to a set of}} criteria set out in Annex 3 of <b>codified</b> <b>Directive</b> 2011/92/EU.|$|R

In addition, the Recast <b>Directive</b> <b>codified</b> certain other instruments including a Commission decision of 2000 relating to funding of the EU budget from with a percentage of the VAT amounts collected by each Member State.|$|R
40|$|The EU Law on Injunctive Collective Redress The article aims to {{illustrate}} the EU policy on consumers specifically facing with the injunctions {{for the protection of}} consumers’ interests. According to EU legislation (as well as to national legislation), the current mechanism available for ensuring the effective judicial protection is twofold: consumers can bring an action before the judges either personally (individual redress) or through consumer associations (collective redress). Due to the ontological weakness of the individual consumer against the infringement, the EU strengthened the protection of collective interests. The legal ground is Directive 2009 / 22 /EC on injunctions for the protection of consumers’ interests, which, for the sake of clarity and rationality, <b>codifies</b> <b>Directive</b> 98 / 27 /EC which has been amended several times. An in-depth analysis of the ‘injunctions’ shows that this procedural instrument aims at terminating or prohibiting infringements which are contrary to the collective interests of consumers. The approximation of legislation performed by this Directive allows an increase of the effectiveness of these injunctions and a smoother functioning of the internal market. In addition, the research illustrates the two new legislative acts which, since 2013, implemented and partially amended the Directive in force, i. e. Directive 2013 / 11 /EU (Directive on consumer ADR), and Regulation (EU) 524 / 2013 (Regulation on consumer ODR), as well as the critical remarks about the application of Directive 2009 / 22 resulting from the Report of the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council COM(2012) 635. The analysis focuses on the obstacles that prevent the injunctive actions to be effective, and on the future trends drafted by the Commission Recommendation on common principles for injunctive and compensatory collective redress mechanisms in the Member States concerning violations of rights granted under EU Law (2013 / 396 /EU) ...|$|R

Our interrogation of recent policy scripts in Australia reveals that there is limited scope for leadership in schools to occur as accountability mechanisms and policy <b>directives</b> <b>codify</b> the professional expertise that leaders are required to possess, act out and act on...|$|R
5000|$|A {{wide range}} of {{instruments}} exist in the Environmental policy of the European Union. Among them the European Union has established a mix of mandatory and discretionary procedures to assess environmental impacts. European Union Directive (85/337/EEC) on Environmental Impact Assessments (known as the EIA Directive) [...] was first introduced in 1985 and was amended in 1997. The directive was amended again in 2003, following EU signature of the 1998 Aarhus Convention, and once more in 2009. The initial Directive of 1985 and its three amendments have been <b>codified</b> in <b>Directive</b> 2011/92/EU of 13 December 2011.In 2001, the issue was enlarged to the assessment of plans and programmes by the so-called Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive (2001/42/EC), which is now in force.Under the EU directive, an EIA must provide certain information to comply. There are seven key areas that are required: ...|$|R
50|$|Tamari's {{approach}} to business ethics {{is characterized by}} integration and harmonization of the various aspects of Jewish economic activity. In With All Your Possessions, Tamari criticizes Werner Sombart and Max Weber for focusing solely on contemporary Jewish behavior, and neglecting Jewish tradition and religion. By comparison, Aaron Levine of Yeshiva University, who has published many well-received books {{on the topic of}} Jewish business ethics, bases his approach almost exclusively on the religious side, namely normative dictates of Jewish law (halacha). Another common approach focuses on homiletic expressions from the Bible and other Jewish sources about the importance of integrity. Tamari's work combines all these resources. Tamari's work is particularly noteworthy for extensive use of communal records of medieval Jewish communities. Communal enactments recorded in these records are often significantly different from the kind of <b>codified</b> legal <b>directives</b> used by Levine.|$|R
5000|$|The 2004 Public Sector <b>Directive</b> <b>codified</b> {{rules for}} the {{procurement}} {{of goods and services}} through framework agreements, and the 2014 Directive amended these rules. Under the 2004 Directive, either one economic operator or more than three were to be party to a framework agreement, but the 2014 Directive also allowed a framework agreement to operate with just two economic operators. The term of a framework agreement may not usually exceed 4 years, [...] "save in exceptional cases duly justified, in particular by the subject-matter of the framework agreement".|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of healthcare, the ECJ's {{jurisprudence}} has recently been clarified and <b>codified</b> in <b>Directive</b> 2011 / 24 /EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare ("Patients' Mobility Directive"). Two judgments recently issued by the ECJ make interesting reading in this regard. While the facts of Femarbel and Ottica do not bear much resemblance to each other, the judgments illustrate that the definition of what falls {{under the umbrella of}} healthcare services is not always obvious. Moreover, the cases provide a timely example of attempts by commercial interest groups to use EU law to open up domestic healthcare markets to private, commercial service providers. As such, the judgments have the potential to provide more clarity on the scope of the Directive 2006 / 123 on services in the internal market ("the Services Directive") and Member States' discretion in regulating healthcare provision in their territory. Finally, the judgments provide further examples of the ECJ's willingness to adjudicate in cases concerning wholly internal situations...|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1970s, {{concerns}} among Chinese leaders {{about military}} weakness, especially vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, {{resulted in a}} decision to modernize the PLA. Two initial steps were taken to promote military modernization. First, in 1975, vacant key positions in the military structure and the party Central Military Commission were filled. (The state Central Military Commission was not founded until 1982; see the National People's Congress). Nonetheless, to ensure party control of the PLA, civilians were appointed to key positions. Deng Xiaoping was appointed Chief of the General Staff, while Gang of Four member Zhang Chunqiao was appointed director of the General Political Department. Second, in the summer following Premier Zhou Enlai's January 1975 proclamation of the Four Modernizations as national policy, the party Central Military Commission convened an enlarged meeting to chart the development of military modernization. The military modernization program, <b>codified</b> in Central <b>Directive</b> No. 18 of 1975, instructed the military to withdraw from politics and to concentrate on military training and other defense matters. Factional struggles between party moderates and radicals in 1975 and 1976, however, led to the dismissal of Deng from all his posts and the delay of military modernization until {{after the death of}} Mao Zedong. Within a month of Mao's death, military leaders headed by Minister of National Defense Ye Jianying cooperated with party chairman Hua Guofeng to arrest the Gang of Four, thus ending a decade of radical politics.|$|R
40|$|Tail biting {{behaviour}} {{is a major}} {{animal welfare}} issue in intense pig production, {{as well as an}} economic issue. To prevent the behaviour, tail docking is practised. It is a painful procedure where a part of or the whole tail is cut off. There is a lot of research on the subject of tail biting, with a big variety of solutions to prevent the behaviour. Scientists are consistent about that the absence of manipulable material increases the risk for tail biting. Manipulable material works as an environmental enrichment and stimulates natural behaviours of the pig, such as investigation and rooting. It helps pigs to cope with the environment and reduces stress and frustration, triggers that can lead to tail biting. The legal requirement regarding tail docking state that it shall not be practised on a routine and has been in force since the 1 st of January 1994. It was strengthened in 2003 and now appears in Council Directive 2008 / 120 /EC which <b>codifies</b> the earlier <b>directives.</b> The legal requirement now states that measures to prevent tail biting shall be taken before practising tail docking, measures such as changing inadequate management systems, changed environment and reduced stock densities. Pigs shall also have access to a suitable material or object, to be able to perform natural behaviours and prevent tail biting and stereotypies. In the latest version of the directive on pigs this material was defined as straw, hay, wood, sawdust, mushroom compost, peat or a mixture of such. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the current situation of compliance with the legal requirements in the directive on pigs, regarding the provision of manipulable material and the routine practice of tail docking. It was also to investigate actions to increase compliance among the Member States in the European Union. A descriptive analysis of available FVO-reports was used, together with written answers from the Competent Authorities and a qualitative interview with people at the Commission and the FVO. The results of this report showed that 18 out of 28 Member States in the European Union do not comply with the legal requirement regarding the provision of manipulable material, and that 17 of the Member States do not comply with the legal requirement regarding the practice of tail docking. There has not been any actions such as sanctions to increase the compliance among the Member States. These findings make an overall conclusion about the current issues with the compliance of the directive on pigs. There are no further intrinsic actions to increase compliance, due to a lack of responsibility among the involved parties, such as pig farmers, Competent Authorities and the Commision. Due to the lack of intrinsic action, it is an impossibility to conclude when full compliance will be fulfilled...|$|R
