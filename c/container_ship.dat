5|$|Areas of {{the coast}} near Exmouth, The Fleet at Weymouth and the beaches at Studland have also been used for {{training}} for war, but have since been returned to civilian use. Parts {{of the coast}}, especially around Portland, can be dangerous, and shipwrecks have been {{a feature of the}} coast. In January 2007 the coast experienced its most environmentally damaging wreck when the MSC Napoli, a 2,400 capacity <b>container</b> <b>ship,</b> was beached at Branscombe near Sidmouth, losing oil and cargo.|$|E

However, no contract has yet been signed. On 10 March 2017, ex-Protecteur caught fire while being dismantled in Liverpool, Nova Scotia. Residual fuel caught fire during demolition of the vessel.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper dose {{research}} about the optimization of <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> of sea –carriage {{for meeting the}} goods transport requirement by use of integer programming. Both laden and empty containers are combined into a system. In particular, the effect of special laden <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> capacity on the shipping plan is investigated. In the model, the objective function is to maximize the total profit of <b>container</b> <b>shipping.</b> The profit caused by laden <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> minus the cost caused by both laden and empty <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> equal to the total profit. The constraints to the model include meeting the need of both laden and empty <b>containers,</b> <b>shipping</b> limit to both common and special laden containers, the number of empty container supported. Lingo 9. 0 is used to solve the model and shipping methods in varied parameters are shown by simulation. The aim of the paper {{is to provide a}} reasonable plan of <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> of sea-carriage, so the <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> cost of a shipping company can be reduced and the its profit made by <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> are maximized...|$|R
40|$|Being {{aimed at}} the {{influence}} of ship-size and cargo-demand changes on <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> networks, to reveal the evolution process of <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> networks structure form, this paper respectively designed the operation models for two major <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> networks structure forms: Multi-port-calling network and Hub-and-spoke network, to maximizing the investment efficiency. Based on the above models, a comprehensively integrated operation model of <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> networks is built and the evolution process of <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> networks structure form with changing of both ship-size and cargo demands is analyzed. Finally, through a case study, {{results show that the}} comprehensive integrated operation model is very effective in the analysis of evolution process of <b>container</b> <b>shipping</b> networks structure forms...|$|R

5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the <b>container</b> <b>ship,</b> the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
5|$|Port Newark is {{the part}} of Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal and the largest cargo {{facility}} in the Port of New York and New Jersey. On Newark Bay, it is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and serves as the principal <b>container</b> <b>ship</b> facility for goods entering and leaving the New York metropolitan region and the northeastern quadrant of North America. The Port moved over $100 billion in goods in 2003, making it the 15th busiest in the world at the time, but was the number one container port as recently as 1985. Plans are underway for billions of dollars of improvements – larger cranes, bigger railyard facilities, deeper channels, and expanded wharves.|$|E

40|$|I/O to user-level {{processes}} in a uniform, device-independent way. We have refined and implemented the <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> design [2], and have measured its performance for local IPC, FDDI datagrams, and video display [1, 3]. Measured throughput with <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> {{is up to}} seven times greater than with conventional Unix I/O. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> is an I/O data transfer mechanism composed of six system calls. Implemented {{as a supplement to}} or a replacement of a user-level I/O API, <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> provides copy-free I/O through selective virtual memory remapping. Unlike related efforts, <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> is not limited to one type of device, does not restrict access to data, and does not perform unnecessary memory mappings or copy-on-write operations. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> unconditionally eliminates copies by moving all data with virtual memory remapping. I/O data (in blocks of memory called Containers) is mapped in and out of process address spaces. Copy elimination provides a large reduction in latency and a corresponding improvement in throughput. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> also eliminates unnecessary memory mapping operations, by mapping data only as requested by a process, thereby providing additional latency and throughput gains. Because mapping is directed by user request, no expensive page faults are required to access data. Finally, <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> makes possible additional optimizations which exploit the predictable behavior of long-lasting I/O pathways, for further performance gains. We have implemented <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> alongside the traditional Unix I/O API in DEC’s OSF/ 1 v 2. 0 operating system. Tests were conducted by running our modified kernel on DEC 3000 model 800 (“Alpha”) workstations. First, we measured local IPC performance between two processes. These processes exchanged 32 megabytes of data through AF_UNIX sockets, so source and target memory was largely uncached. <b>Container</b> <b>Shipping</b> provided over 700 % more throughput the...|$|R
