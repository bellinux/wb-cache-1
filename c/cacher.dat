40|$|For food caching to be adaptive, the {{benefits}} of recovery must outweigh the costs of storing an item. One of the costs to <b>cachers</b> is the risk of theft, and therefore, it is predicted that individuals may be sensitive to this theft and show various behavioural strategies to minimise it. In this study, we gave wild Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) a choice between two different coloured items {{of the same food}} type: one item with a specific colour that was always artificially removed when cached and the other item with a different colour that was not removed when cached. During the choice presentations, subjects reduced the amount they consumed and cached of the food items with the colour that was experimentally removed when cached, despite the two items only differing in caching pay-off. This avoidance to choose the food with the colour that was removed occurred over time, which suggests that subjects were using information about the item's pay-off during cache recovery and this then impacted on successive decisions. This study highlights how the sensitivity to a food item's pay-off can affect an individual's choice towards items that offer the greater overall reward...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{simulate}} the caching of acorns by jays and rodents to see if less costly procedures could be developed for the establishment of coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia). Four treatments [(1) random- single acorn cache, (2) regular- single acorn cache, (3) regular- 5 acorn cache, (4) regular- 10 acorn cache] were planted in January 1990. No efforts were made to protect the acorns nor the emerging seedlings from herbivory. Emergence of epicotyls ranged from 23. 4 percent (single acorn, random) to 64. 6 percent (five acorn, regular). By October 1990 the percentage of established seedlings ranged from 9 percent (single acorn, random) to 30. 6 percent (five acorn regular). Gopher caused mortality averaged 21. 3 percent and drought caused mortality averaged 38. 4 percent across the treatments. Conclusions about the efficacy of simulating jay and animal caching of acorns for the establishment of oaks must await a second growing season because of the unusual pattern of spring precipitation in 1990.

40|$|Food caching is a {{paramount}} {{model for}} studying relations between cognition, brain organisation and ecology in corvids. In contrast, behaviour towards inedible objects is poorly examined and understood. We review {{the literature on}} object caching in corvids and other birds, and describe an exploratory study on object caching in ravens, New Caledonian crows and jackdaws. The captive adult birds were presented with an identical set of novel objects adjacent to food. All three species cached objects, which shows the behaviour not to be restricted to juveniles, food <b>cachers,</b> tool-users or individuals deprived of cacheable food. The pattern of object interaction and caching did not mirror the incidence of food caching: the intensely food caching ravens indeed showed highest object caching incidence, but the rarely food caching jackdaws cached objects to similar extent as the moderate food caching New Caledonian crows. Ravens and jackdaws preferred objects with greater sphericity, but New Caledonian crows preferred stick-like objects (similar to tools). We suggest that the observed object caching might have been expressions of exploration or play, and deserves being studied {{in its own right}} because of its potential significance for tool-related behaviour and learning, rather than as an over-spill from food-caching research.

2500|$|Typical cache [...] "treasures", {{also known}} in the geocaching world as swag, are not high in {{monetary}} value but may hold personal value to the finder. Aside from the logbook, common cache contents are unusual coins or currency, small toys, ornamental buttons, CDs, or books. Although not required, many geocachers decide to leave behind signature items, such as personal Geocoins, pins, or craft items, to mark their presence at the cache location. Disposable cameras are popular as they allow for anyone who found the cache {{to take a picture}} which can be developed and uploaded to a Geocaching web site listed below. Also common are objects that are moved from cache to cache called [...] "hitchhikers", such as Travel Bugs or Geocoins, whose travels may be logged and followed online. <b>Cachers</b> who initially place a Travel Bug or Geocoins often assign specific goals for their trackable items. Examples of goals are to be placed in a certain cache a long distance from home, or to travel to a certain country, or to travel faster and farther than other hitchhikers in a race. Less common trends are site-specific information pages about the historic significance of the site, types of trees, birds in the area or other such information. Higher-value items are occasionally included in geocaches as a reward for the First to Find (called [...] "FTF"), or in locations which are harder to reach. Dangerous or illegal items, weapons, food and drugs are not allowed and are specifically against the rules of most geocache listing sites.|$|R
40|$|Caching food {{provides}} {{a variety of}} benefits to an individual, such as the build up of reserves for periods when resources are depleted or to gain a disproportionate amount of an ephemeral resource. One of the risks to adopting this strategy {{is the potential for}} theft from food stores, by both conspecifics and/or other species. To reduce this theft, some species have evolved a range of cache protection mechanisms, such as placing food out of site of competitors. In this thesis, I examined various cache protection and decision-making processes exhibited by the Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), a social rodent. Due to the sociality of this species, and therefore, the potential for high rates of cache loss, I predicted they would use a diverse range of behaviours to increase the survivability of stored food. I first described the natural caching behaviours of the Cape ground squirrel in their natural habitat. This species increased caching frequency just after the heaviest periods of rainfall, indicating that this behaviour might be controlled by the availability of food. They cache around a central burrow system, which classifies their cache type as “scatter hoarding”. In the second study, I investigated the effect of group size on caching and recovery behaviours. Group size in these ground squirrels showed daily fluctuations, and an increased number of individuals in a group had a negative impact on food cache survival. In response to fluctuations in group size, individuals did not change the spatial arrangement of caches, but I argued that this arrangement was a by-product of optimal cache placement and not a method to protect caches. With increased social competition, the ground squirrels seemed to maximise payoffs from food by consuming rather than caching items. The third study, focused on determining whether the <b>cachers</b> were sensitive to the attentive state of nearby conspecifics. Conspecifics were often observed competing with <b>cachers</b> immediately after a cache was deposited, and therefore ensuring audience members are inattentive to the cache event would decrease the chance a cache was stolen. There was a strong preference for individuals to cache when audience members were inattentive to the cache event. In addition, higher ranked individuals showed less sensitivity to these audience effects, possibly due to their ability to defend food items from conspecifics. In the fourth study I presented individuals with a choice between two food items of differing value: one item that was always artificially removed when cached and the other item that was not removed when cached. Although the two items only varied with respects to the payoff in caching, individuals reduced the amount of the removed items they both consumed or cached during the choice presentations. This avoidance to choose the removed food occurred over time, indicating that individuals were using information about the item’s payoff during cache recovery and this then impacted on successive decisions. Due to the lack of obvious landmarks at the study site, in the last experiment, I predicted that individuals might use positional cues from the sun as a reference point when caching and recovering food items. When caching food, individuals moved at consistent offset angles from the sun, moving in straight lines from the provisioning point to the cache point. When recovering food, individuals displayed some flexibility in the use of solar cues, which allowed them to retrieve food more efficiently. Food was retrieved sooner if there were a higher number of individuals present in the group. Overall, this thesis highlights the variety of decision-making processes individuals must undertake when caching food to ensure maximum profitability. I answered a number of questions on when animals cache, the decisions about what to cache and where to place caches. As this species is social, this decision-making is highly influenced by group members. This thesis provides much needed knowledge on the cache protection strategies used by mammals, where the majority of work has been conducted on birds. Research such as this will hopefully encourage other studies on mammals to determine how social living can lead to the evolution of counterstrategies to protect food stores...|$|R
