2500|$|Most {{filtration}} in a winery can {{be classified}} as either the <b>coarser</b> depth <b>filtration</b> or the finer surface filtration. In depth filtration, often done after fermentation, the wine is pushed through {{a thick layer of}} pads made from cellulose fibers, diatomaceous earth, or perlite. [...] In surface filtration, the wine passes through a thin membrane. Running the wine parallel to the filter surface, known as cross-flow filtration, will minimize the filter clogging. The finest surface filtration, microfiltration, can sterilize the wine by trapping all yeast and, optionally, bacteria, and so is often done immediately prior to bottling. An absolute rated filter of 0.45µm is generally considered to result in a microbially stable wine and is accomplished by the use of membrane cartridges, most commonly polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Certain red wines may be filtered to 0.65µm, to remove yeast, or to 1.0µm to remove viable brettanomyces only.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{undertake}} {{an initial}} {{assessment of the}} potential utility of dynamic contrast-enhanced texture analysis (DCE-TA) of the liver in patients with colorectal cancer. Materials and Methods: TA comprised measurement of mean gray-level intensity, entropy, and uniformity with and without selective-scale filtration using a band-pass filter to highlight different spatial frequencies reflecting fine, medium, and coarse textures. An initial phantom study assessed the sensitivity of each texture qualifier to computed tomography (CT) acquisition parameters. Texture was analyzed in DCE-CT series from 27 colorectal cancer patients having apparently normal hepatic morphology (node-negative: n = 8, node-positive: n = 19). Averaged changes in hepatic texture induced by contrast material were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively by using kinetic modeling to calculate hepatic perfusion indices following fine, medium, and <b>coarse</b> image <b>filtration.</b> Results: All texture qualifiers were less sensitive to changes in CT acquisition parameters than measurement of CT attenuation. Temporal changes in hepatic texture were qualitatively different from changes in enhancement. Statistically significant differences between node-negative and node-positive patients were observed for at least 1 time period for measurements of hepatic enhancement and for all texture parameters. The differences were most statistically significant and occurred over {{the greatest number of}} time periods for fine texture quantified as mean gray-level intensity (5 time periods, minimum P value: 0. 006) followed by fine texture quantified as entropy (4 time points, minimum P value: 0. 006).

In addition, advanced particle removal techniques {{for the development of}} more sustainable treatment scenarios based on physical-chemical pre-treatment of wastewater were researched. The specific research theme was part of a research project with the overall objective identifying the possibilities of physical and physical-chemical pre-treatment techniques as basis for the development of more sustainable wastewater treatment scenarios in the Netherlands. Within this research, the role of particles in wastewater systems was of particular interest. Knowledge was gained about the contribution of particles regarding the pollution of wastewater due to adsorbed or incorporated pollution fractions on or in particulate material. Furthermore, the effect of particle removal in the pre-treatment on the performances of total wastewater treatment systems and the related environmental criteria and costs were explored. By means of a newly developed scenario analysis, by which wastewater treatment system based on physical-chemical pre-treatment can be designed and evaluated on environmental criteria and costs, it was identified that advanced particle removal in the pre-treatment leads towards energy savings and compact design.

40|$|Granular {{filters are}} used in {{embankment}} dams to protect the dam core material from internal erosion, while draining seepage water to prevent saturation of the downstream embankment. In this thesis, a mathematical model is developed to describe the timedependent processes of filtration of non-cohesive base soils, modelling the rate of erosion and transport of particles into the filter. As particles are captured within the filter, {{they are able to}} retain progressively finer base soil particles until a self-filtration zone forms that is able to prevent any further erosion. The model predictions are verified with a series of laboratory tests in newly constructed, large scale filtration equipment, the largest of its kind in Australia. Erosion and filtration of a crack through a cohesive dam core is described by analytical modelling. The processes of erosion of the crack walls, transport of particles through the crack, and capture of the particles within the filter are combined to produce a timedependent model describing the sealing of a cracked core as a filter cake forms. The model is able to predict crack erosion for various filters and hydraulic conditions, and has been applied to several case studies to identify practical uses of the Extensive laboratory work examining erosion and filtration of cohesive base soils provides an improved understanding of the filtration process.

40|$|Woven monofilament, multifilament, {{and spun}} yarn filter media {{have long been}} the {{standard}} media in liquid filtration equipment. While the energy for a solid-liquid separation process {{is determined by the}} engineering work, it is the interface between the slurry and the equipment - the filter media - that greatly affects the performance characteristics of the unit operation. Those skilled in the art are well aware that a poorly designed filter medium may endanger the whole operation, whereas well-performing filter media can make the operation smooth and economical. As the mineral and pulp producers seek to produce ever finer and more refined fractions of their products, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to dewater slurries with average particle sizes around 1 ¿m using conventional, high-capacity filtration equipment. Furthermore, the surface properties of the media must not allow sticky and adhesive particles to adhere to the media. The aim of this thesis was to test how the dirt-repellency, electrical resistance and highpressure filtration performance of selected woven filter media can be improved by modifying the fabric or yarn with coating, chemical treatment and calendering. The results achieved by chemical surface treatments clearly show that the woven media surface properties can be modified to achieve lower electrical resistance and improved dirt-repellency. The main challenge with the chemical treatments is the abrasion resistance and, while the experimental results indicate that the treatment is sufficiently permanent to resist standard weathering conditions, they may still prove to be inadequately strong in terms of actual use. From the pressure filtration studies in this work, it seems obvious that the conventional woven multifilament fabrics still perform surprisingly well against the coated media in terms of filtrate clarity and cake build-up. Especially in cases where the feed slurry concentration was low and the pressures moderate, the conventional media seemed to outperform the coated media. In the cases where thefeed slurry concentration was high, the tightly woven media performed well against the monofilament reference fabrics, but seemed to do worse than some of the coated media. This result is somewhat surprising in that the high initial specific resistance of the coated media would suggest that the media will blind more easily than the plain woven media. The results indicate, however, that it is actually the woven media that gradually clogs during the <b>coarse</b> of <b>filtration.</b> In conclusion, it seems obvious that there is a pressure limit above which the woven media looses its capacity to keep the solid particles from penetrating the structure. This finding suggests that for extreme pressures the only foreseeable solution is the coated fabrics supported by a strong enough woven fabric to hold thestructure together. Having said that, the high pressure filtration process seems to follow somewhat different laws than the more conventional processes. Based on the results, {{it may well be that}} the role of the cloth is most of all to support the cake, and the main performance-determining factor is a long life time. Measuring the pore size distribution with a commercially available porometer gives a fairly accurate picture of the pore size distribution of a fabric, but failsto give insight into which of the pore sizes is the most important in determining the flow through the fabric. Historically air, and sometimes water, permeability measures have been the standard in evaluating media filtration performance including particle retention. Permeability, however, is a function of a multitudeof variables and does not directly allow the estimation of the effective pore size. In this study a new method for estimating the effective pore size and open pore area in a densely woven multifilament fabric was developed. The method combines a simplified equation of the electrical resistance of fabric with the Hagen-Poiseuille flow equation to estimate the effective pore size of a fabric and the total open area of pores. The results are validated by comparison to the measured values of the largest pore size (Bubble point) and the average pore size. The results show good correlation with measured values. However, the measured and estimated values tend to diverge in high weft density fabrics. This phenomenon is thought to be a result of a more tortuous flow path of denser fabrics, and could most probably be cured by using another value for the tortuosity factor...|$|R

40|$|A new {{application}} of polymer–surfactant aggregates {{has been developed}} to remove dilute metallic anions, such as CrO 4 2  − and Fe(CN) 6 3  −, from aqueous solutions. This process uses anionic polymers, such as poly(sodium 4 -styrenesulfonate) (PSS) or poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), as a back-bone structure onto which cationic surfactants, such as myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (MTAB), form micelle-like aggregates. The resulting structures, called polymer–surfactant aggregates (PSAs), {{have the ability to}} remove anions from solutions, and to form larger flocculated aggregates through a process of intermolecular association. The flocculated aggregates can then be separated out from the solution through a settling or <b>coarse</b> <b>filtration</b> step. In the work presented here, the results show that 99 % of 0. 1  mM Fe(CN) 6 3  − and 80 % of 0. 2  mM CrO 4 2  − can be removed at optimum dosages. The change in conductivity with the change in surfactant concentration is plotted to reveal changes {{in the state of the}} system, and to detect the point of formation of the PSAs. The results indicate that the PSAs, which form at surfactant concentrations well below the critical micellar concentration, are responsible for removing the metallic anions. This process is effective for metallic anion removal over a pH range from 4. 5 to 6 and a temperature range from 5 to 50  °C. Furthermore, both salt and organic contaminants do not significantly interfere with the anion removal efficiency.

TA utilised band-pass image filtration to highlight image features at different spatial frequencies (filter values: 1. 0 - 2. 5) from fine to coarse texture. The distribution of features in the derived images was quantified using uniformity. Results: Significant differences in uniformity were observed between patient groups for all filter values. With medium scale filtration (filter value = 1. 5) pure DCIS was more uniform (median = 0. 281) than either DCIS with IC (median = 0. 246, p= 0. 0102) or IC (median = 0. 249, p= 0. 0021).

Greywater and A/C condensate are potentially new alternatives for increasing urban water supply. An advanced physical filtration system for greywater treatment was developed named as GAC-MI-ME. It is comprised <b>coarse</b> <b>filtration</b> (CR-F) followed by microfiltration (MF), granular activated carbon (GAC), ultrafiltration (UF), ultraviolet (UV), and reverse-osmosis (RO). GAC-MI-ME effluent-quality was analyzed for greywater from laundry, shower, and wash basin. High-grade effluent equivalent to unrestricted water reuse was observed at UF and RO units. A subsequent tool (GREY-ANN) was proposed for GAC-MI-ME effluent quality predictions. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was applied to develop 5 unit models for selected parameters including Biochemical Oxidation Demand, pH, Total Dissolved Solids, Turbidity, and Oxidation-Reduction Potential to predict effluent quality at each stage of GAC-ME-MI treatment using water quality databases (developed from a series of experiments testing greywater of varying strength). The 15 days storage potential of GAC-MI-ME treated effluents were also analyzed and showed no significant quality depletion in UF and RO effluent quality. A hybrid modeling approach was applied to A/C condensate estimation, which included a psychrometric based ?Air-Conditioner-Condensate? (ACON) model, and data-driven ?Internal Load Analysis using Neural Network? (ILAN) model. The ACON model uses mass and energy balance approach for HVAC systems operating under steady state conditions. It accounts for psychometric states of different air parcels during the cooling and dehumidification process. The ILAN model was developed using ANN for the city of Doha to predict Internal Load at a daily time step for variable climatic conditions (temperature, relative humidity). The ACON- ILAN models were validated for a test building and applied for yearly condensate estimation for Doha. The virtual simulations of the hybrid model showed an annual condensate volume of 1370 and 3700 l/ 100 m^ 3 of cooling space for 20 % and 100 % outdoor-ventilation. The condensate quality (for limited water quality parameters) showed values within primary and secondary drinking water standards, except for copper, which had marginally higher concentrations. Overall, the GREY-ANN and ACON-ILAN may improve greywater and A/C condensate reuse potentials...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Coagulation and {{flocculation}} {{are commonly}} used in drinking water treatment {{as a means of}} destabilizing and aggregating particles and promoting adsorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In practice, jar tests are used to determine optimal conditions for the removal of turbidity and DOC. However, beyond the inferences that can be made with respect to turbidity removal during the sedimentation (and/or <b>coarse</b> <b>filtration)</b> step, little attention is paid to details of the particle size distribution (PSD) and the morphology of the aggregates that are formed. These physical properties can strongly influence the efficiency of downstream processes (e. g., sedimentation, granular media filtration, and membrane filtration). A greater quantitative understanding of how coagulation conditions influence the size distribution and morphology of floc formed during water treatment is necessary. For example, the optimal PSD for efficient removal in sedimentation is likely very different than the desired PSD for direct filtration using membranes. Experiments were conducted using monodisperse polystyrene microspheres, polydisperse synthetic water (kaolin clay and humic acid), and natural waters. The focus the experimentation was to develop a new methodology for characterizing aggregate morphology and to apply that method to evaluate the influence of physical and chemical conditions on the resultant PSD, fractal dimension, and removal of DOC during coagulation. Samples were collected and analyzed using a Coulter Counter Multisizer 3 and a Brightwell Technology DPA 4100 -D digital particle analyzer. PSDs based on solid volume (Coulter Counter) and maximum Feret's diameter (DPA 4100) allowed the determination of the fractal dimension using a modification of the two-slope method developed by Jiang and Logan (1996). Results from experiments conducted using latex microsphere destabilized in 0. 6 M NaCl show that distinguishable changes in the PSD and floc morphology due to changes in the mixing conditions can be observed using the methodology described in the following chapters. Microsphere coagulation was conducted at three distinct mixing conditions: flocculation, breakup, and regrowth. Flocculation mixing resulted in a dramatic reduction of primary particles as large porous floc were formed. These floc were characterized by a low three dimensional fractal dimension, D₃, implying that the floc were loosely packed and had a low density. Restructuring was observed during breakup mixing that saw large floc broken up into multiple smaller and more compact floc, as characterized by an increase in D₃. Regrowth allowed the floc size to recover from the restructuring of the breakup mixing phase, with the resultant floc being characterized by a D₃ between that observed for the flocculation and breakup phases. Enhanced alum coagulation of synthetic and natural waters produced fragile floc which were difficult to characterize in terms of the fractal dimension as measured using the methodology validated using the latex microspheres. The difficulty in analyzing the large alum floc was likely caused by breakup during measurement. The results show that coagulant pretreatment significantly alters the size distribution of the feed water. Optimizing the coagulation conditions with respect to specific downstream processes has the potential to increase efficiency and decrease operational and maintenance costs...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{feasibility}} and environmental impacts of using raw domestic greywater from laundry and bathroom after only primary treatment, e. g. <b>coarse</b> <b>filtration</b> for irrigating lawns and gardens. The use of greywater for landscape irrigation requires careful management, especially in regions with sandy soils and shallow groundwater levels. There {{is the possibility that}} excessive nutrients and other contaminants will leach into surrounding water bodies. This has been a major concern with greywater use in ecologically sensitive environments, such as on the Swan Coastal Plain of Perth, Western Australia. Proper management is essential to ensure environmental risks from greywater irrigation are avoided. The main purpose of the first stage {{of the study was to}} develop a new zero-tension lysimeter (ZTL) as a leachate sampler in a greywater irrigation plot. The new ZTLs were tested to compare the quantity and quality of leachate collected with that from the conventional pan lysimeter, in a pilot-scale study. The results indicate that the new lysimeter designated as ZTL (N 1), was effective at collecting leachate and was suitable to install at household sites. The lysimeter ZTL (N 1) design offers significantly improved performance, was cost-effective and required limited effort to install using an auger, which also minimizes soil disturbance. Since the lysimeter was practical and inexpensive it was established to facilitate the monitoring of greywater irrigation. The second stage of the study was to monitor the use of primarily treated greywater by using diversion system from bathrooms and laundries at four Perth houses: two houses at the Bridgewater Lifestyle Village (BWLV), one each at White Gum Valley and Hamilton Hill. Each house had different characteristics: different house types, occupants, cleaning product preferences and presence, or not, of household pets. Water use activities, soil and vegetation were monitored and were sampled for physical and chemical characteristics. Groundwater samples at the BWLV site were also collected. This site has 389 houses with a greywater diversion system installed in each, is located close to the Peel-Harvey estuary and a wetland, and has a shallow aquifer. Monitoring results showed that the groundwater samples were within the ANZECC guidelines. Greywater quality showed high variability depending on water consumption by washing machines, use of detergents and fabric softeners, as well as individual lifestyles. Land activities such as fertilizers and pets were expected to contribute to high amounts of nutrients in the leachate. Mulching and fertilizer used by householders in conjunction with greywater irrigation improved the function of soil and condition of plants. The third stage of the study was to determine the effects of raw laundry and bathtub greywater irrigation on the growth of couch grass (Cynodon dactylon L.) sod on a sandy soil in a 24 -week study, from October 2009 to March 2010. In Perth, the use of greywater is significant during these months as rainfall is at its lowest and irrigation demand at its highest.

In Perth, the use of greywater is significant during these months as rainfall is at its lowest and irrigation demand at its highest. Couch grass is a common lawn used in Western Australia with excellent drought tolerance, water efficiency and relatively low maintenance requirements. Three irrigation treatments were applied using a modified aquarium tank: (i) 100 % scheme water as a control (TW), (ii) untreated full cycle laundry water (LGW), (iii) untreated bathtub water (BGW). Salts and nutrients Na, CI, P, Ca, Mg, K, B, Zn and Al were chosen for measuring because they are dominant constituents in greywater and have a beneficial role in turf grass growth. Their dynamics and mass balance were assessed by measuring the irrigation (input) and leachate (output) volumes and concentrations of element concentration in both input and output water of the tank. Irrigation using LGW and BGW in sand resulted significant leaching of some Mg and Al beyond the 30 cm root-zone depth. The mass balance showed an increased amount of stored Na, CI, P and K in the soil at the end of the study. The accumulation of salts and nutrients in the soil has resulted in the infiltration rate, K, gradually declining. The final stage of the study was to investigate further the significant reduction of K in the tank test. Another soil hydraulic property, capillary rise (P,), was also measured. The soil samples were collected from greywater-irrigated plots at the case studies and the tank test, as mentioned previously. In addition, the study vii examined the changes in soil properties from the use of an anionic surfactant, linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) which is known to be the main ingredient in detergent formulation. A commercially available surfactant-based wetting agent to alleviate water repellency in household gardens was also considered. Irrigation with raw laundry and bathtub greywater, application of LAS and a wetting agent made a significant reduction on infiltration rate, K, and on PC. At the case study sites, the changes were difficult to quantify owing to various land activities that influenced the result. The results of the extensive experimental on-site program indicated that the use of primarily treated greywater is a viable option to conserve water for irrigation during times of drought and water restrictions. The sustainable use of raw greywater would vary with specific site conditions and householder practices. Soil and plant quality parameters are significantly affected after continuous irrigation with greywater. This is mainly determined by the management regime of greywater irrigation and its composition. In addition, continuous irrigation with greywater may lead to accumulation of salts, plant nutrients and some nutrients beyond plant tolerance levels. Therefore, these concerns should be essential components of any management plan for greywater irrigation. On the other hand, plant growth, soil fertility and productivity can be enhanced with properly managed greywater irrigation, through increasing levels of plant nutrients and soil organic matter. It is suggested that proper management of greywater irrigation with periodic monitoring of soil fertility and quality parameters are required to ensure successful and safe long-term use of greywater for irrigation. The adequate assessment of any environmental risks will require further research...|$|E
