5|$|Berkelium forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk metallocene complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene (Be(C5H5)2) at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks). One cyclopentadienyl ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> by chlorine to yield 2. The optical absorption spectra of this compound {{are very similar to}} those of (η5–C5H5)3Bk.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(IV) forms a {{tetrahedral}} complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C5H5)4) {{with four}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C5H5)2. One ring <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> with a halide atom. Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, or protactinocene, Pa(C8H8)2, which is analogous in structure to uranocene. There, the metal atom is sandwiched between two cyclooctatetraene ligands. Similar to uranocene, it can be prepared by reacting protactinium tetrachloride with dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide, K2C8H8, in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene Be(C5H5)2 at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and orthorhombic symmetry, with the lattice constants of a = 1411 pm, b = 1755 pm and c = 963 pm and the calculated density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound within a period of weeks. One C5H5 ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> by chlorine to yield 2. The optical absorption spectra of this compound {{are very similar to}} those of (η5–C5H5)3Bk.|$|E

5|$|If {{opportunity}} costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case reflects {{a situation where}} resources are not specialised and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant {{opportunity costs}}. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, it may not be entirely linear in either case.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} rounds in a match of Blitz, where two teams of four {{computer}} or human players score points for each energized Blitz disc thrown through their opponent's hoop, which is eight {{feet off the}} ground. Players pass and travel with the disc across the arenas, and the game continues without pause between points scored. The team with the most points {{at the end of}} a match wins. Players can choose to brawl when not scoring points. Fighting depletes character health, depending on who takes the blows. Once his health is completely depleted, a character is removed from the game, and teams with all players knocked out are disqualified (though players <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> between rounds). If a player tends towards belligerence, the game's artificial intelligence will compensate and exact revenge for its teammates. Friendly fire, where teammates can intentionally or inadvertently hurt each other with attacks meant for their opponents, is permitted.|$|E
5|$|In this game, Mario {{is joined}} by a robotic {{backpack}} named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Squirt and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Squirt nozzle lets Mario spray a stream of water which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. The Hover nozzle lets Mario hover {{in the air for}} a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> with the Hover nozzle: the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water. Juice can be replenished by eating more fruit.|$|E

25|$|Just as in first-order logic, second-order logic {{may include}} non-logical symbols in a {{particular}} second-order language. These are restricted, however, in that all terms that they form must be either first-order terms (which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> for a first-order variable) or second-order terms (which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> for a second-order variable of an appropriate sort).|$|E

Using cost-effectiveness analysis is less laborious and time-consuming as it does not involve the monetization of outcomes, which can be difficult in some cases.|$|E
40|$|Do {{international}} trade and finance flow together? In theory, trade and finance <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>substitutes</b> or complements, so the matter must be resolved empirically.
