This study focused {{on the effect of}} mTGase modification on the functional properties of yak and cow caseins, including solubility, emulsifying property, water and oil absorption capacity, foaming property, and stability in the presence of Na+, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 +. The results showed that the crosslinking degree of yak and cow caseins differed at the same mTGase concentration, but the change in functional properties of cow and yak caseins was similar. After mTGase crosslinking, the solubility of caseins decreased, while the emulsifying properties increased because of casein polymerization.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} sources of variation of milk coagulation properties (MCP) of buffalo cows. Individual milk samples were collected from 200 animals in 5 herds located in northern Italy from January to March 2010. Rennet coagulation time (RCT, min) and curd firmness after 30 min from rennet addition (a(30), mm) were measured using the Formagraph instrument (Foss Electric, Hillerod, Denmark). In addition to MCP, information on milk yield, fat, protein, and casein contents, pH, and somatic cell count (SCC) was available. Sources of variation of RCT and a 30 were investigated using a linear model that included fixed effects of herd, days in milk (DIM), parity, fat content, <b>casein</b> <b>content</b> (only for a(30)), and pH. The coefficient of determination was 51 % for RCT and 48 % for a(30).

40|$|All dairy {{processors}} {{depend on}} a continuous supply of high-quality bulk milk from milk producers {{to be able to}} distribute liquid milk and dairy products. Mastitis, inflammation of the bovine udder, is the most common disease in dairy cows, and leads to altered milk composition and impaired milk quality. The somatic cell count (SCC) is currently used as a marker for udder health, and indirectly, for bulk milk quality, but because it is somewhat insensitive and unspecific, there has been an interest to find alternative markers. The main objective of this thesis was to acquire more knowledge about two potential markers for bulk milk quality: polymorphonuclear leukocyte count (PMNC) and α-lactalbumin (α-LA). Another objective was to study if the combination of α-LA, haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in an acute phase index (API) could be useful as an alternative marker for bulk milk quality. Bulk milk samples were collected from Swedish dairy farms and analyzed for PMNC, α-LA, SCC, haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), fat, lactose, total protein and <b>casein</b> <b>contents,</b> <b>casein</b> number, protein composition, proteolysis and coagulating properties. An API was calculated for each sample by combining results on α-LA, Hp and SAA. Samples with high PMNC had a lower casein number than samples with low PMNC, while samples with high SCC had lower lactose and <b>casein</b> <b>contents,</b> lower <b>casein</b> number and more proteolysis than low SCC samples. There {{was no significant difference in}} the inflammatory markers SCC, PMNC, Hp and SAA between milk samples containing low, medium or high concentrations of α-LA. Differences between α-LA groups were, however, found in some milk quality parameters as high α-LA concentration was related to low concentrations of αs 1 -, αs 2 - and β-casein, and high concentrations of lactose and β-lactoglobulin. High API was related to low lactose <b>content</b> and <b>casein</b> number.

To better understand the action of protein kinase CK 2 on milk proteins, we have compared the action of rspCK 2 alpha on milk, and on different casein micellar subfractions isolated from milk by ultracentrifugation. In contrast to the situation observed with phosphocaseinate, alpha(s) casein was the best substrate for rspCK 2 alpha, whether milk or micellar fractions were used as substrates. We have characterized the protein content of different micellar fractions obtained by ultracentrifugation of cow milk using capillary zone electrophoresis. We confirm that the kappa <b>casein</b> <b>content</b> of micelles largely decreases when their size increases. In contrast, the alpha(s) <b>casein</b> <b>content</b> slightly increased with micelles size and beta <b>casein</b> <b>content</b> remained constant. All of the micellar fractions were substrates for rspCK 2 alpha, but {{a significant amount of}} intrinsic protein kinase activity was also found.

It could phosphorylate micellar casein in milk ultrafiltrate, in the absence of addition of any metallic cofactor. Its activity was only slightly affected by the addition of either MgCl 2 or MnCl 2. CaCl 2 activated the enzyme significantly. The intrinsic kinase lost its activity with time, and could incorporate from 9 to 26 % of the total phosphate incorporated in the presence of rspCK 2 a.

Twelve cheese-making sessions were carried out from February to December 2009 in a dairy cooperative of Grana Padano Consortium (Italy), for a total of 96 vats of milk processed. For each vat, samples of raw milk were collected and analysed for quality traits (fat, protein, and <b>casein</b> <b>contents),</b> pH, TA, and milk coagulation properties (MCP), measured as rennet coagulation time (RCT, min), curd-firming time (k 20, min), and curd firmness (a 30, mm). Cheese yield was expressed as kilograms of cheese per 100 kg milk transformed, and was measured after 2 d of drainage. Fat, protein, and <b>casein</b> <b>contents</b> were positively and strongly correlated with CY (coefficients of correlation, r= 0 · 72, 0 · 88, and 0 · 84, respectively; P< 0 · 001). Coagulation properties were moderately and significantly (P< 0 · 001) related to CY: milk that coagulated earlier and had stronger a 30 was associated to greater CY. Cheese yield was analysed with a model that accounted for fixed effects of cheese-making day, fat and protein content, TA, and a 30. Significance was found for all the effects (P< 0 · 05). Milk characterised by high values of a 30 resulted in higher CY than milk with low values of a 30, indicating that MCP could be used as indicators of cheese-making efficiency.

The aims of this study were to investigate how milk yield and composition were affected when kids suckled their dams during 8 weeks, and to measure the <b>casein</b> <b>content</b> on farm level by a mid-infrared spectroscopy method, previously calibrated for goat milk. Lactating goats were kept in two different MIX- systems where the dams are both suckled and milked. All goats were machine milked twice daily. Group 1 (n= 5) was kept together with one kid for 16 hours a day (T- 16 h), kids and dams were separated daytime between 7 : 30 and 15 : 00, kids were allowed to suckle before each milking. In group 2 (n= 6) the dam and kid were kept together for 24 hours but the kid was only allowed to suckle one teat as the other teat was covered with a bra. The daily milk yield was higher in T- 16 h goats (P< 0. 05) compared with T- 24 h goats; 2. 5 ± 0. 8 and 2. 1 ± 0. 6 kg, respectively. The fat content was higher in T- 16 h 4. 9 ± 0. 9 % than in T- 24 h goats; 4. 4 ± 0. 7 % (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Session : Lactation Biology IIMilk {{and dairy}} {{products}} are {{an important source of}} calcium for humans but recent studies in France have shown a clear decrease in milk calcium content during May and June and with grass diets compared with corn silage diets. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the reasons of this seasonal drop of milk calcium content by testing the effect of 2 levels of dietary anion-cation differences (DCAD; 0 mEq/kg DM for D 0 and 400 mEq/kg for D 400) and 2 d lengths (8 h of light/d for short days and 16 h/d for long days) on calcium balances of dairy cows. The DCAD treatments were conceive to mimic diets based either on maize silage or on herbage. The cows were only lightened by solarium lights providing UVA and UVB. The trial was carried out according to a Latin squaredesign using 8 dairy cows averaging 103 ± 44 DIM with 4 periods of 14 d. Data were analyzed accordingly using Mixed procedure. The significance threshold was set at P ≤ 0. 05. There was no significant interaction between day length and DCAD level. With D 400 compared with D 0, blood pH increased and plasma ionized calcium content decreased, while the plasma total calcium content was not different between treatments. However, milk calcium content increased, in relation with a decrease of the amount of calcium excreted in urine. DCAD had no significant effect on protein and <b>casein</b> <b>contents</b> and D 400 tended to decrease milk yield. This illustrates that the udder did not decrease Ca uptake from the blood at high DCAD even though high DACA decreased the availability of Ca by decreasing the proportion of blood ionized Ca. Milk calcium and <b>casein</b> <b>contents</b> were significantly lower with long compared with short days, whereas day length had no effect on milkyield. This work highlights that long and sunny days can explain a part of the seasonal decrease of milk calcium content in summer and refutes the hypothesis that low milk calcium contents at grazing could be due to the high DCAD of herbage...|$|R

The DCAD treatments were designed to mimic diets based either on corn silage or on herbage. The cows were only illuminated by solarium lights providing UVA and UVB. The trial was conducted according to 2 simultaneous replicates of a 4 × 4 Latin square design using 8 dairy cows averaging 103 ± 44 d in milk with 4 periods of 14 d. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with a model including treatment, cow, and period effects. No significant interaction was found between day length and DCAD treatments. With DCAD 400 compared with DCAD 0, blood pH increased and plasma ionized Ca content decreased, whereas the plasma total Ca content did not differ between treatments. Milk Ca content, however, increased with DCAD 400 compared with DCAD 0, in relation to a decrease in the amount of Ca excreted in urine. The DCAD had no significant effect on protein and <b>casein</b> <b>contents</b> and DCAD 400 tended to decrease milk yield. This illustrates that the udder did not decrease Ca uptake from the blood at high DCAD even though DCAD 400 decreased the mammary availability of Ca by decreasing the proportion of blood ionized Ca.

Besides MCP, fat, protein, and casein percentages, titratable acidity (TA), and somatic cell and bacterial counts were available. A standardised index of milk aptitude to coagulate (IAC) was derived using information of RCT and a 30. An analysis of variance was conducted on MCP and IAC using a fixed effects linear model. Approximately 3 % of milk samples did not form a curd within the testing time (30 min) and k 20 was missing for 26 % of milks. The percentage of samples without information on k 20 largely differed among dairy factories (1 · 7 – 20 · 9 %).

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the effects of feeding value of silages from whole crop maize (WCM) and maize Stover (MS) on dry matter intake (DMI), milk yield and its composition in lactating Sahiwal cows. Eight cows nearly of the same age, weight and lactation stage were randomly divided into 2 equal groups. A and B, Two rations viz I and II were randomly allotted to these groups. Both the rations were based on 60 % test materials (WCM or MS silage) added with 40 % concentrates. Each ration was offered ad libitum twice daily. The experiment lasted for 20 days, allowing 10 days of adaptation period. The data were statistically analyzed using completely randomized design. Non significant differences were observed between both the groups of cows fed WCM or MS silage for DMI, milk yield and its components such as fat and solid-not-fat, total solids, crude protein and <b>casein</b> <b>contents,</b> Based on the findings of this study. it was concluded that the overall response of the experimental cows to the silages from MS and WCM was similar. Therefore, it was suggested that on the commercial scale. for feeding dairy animals during drought season, conversion of the maize stover into silage should be encouraged rather than whole crop maize...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity (EC) of milk is {{considered as one}} of the most important parameters which supports the diagnosis of mastitis in cows. Milk ions have a considerable influence on EC and their concentrations vary depending on animal species, season, lactation stage, etc. Some components of milk can change the EC, e. g. lactose. A negative correlation between EC values and the concentration of lactose is noticed, as a consequence of the inverse relation between this disaccharide and the chlorine content in milk. Fat and <b>casein</b> <b>contents</b> exert some influence on the EC, too. This study provides preliminary results on the physiological EC values in donkey milk and aims to highlight any correlation with some of its chemical-physical parameters and Somatic Cell Count (SCC). Mean EC value in donkey milk was found to be 3. 57 mS. Statistically significant correlations were found between EC and SCC (r = 0. 57, p < 0. 01) and between EC and (r = 0. 30, p < 0. 05). The EC and lactose were not correlated although a reduction of EC was often observed when the lactose content increased, as reported in the literature for bovine milk. According to the EC can be considered as a reliable parameter to identify any breast disorder, taking into account the physiological factors that influence EC...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{assessed the}} effects of forage quality and heat stress on milk composition and Cheddar cheese yield efficiency. The experimental design was a 4 x 4 latin square, with 7 -day adjustment periods followed by 5 days of sample collection. The treatments were: 1) high quality lucerne chaff-based diet plus cooling (sprinkler and shade) (HD+C), 2) high quality lucerne chaff-base diet without cooling (HD-C), 3) low quality lucerne chaff-based diet with cooling (LD+C), and 4) low quality lucerne chaff-based diet without cooling (LD-C; control). Animals were restricted to the same forage intake as the control treatment, and they all received 4. 2 kg concentrates daily. Diets were fed {{in the form of}} total mixed rations and were balanced for protein using cottonseed meal. Cooling reduced body temperature by 1 °C and increased milk yield by 0. 5 L/day/cow (P< 0. 05). Milk fat plus <b>casein</b> <b>contents</b> were affected by a combination of diet and cooling (P< 0. 05). The proportion of αs 2 –casein in the total casein increased from 7. 9 to 8. 7 % for the control and cooling treatments, respectively (P< 0. 05). Cheese yield efficiency (i. e. adjusted cheese yield per 100 kg milk divided by theoretical yield x 100) for the HD+C treatment was greater by 1 %, 5 % and 9 % compared with HD-C, LD+C and LD-C treatments, respectively (P< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{genotypic}} frequencies at the beta-lactoglobulin locus {{were examined}} on 128 individual ovine milk samples from Massese breed. Chemical composition, casein and whey protein fractions and tromboelastographic parameters were determined on all individual milk samples. Statistical interrelations were calculated using JMP software 3. 02 of SAS Institute. The genotypic frequencies at the beta-lactoglobulin locus were: 0. 36 AA; 0. 54 AB; 0. 10 BB. The BB variant of beta-lactoglobulin could {{be related to}} a higher milk production with a lower <b>casein</b> <b>content</b> and a greater overall amount in whey proteins, particularly alpha-La and BSA. The AA and AB genotypes showed higher beta-lactoglobulin and total casein contents, and were related to a better quality of milk either in composition or in rennetability...|$|E
40|$|Infrared {{spectrometry}} is, at present, {{the most}} frequently applied methodology for the composition analysis of milk and dairy products. The determination of fat, protein and lactose has been described during recent decades. The introduction of Fourier Transform Infra-red (FT-IR) technology {{in combination with the}} application of multi-dimensional procedures (i. e. principal component regression, partial least squares) has improved this methodology, opening new perspectives for the simultaneous and routinely determination of many new parameters such as casein, urea, specific sugars, etc [...] The aim of our study was to develop on MilkoScanTM FT 120 (Foss Electric, Hillerød, Denmark) a calibration curve for the analysis of casein in cow milk and to execute a preliminary validation. The calibration curve was developed on 89 individual milk samples collected from 4 dairy herds in the Grana-Padano cheese district. In order to obtain a higher variability of milk protein content and composition, in each herd milk samples from cows in early and late lactation were collected. On milk samples, casein separated at pH 4. 6 and protein content were measured using Kjeldahl method (N x 6. 38) and the results, expressed as casein percentage of whole milk, were used as reference values. On each milk sample the full spectra with MilkoScanTM FT 120 was collected twice. The samples were sorted according to <b>casein</b> <b>content</b> and homogenously subdivided in two data subset: the 1 st (2 / 3 of the samples) was used to develop the calibration curve; the 2 nd (1 / 3 of the samples) was used, as external dataset, to validate the calibration curve by cross validation. These elaborations were performed using Regression and Partial Least Squares procedures of SAS. The <b>casein</b> <b>content</b> in milk samples used to develop the calibration curve ranged between 2 and 3. 5...|$|E
40|$|The {{protein and}} fat content of Dutch bulk milk has been {{monitored}} since the 1950 s and has increased considerably, by 11 and 20 %, respectively, whereas milk yield {{has more than}} doubled. The change in protein and {{fat content of milk}} is advantageous for the dairy industry, as these are the 2 most economically valuable constituents of milk. Increases in protein and fat content of milk have allowed increases in the yield of various products such as cheese and butter. However, for cheese and other applications where casein micelles {{play a crucial role in}} structure and stability, it is not only <b>casein</b> <b>content,</b> but also the properties of the casein micelles that determine processability. Of particular importance herein is the salt partition in milk, but it is unknown whether increased protein content has affected the milk salts and their distribution between casein micelles and milk serum. It was, therefore, the objective of this research to determine the salt composition and protein content for individual cow milk and bulk milk over a period of 1 yr and to compare these data to results obtained during the 1930 s, 1950 s, and 1960 s in the last century. Calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus content were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and inorganic phosphate, citrate, chloride, and sulfate content by anion-exchange chromatography in bulk milk and milk ultracentrifugate. In addition, ionic calcium and ionic magnesium concentration were determined by the Donnan membrane technique. We concluded that historical increase in milk yield and protein content in milk have resulted in correlated changes in <b>casein</b> <b>content</b> and the micellar salt fraction of milk. In addition, the essential nutrients, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus in milk have increased the past 75 yr; therefore, the nutritional value of milk has improved. Key words: milk protein, casein, calcium phosphate, magnesiu...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} more than 2, 000, 000 records on <b>casein</b> <b>contents</b> were {{collected}} in Lombardia (Italy) during routine milk recording of Italian Holstein and Brown Swiss dairy cows. Variance components for casein were estimated as well as all the genetic correlations of casein with production and type traits considered in selection. According to the heritabilities estimated (12. 4 % for Brown and 9. 36 % for Holstein), breeding values were calculated for bulls and compared to the breeding values for total protein. The results of two different selection scenarios were compared for each breed when including protein or casein as selection criterion. Genetic progress expected for all traits selected were compared after 10 years of selection. The genetic variability of casein allows the use of this trait as selection criterion with the estimation of breeding values and its inclusion in selection indexes. Ranking of breeding values for casein and protein are very similar in both breeds. But some differences in genetic values for casein exist for the same level of breeding value for protein. Nevertheless results in genetic gain differ between breeds depending mainly on genetic correlations with the other traits selected. The positive results in selection response estimated for several traits suggest to the Brown Swiss Association the replacement of protein selection with casein. In contrast the smaller effects estimated for the Italian Holstein suggest to wait for more casein data collected before any change in selection program...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were to {{investigate}} if variation at regulatory {{sites of the}} milk protein genes is associated with traits of economic interest in dairy Sarda sheep, {{as well as the}} genetic characterization of Spanish meat ovine breeds. Seven hundred and sixty Sarda sheep were genotyped with a multiplex TaqMan® assay of 29 SNPs found by us in the four casein genes and three previously reported SNPs in the LALBA and BLG genes. A high level of polymorphism (1 SNP every 200 bp) was revealed and significant associations between CSN 1 S 2 and CSN 3 genotypes and milk protein and <b>casein</b> <b>contents,</b> while CSN 1 S 1 and CSN 2 genotypes were significantly associated with curd firming time. A total of 140 individuals belonging to the Xisqueta, Ripollesa, Segureña, Gallega, Roja Mallorquina and Canaria de Pelo breeds were genotyped with the Infinium 50 K Ovine SNP BeadChip (Illumina). This dataset was merged with 50 K genotypes of other five Spanish breeds (Churra, Ojalada, Castellana, Latxa and Rasa Aragonesa). Population genetics analyses revealed that Canaria de Pelo, Roja Mallorquina, Latxa and Churra were clearly differentiated populations. We performed a second experiment aiming to estimate the amount of shared vs breed-specific variation in five Spanish breeds through a RNA-seq approach. Our results showed a similar amount of shared vs pool-specific variants. Moreover, the number of pool-specific SNPs in Canaria de Pelo and Xisqueta was 2 - 5 fold higher than in the others breeds...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{variation}} at the ovine casein genes {{could have}} important {{effects on the}} composition and coagulation properties of milk. Herewith, we have partially resequenced the promoters and the 3 ′-UTR of the four casein genes in 25 Sarda sheep. Alignment of these sequences allowed us to identify a total of 29 SNPs. This level of polymorphism (one SNP every 250 bp) is remarkably high if compared with SNP densities estimated in human genic regions (approximately one SNP per bp). The 29 SNPs identified in our resequencing experiment, plus three previously reported SNPs mapping to the lactalbumin, alpha (LALBA) and β-lactoglobulin (BLG, also known as progestagen-associated endometrial protein, PAEP) genes, were genotyped with a multiplex TaqMan Open Array Real-Time PCR assay in 760 Sarda sheep with records for milk composition and coagulation properties. Association analysis revealed the existence of significant associations of CSN 1 S 2 and CSN 3 genotypes with milk protein and <b>casein</b> <b>contents.</b> Moreover, genotypes at CSN 1 S 1 {{were significantly associated with}} rennet coagulation time, curd firming time and curd firmness, whereas CSN 2 was associated with curd firming time. These results suggest that SNPs mapping to the promoters and 3 ′-UTRs of ovine casein genes may exert regulatory effects on gene expression and that they could be used for improving sheep milk quality and technological traits at the population level through marker assisted selection. © 2016 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics...|$|R
