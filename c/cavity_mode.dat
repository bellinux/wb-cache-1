50|$|One of {{the biggest}} hurdles for {{implementation}} of the NICE-OHMS technique is indisputably the locking of {{the frequency of the}} laser to that of a <b>cavity</b> <b>mode.</b> Although the requirements for the performance of the lock are less stringent than for other direct cw-CEAS techniques (due to the noise-immune principle), the laser frequency still has to be kept locked within the <b>cavity</b> <b>mode</b> during signal acquisition, i.e. it should follow the mode while the cavity is scanned, including a possible wavelength modulation. It can be difficult to achieve these goals if the free-running linewidth of the laser is significantly larger than the <b>cavity</b> <b>mode</b> width and if the laser is prone to sudden frequency excursions due to technical noise from the surroundings. This is usually the case when working with medium- or high finesse cavities (with transmission mode widths in the low kHz range) and standard types of lasers, e.g. external cavity diode lasers (ECDLs), with free-running linewidths in the MHz range. Electronic feedback loops with high bandwidths (typically a few MHz) and high gain are then needed to couple a substantial amount of the laser power into a <b>cavity</b> <b>mode</b> and to ensure stable performance of the lock.|$|E

40|$|A {{practical}} {{scheme for}} {{the demonstration of}} perfect one-sided device-independent quantum secret sharing is proposed. The scheme involves a three-mode optomechanical system in which a pair of independent <b>cavity</b> <b>modes</b> is driven by short laser pulses and interact with a movable mirror. We demonstrate that by tuning the laser frequency to the blue (anti-Stokes) sideband of the average frequency of the <b>cavity</b> <b>modes,</b> the modes become mutually coherent and then may collectively steer the mirror mode to a perfect Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state. The scheme is shown to be experimentally feasible, it is robust against the frequency difference between the modes, mechanical thermal noise and damping, and coupling strengths of the <b>cavity</b> <b>modes</b> to the mirror.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the optical properties of one-dimensional arrays of slits in metal films. Although enhanced transmission windows are dominated by Fabry-Perot <b>cavity</b> <b>modes</b> localized inside the slits, the periodicity introduces surface modes that can either enhance or inhibit light transmission. We thus illustrate the interaction between <b>cavity</b> <b>modes</b> and surface modes in both finite and infinite arrays of slits. In particular we study a grating that clearly separates surface plasmon effects from Wood-Rayleigh anomalies. The periodicity of the grating induces a strong plasmonic band gap that inhibits coupling to the <b>cavity</b> <b>modes</b> for frequencies {{near the center of the}} band gap, thereby reducing the transmission of the grating.

5000|$|However, all {{attempts}} to directly combine CEAS with a locking approach (DCEAS) {{have one thing in}} common; they do not manage to use the full power of the cavity, i.e. to reach LODs close to the (multi-pass) shot-noise level, which is roughly 2F/π times below that of DAS and can be down to ~10−13. The reason is twofold: (i) any remaining frequency noise of the laser relative to the <b>cavity</b> <b>mode</b> will, due to the narrow <b>cavity</b> <b>mode,</b> be directly converted to amplitude noise in the transmitted light, thereby impairing the sensitivity; and (ii) none of these techniques makes use of any modulation technique, wherefore they still suffers from the 1/f noise in the system. There is, however, one technique that so far has succeeded in making full use of the cavity by combining locked CEAS with FMS so as to circumvent both of these problems, and that is Noise-immune cavity-enhanced optical heterodyne molecular spectroscopy (NICE-OHMS). The first and so far ultimate realization of this technique, performed for frequency standard applications, reached an astonishing LODs of 5•10−13 (1•10−14 cm−1). It is clear that this technique, correctly developed, has a larger potential than any other technique for trace gas analysis! ...|$|E

5000|$|Integrated cavity output {{spectroscopy}} (ICOS) {{sometimes called}} as cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) records the integrated intensity {{behind one of}} the cavity mirrors, while the laser is repeatedly swept across one or several cavity modes. However, for high finesse cavities the ratio of [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] a <b>cavity</b> <b>mode</b> is small, given by the inverse of the finesse, whereby the transmission as well as the integrated absorption becomes small. Off-axis ICOS (OA-ICOS) improves on this by coupling the laser light into the cavity from an angle with respect to the main axis so as to not interact with a high density of transverse modes. Although intensity fluctuations are lower than direct on-axis ICOS, the technique is, however, still limited by a low transmission and intensity fluctuations due to partly excitation of high order transverse modes, and can again typically reach sensitivities ~10−7 [...]|$|E

50|$|Cavity {{perturbation}} theory generally relies on formulae involving stored energy considerations. The following sections of this wikipedia pages {{are based on}} these formulae. The latter appear intuitive since the common sense dictates that the maximum change in resonant frequency is achieved when the small perturbation is placed at the intensity maximum of the <b>cavity</b> <b>mode.</b> This intuition is valid for high-Q cavities only and when predicting the spectral shift of the resonance frequency. However, the shift is always accompanied by a broadening of the resonance width, i.e. a decrease of Q, {{and it is important}} to predict it also. The classical formulae based on energy considerations, i.e. on |E.E| products, cannot predict the broadening. For low-Q cavities, such as plasmonic resonators, they cannot predict neither the shift, nor the broadening. Correct formulae that are accurate for high- and low-Q resonators and for the shift and the brodening, have been established in 2015, see Nano Lett. 15 (5), pp 3439-3444 (2015). They are as simple, but use E.E products instead of |E.E| products. Importantly, the phase of the resonant mode is preserved in the new formulae.|$|E
