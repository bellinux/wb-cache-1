Some of them are deployed on the cloud such as Google Drive and Microsoft Office at SkyDrive. Massively used editing systems make use of operational transformation (OT), a traditional replication mechanism for <b>concurrent</b> <b>document</b> editing. Such algorithms do not scale well in peer-to-peer environments with dynamic groups. Recently, Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) were introduced as a new class of replication mechanisms whose concurrent operations are designed to be natively commutative.

To reflect the tendency of decentralised collaboration, which can resist censorship, tolerate failures, and let users have control over documents, we collected editing logs from real-time peer-to-peer collaborations.

40|$|The {{concurrency}} is {{an important}} issue to tackle when modelling real-time applications which are intrinsically concurrent. According to the definitions of real-time given in (CNRS 1988) and (Stankovic 88), real-time implies on one hand that the response are waited at a precise moment (neither before nor after) and on other hand, that such systems are coupled with the real world, therefore highly <b>concurrent.</b> This <b>document</b> overviews the support for concurrency modelling provided by UML.

We also evaluate LockX's performance on the XMark benchmark [16] after extending it with suitable update operations [13].

40|$|In current {{engineering}} practice, be it <b>concurrent</b> or otherwise, <b>documents</b> are {{the central}} mechanism for communicating, informing and instructing. Any attempt to engender a greater uptake of concurrent engineering {{in the industry}} has to recognise {{the central role of}} documents in process reengineering. The proper management of documents has the potential to greatly improve the design process in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. It is estimated (by document management system developers) that professionals in the industry spend 30 percent, or more, of their time managing documentation in current paper-based management regimes, and the source of much litigation in the industry can be tracked back to improper management of documentation. IT-based approaches can greatly impact on document management; however, to date the various aspects of IT applied to engineering have developed independently, leading to stand-alone product, process and document management systems.

Emerging {{evidence points to}} a critical role for the innate immune system, and several studies had <b>documented</b> <b>concurrent</b> impairment in neutrophil chemotaxis with these post-burn inflammatory changes. While a few studies suggest that a link between neutrophil motility and patient mortality might exist, so far, cumbersome assays have prohibited exploration of the prognostic and diagnostic significance of chemotaxis after burn injury. To address this need, we developed a microfluidic device that is simple to operate and allows for precise and robust measurements of chemotaxis speed and persistence characteristics at single-cell resolution. Using this assay, we established a reference set of migration speed values for neutrophils from healthy subjects. Comparisons with samples from burn patients revealed impaired directional migration speed starting as early as 24 hours after burn injury, reaching a minimum at 72 â€“ 120 hours, correlated {{to the size of}} the burn injury and potentially serving as an early indicator for concurrent infections.

Vitamin D deficiency was defined as < 30 Â ng/mL and anemia was defined as a hemoglobin < 11 Â g/dL. A total of 554 subjects were included in the analysis. Anemia was present in 49 % of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D-deficient subjects compared with 36 % with normal 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels (p[*]<[*] 0. 01).

40|$|Purpose: Macular schisis or {{detachment}} {{is frequently}} observed in eyes with optic pits or colobomas. Although spontaneous {{resolution of the}} maculopathy has been reported, concurrent changes in the optic nerve coloboma have not. We report three cases of atypical optic nerve colobomas in which dynamic optic nerve changes coincide with the development and subsequent resolution of the associated maculopathy. Methods: We reviewed the records of three patients with dynamic optic nerve changes associated with maculopathy. All patients were observed for at least 6 months. Fundus photography and fluorescein angiography were used to document the optic nerve and macular changes. Results: Three patients were noted to have macular detachments without apparent optic nerve excavation. With observation, the maculopathy spontaneously resolved in each case. We <b>documented</b> <b>concurrent</b> optic nerve changes whereby atypical optic nerve colobomas became apparent over several months in all cases. In one case, we noted the simultaneous development of maculopathy in association with obscuration of a prior disc anomaly. None of the eyes had a posterior vitreous detachment. We could not identify any associated systemic conditions or reproduce the findings with external stimulation. Initial Snellen acuity ranged from 20 / 60 to 20 / 200. Final Snellen acuity ranged from 20 / 20 to 20 / 40. Conclusions: Fluctuating optic nerve changes may occur {{in the setting of}} atypical optic nerve coloboma and associated maculopathy. In cases of macular schisis or detachment where an optic nerve coloboma is not readily apparent, and no other causes are identified, consideration of a period of observation prior to therapeutic intervention seems appropriate.

40|$|Mice were {{repopulated}} {{with small}} numbers of retrovirally marked hematopoietic cells operationally definable as totipotent hematopoietic stem cells, without engraftment of cells at later stages of hematopoiesis, {{in order to facilitate}} analysis of stem cell clonal histories. This result depended upon the use of unirradiated W/Wv newborn recipients. Before transplantation, viral integration markers were introduced during cocultivation of fetal liver or bone marrow cells with helper cell lines exporting defective recombinant murine retroviruses of the HHAM series. Omission of selection in culture [although the vector contained the bacterial neomycin-resistance (neo) gene] also limited the proportion of stem cells that were virally labeled. Under these conditions, engraftment was restricted to a small population of marked and unmarked normal donor stem cells, due to their competitive advantage over the corresponding defective cells of the mutant hosts. A relatively simple and coherent pattern emerged, of one or a few virally marked clones, in contrast to previous studies. In order to establish the totipotent hematopoietic stem cell identity of the engrafted cells, tissues were sampled for viral and inbred-strain markers for periods close to one year after transplantation. The virally labeled clones were characterized as stem cell clones by their extensive self-renewal and by formation of the wide range of myeloid and lymphoid lineages tested. Results clearly <b>documented</b> <b>concurrent</b> contributions of cohorts of stem cells to hematopoiesis.

METHODS: Included patients received treatment within two prospective clinical trials: AGO-OVAR 2. 4 phase I trial (Carboplatin/ Gemcitabine; N= 25, protocol AGO-OVAR 2. 4) and AGO led Intergroup phase III trial (Carboplatin vs Carboplatin/ Gemcitabine; N= 356, protocol AGO-OVAR 2. 5, EORTC-GCG, NCIC CTG). <b>Concurrent</b> medication was <b>documented</b> after every cycle and thorough monitoring was conducted. RESULTS: During the studies 38 patients (9. 97 %) received a beta blocker as co-medication. Patients treated with beta blockers were significant older than patients not treated with beta blockers. Response rates to chemotherapy were not different between patients treated with beta blockers and those who were not. After a median follow up of 17 months, 349 (91. 6 %) patients had progressive disease and 267 (70. 1 %) patients had died. No difference in median progression-free survival (7. 79 vs 7. 62 months (p= 0. 95)) and overall survival (21. 2 vs 17. 3 months (P= 0. 18)) was recorded for patients treated with and without beta blocker. In multivariate analyses including age, platinum free-interval, study treatment and ECOG performance status beta blocker treatment was not associated with a significant impact on progression-free survival (HR: 0. 92; 95 %CI: 0. 65 - 1. 31; P= 0. 65) and overall survival (HR: 0. 74; 95 %CI: 0. 49 - 1. 11; P= 0. 15).

40|$|Integrating {{technology}} readiness levels (TRL) {{into the}} management of engineering projects {{is critical to the}} mitigation of risk and improved customer/supplier communications. TRLs provide a common framework and language with which consistent comparisons of different technologies and approaches can be made. At Sandia National Laboratories, where technologies are developed, integrated and deployed into high consequence systems, the use of TRLs may be transformational. They are technology independent and span the full range of technology development including scientific and applied research, identification of customer requirements, modeling and simulation, identification of environments, testing and integration. With this report, we provide a reference set of definitions for TRLs and a brief history of TRLs at Sandia National Laboratories. We then propose and describe two approaches that may be used to integrate TRLs into the NW SMU business practices. In the first approach, we analyze how TRLs can be integrated within <b>concurrent</b> qualification as <b>documented</b> in TBP- 100 [1]. In the second approach {{we take a look at}} the product realization process (PRP) as documented in TBP-PRP [2]. Both concurrent qualification and product realization are fundamental to the way weapons engineering work is conducted at this laboratory and the NWC (nuclear weapons complex) as a whole. Given the current structure and definitions laid out in the TBP- 100 and TBP-PRP, we believe that integrating TRLs into concurrent qualification (TBP- 100) rather than TBP-PRP is optimal. Finally, we note that our charter was to explore and develop ways of integrating TRLs into the NW SMU and therefore we do not significantly cover the development and history of TRLs.

One hundred and fifty-five taxa belonging to 50 families were identified, with the Asteraceae (21 %), Poaceae (11 %), and Rosaceae (9 %) as the most species-rich families. Ninety-six species encountered at the Mine were native to North America (62 %), including 11 taxa (7 %) with rarity status {{in at least one}} New England state. Fifty-one species were non-native (33 %), including nine taxa (6 %) considered invasive in at least one New England state. We characterized how the plant community changed across different habitats at the Mine, from disturbed and exposed (waste rock piles, tailings pond) to inundated and relatively undisturbed (wetland, shore), and <b>documented</b> <b>concurrent</b> shifts in the ionic content of the soils across the habitats.

The first principal component axis of the 21 soil variables was significantly predicted by the ordination of the plant community, indicating a gradient of increasing organic matter, Fe, Mg, Mn, total N, Na, and K roughly parallel to the gradient of increasing wetland vegetation.

40|$|Fire {{has been}} an {{important}} component of ecosystems on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Fire can affect vegetation distribution, the carbon cycle, and climate. The relationship between climate and fire is complex, {{in large part because of}} a key role of vegetation type. Here, we evaluate regional scale fireâ€“climate relationships during a past global warming event, the Paleoceneâ€“Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), in order to understand how vegetation influenced the links between climate and fire occurrence in the Arctic region. To <b>document</b> <b>concurrent</b> changes in climate, vegetation, and fire occurrence, we evaluated biomarkers, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), terpenoids, and alkanes, from the PETM interval at a marine depositional site (IODP site 302, the Lomonosov Ridge) in the Arctic Ocean. Biomarker, fossil, and isotope evidence from site 302 indicates that terrestrial vegetation changed during the PETM. The abundance of the C 29 n-alkanes, pollen, and the ratio of leaf-wax n-alkanes relative to diterpenoids all indicate that proportional contributions from angiosperm vegetation increased relative to that from gymnosperms. These changes accompanied increased moisture transport to the Arctic and higher temperatures, as recorded by previously published proxy records. We find that PAH abundances were elevated relative to total plant biomarkers throughout the PETM, and suggest that fire occurrence increased relative to plant productivity. The fact that fire frequency or prevalence may have increased during wetter Arctic conditions suggests that changes in fire occurrence were not a simple function of aridity, as is commonly conceived. Instead, we suggest that the climate-driven ecological shift to angiosperm-dominated vegetation was what led to increased fire occurrence. Potential increases in terrestrial plant biomass that arose from warm, wet, and high CO 2 conditions were possibly attenuated by biomass burning associated with compositional changes in the plant community...|$|R
40|$|The Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments of the Central Asian basins include {{remnants}} of the easternmost extent of a large epicontinental sea. Before this sea retreated westward and eventually separated as the Paratethys Sea, it extended across Eurasia from the Mediterranean Tethys to the Tarim Basin in western China. Climate models have shown that by diminished moisture supply, {{the disappearance of the}} sea from Central Asia may have caused continental aridification in Asia. This thesis provides the required chronological framework of both the aridification and the sea retreat to test this causal link during Eocene times. A reference for the Asian aridification is provided by the well-dated Eocene to Oligocene Xining Basin record along the north-western margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Here the record has been extended downwards into middle Eocene lacustrine mudstone-gypsum successions and accurately constrained in age by magnetostratigraphy. Sedimentologic and pollen analyses on the precisely dated record reveal several aridification steps of which the most prominent occurred concomitant with rapid cooling directly following the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) at ~ 40. 0 Ma (base C 18 n. 2 n). The sea retreat has been studied in the Tarim Basin (western China), the Ferghana Basin (southern Kyrgyzstan) and the Afghan-Tajik Basin (south-western Tajikistan). The sea supposedly entered Central Asia in the Cretaceous and withdrew after five third-order marine incursions, of which the last two have been documented here. Integrated bio-magnetostratigraphic dating in the Tarim Basin shows the sea retreated stepwise from the southwest depression in the latest Lutetian at ~ 41 Ma (base C 18 r) and from the westernmost margin in the latest Bartonian-early Priabonian (near top C 17 n. 2 n-top C 16 n. 2 n). The shallow marine near-shore sediments of these last two incursions can be convincingly correlated by litho- and biostratigraphy across Central Asia, showing {{for the first time that}} the sea had probably largely retreated from Central Asia in the late Eocene. A major disconformity across the EOT in southwest Tarim confirms that Central Asia remained hydrologically connected to the Mediterranean Tethys in the Eocene and had not yet been isolated by tectonic uplift of the surrounding Pamir Mountains. This paleogeographic evolution is supported by paleomagnetic data from the southwest Tarim Basin showing that clockwise rotation took place after the fourth marine incursion, but was negligible after the Oligocene. Comparison to regional paleomagnetic data shows this is consistent with initial symmetric radial thrusting of the Pamir in response to the Eocene Indo-Asia collision, followed in the Miocene by continued anticlockwise rotation on its western margin and ceased clockwise rotations on its eastern margin subjected to the onset of a lithospheric strike-slip system. The stepwise sea retreat and disconformity are <b>concurrent</b> with <b>documented</b> aridification steps in the Xining Basin at ~ 41 Ma (C 19 n-C 18 r), ~ 37. 1 Ma (top C 17. 1 n) and the EOT at ~ 33. 9 Ma (top C 13 r), suggesting that the sea retreat and aridification in Asia were indirectly paced by global climate deterioration in the Eocene through eustatic level changes affecting the Proto-Paratethys Sea. In line with climate modelling results, the sea retreat may thus have amplified the aridification of Asiaâ€™s interior...|$|R

Abstract is included in. pdf <b>document.</b> <b>Concurrent</b> data structures simplify {{the development of}} concurrent programs by encapsulating commonly used mechanisms for synchronization and communication into data structures. This thesis develops a notation for describing concurrent data structures, presents examples of concurrent data structures, and describes an architecture to support concurrent data structures. Concurrent Smailtalk (CST), a derivative of Smailtalk- 80 with extensions for concurrency, is developed to describe concurrent data structures. CST allows the programmer to specify objects that are distributed over the nodes of a concurrent computer. These distributed objects have many constituent objects and thus can process many messages simultaneously. They are the foundation upon which concurrent data structures are built. The balanced cube is a concurrent data structure for ordered sets. The set is distributed by a balanced recursive partition that maps to the subcubes of a binary n-cube using a Gray code. A search algorithm, VW search, based on the distance properties of the Gray code, searches a balanced cube in O(log N) time. Because {{it does not have}} the root bottleneck that limits all tree-based data structures to 0 (1) concurrency, the balanced cube achieves [ [...] . ] concurrency. Considering graphs as concurrent data structures, graph algorithms are presented for the shortest path problem, the max-flow problem, and graph partitioning. These algorithms introduce new synchronization techniques to achieve better performance than existing algorithms. A message-passing, concurrent architecture is developed that exploits the characteristics of VLSI technology to support concurrent data structures. Interconnection topologies are compared on the basis of dimension. It is shown that minimum latency is achieved with a very low dimensional network. A deadlock-free routing strategy is developed for this class of networks, and a prototype VLSI chip implementing this strategy is described. A message-driven processor complements the network by responding to messages with a very low latency. The processor directly executes messages, eliminating a level of interpretation. To take advantage of the performance offered by specialization {{while at the same time}} retaining flexibility, processing elements can be specialized to operate on a single class of objects. These object experts accelerate the performance of all applications using this class...|$|R
40|$|One {{component}} of successful parenting {{is related to}} efficiency in foraging behaviour. The relationships among chick feeding, the size and type of food package, and length of parental foraging trips has not been well studied in seabirds. In addition, relatively few data have been collected on the activities of seabirds when foraging away from the nest site. The objectives of this study were: (1) to contrast productivity, feeding rate, and attendance patterns of individuals carrying a novel transmitter with a control group of birds; (2) to use radio-telemetry to assess the variability in foraging locations within and between individual male Common Terns; (3) to determine the seasonal variation in chick diet; (4) to determine for each transmittered bird, the relationships among the foraging patterns, parental behaviour, and seasonal reproductive success. The study took place over two years (1990 - 91) on a concrete breakwater 1 km offshore on Lake Erie near Port Colbome, Ontario. Ten pairs of terns in 1990 and 12 pairs in 1991 were radio-tracked by boat or car during the chick rearing stage. <b>Concurrent</b> behavioural observations <b>documented</b> the time each sex spent foraging or at the nest. The frequency and prey species composition of feeds to chicks were also recorded. The transmitters had negligible effects on the feeding frequency and brood attendance patterns of transmitter carrying birds. Peak nesting transmittered birds in 1990 and 1991 exhibited some inter-individual variability in foraging locations, however intraindividual variability was low. Birds foraged primarily {{to the west and}} northwest of the colony. Late nesters exhibited greater inter-individual variability, however intra-individual variability remained low for most birds. Neither group demonstrated sufficient variability to support the regular use of this colony as an "information centre". Individual transmittered birds had unique and predictable foraging patterns, and corresponding differences in feeding frequencies and brood attendance patterns, yet productivity was essentially equal between nests due to the impact and importance of stochastic events. Individuals that were recaptured in 1991 exhibited very similar foraging patterns to 1990, suggesting littie variability between years. Conservation of foraging patterns between years may have potential implications for mate choice decisions in future breeding seasons. Prey species delivered to chicks differed between morning and evening for peak and late nesters in 1990, but not 1991. Peak nesters in 1990 fed significantiy more Rainbow Smelt fOsmerus mordM) than Emerald Shiner (Notropis atherinoidesV this trend was reversed for late nesters who also fed large numbers of unidentified larval fish. No significant differences were found in 1991. Seasonal changes in prey species delivered to chicks is believed to be attributable to the temperature tolerances of the smelt and shiners, and the presence of large schools of larval fish during the late nesting season...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe sediments of the Central Asian basins {{include the}} {{remnants}} of the easternmost extent of a large epicontinental sea. Before it retreated westward and eventually separated as the Paratethys Sea following the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT), this shallow marine sea extended across the Eurasian continent from the Mediterranean Tethys in the west to the Tarim Basin in western China in the east. However, the paleogeography and the timing of the westward retreat of the proto-Paratethys Sea are too poorly constrained to identify its proposed controlling mechanisms and paleoenvironmental impacts. The sea supposedly entered Central Asia in the Cretaceous and five third-order marine incursions have been recognized from the Cretaceous-Paleogene sedimentary record, of which the last two transgressions are documented here. We studied the sea retreat in the Tarim Basin in western China, the Alai Valley and Ferghana Basin in southern Kyrgyzstan and the Afghan-Tajik Basin in south-western Tajikistan. Integrated bio-magnetostratigraphic dating shows that the sea retreated westward from the Tarim Basin in stepwise fashion. The major fourth transgression occurred during the Lutetian, after which the sea retreated from the southwest Tarim Basin paleodepocenter at 41 Ma (base C 18 r). The last and fifth transgression was restricted to the westernmost margin of the Tarim basin and occurred during latest Bartonian-early Priabonian (base C 17 n. 3 n-base C 16 n. 1 n). At the level of precision of our dating, each of these marine incursions is apparently synchronous across the Tarim Basin suggesting rapid regional transgression/regression cycles in these shallow epicontinental basins with limited diachroneity. The shallow marine near-shore sediments of these last two transgressions can be convincingly correlated by litho- and biostratigraphy across Central Asia, showing {{for the first time that}} the sea may have largely retreated from Central Asia in the late Eocene. The lack of apparent diachroneity of the two last regressions and their concomitancy with the closure of the Turgai Strait in the late Lutetian, with short-term cooling events recognized in contemporary marine records, important late Eocene regressions documented in European basins (e. g. Paris Basin, Ebro Basin, and Transylvanian Basin) and with minor drops in global sea-level, suggest that the individual marine incursions may have been controlled by short-term global fluctuations in sea-level. On the other hand, the gradual continuous character of the marinecontinental transitions and the westward paleogeographic step between the fourth and fifth incursions, separated by several millions of years, rather are typical of long-term tectonic control. Tectonism is likely related to the Eocene India-Asia collision and Pamir initiation to the south in agreement with the infilling with northward paleoflow directions observed in the investigated sections. This is confirmed here by paleomagnetic data from the southwest Tarim Basin showing that clockwise rotation initiated after the fourth marine incursion, probably in response to initial symmetric radial thrusting of the Pamir Mountains. However, the presence of a major disconformity in the southwest Tarim Basin at the EOT, associated with a major global sea-level fall, confirms that the Tarim Basin remained hydrologically connected to the Mediterranean Tethys in the Eocene and had not yet been isolated by tectonic uplift of the surrounding mountains. This is in agreement with previously reported late Oligocene-early Miocene exhumation ages of the Pamir-Kunlun orogenic system and proposed kinematic models suggesting that after late Oligocene-early Miocene initiation of slip along the Kashgar-Yecheng Transfer System along the Eastern Pamir. This is consistent with the paleomagnetic data presented here showing that after the Oligocene deformation became asymmetric with ceased clockwise rotation in the Tarim Basin and continued anticlockwise rotation on the western side in the Afghan-Tajik Basin. The stepwise sea retreat and disconformity are <b>concurrent</b> with the <b>documented</b> aridification steps in the Notheastern Tibetan Plateau (Xining Basin) at 41 Ma (C 19 n-C 18 r), 37. 1 Ma (top C 17. 1 n) and the EOT at 33. 9 Ma (top C 13 r), suggesting that the sea retreat and aridification in Asia were indirectly paced by global climate deterioration in the Eocene through eustatic level changes affecting the Proto-Paratethys sea. In line with climate modelling results, the sea retreat may have amplified the aridification of the Asian interior. Hence, future studies of Asian paleoenvironmental change during Eocene times also have to be interpreted in terms of fluctuations in moisture supply by the changing paleogeography of the proto-Paratethys Sea in Central Asia...|$|R
