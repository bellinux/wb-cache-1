2500|$|The {{implementation}} of healthcare insurance reform began in June 2006, with {{the appointment of}} members of the <b>Connector</b> <b>board</b> and the naming of Jon Kingsdale, a Tufts Health Plan official, {{as executive director of the}} Connector. On July 1, MassHealth began covering dental care and other benefits, and began enrolling children between 200% and 300% of the poverty level. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved the state's waiver application on July 26, 2006, allowing the state to begin enrolling 10,500 people from the waitlist for the MassHealth Essential program, which provides Medicaid coverage to long-term unemployed adults below the poverty line. In 2006, the Division of Health Care Finance and Policy issued regulations defining [...] "fair and reasonable" [...] for the fair share assessment. The regulations provide that companies with 11 or more full-time equivalent employees will meet the “fair and reasonable” test if at least 25 percent of those employees are enrolled in that firm’s health plan and the company is making a contribution toward it. A business that fails that test may still be deemed to offer a [...] "fair and reasonable" [...] contribution if the company offers to pay at least 33 percent of an individual’s health insurance premium.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{effective}} in 2006, the <b>Connector</b> <b>Board</b> set premium levels and copayments {{for the state}} subsidized Commonwealth Care plans. Premiums will vary from $18 per month, for individuals with incomes 100%–150% of the poverty line, to $106 per month for individuals with incomes 250%–300% of poverty. The Connector approved two copayment schemes for plans for people 200%–300% of poverty. One plan will have higher premiums and lower copayments, while a second choice will have lower premiums and higher copayments. Four managed care plans began offering Commonwealth Care on November 1, 2006. Coverage for people above 100% of poverty up to 300% of poverty began on February 1, 2007. As of December 1, 2007, around 158,000 people had been enrolled in Commonwealth Care plans. Initial bids received by the Connector showed a likely cost for the minimum insurance plan of about $380 per month. The Connector rejected those bids, and asked insurers to propose less expensive plans. New bids were announced on March 3, 2007. The Governor announced that [...] "the average uninsured Massachusetts resident {{will be able to}} purchase health insurance for $175 per month." [...] But plan costs will vary greatly depending on the plan selected, age and geographic location, ranging from just over $100 per month for plans for young adults with high copayments and deductibles to nearly $900 per month for comprehensive plans for older adults with low deductibles and copayments. Copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket contributions may vary among plans. The proposed minimum creditable coverage plan would have a deductible no higher than $2,000 per individual, $4,000 per family, and would limit out-of-pocket expenses to a $5,000 maximum for an individual and $7,500 for a family. Before the deductible applies, the proposed plan includes preventive office visits with higher copayments, but would not include emergency room visits if the person was not admitted.|$|E

40|$|An FPGA-based Linux {{test-bed}} {{was constructed}} {{for the purpose}} of measuring its sensitivity to single-event upsets.

The experiments performed here demonstrate that the Linux-based system was sensitive to 199, 584 or about 1. 4 percent of all tested bits. Each sensitive bit in the bit-stream is mapped to the resource and user-module to which it configures. A density metric for comparing the reliability of modules within the system is presented.

40|$|The lack of {{open access}} to the pre-beamformed data of an {{ultrasound}} scanner has limited the research of novel imaging methods to a few privileged laboratories. To address this need, we have developed a pre-beamformed data acquisition (DAQ) system that can collect data over 128 array elements in parallel from the Ultrasonix series of research-purpose ultrasound scanners. Our DAQ system comprises three system-level blocks: 1) a <b>connector</b> <b>board</b> that interfaces with the array probe and the scanner through a probe connector port; 2) a main board that triggers DAQ and controls data transfer to a computer; and 3) four receiver boards that are each responsible for acquiring 32 channels of digitized raw data and storing them to the on-board memory. This system can acquire pre-beamformed data with 12 -bit resolution when using a 40 -MHz sampling rate. It houses a 16 GB RAM buffer that is sufficient to store 128 channels of pre-beamformed data for 8000 to 25 000 transmit firings, depending on imaging depth; corresponding to nearly a 2 -s period in typical imaging setups. Following the acquisition, the data can be transferred through a USB 2. 0 link to a computer for offline processing and analysis. To evaluate the feasibility of using the DAQ system for advanced imaging research, two proof-of-concept investigations have been conducted on beamforming and plane-wave B-flow imaging. Results show that adaptive beamforming algorithms such as the minimum variance approach can generate sharper images of a wire cross-section whose diameter {{is equal to the}} imaging wavelength (150 μm in our example). Also, planewave B-flow imaging can provide more consistent visualization of blood speckle movement given the higher temporal resolution of this imaging approach (2500 fps in our example). © 2012 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Access to the pre-beamform data of each array {{channel on}} an {{ultrasound}} scanner {{is important to}} experimental investigations on advanced imaging research topics like adaptive beamforming and synthetic aperture imaging. Through such data access, we can obtain in-vitro or in-vivo insights on various imaging methods without resorting to hardware implementation. This paper reports {{the development of a}} pre-beamform data acquisition (DAQ) system that can collect data from 128 array elements in parallel. Our DAQ system is intended to interface with a Sonix-RP research scanner through a probe connector port. It comprises three major blocks: 1) a <b>connector</b> <b>board</b> that interfaces with the array probe and the scanner; 2) a main board that triggers data acquisition and controls data transfer to a computer; 3) four receiver boards that are each responsible for acquiring 32 channels of digitized raw data and storing them to the on-board DDR 2 memory. The probe-connecting end of this system is interfaced with TX 810 chips to facilitate switching between transmit and receive modes. When receiving data, the incoming analog signal is first passed into a low-noise amplifier. These signals are then sent into AD 9272 chips on the four receiver boards to perform time gain compensation, anti-alias filtering, and 12 -bit data sampling at an 80 MHz rate. Subsequently, the digitized signal samples are de-serialized using a Virtex- 5 FPGA and are stored into DDR 2 memory. To facilitate data retrieval, we implemented a Virtex- 5 FPGA on the main board to initiate data transfer, and if preferred, to perform onboard beamforming (programmable by user) prior to sending data to a computer through a USB 2. 0 link. For our prototype, we used 16 GB of DDR 2 memory for data storage. With a frame rate of 35 Hz, a 10 cm depth-of-view and 128 transmit firings per frame, this DAQ system is capable of collecting pre-beamform data from all array channels for 2. 5 seconds. We are currently completing the prototype development in collaboration with Ultrasonix. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
