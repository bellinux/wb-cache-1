In large-scale microorganism processes such as fermentation, progeny cells lacking the plasmid insert often have a higher fitness than those who inherit the plasmid and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms.

Studies were made in axenic conditions with yeast extract, peptone and glucose added to the culture medium, each alone, in combinations of two or all together.

The organic carbon source affected the biochemical composition. The components most affected were the carbohydrates, with values between 6. 5 pg cell− 1 in <b>control</b> <b>cultures</b> and 48. 5 pg cell− 1 in glucose cultures. Protein content ranged between 27. 5 pg cell− 1 in <b>control</b> <b>cultures</b> and 88. 6 pg cell− 1 in yeast + glucose + peptone cultures. The lipid content changed little. Maximum protein yields were reached in cultures with yeast + glucose and with yeast - glucose - peptone, with values of 24. 6 and 28. 2 mg 1 − 1 d− 1, respectively. These values are 22 and 25 times those in <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> A maximum carbohydrate yield of 7. 9 mg carbohydrate per litre per day was obtained in yeast + glucose + peptone cultures, 27 times that in the <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> The maximum lipid yield was obtained with yeast + glucose + peptone and yeast + glucose.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether 4 -tert-octylphenol (OP) affects the differentiation of multipotent C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells, a cell line established from mouse embryonic connective tissue, into osteoblast and adipocyte lineages. Conflu-ent C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells were incubated for 7 days with (OP-treated <b>cultures)</b> or without (<b>control</b> <b>cultures)</b> 15 mg/ml of OP. The 7 -day treatment of confluent cells with OP decreased alkaline phospha-tase activity by 81 %, inhibited the expression of transforming growth factor b 2, and inhibited the morphological changes in cells to an osteoblastic appearance. These results indicate that the 7 -day treatment of confluent C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells with OP inhibited their differentiation into osteoblasts. Since this treatment strongly induced the expression of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor r (PPARr) but did not stimulate triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation in cells, C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells in the <b>control</b> and OP-treated <b>cultures</b> were incubated for 2 days with a hormone mixture (insulin [INS], dexamethasone, and 1 -methyl- 3 -isobutyl-xanthine) and incubated for an additional 5 days with INS alone. The TG and adiponectin contents of the OP-treated cultures were 4. 2 and 4. 1 times higher, respectively, than those of the <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> There were many more Oil Red O–staining cells in the OP-treated cultures than in the <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> The expression of PPARr in the OP-treated cultures was higher than that in the <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> These results indicate that the OP-treated cultures contained a larger number of adipocytes than the <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> In conclusion, treatment of C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells with OP inhibited osteoblast differentiation, causing a lineage shift toward adipocytes...|$|R

A flux balance analysis (FBA) showed negligible homoacetogenic flux in mesophilic cultures pretreated with linoleic acid (IA) and loading shock (LS) after successive batch cultivations.

40|$|Identifying {{external}} {{factors that can}} be used to control neural stem cells division and their differentiation to neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes is of high scientific and clinical interest. Here we show that the Nogo- 66 receptor interacting protein LINGO- 1 is a potent regulator of neural stem cell maturation to neurons. LINGO- 1 is expressed by cortical neural stem cells from E 14 mouse embryos and inhibition of LINGO- 1 during the first days of neural stem cell differentiation results in decreased neuronal maturation. Compared to neurons in <b>control</b> <b>cultures,</b> which after 6 days of differentiation have long extending neurites, neurons in cultures treated with anti-LINGO- 1 antibodies retain an immature, round phenotype with only very short processes. Furthermore, neutralization of LINGO- 1 results in a threefold increase in bIII tubulin-positive cells compared to untreated <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> By using BrdU incorporation assays we show that the immature neurons in LINGO- 1 neutralized cultures are dividing neuroblasts. In contrast to <b>control</b> <b>cultures,</b> in which no cells were double positive for bIII tubulin and BrdU, 36 % of the neurons in cultures treated with anti-LINGO- 1 antibodies were proliferating after three days of differentiation. TUNEL assays revealed that the amount of cells going through apoptosis during the early phase of differentiation was significantly decreased in cultures treated with anti-LINGO- 1 antibodies compared to untreated <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel role for LINGO- 1 in neural stem cell differentiation to neurons and suggest a possibility to use LINGO- 1 inhibitors to compensate for neuronal cell loss in th...|$|R

The use of concentrated algae cells in the mass culture of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis (Brachionidae) has opened new horizons for research on this organism. Pastes of Rhodomonas salina (Pyrenomonadaceae) obtained either by centrifugation or flocculation with chitosan were preserved, with or without vitamin C, at - 20 °C for four weeks and were evaluated biochemically (proteins, lipids, pigments and fatty acids contents) and subsequently, were used to feed the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis {{at a ratio of}} 25 mg/L/day. Four different microalgae pastes were prepared: (1) centrifuged and preserved with vitamin C (CV), (2) centrifuged and preserved without vitamin C (C), (3) flocculated and with vitamin C (FV) and (4) flocculated without vitamin C (F). All treatments showed similar contents of proteins and total lipids with respect to <b>control</b> <b>culture</b> (a fresh culture of R. salina), with mean values of 40. 0 ± 2. 32 % and 12. 0 ± 1. 45 %, respectively. The pheophytin a/chlorophyll a ratio, a general indicator of the chemical status of microalgal concentrates, was similar (0. 09 - 0. 11) between centrifuged pastes and <b>control</b> <b>culture,</b> but was found to be higher in flocculated pastes (1. 28 - 1. 48). The fatty acid profile varied with respect to the <b>control</b> <b>culture,</b> mainly in the proportion of the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) : eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Total PUFAs, EPA and DHA contents were statistically similar between centrifuged pastes and <b>control</b> <b>culture</b> (PUFAs: 47 %, EPA: 4 % and DHA: 4. 7 %), whereas values obtained for flocculated pastes were significantly lower.

40|$|Addition of actinomycin D (or cordycepin, an {{alternative}} inhibitor of RNA synthesis) to cartilage cultures {{resulted in a}} first-order decrease {{in the rate of}} incorporation of [35 S]sulphate into proteoglycan (half-life = 7. 5 +/- 1. 1 h). Addition of 1. 0 mM-benzyl beta-D-xyloside relieved the initial inhibition of glycosaminoglycan synthesis induced by actinomycin D; however, after a lag of about 10 h the rate of xyloside-initiated glycosaminoglycan synthesis also decreased with apparent first-order kinetics (half-life = 7. 1 +/- 1. 8 h), which paralleled the decrease in the rate of core-protein-initiated glycosaminoglycan synthesis. The hydrodynamic size of the proteoglycans formed in the presence of actinomycin D remained essentially constant (Kav. 0. 21 - 0. 23), whereas the constituent glycosaminoglycan chains were larger than those formed by <b>control</b> <b>cultures,</b> which suggested that the core protein was substituted with fewer but larger glycosaminoglycan chains. Proteoglycans formed in the presence of beta-D-xyloside were significantly smaller (Kav. approximately 0. 33) than those synthesized by <b>control</b> <b>cultures,</b> and were further diminished in size after exposure of cultures to actinomycin D. Glycosaminoglycan chains synthesized by these same cultures on to both core-protein and xyloside acceptors were also smaller than those of <b>control</b> <b>cultures.</b> The decrease in synthesis observed after exposure to actinomycin D was not reflected by any significant decrease in the activities of several glycosyltransferases involved in chondroitin sulphate synthesis (galactosyltransferase-I, galactosyltransferase-II, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and glucuronosyltransferase-II) ...|$|R
