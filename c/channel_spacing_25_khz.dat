40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} cells offers insight into {{many aspects of}} their properties. We propose an approach to the mechanical analysis of cells that uses a combination of electromanipulation for stimulus and capacitance for sensing. To demonstrate this approach, polystyrene spheres and yeast cells flowing in a 25 μm× 100 μm microfluidic channel were detected by a perpendicular pair of gold thin film electrodes in the <b>channel,</b> <b>spaced</b> <b>25</b> μm apart. The presence of cells was detected by capacitance changes between the gold electrodes. The capacitance sensor was a resonant coaxial radio frequency cavity (2. 3 GHz) coupled to the electrodes. The presence of yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and polystyrene spheres resulted in capacitance changes of approximately 10 and 100 attoFarad (aF), respectively, with an achieved capacitance resolution of less than 2 aF in a 30 Hz bandwidth. The resolution is better than previously reported in the literature, and the capacitance changes are in agreement with values estimated by finite element simulations. Yeast cells were trapped using dielectrophoretic forces by applying a 3 V signal at 1 MHz between the electrodes. After trapping, the cells were displaced using amplitude and frequency modulated voltages to produce modulated dielectrophoretic forces. Repetitive displacement and relaxation of these cells was observed using both capacitance and video microscopy...|$|R

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of UHF CB radios in 1977, many operators used both UHF and HF radios and formed groups to own and operate local FM repeaters. Members of the CBTCC formed {{what became known as}} Australian Citizens Radio Movement (ACRM) in the early 1970s; this organization became the voice for legalization of CB radio throughout Australia. After peaking in the 1970s and early 1980s, the use of 27 MHz CB in Australia has fallen dramatically due to {{the introduction}} of 477 MHz UHF CB (with FM and repeaters) and the proliferation of cheap, compact handheld UHF transceivers. Technology such as mobile telephones and the internet have provided people with other choices for communications. The Australian government has changed the allocation of channels available for UHF CB Radio from 40 to 80, and doubled the number of repeater channels from 8 to 16. This was done by taking the existing channels that had a <b>spacing</b> of <b>25</b> <b>kHz</b> between (Known as wide band) them and placing new channels in between the old 40 channels. So now the channels have 12.5 kHz spacing between them (now called narrow band). But the original 40 channels are still on the original frequencies.|$|R
50|$|On 27 May 2011 the <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> on UHF CB was changed, {{allowing}} the band to expand from 40 channels to 80 channels.

40|$|Real-time ultrahigh-resolution {{microwave}} frequency identification is paramount for widespread applications, such as communications, radar, and electronic warfare. Photonics-assisted {{microwave frequency}} identification {{can be achieved}} using an optical channelizer. While this technique enables simultaneous measurement of multiple frequencies, it has poor measurement resolution due to the large <b>channel</b> <b>spacing,</b> which is usually greater than 1 GHz. Here, we introduce a new channelizer-based microwave frequency measurement technique that offers nearly 500 times higher spectral resolution. This method employs largely dispersed broadband optical pulses to encode the time-domain characteristics of the modulating signal to the optical spectral domain. An optical channelizer is employed to slice the spectrum, which is equivalent to performing temporal sampling of the time-domain waveform. The unknown microwave signal is then reconstructed and its spectral distribution is analyzed by a digital processor. To evaluate the proposed technique, frequency measurements of a single-tone, a multiple-tone, and a frequency-hopping microwave signal are demonstrated. A measurement resolution as high as 55 MHz is achieved using an optical channelizer with a <b>channel</b> <b>spacing</b> of <b>25</b> GHz...|$|R

40|$|The European Union ACTS project SONATA {{is going}} to {{demonstrate}} a ((switchless)) all-optical network to provide a hture single-layer, advanced transport architecture on a national scale [I].

No electronic switching nodes or cross-connects (telephony, IP.
