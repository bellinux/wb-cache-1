40|$|Evaporated silver {{films as}} an oxygen {{electrode}} material were studied in-situ and ex-situ by XPS and UPS under UHV conditions. The experimental set-up {{consisted of a}} miniaturised solid state galvanic cell with yttria stabilised zirconia as solid electrolyte and a solid oxide reference electrode. The oxygen activity at the working electrode was changed by controlling the electrode potential versus the reference electrode consisting of a metal/metal oxide system Me/MeO (with Me=Pd or Fe). The electrode surface was investigated by XPS and UPS under <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation</b> with low oxygen activity as well as under anodic polarisation with steady-state oxygen evolution. The measurements have been performed between 720 K and 1100 K. With XPS, several oxygen species have been detected at the silver surface. Their concentration depends on the applied electrode potential. A species with low XPS binding energy was found whose intensity increased with anodic polarisation. It is attributed to oxygen species at the surface and at subsurface sites. The latter corresponds to oxygen atoms dissolved in the bulk. Under <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation,</b> the oxygen species at low binding energy disappeared, but a second oxygen species at higher XPS binding energy grew in intensity with increasing <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation.</b> In view of the reducing condition {{and the presence of}} water, this latter oxygen signal is attributed to a steady state concentration of hydroxyl species at the surface. With UPS, the work function of electrons at the silver surface was determined {{as a function of the}} applied overpotential. The work function of silver increased by about 1. 6 eV in changing from a <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation</b> - 1. 5 V to an anodic polarisation of + 1. 5 V. This pronounced change is caused by a concentration decrease of adsorbed OH and a corresponding increase of adsorbed O atoms leading to a higher surface electron affinity. Applying high cathodic as well as anodic polarisation led to the formation of insulated sil ver particles within open pores of the silver layer on the surface of the zirconia. These particles which are electronically coupled to the Fermi level of the underlying zirconia cause a superposed but slightly shifted second UPS spectrum with the shift depending on the effective overvoltage. The as determined overvoltage at the silver electrode depends linearly on the cell voltage...|$|E
40|$|Two criticisms {{which are}} {{frequently}} advanced to counter {{observations of the}} generation of excess enthalpy in the <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisations</b> of Pd-based electrodes in D 2 O-based electrolytes (e. g. see (1), (2)) are usually based on the assertion that the isoperibolic calorimeters used in these studies are imprecise and inaccurate. Furthermore, any excess enthalpy generation is then attributed to the reduction of electrogenerated oxygen although such assertions have not been accompanied by appropriate measurements. There is naturally a link between these two assertions. The {{first step in the}} development of any investigative methodology should be the determination of the relevant “instrument functions ” of the instrumentation used, here the isoperibolic calorimeter illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig 1. The Isoperibolic Calorimetric Cell. We note the following key features of this design: (i) heat transfer is controlled by radiation across the vacuum gap, this heat transfer being predominantly due to the lower, unsilvered parts of the cells. The heat transfer is therefore given by the product of the Stefan-Boltzmann coefficient and the radiant surface area as has been confirmed in numerous studies.

The focus is on the surface chemistry and catalytic role of Cu, the increasingly popular metallic component in electrodes used in CO 2 electrolysis and CO 2 /H 2 O co-electrolysis. The NAPXPS and NEXAFS results, obtained in situ and operando conditions and under electrochemical control have provided important insights about the evolution of the Cu surface chemical composition. We have found that in dry CO 2 ambient carbon deposits are scavenged at low cathodic potential by the oxidising action of nascent O, while at high <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisations</b> C grows due to activation of the CO reduction.

40|$|An {{attractive}} {{alternative to}} ineffective and inefficient biocide dosing strategies for seawater piping systems {{would be to}} monitor, quantitatively evaluate and then induce biofilm disruption when necessary using an environmentally friendly biocide. The aim of the present Ostl and EPSRC funded project is to (i) sense {{for the presence of}} bacterial biofilms on metallic surfaces within seawater handling systems (e. g. heat exchangers, pipework, pumps and valves) by deploying a sensor technology to ultimately disrupt biofilms matrix and to (ii) qualitatively and quantitatively assess the extent of bacterial fouling. An electrochemical sensor using a 0. 2 mm diameter gold electrode was characterised in abiotic and biotic media within a modified continuous culture flow cell under a controlled laboratory environment. Herein, electrochemical measurements by imposing electrical <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisations</b> have demonstrated enhancement of the oxygen reduction reaction within aerobic bacterial biofilms. Importantly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at open circuit potential, i. e. without electrical imposed polarisation, was successfully employed to monitor initial bacterial biofilms growth and extent. An important parameter of the sensor response (capacitive component) can provide insight into quantitative evaluation of the interface, where {{for the first time in}} situ quantifiable EIS data were in good agreement with ex situ confocal microscopy analyses. Consequently, a relationship for the surface charge density (capacitive component I estimated number of sessile bacterial population) has outlined its potential use for in-service conditions. Uniquely, the electrochemical performances of a 72 h-old biofilmed gold surface dosed with nanomolar concentration; 500 nM, of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside were presented. Corroborative confocal microscopy studies have revealed effective and efficient dispersal of aerobic bacterial biofilms exposed to nitric oxide. Overall, this unique qualitative and quantitative bacterial biofilm investigation utilising a modified once through flow cell, i. e. combining microbiological and engineering expertise, represents an important first step in controlling of marine biofouling within seawater piping systems.

In addition, the concrete resistivity was continuously monitored and <b>cathodic</b> and anodic <b>polarisation</b> curves were measured. The results are consistent and imply that the localised corrosion process is in the initial phase of pit growth under mixed anodic/ohmic control.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Conventional tin-lead solder alloys {{have been widely used}} in electronics interconnection owing to their properties such as low melting temperature, good ductility and excellent wettability on copper and other substrates. However, due to the worldwide legislation addressing the concern over the toxicity of lead, the usage of lead-containing solders has been phased out, thus stimulating substantial efforts on lead-free alternatives, amongst which eutectic Sn-Ag and Sn-Cu, and particularly Sn-Ag-Cu alloys, are promising candidates as recommended by international parties. To meet the increasing demands of advanced electronic products, high levels of integration of electronic devices are being developed and employed, which is leading to a reduction in package size, but with more and more input/output connections. Flip chip technology is therefore seen as a promising technique for chip interconnection compared with wire bonding, enabling higher density, better heat dissipation and a smaller footprint. This thesis is intended to investigate lead-free (eutectic Sn-Ag, Sn-Cu and Sn-Ag-Cu) wafer level solder bumping through electrodeposition for flip chip interconnection, as well as electroplating lead-free solderable finishes on electronic components. The existing knowledge gap in the electrochemical processes as well as the fundamental understanding of the resultant tin-based lead-free alloys electrodeposits are also addressed. For the electrodeposition of the Sn-Cu solder alloys, a methanesulphonate based electrolyte was established, from which near-eutectic Sn-Cu alloys were achieved over a relatively wide process window of current density. The effects of methanesulphonic acid, thiourea and OPPE (iso-octyl phenoxy polyethoxy ethanol) as additives were investigated respectively by <b>cathodic</b> potentiodynamic <b>polarisation</b> curves, which illustrated the resultant electrochemical changes to the electrolyte. Phase identification by X-ray diffraction showed the electrodeposits had a biphasic structure (β-Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5). Microstructures of the Sn-Cu electrodeposits were comprehensively characterised, which revealed a compact and crystalline surface morphology under the effects of additives, with cross-sectional observations showing a uniform distribution of Cu 6 Sn 5 particles predominantly along β-Sn grain boundaries. The electrodeposition of Sn-Ag solder alloys was explored in another pyrophosphate based system, which was further extended to the application for Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloys. <b>Cathodic</b> potentiodynamic <b>polarisation</b> demonstrated the deposition of noble metals, Ag or Ag-Cu, commenced before the deposition potential of tin was reached. The co-deposition of Sn-Ag or Sn-Ag-Cu alloy was achieved with the noble metals electrodepositing at their limiting current densities. The synergetic effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 600 and formaldehyde, dependent on reaching the cathodic potential required, helped to achieve a bright surface, which consisted of fine tin grains (200 nm) and uniformly distributed Ag 3 Sn particles for Sn-Ag alloys and Ag 3 Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5 for Sn-Ag-Cu alloys, as characterised by microstructural observations. Near-eutectic Sn-Ag and Sn-Ag-Cu alloys were realised as confirmed by compositional analysis and thermal measurements. Near-eutectic lead-free solder bumps of 25 μm in diameter and 50 μm in pitch, consisting of Sn-Ag, Sn-Cu or Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloys depending on the process and electrolyte employed, were demonstrated on wafers through the electrolytic systems developed. Lead-free solder bumps were further characterised by material analytical techniques to justify the feasibility of the processes developed for lead-free wafer level solder bumping...|$|R

40|$|Natural gases contain {{impurities}} such as {{mercury and}} water, which both act simultaneously and cause a significant corrosion {{of aluminium alloys}} constituting the cryogenic exchangers tubes used in the industries of natural gas liquifaction. Corrosion creates many problems of liquifaction units (Groningen (Holland), Skikda, Bethioua (Algeria). The process of corrosion begins with an adsorption of mercury on aluminium surfaces, {{the formation of an}} amalgam and an electrochemical oxidation of aluminium. The cathodic process is recognized as hydrogen evolution which occurs with a high overpotential on mercury and produces free radical H. which enhanced oxidation of aluminium and diffused in metal bulk causing stress corrosion. The effect of cathodically adsorbed hydrogen on amalgamated surfaces was not developed in previous studies of aluminium corrosion; this is the object of this study. Potentiodynamic techniques on amalgamated industrial alloy AA 5083 have been used in this study. The results show different anodic behaviors depending on the pH of the medium and <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation.</b> For pH values less than 4, anodic behaviour of amalgamated electrodes gave two oxidation peaks at respective constant potentials of - 1. 40 and - 1. 25 volt/SCE; the current peaks increased with a decrease of pH.

A novel "activation" procedure based on <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation</b> in ethanol (0. 01 M NBu 4 PF 6) is proposed and shown to be highly effective in promoting electron transfer to the aqueous Fe (CN) 63 - / 4 - redox system. For redox systems in acetonitrile, effects on electron transfer processes are strongly dependent on the type of electron transfer process. For decamethylferrocene+/ 0, decamethylcobaltocene+/ 0, methyviologen 2 +/+, and for methylviologen+/ 0 redox systems essentially reversible electron transfer is observed irrespective of the pre-treatment of the boron-doped diamond electrode. For the benzoquinone 0 /- redox system insignificant changes occur but for the benzoquinone-/ 2 - process a more dramatic change in electron transfer kinetics is observed (after <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation</b> in ethanol) consistent with an improved interfacial electron transfer (a 4. 6 × increase in peak current occurs). Finally, the tetraethyl-ethylenetetracarboxylate 0 /- system is investigated as a model olefin redox system. Again changes in reactivity occur (a 4. 0 × increase in peak current) at the cathodically pre-treated boron-doped diamond electrode. XPS surface analysis data reveal only insignificant changes in the chemical composition of the boron-doped diamond surface before and after activation and therefore a predominantly electronic mechanism for the "activation" process is proposed. In future selectivity effects for electron transfer at boron-doped diamond electrode surfaces could be introduced intentionally and used beneficially for chemo-selective electro-organic processes. © 2007 Elsevier B.

The level of toxicity of chromate conversion coating solutions {{has led to a}} search for alternatives. Molybdate has been considered, being a relatively non-toxic analogue from group (VIA) of the periodic table. The ability of molybdate to perform as an inhibitor in aerated conditions is well-reported, although its application in conversion coatings is less widely documented. The experimental work reported in this thesis was to a large extent based on potentiodynamic polarisation which is considered a powerful tool for evaluating potential coating solutions. The <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation</b> characteristics of zinc in group (VIA) oxy-anion solutions has been studied quantitatively. The effect of temperature, pH and aeration has been examined. The film-forming ability of molybdate-based solutions such as molybdate-orthophosphoric acid (MP), molybdate-orthophosphoric acid-nitrate and molybdate-orthophosphate has been examined with respect to a tin, tinplate or zinc substrate. Films were formed electrochemically (anodically and cathodically) or by a simple immersion technique. The performance of such coatings has been studied using classical corrosion tests such as sulphide stain and salt spray. The cathodic reduction characteristics of molybdate solutions have also been examined in detail with respect to possible lower valency films being produced (possibly as a result of molybdate's complex electrochemistry) on tinplate, zinc and platinum metal surfaces. Experimental results have indicated that simple, relatively dilute, molybdate solutions at pH 3 are capable of imparting good staining resistance to tinplate in sulphide stain tests. However, other mixed systems have proved less successful, only molybdate-orthophosphoric acid providing acceptable protection on tin foil. Simple immersion techniques in dilute, pH 5 molybdate solutions have provided moderate protection on zinc in 24 -hour salt spray tests. Inflections exhibited on <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation</b> curves of tinplate in simple molybdate solutions have been attributed to a physical degradation of the coating as opposed to a reduction step...|$|E

40|$|Underground {{pipelines}} protected with a {{thick coating}} and by <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation</b> may suffer a serious external corrosion damage {{in the presence of}} stray alternating current (AC) voltage induced by high voltage industrial electric transport system, such as power lines or electrified railroads. The origin of the corrosion enhancement comes from the nonlinearity of the currentpotential characteristics of the metal-soil interface. In this paper, we will theoretically evaluate the increase of the corrosion current density and the potential shift induced by a high amplitude AC signal to models of corroding systems: anodic polarisation curves obeying an exponential law with respect to the potential, and cathodic process under the mixed activation-diffusion kinetics. The originality of the present work lies in the use of {{a relatively small number of}} dimensionless variables to describe the faradaic rectification for the corrosion potential shift and the corrosion current enhancement. In this article, the effect of the electrolyte resistance was neglected...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of diamond electrodes {{depends on the}} chemical state of the diamond surface, and the present work is focussed on understanding how chemical changes either produced in situ electrochemically, or by ex situ plasma treatments, influence the electrochemical properties. Conductive boron-doped diamond electrodes were produced by depositing adherent boron-doped diamond films on tungsten substrates using a hot filament reactor and were characterised by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical methods. In order to produce electrochemically induced surface modifications, anodic and <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation</b> experiments were performed in an aqueous 0. 2 M phosphate buffer solution (pH = 2). The surface composition of the electrode, as determined by ex situ high-resolution XPS measurements, could {{be linked to the}} electrochemical performance of diamond film electrodes. The extent to which changes in surface composition and electrode performance can be controlled and reversed by suitable plasma treatments is explored. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S. A.

40|$|The anodic {{dissolution}} and the electrocatalytic {{properties of}} Fe 60 Co 20 Si 10 B 10 (Vitrovrac 7600, G 14) amorphous alloy in de-aerated 1 M KOH aqueous solutions were investigated at 25 and 70 °C by different electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation,</b> and galvanostatic transients). The results obtained show that voltammograms for the amorphous alloy change with time becoming stable after 20 - 25 cycles between - 1900 and + 100 mmV vs saturated sulphate electrode. Comparisons among voltammograms for polycrystalline iron, cobalt and the amorphous alloy, {{suggest that the}} first step of the anodic dissolution of the amorphous alloy is cobalt dissolution. The stable voltammogram of the amorphous alloy is quite similar to that of pure iron in the same environment, suggesting that after 20 - 25 cycles only iron dissolves. The electrocatalytic properties of the amorphous alloy vs the hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH increases by increasing the number of cycles which have been attributed to a porous Fe 3 O 4 layer covering the amorphous surface. © 1994...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibiting}} {{effect of}} straight chain mono- and di-carboxyilic acids and n-lauroylsarcosine on copper corrosion in 0. 01 and 0. 1 M NaCl solutions was studied. Tests were {{performed in the}} presence of 10 - 2 M concentration of inhibitors at pH 5. 7 and 8. 0, at 25 °C. Polarisation resistances were measured during 24 hours. Corrosion rate of Cu in the different solutions was determined by weight losses in 20 day tests. Anodic and <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation</b> curves were recorded after 24 hour immersion of electrodes in the solutions. The results showed that decanoic, undecanoic, sebacic acids and n-lauroylsarcosine at 10 - 2 M concentration were efficient inhibitors of copper corrosion in 24 hour tests in 0. 01 and 0. 1 M NaCl solutions at pH 5. 7 and 8. 0. By increasing the time length of tests, the inhibiting effect decreased or changed in stimulating effect. In 20 day tests only n-lauroysarcosine at pH 5. 7 and undecanoic acid at pH 8. 0 maintained their high inhibiting efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Research {{work on the}} {{inhibition}} of copper corrosion in chloride aqueous solutions by heterocyclic organic compounds, is in progress in this laboratory for several years. Various azole and thiazole derivatives, number of 1, 2, 3 - benzotriazole substituted have been tested, whereas recently some interesting results {{with a series of}} tetrazole derivatives have been obtained. The present paper will discuss the results obtained in inhibiting the copper corrosion in neutral sodium chloride solutions at 25 °C and 40 °C by 1, 2, 4 - triazole and some of its derivatives, such as amino-, mercapto- and carboxylic substitutes. Weight loss measurements, polarisation resistance determinations, recording of the anodic and <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation</b> curves and the calculation of the anodic and cathodic overvoltages in correspondence of definite anodic and cathodic current density values, have been used to evaluate the efficiency of the tested additives. The recording of the FTIR reflection spectra on Cu electrodes in various experimental conditions allowed the authors to draw some conclusions about the action of the quoted series of compounds...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCrack {{growth rates}} of small fatigue cracks in a high {{strength}} steel tested in 3. 5 % NaCl solution with cathodic protection are analysed in the Paris regime through the comparison with the corresponding results obtained in air or in high vacuum. Environmental effects in the saline solution are due to hydrogen produced by <b>cathodic</b> <b>polarisation,</b> which causes intergranular and transgranular brittle fracture surfaces. By comparison to fatigue crack growth rates obtained in air, it could be concluded that hydrogen effects are negligible at low Delta K and then increase with Delta K. But in fact, when compared to results obtained in a non-active media such as high vacuum, hydrogen effects in the saline solution are very high at low Delta K and decrease slightly when Delta K increases. In air, adsorption of the different gaseous species as well as hydrogen effects due to water vapour dissociation strongly enhance crack growth rate compared to vacuum especially for low Delta K. Consequently, a comparison with fatigue crack growth results obtained in air does not allow to quantify properly environmental effects due to another active environment such as the saline solution with cathodic protection considered in the present work...|$|E
