Several measures of learner performance of <b>compliments</b> were used, including: frequency of occurrence of norm-appropriate compliments; level of spontaneity (speaker-initiated, task-related spontaneous, and addressee-induced); level of appropriateness; well-informedness of utterance, and adjectival repertoire.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>complimenting</b> {{behavior among}} members of one Facebook network {{of family and friends}} in the US. It proposes a way of selecting a corpus for analysis within the online environment under scrutiny and offers a preliminary characterization of Facebook <b>compliments</b> in American English in relation to the form <b>compliments</b> take, common objects of <b>complimenting</b> and the key function(s) that they perform. As part of a multimodal system of communication, <b>compliments</b> on Facebook are described as a kind of second-pair part of photo-initiated communication online that can be employed to reaffirm the relationship and strengthen the bonds between the interactants. The paper also explores the extent to which <b>complimenting</b> behavior on Facebook resembles usage that has been described for American English in face-to-face interaction. It shows that <b>complimenting</b> behavior on Facebook is the same in some ways but also different. The differences identified appear to be mainly related to the medium of interaction and the affordances (and restrictions) of the technology that can give rise to variations of talk or perhaps even new social practices...|$|R
50|$|Janet Holmes {{suggests}} that the discrepancies in male-male and female-female complimentary language {{may be due to}} differences in perception concerning the purpose of <b>compliments.</b> The hypothesis is that women use <b>compliments</b> to build affiliations, while men use <b>compliments</b> to make evaluative judgments. Deborah Tannen attributes female linguistic behavior to the purpose of rapport-building, so, assuming <b>compliments</b> are being used as such a means, the data of complimentary language between women seems to suggest this tendency to create and strengthen affiliations is strongest between women.|$|R

5|$|It is certain, however, that Wood was répétiteur at Carte's Royal English Opera House for Sullivan's grand opera Ivanhoe in late 1890 {{and early}} 1891, and for André Messager's La Basoche in 1891–92. He {{also worked for}} Carte at the Savoy as {{assistant}} to François Cellier on The Nautch Girl in 1891. Wood remained devoted to Sullivan's music and later insisted on programming his concert works when {{they were out of}} fashion in musical circles. During this period, he had several compositions of his own performed, including an oratorio, St. Dorothea (1889), a light opera, Daisy (1890), and a one-act comic opera, Returning the <b>Compliment</b> (1890).|$|E
5|$|While parody {{sometimes}} {{served as}} {{a special kind of}} translation, some translations returned the <b>compliment</b> by providing a parodic version of the Elegy in their endeavour to accord to the current poetic style in the host language. An extreme example was provided by the classicised French imitation by the Latin scholar John Roberts in 1875. In place of the plain English of Gray’s “And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave”, he substituted the Parnassian Tous les dons de Plutus, tous les dons de Cythère (All the gifts of Plutus and of Cytherea) and kept this up throughout the poem in a performance that its English reviewer noted as bearing only the thinnest relation to the original.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Two studies tested {{whether people}} feel {{threatened}} by another individual verbally <b>complimenting</b> their romantic partner. Such <b>compliments</b> may indicate that the other person is a potential rival who will try to “poach ” their mate. Across two studies, women were more threatened than men when imagining another person <b>complimenting</b> their partner’s physical appearance. There were no sex differences in response to imagining another person <b>complimenting</b> their partner’s sense of humor. When another person <b>compliments</b> one’s partner’s physical appearance, this indicates {{that they may be}} sexually attracted to the partner. Mediation analyses revealed that the sex difference occurs because women believe men are more open to casual sex, and therefore more vulnerable to mate poaching when another person expresses sexual interest in them...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the ways in which}} speakers positively assess recipients—a generic practice of <b>complimenting</b> in talk-in-interaction—in the particular institutional context of a helpline for women seeking a home birth. It analyzes the positive assessments (n[*]=[*] 112) produced by a single call-taker across 80 helpline calls. It considers their design, how they are responded to, and the actions (other than or additional to <b>complimenting)</b> they are used to do. The findings support the literature, suggesting that <b>complimenting</b> is an important professional skill, and show both how it is done and its value for the helpline. They also extend our knowledge about <b>complimenting</b> as a social action more generally and about actions other than <b>complimenting</b> that positive assessments can be used to do...|$|R

Under Thomas, Crisp's role outside of his duties as the line coach was that of the team disciplinarian to <b>compliment</b> the soft-spoken, diplomatic style of Thomas. He continued in his role as line coach {{through the end of the}} 1941 season when he took a leave of absence to serve as a civilian physical training instructor for the U.S. Navy pre-flight school at the University of Georgia. He then returned to Alabama and again served as line coach for the 1945 season, before he left to take an assistant coaching position with the Miami Seahawks.|$|E
5|$|In May, a {{delegation}} of 31 Samogitian nobles arrived in Königsberg and promised loyalty to Vytautas by signing the Treaty of Königsberg. The joint forces of Vytautas and the Teutonic Knights consisted largely of volunteers and mercenaries from western Europe, notably from France, the German states, and England. Henry, Earl of Derby, the future King Henry IV of England and Marshal of France Jean Le Maingre were among the participants. The English crusaders left detailed records of their actions in Prussia and Lithuania, and their exploits were mentioned by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales, possibly as a <b>compliment</b> to the English knights and the future king. In the meantime, Jogaila achieved some military successes; his forces captured several castles in Podlaskie, leaving them to be guarded by Polish garrisons, and took Hrodna in April 1390 after a six-week siege.|$|E

You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{treating}} Prokofiev as {{a fugitive}} or exile, the Moscow government chose to consider {{him as a}} general ambassador for Soviet culture, and the composer returned the <b>compliment</b> by registering in France as {{a citizen of the}} Soviet Union, the new state formed on 20 December 1922 by Russia and the states of the former Russian Empire. Prokofiev expressed support for the political developments in what he still considered his homeland, and was keen to resume contacts there. He was accorded VIP status when he paid his first visit to the Soviet Union in 1927, for a recital tour. Further trips followed, and in 1930 Prokofiev took a flat in Moscow, although Paris remained his principal home. During this period of rapprochement he consciously sought to simplify his musical language into a form that he believed would be consistent with the official Soviet concept of art.|$|E
