Finally, we show that the entry of <b>copycats</b> does not always improve consumer surplus and social welfare. In particular, when the quality of the <b>copycat</b> is sufficiently low, the loss in status utility from consumers of the incumbent product overshadows the small gain in consumption utility from buyers of the <b>copycat,</b> leading to an overall decrease in consumer surplus and social welfare...|$|R

40|$|<b>Copycat</b> brands {{imitate the}} trade dress of other brands, {{such as their}} brand name, logo, and {{packaging}} design. <b>Copycats</b> typically operate in the core product category of the imitated brand {{under the assumption that}} such “in-category imitation” is most effective. In contrast, four experiments demonstrate the benefits of “out-of-category imitation” for <b>copycats,</b> and the harmful effect on the imitated brand. <b>Copycats</b> are evaluated more positively in a related category, because consumers appraise the similarity between <b>copycat</b> and imitated brand more positively than in the core category, independent of the perceived similarity itself. This is due to a reduced salience of norms regarding imitation in the related category. Moreover, the results show a damaging backlash effect of out-of-category imitation on the general evaluation of the imitated brand and on its key perceived product attributes. The findings replicate across student, MTurk, and representative consumer samples; multiple product categories; and forms of brand imitation. This research demonstrates that out-of-category brand imitation helps <b>copycat</b> brands and hurts national leading brands much more than has so far been considered, which has managerial and public policy implications...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{propose a}} method and metric to {{quantify}} the consumer confusion between leading brands and <b>copycat</b> brands that results from the visual similarity of their packaging designs.

Second, a perceptual decision task (triangle test) assesses the accuracy and speed with which consumers can identify differences between brands from rapidly (300 milliseconds) flashed images of their packages. Third, a competing accumulator model describes the buildup of evidence on each of the alternative brands during consumers’ perceptual decisions and predicts the accuracy and response time of brand identification. Jointly, these components establish the impact of <b>copycat</b> packaging’s visual features on consumer confusion. The method is applied in a test of experimentally designed <b>copycats</b> and market <b>copycats</b> in 15 product categories.

40|$|<b>Copycat</b> brands try {{to entice}} {{consumers}} by imitating the trade-dress of leading brands.

When uncertainty about product quality is low, people dislike <b>copycat</b> brands, but this preference reverses when uncertainty is high - despite awareness of the imitation tactics being used.
