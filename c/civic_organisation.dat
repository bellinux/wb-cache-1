40|$|Youth civic {{identities and}} social media {{practices}} are changing rapidly, and <b>civic</b> <b>organisations</b> {{are struggling to}} exploit the potential of social media to reach youth. One major challenge concerns the generational culture gap between the networked culture of today’s youth and the top–down culture characteristic of many <b>civic</b> <b>organisations.</b> This study presents lessons learnt from three cases where young designers (22 – 26 years) were engaged to develop social media concepts for <b>civic</b> <b>organisations.</b> Drawing on this experience, we present lessons learnt on how design by youth for youth may help to bridge the generational culture gap concerning civic engagement through social media. It is suggested that design may benefit from not only being informed by youth but also created by them. Through the design cases, we contribute to how <b>civic</b> <b>organisations</b> might innovate in their social media approach to better reflect the fast-changing networked youth culture...|$|R

It is argued that the EU is exporting a specific model of relationships between regional institutions and <b>civic</b> <b>organisations,</b> giving priority to the promotion of regional integration, democracy and social inclusion. This article shows that EU funds have significantly contributed to the shaping of the civil society landscape in both regions, especially enhancing the participation of excluded groups in the policy process at the regional level. It is also important to determine if the EU is acting as an internal or external promoter of <b>civic</b> <b>organisations.</b> Even if the economic, social and cultural context is not neglected, the differential impact is primarily related to different types of European requirements...|$|R
