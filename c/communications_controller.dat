5000|$|<b>Communications</b> <b>Controller</b> for Linux (<b>Communications</b> <b>Controller</b> for Linux on System z or CCL) is an IBM {{software}} product announced in 2005 that runs under Linux on System z and emulates an IBM 37xx <b>communications</b> <b>controller.</b> CCL runs unmodified IBM Network Control Program (NCP) to allow consolidation of an SNA network infrastructure to IP. According to IBM [...] "SNA traffic enters and leaves CCL as SNA network flows over an OSA adapter. However, your {{wide area network}} infrastructure {{does not need to}} be SNA. You can consolidate your SNA traffic and use tunneling such as data link switching (DLSw) to encapsulate the SNA communication over an IP network." ...|$|E
50|$|IBM 37xx (or 37x5) is {{a family}} of IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA) {{programmable}} <b>communications</b> <b>controllers</b> used mainly in mainframe environments.|$|R
50|$|Some {{models have}} a network {{interface}} processor {{in the form}} of a communication processor module (CPM) and serial <b>communications</b> <b>controllers</b> (SCC) which can be interfaced to Ethernet or HDLC busses.|$|R
50|$|They will {{attach to}} IBM System/360 or IBM System/370 {{mainframe}} computers through IBM 3705 <b>communications</b> <b>controllers,</b> {{and supported by}} 3705 Network Control Program and mainframe software such as CICS and IMS.|$|R
5000|$|Emulation of {{the older}} IBM 2703 <b>Communications</b> <b>Controller</b> and its predecessors. The {{relevant}} software is the Emulation Program or EP.|$|E
50|$|The IBM 3705 <b>Communications</b> <b>Controller</b> is {{a simple}} {{computer}} which attaches to an IBM System/360 or System/370. Its purpose is to connect communication lines to the mainframe channel. It was a first <b>communications</b> <b>controller</b> of the popular IBM 37xx series. It was announced in March 1972. Designed for semiconductor memory which was not ready {{at the time of}} announcement, the 3705-I had to use 1.2 microsecond core storage; the later 3705-II uses 1.0 microsecond SRAM. Monolithic System Technology components, similar to those in S/370, were used.|$|E

50|$|EXCP {{may also}} be used to access {{communications}} devices attached to IBM 2701, 2702 and 2703 <b>communications</b> <b>controllers</b> and IBM 370x or Amdahl 470x front-end processors (and their respective follow-ons) operating in emulator mode (EP) or partitioned emulator mode (PEP).|$|R
5000|$|A more {{automatic}} and general vectorized interrupt system, mode 2, primarily intended for Zilog's line of counter/timers, DMA and <b>communications</b> <b>controllers,</b> {{as well as}} a fixed vector interrupt system, mode 1, for simple systems with minimal hardware (with mode 0 being the 8080-compatible mode).|$|R
50|$|The term 37xx {{refers to}} IBM's family of SNA <b>communications</b> <b>controllers.</b> The 3745 {{supports}} {{up to eight}} high-speed T1 circuits, the 3725 is a large-scale node and front-end processor for a host, and the 3720 is a remote node that functions as a concentrator and router.|$|R
5000|$|IBM {{no longer}} {{manufactures}} 37xx processors. The last models, the 3745/46, were withdrawn from marketing in 2002. [...] Replacement software products are <b>Communications</b> <b>Controller</b> for Linux on System z and Enterprise Extender.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes FEP {{is synonymous}} with a <b>communications</b> <b>controller,</b> {{although}} the latter is not necessarily as flexible. Early communications controllers such as the IBM 270x series were hard wired, but later units were programmable devices.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM Network Control Program, or NCP, was {{software}} that ran on a 37xx <b>communications</b> <b>controller</b> and managed communication with remote devices. NCP provided services {{comparable to the}} Data Link Layer and Network Layer functions in the OSI model of a Wide area network.|$|E
5000|$|Available {{peripherals}} included teletypewriters, {{paper tape}} readers/punches, punched card readers/punches, line printers, magnetic tape drives, magnetic drums, fixed and removable magnetic disk drives, display terminals, <b>communications</b> <b>controllers,</b> Digigraphic display units, timers, etc. These interfaced to the processor using unbuffered interrupt-driven [...] "A/Q" [...] channels or buffered Direct Storage Access channels.|$|R
5000|$|The 3745, {{announced}} in 1988, [...] provides {{up to eight}} T1 circuits. At {{the time of the}} announcement IBM was estimated to have nearly 85% of the over US$825 million market for <b>communications</b> <b>controllers</b> over rivals such as NCR Comten and Amdahl Corporation. The 3745 is no longer marketed, but still supported and used.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} <b>communications</b> <b>controllers</b> {{could also be}} used with the system. The older DATANET-30 and the DATANET 305â€” {{intended}} for smaller systems with up to twelve terminals attached to an IOM. [...] The DATANET 355 processor attached directly to the system controller in a memory module and was capable of supporting up to 200 terminals.|$|R
50|$|IPSANET was {{a packet}} {{switching}} network written by I. P. Sharp Associates (IPSA). Operation began in May 1976. It initially used the IBM 3705 <b>Communications</b> <b>Controller</b> and Computer Automation LSI-2 computers as nodes. An Intel 80286 based-node was added in 1987. It {{was called the}} Beta node.|$|E
50|$|Includes an {{embedded}} GPS receiver, LAN jack, USB port, PS2 port. Two PC Card Type II or {{a single}} Type III are available. Communications interfaces are supported via Elbit's <b>communications</b> <b>controller,</b> supporting up to six networks at 64 kbit/s. Compatible with Windows or Linux operating systems.|$|E
50|$|For long-duration {{missions}} {{there is}} more than one CAPCOM, each assigned to a different shift team. After control of U.S. spaceflights moved to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in the early 1960s, each CAPCOM used the radio call-sign Houston. When non-astronauts are communicating directly with the spacecraft, CAPCOM acts as the <b>communications</b> <b>controller.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Established in 1961 in Silicon Valley, Memorex {{started by}} selling {{computer}} tapes, then added other media such as disk packs. The company then expanded into disk drives and other peripheral equipment for IBM mainframes. During the 1970s {{and into the}} early 1980s Memorex was worldwide {{one of the largest}} independent suppliers of disk drives and <b>communications</b> <b>controllers</b> to users of IBM-compatible mainframes, as well as media for computer uses and consumers.|$|R
50|$|Next Generation (NextGen) Data Communications (Nexcom or DataComm), {{an element}} of the Next Generation Air Transportation System, will {{significantly}} reduce controller-to-pilot <b>communications</b> and <b>controller</b> workload, whilst improving safety.|$|R
50|$|The Modular One was {{comparatively}} expensive. It {{was somewhat}} exotic in that its modular design resulted {{in almost every}} system delivered being somewhat different, which created a high maintenance burden. It never sold widely outside of the UK, {{and even in the}} UK it was surpassed in sales by DEC and Data General {{before the end of the}} 1970s. Over the mid '70s to mid '80s the systems were cost reduced with TTL bitslice technology and 8-bit microprocessor <b>communications</b> <b>controllers,</b> retreating from the radical modular design, but it never gained a significant market share.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM 3720 was a <b>communications</b> <b>controller</b> (front-end processor) made by IBM, {{suitable}} for use with IBM System/390. The 3720, introduced in 1986, was capable of supporting up to 60 communications lines, and was a smaller version of the 3725. [...] Official service support was withdrawn in 1999 in favour of the IBM 3745.|$|E
50|$|NDL (Network Definition Language) was a {{compiler}} on Burroughs large systems computers used {{to create}} a network definition file for a data <b>communications</b> <b>controller</b> (DCC) and object code for a data communications processor (DCP) that interfaced between a message control program (written in DCALGOL) such as (RJE), (MCSII) or (CANDE) and its line adaptors and terminal network.|$|E
50|$|Note: In this configuration, TPNS transmits its {{generated}} {{data traffic}} from its MVS address space, first across a channel-adapter to its TPNS Control Program (TPNCP) {{running in a}} dedicated IBM 37x5 <b>Communications</b> <b>Controller,</b> and then across teleprocessing lines connected back-to-back between the TPNCP and the target IBM 37x5 channel-attached to the host system (server) under test and its subsystems, applications and databases/files.|$|E
50|$|A Center's {{control service}} for an oceanic FIR may be operationally {{distinct}} from its service for a domestic overland FIR over land, employing different <b>communications</b> frequencies, <b>controllers,</b> {{and a different}} ICAO code.|$|R
50|$|Adding {{air-to-ground}} and ground-to-ground {{data communications}} will significantly reduce controller-to-pilot <b>communications</b> and <b>controller</b> workload. The data communications will enable ground automated message generation and receipt, message routing and transmission, and direct communications with aircraft avionics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Communications</b> {{between the}} <b>controller</b> and drives is done through PROFINET, PROFIBUS, or Ethernet.|$|R
