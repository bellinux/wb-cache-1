It was first discovered and developed by ICI and introduced under the brand name Cetavlon. It is used as a 1-3 % solution for cleaning road side accident wounds. Another antiseptic Chlorhexidine was also discovered and first developed by ICI. ICI also introduced Savlon which was a combination of Cetrimide and Chlorhexidine.

50|$|The {{one-step}} Stöber {{process may}} {{be modified to}} manufacture porous silica by adding a surfactant template to the reaction mixture and calcining the resulting particles. Surfactants {{that have been used}} include <b>cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide,</b> cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, and glycerol. The surfactant forms micelles, small near-spherical balls with a hydrophobic interior and a hydrophilic surface, around which the silica network grows, producing particles with surfactant- and solvent-filled channels. Calcining the solid leads to removal of the surfactant and solvent molecules by combustion and/or evaporation, leaving mesopore voids throughout the structure, as seen in the illustration at right.|$|E
5000|$|Surfactants are {{classified}} into four main types, each with different properties and applications: anionic, cationic, nonionic and zwitterionic (or amphoteric). Anionic surfactants are compounds that contain an anionic polar group. Examples of anionic surfactants include {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate. Included in this class of surfactants are sodium alkylcarboxylates (soaps). [...] Cationic surfactats are similar in nature to anionic surfactants, except the surfactant molecules carry a positive charge at the hydrophilic portion. Many of these compounds are quaternary ammonium salts, as well as <b>cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (CTAB). Non-ionic surfactants are non-charged and together with anionic surfactants make {{up the majority of}} oil-dispersant formulations. The hydrophilic portion of the surfactant contains polar functional groups, such as -OH or -NH. Zwitterionic surfactants are the most expensive, and are used for specific applications. These compounds have both positively and negatively charged components. An example of a zwitterionic compound is phosphatidylcholine, which as a lipid is largely insoluble in water.|$|E

Lidocaine was determined at 250 nm using the "zero crossing" technique because the signals of centrimonium bromide and the colour ingredient are zero at this wavelength. <b>Cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> was determined by correction of the peak amplitude at 215 nm according to lidocaine. In choosing the optimal magnitudes for the simultaneous determination of both drugs, the following criteria were considered: (1) the linearity of the calibration graphs as given by the correlation coefficients, (2) the intercept, (3) the sensitivity as given by the regression coefficient, (4) the degree of interference in the derivative measurement {{by the presence of}} the other compound, as given by the relative percent error and by the relative recovery, and (5) the reproducibility, as given by the coefficient of variation, calculated by recording the second-derivative spectra...|$|E

40|$|Microscopic {{understanding}} {{of physical and}} electrochemical processes at electrolyte/ electrode interfaces is critical for applications ranging from batteries, fuel cells to electrocatalysis. However, probing such buried interfacial processes is experimentally challenging. Infrared spectroscopy is sensitive to molecule vibrational signatures, yet to approach the interface three stringent requirements have to be met: interface specificity, sub-monolayer molecular detection sensitivity, and electrochemically stable and infrared transparent electrodes. Here we show that transparent graphene gratings electrode provide an attractive platform for vibrational spectroscopy at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces: infrared diffraction from graphene gratings offers enhanced detection sensitivity and interface specificity. We demonstrate the vibrational spectroscopy of methylene group of adsorbed sub-monolayer <b>cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> molecules and reveal a reversible field-induced electrochemical deposition of <b>cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> on the electrode controlled by the bias voltage. Such vibrational spectroscopy with graphene gratings is promising for real time and in situ monitoring of different chemical species at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces...|$|E

Mixtures were 17 kDa hyaluronate with 1, 46 MDa, 73 kDa with 1, 46 MDa, 300 kDa with 1, 46 MDa, 806 kDa with 1, 46 MDa and 1800 kDa with 1, 46 MDa. These compounds were always mixed in the weight ratios 70 : 30, 50 : 50 and 30 : 70. As the surfactant <b>cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> and TWEEN 20 were used. Interactions were studied in aqueous solution with different ionic strength. Sudan red was used as hydrophobic dye. In all experimental series with <b>cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> was observed phenomenon of discontinuous separated phases, described as pearls. Samples containing pearls were tested on stability, were dried and rehydrated back, as were also heated in solution. Subsequently, the particle size was measured in the remaining sample after pearls were filtrated. Mixtures of hyaluronate were characterized by measuring the viscosity using rheology microrheology.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{microbial}} contamination of disinfectants and antiseptics in major hospitals on the Caribbean island of Trinidad. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, disinfectants and antiseptics were sampled from the pharmacy departments, the pediatric/neonatal wards, and the surgical wards of four hospitals. The samples were cultured for aerobic bacteria on nutrient agar using the surface plating method. The antibiotic sensitivity of bacterial isolates {{was determined by}} the disk diffusion method, using 14 antimicrobial agents. We studied a total of 180 disinfectant/antiseptic samples: 60 of chlorhexidine gluconate (Hibitane), 60 of chlorhexidine gluconate and <b>cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Savlon), and 60 of methylated spirit. RESULTS: Of the 180 samples studied, 11 of them (6. 1 %) were contaminated by aerobic bacteria. All bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas spp. Of the 11 contaminated samples, 6 of them (54. 5 %) occurred at the pharmacy level while 5 (45. 5 %) were from diluted pre-use or in-use samples in the pediatric/neonatal wards or the surgical wards. Chlorhexidine gluconate and <b>cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> accounted for 9 of the 11 contaminated disinfectants/antiseptics (81. 8 %), and chlorhexidine gluconate accounted for the remaining 2 (18. 2 %). Only two of the four hospitals had contaminated disinfectant/antiseptic samples. All 24 isolates of Pseudomonas spp. tested were resistant to {{one or more of the}} 14 antimicrobial agents tested, with the prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, tobramycin, and gentamicin being 58. 3 %, 50. 0 %, 45. 8 %, and 41. 7 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that contaminated disinfectants/antiseptics pose a health risk to patients, particularly in the pediatric and surgical wards. The high prevalence of resistance to antimicrobial agents exhibited by the Pseudomonas spp. that were isolated is of special therapeutic concern...|$|E

A soluble {{polyimide}} (PI), 3, 3 ’ 5, 5 ’-tetramethyl- 4, 4 ’-diamino diphenylbutyltoluene-co-BPDA, was synthesized from 3, 3 ’ 5, 5 ’-tetramethyl- 4, 4 ’-diaminodiphenyl-butyltoluene and BPDA in m-cresol solution. The {{inherent viscosity}} {{of the resulting}} polyimide was 0. 84 dL/g. Polyimide solutions in DMAc, with a concentration ranged from 14 wt % to 34 wt%, were electrospun into well-formed nanofiber membranes. The electrospinning parameters such as solution concentration, feed rate, applied voltage, and collection distance were optimized {{in order to reduce}} fiber diameter and distribution. The effect of LiCl and CTAB (<b>Cetrimonium</b> <b>Bromide)</b> on the elcetrospinning was also investigated. The obtained nanofiber membranes were characterized by SEM, TGA, XRD, and tensile test. With optimized electrospinning parameters the averaged diameter and the distribution of nanofibers could be reduced to 249 nm and 0. 047, respectively.

40|$|Alloying {{is an old}} trick used {{to produce}} new {{materials}} by synergistically combining at least two components. New developments in nanoscience have enabled new degrees of freedom, such as size, solubility and concentration of the alloying element to be utilized {{in the design of}} the physical properties of alloy nanoparticles (ANPs). ANPs as multi-functional materials have applications in catalysis, biomedical technologies and electronics. Phase diagrams of ANPs are very little known and may not represent that of bulk picture, furthermore, ANPs with different crystallite orientation and compositions could remain far from equilibrium. Here, we studied the synthesis and stability of Au-Sn and Ag-Ni ANPs with chemical reduction method at room temperature. Due to the large difference in the redox potentials of Au and Sn, co-reduction is not a reproducible method. However, two step successive reductions was found to be more reliable to generate Au-Sn ANPs which consists of forming clusters in the first step (either without capping agent or with weakly coordinated surfactant molecules) and then undergoing a second reduction step in the presence of another metal salt.

30|$|Chlorin e 6 is a known {{compound}} with photosensitizing properties used in PDT {{of cancer}} [14, 15]; its combination with scintillating lanthanide fluoride NP could be promising for the X-ray-inducible PDT. Nanosystems containing conjugates of La 0.9 Ce 0.1 F 3 to chlorin e 6 were studied in [10], though Tb-doped NPs were not investigated with chlorin e 6 {{because of poor}} spectral overlap [10]. At the same time, EEET from Tb-doped NP to protoporphyrin IX was demonstrated in [16]. Thus, the possible role of Tb 3 + doping agent in EEET pathways taking place in nanosystems containing lanthanide fluoride NP and chlorin e 6 photosensitizer should be studied. X-ray-induced scintillation emission spectra of CeF 3 NP (both undoped and Tb 3 +-doped) were similar to their photoluminescence spectra excited in ultraviolet spectral region [9, 16 – 18]. EEET processes in Tb 3 +-doped cerium fluoride NP are also expected to be similar for the cases of X-rays and ultraviolet light excitation. Therefore, studies of energy transfer between the sensitizer and Tb 3 +-doped CeF 3 NP {{can be carried out}} using UV excitation as a model.

40|$|International audienceA novel nanohybrid {{assembly}} {{consisting of}} gold nanorods (AuNRs) and organic semiconductors (OSCs) to tune optical properties is presented. OSCs {{are bound to}} specific areas of the AUNRs (e. g., end or side) by controlling the surface Chemistry of the AuNRs. AuNRs anisotropically fiinctionalized with <b>cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (CTAB) cysteine, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and/or DNA. Rhodamine B (RhB) 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein (CF), or c-yanine 3 (Cy 3) are incubated with the anisotropically functionalized AuNRs. The resulting optical properties of the dispersed AuNRs are characterized via steady-state UVvis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) Spectroscopies as a function Of OSC concentration. We found that CF and RhB adsorb to the AuNR differently depending on the AuNR surface chemistry, which results in unique optical properties of the assembly. The distinctive spectra were used to dotermine {{the interaction between the}} OSC and the AuNIL Finally, we found that attaching Cy 3 specifically {{to the ends of the}} AuNR via a DNA tether results in a larger emission quenching process than when Cy 3 is not attached.

30|$|Size and {{morphology}} {{control of}} nanocrystals {{is essential to}} tailor the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the resulting material [7, 8]. Liquid phase synthesis is a convenient, low-cost and versatile technique for fabricating well-controlled nanocrystals, since solution chemistry can be tuned to give specific morphology. A fundamental understanding of the driving force and principles that govern morphologies during nucleation and growth is essential to optimize existing synthesis methods and to discover novel methods. Experiments on the dissolution and growth of gold nanorods were carried out with the nanoaquarium in an FEI Quanta 600 FEG Mark II SEM with a transmission detector. The aqueous solution contained gold nanorods [48] with a trace amounts of the surfactant <b>cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (CTAB) and HAuCl 4 at pH ~ 7. The devices were filled under atmospheric conditions and the solution was not deaerated. Production of radiolytic species by the electron beam, as described in Schneider et al. [20], causes the Au nanorods to either grow or dissolve. During dissolution, we hypothesize that the radicals produced during water irradiation react with the CTAB, whose role is to stabilize the nanorods; in the absence of CTAB, nanorods are known to be unstable and dissolve [49, 50]. Analysis of morphology and growth dynamics at specific facets provides information about the atomic level processes that control shape [51].|$|E
40|$|The chicken {{feathers}} (CFs)  consist {{of up to}} 10 % {{of total}} chicken dry mass and they have many potential industrial applications. CFs contains protein fibers named as keratin, which is an insoluble protein. Primary sanitization phases are complex {{because of the presence}} of lots of blood born microbes, pathogens and parasites in raw biomass. The extraction process of keratins from the unprocessed feathers is also a challenging task. Prior to the extraction cleaning/sanitization of feathers is a very necessary step. Thus, the present work was conducted to optimize  an efficient surfactant  for the cleaning process of the  CFs by using ionic and non-ionic surfactants. The experiment was conducted by the washing of feathers with double distilled water (ddH 2 O), detergents, ether and lastly with boiling water. The washed feathers treated with surfactants and the effect of each surfactant was analyzed by a microbiological test which tells about the extent of  the presence of different bacteria on the treated feathers. SEM, EDX, FTIR were used to study the morphology and composition of  untreated and treated CFs. SEM showed there was no detectable fiber damage after treatment. <b>Cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (CTAB) (t 3) was one of the best surfactant for the treatment of CFs among all the surfactant used.

40|$|Research on insect {{microbiota}} {{has greatly}} expanded {{over the past}} decade, along with a growing appreciation of the microbial contributions to insect ecology and evolution. Many of these studies use DNA sequencing to characterize the diversity and composition of insect-associated microbial communities. The choice of strategies used for specimen collection, storage, and handling could introduce biases in molecular assessments of insect microbiota, but such potential influences have not been systematically evaluated. Likewise, although it is common practice to surface sterilize insects prior to DNA extraction, {{it is not known}} if this time-consuming step has any effect on microbial community analyses. To resolve these methodological unknowns, we conducted an experiment wherein replicate individual insects of four species were stored intact for two months using five different methods—freezing, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), <b>cetrimonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (CTAB), and room-temperature storage without preservative—and then subjected to whole-specimen 16 S rRNA gene sequencing to assess whether the structure of the insect-associated bacterial communities was impacted by these different storage strategies. Overall, different insect species harbored markedly distinct bacterial communities, a pattern that was highly robust to the method used to store samples. Storage method had little to no effect on assessments of microbiota composition, and the magnitude of the effect differed among the insect species examined. No single method emerged as “best,” i. e., one consistently having the highest similarity in community structure to control specimens, which were not stored prior to homogenization and DNA sequencing. We also found that surface sterilization did not change bacterial community structure as compared to unsterilized insects, presumably due to the vastly greater microbial biomass inside the insect body relative to its surface. We therefore recommend that researchers can use any of the methods tested here, and base their choice according to practical considerations such as prior use, cost, and availability in the field, although we still advise that all samples within a study be handled in an identical manner when possible. We also suggest that, in large-scale molecular studies of hundreds of insect specimens, surface sterilization may not be worth the time and effort involved. This information should help researchers design sampling strategies and will facilitate cross-comparisons and meta-analyses of microbial community data obtained from insect specimens preserved in different ways...|$|E

Different molar ratios of Sn and Au precursors were used to study the effect of alloying elements on the melting point and the crystalline structures and melting points were determined by various microscopy and spectroscopy techniques and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A significant depression (up to 150 °C) in the melting transition was observed for the Au-Sn ANPs compared to the bulk eutectic point (T m 280 °C) due to the size and shape effect. Au-Sn ANPs offer a unique set of advantages as lead-free solder material which can reflow at lower temperatures leading to lower thermal stresses in adjacent electronic components during the manufacturing process, offering better thermal and mechanical properties suitable for high temperature electronic applications. The second system studied here is Ag-Ni ANPs and electron microscopy and spectroscopy confirm the formation of Ag 0. 5 Ni 0. 5 ANPs with cubic structure, stable up to 125 °C. Atomic size and crystalline structure have less effect on the alloy formation process at the nanoscale; therefore, metals with limited solubility in bulk could form solid solutions at the nanoscale. Ag and Ni are immiscible in both solid and liquid states due to the large lattice mismatch and thermodynamically, the formation of core-shell structures is favoured. The effect of capping agents on the alloying was also studied here. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with shorter length shows Ag-Ni ANPs with higher content of Ni compared to sodium citrate; the systems lead to the formation of Ag, Ag 2 O 2 and Ag 0. 5 Ni 0. 5 ANPs. The study of multi-component nanoparticle systems could shed light into the various parameters that affect stability of structure and phases, which could be quite distinct from their bulk counterparts...|$|E
