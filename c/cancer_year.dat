40|$|Background: The {{difference}} in outcomes in patients is unclear when 2 types of enteral nutrition, ie, tube feeding and conven-tional oral diets with intravenous dextrose (standard care), are compared with parenteral nutrition. Objective: We reviewed systematically and aggregated statisti-cally {{the results of}} prospective randomized clinical trials (PRCTs) to examine the relations among the nutrition interven-tions, complications, and mortality rates. Design: We conducted a MEDLINE search for PRCTs comparing the effects of enteral and parenteral nutrition in adults. Two dif-ferent people abstracted data for the method and outcomes sepa-rately. We used fixed-effects meta-analysis technique to combine the relative risks (RRs) of the outcomes of infection, nutrition support complications, other complications, and mortality. Results: Twenty-seven studies in 1828 patients met the study cri-teria. Aggregated results showed a significantly lower RR of infec-tion with tube feeding (0. 64; 95 % CI: 0. 54, 0. 76) and standard care (0. 77; 95 % CI: 0. 65, 0. 91). A priori hypotheses showed a lower RR of infection with tube feeding than with parenteral nutri-tion, regardless of nutritional status, presence of <b>cancer,</b> <b>year</b> of study publication, or quality of the study method. In studies in which participants had high rates of protein-energy malnutrition, there was a significantly higher risk of mortality (3. 0; 95 % CI: 10. 9, 8. 56) and a trend toward {{a higher risk of}} infection with stan-dard care than with parenteral nutrition (1. 17; 95 % CI: 0. 88, 1. 56). Conclusions: Tube feeding and standard care are associated with a lower risk of infection than is parenteral nutrition; however, mortality is higher and the risk of infection tends to be higher with standard care than with parenteral nutrition in malnourishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{evolving}} HIV epidemic on cancer has been sparsely documented in Africa. We report results on the risk of cancer associated with HIV- 1 infection using data from an ongoing study. A case-control {{analysis was used to}} estimate the relative risk (odds ratio, OR) of cancer types known to be AIDS defining: Kaposi's sarcoma (n = 333), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, n = 223) and cancers of the cervix (n = 1, 586), and 11 cancer types possibly associated with HIV infection: Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 154), cancers of other anogenital organs (n = 157), squamous cell cancer of the skin (SCC, n = 70), oral cavity and pharynx (n = 319), liver (n = 83), stomach (n = 142), leukemia (n = 323), melanoma (n = 53), sarcomas other than Kaposi's (n = 93), myeloma (n = 189) and lung cancer (n = 363). The comparison group comprised 3, 717 subjects with all other cancer types and 682 subjects with vascular disease. ORs were adjusted for age, sex (except cervical <b>cancer),</b> <b>year</b> of diagnosis, education and number of sexual partners. Significantly increased risks associated with HIV- 1 infection were found for HIV/AIDS associated Kaposi's sarcoma (OR = 47. 1, 95 % CI = 31. 9 - 69. 8), NHL (OR = 5. 9, 95 % CI = 4. 3 - 8. 1) and cancer of the cervix (OR = 1. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 3 - 2. 0); Hodgkin's disease (OR = 1. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 0 - 2. 7), cancers of anogenital organs other than the cervix (OR = 2. 2; 95 % CI = 1. 4 - 3. 3) and SCC (OR = 2. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 4 - 4. 9) were also significantly increased. No significant associations were found between HIV and any of the other cancers examined. Risks for HIV-related cancers are consistent with previous studies in Africa, and are lower when compared to those observed in developed countries...|$|E
