5000|$|Selective {{targeting}} (or targeted killing) {{of terrorist}} leaders {{is considered by}} the IDF as a legitimate mode of operation {{and part of a}} state's counterterrorism, anticipatory, self-defense activities that are designed to prevent the continuation of terrorism. Selective targeting of terrorist activists is used as a measure designed to hurt the real enemy while minimizing civilian casualties. The practice was challenged before the Israeli Supreme Court, which held that while terrorists were civilians under the law of armed conflict, they were not protected by the prohibition in Article 51(3) of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, which provides that <b>civilians</b> enjoy <b>immunity</b> from deliberate attack [...] "unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities". The Court found that the meaning of both [...] "for such time" [...] and [...] "direct part in hostilities" [...] covered those providing services to unlawful combatants in any period before a potential attack; therefore terrorists did not qualify for this immunity, a ruling that has been accepted into international law.|$|R
40|$|Notion {{of direct}} {{participation}} in hostilities {{has been a}} complex and contentious phenomenon {{within the realm of}} armed conflict, especially where the armed conflict involves non state armed actors. The notion covers a situation where a person carries out specific acts which by their nature or purpose form part of the conduct of hostilities between parties to an armed conflict. In this circumstance, a person loses his immunity and becomes a legitimate target since he ceases to be harmless. Though it is usual that civilians and <b>civilian</b> objects enjoy <b>immunity</b> against direct attack, but where either of the belligerents is an armed group, there is problem of how to deal with members of such armed groups. This problem emanates from the fact that membership of the armed group is drawn from the civilian population while during armed conflict, the general population is made up of civilians and members of such group, and it creates a problem of identity. Likewise, the problem may also be attributed to lack of legal framework defining the status of members of armed groups and the notion of direct participation in hostilities. Therefore, the article analyses the notion of direct participation with a view to determining when civilian or a member of an armed group loses immunity against attack...|$|R

40|$|The norm of <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity,</b> {{which holds}} that civilians must not be {{intentionally}} targeted in war or subjected to mass killing, is widely supported and considered a jus cogens principle of international law. Yet not only does mass killing remain a recurrent feature of world politics, but perpetrators sometimes avoid criticism or punishment. This article argues that the paradox {{can be explained by}} understanding that <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> confronts a protracted struggle with competing ideologies, some of which have proven resilient, and that decisions about how to interpret the norm in specific cases are subject to intervening contextual variables.

40|$|Most {{cultural}} and legal codes {{agree that the}} intentional killing of civilians, whether in peacetime or war, is prohibited. This is the norm of <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity,</b> widely {{considered to be a}} fundamental moral and legal principle. Yet despite this fact, the deliberate killing of large numbers of civilians remains a persistent feature of global political life. What is more, the perpetrators have often avoided criticism and punishment. Examining dozens of episodes of mass killing perpetrated by states since the French Revolution late eighteenth century, this book attempts to explain this paradox. It studies the role that <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> has played in shaping the behaviour of perpetrators and how international society has responded to mass killing. The book argues that although the world has made impressive progress in legislating against the intentional killing of civilians and in constructing institutions to give meaning to that prohibition, the norm's history in practice suggests that the ascendancy of <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> is both more recent and more fragile than might otherwise be thought. In practice, decisions to violate a norm are shaped by factors relating to the norm and the situation at hand, so too is the manner in which international society and individual states respond to norm violations. Responses to norm violations are not simply matters of normative obligation or calculations of self-interest but are instead guided by a combination of these logics as well as perceptions about the situation at hand, existing relations with the actors involved, and power relations between actors holding different accounts of the situation. Thus, whilst <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> has for the time being prevailed over 'anti-civilian ideologies' which seek to justify mass killing, it remains challenged by these ideologies and its implementation shaped by individual circumstances. As a result, whilst it has become much more difficult for states to get away with mass murder, it is still not entirely impossible for them to do so.

40|$|Why do belligerents {{intentionally}} kill legally protected civilians during armed conflict? Such acts {{not only}} violate the human security of people {{protected by the}} <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> norm but may also be war crimes. The violation of this pillar of international humanitarian law (IHL), the body of law tasked with regulating armed conflict, {{has been the subject}} of significant research and policy deliberation. Many of the useful analyses produced by these efforts operate from common assumptions. One is that a monolithic understanding of the distinction principle, the obligation for belligerents to distinguish between permissible and impermissible targets and a core component of the <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> norm, exists among those who monitor and disseminate IHL. Another assumption among scholars and practitioners concerned with deliberate civilian targeting is that a shared understanding of who is protected during armed conflict exists between those who monitor IHL and those who must abide by it. Through the analysis of interviews conducted with IHL experts and belligerents who fought in a variety of conflicts on the African continent, this study reveals that neither of these assumptions is warranted. It finds that not only is there a lack of consensus among belligerents as to whom they can permissibly target during armed conflict, but that there is still debate among IHL experts as to whom the law protects. Furthermore, this study finds that shared understandings of who is protected during armed conflict do not exist between experts and belligerents, so that belligerents claiming to abide by their particular interpretation of the distinction principle ostensibly target civilians deemed protected by IHL experts. Thus this study offers new avenues for understanding violations of the <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> norm and possibly reducing their occurrence...|$|E
40|$|What determines {{variation}} in military behavior toward civilians? In this dissertation, I examine {{the determinants of}} military behavior toward civilians, exploring the factors that lead armed groups to brutalize—or respect—civilian populations. I argue that military cultures embodying norms of <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> can shape combatant preferences and, ultimately, military conduct, leading to battlefield restraint toward civilians. Focusing on case studies of the U. S. Army in Vietnam and Iraq and the Ugandan military, I {{examine the effect of}} military culture on conflict behavior utilizing detailed qualitative and quantitative data at macro- and micro-levels of analysis, including historical case studies, combatant survey data, field interviews, and a quantitative analysis of U. S. Army war crimes prosecution data. I find that military culture can fundamentally transform the preferences of combatants {{at all levels of the}} military organization, increasing combatants’ preferences for respect for civilians and producing restraint toward civilians in conflict. The findings of this research thus show that military cultures based in norms of <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> can lead to the protection of civilians in war, even in the face of significant countervailing pressures that would otherwise produce mass civilian victimization.

40|$|Despite {{a growing}} {{research}} agenda centered {{on issues of}} <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity,</b> it remains unclear what effect norms protecting civilians have on state behavior, especially democracies. This study asks when and how the <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> norm (CIN) matters, specifically examining how it alters short term strategic choices and even long term doctrines. Employing a constructivist approach to examine shifting attitudes toward civilians within the military during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, this study argues that democracies will choose strategic outcomes that strengthen compliance with the CIN {{when they see the}} constraining normative environment as {{a key part of the}} strategic environment. Legitimacy is argued to be the causal mechanism driving interests and identities to align more closely with the human rights-based aspects of the international order. My argument, based on a social conception of power, hinges on the observation that state interests change over time and that this is evident as sovereignty-based attitudes toward civilian casualties move toward a more constraining, human rights-based outlook. I identify three conditions under which this occurs: when the normative/discursive framework of protecting civilians is seen as essential to delegitimizing the enemy; when the legitimacy of the initial invasion is in question, and civilian casualties are seen as damaging to the international image by increasing that gap; finally, when regaining a monopoly on force is seen as impossible to achieve through material force alone because civilian casualties increase support for the insurgency. Together, these provide the conditions under which aligning strategy and doctrine with human rights-centered norms eventually come to be seen as the only viable strategy in fighting wars among the people...|$|E
40|$|The phrase "direct {{participation}} in hostilities" {{has a very}} specific meaning in international humanitarian law (IHL). Those individuals who are clothed with combatant status are authorised to participate directly in hostilities without fear of prosecution, while civilians lose their <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> against direct targeting whilst they participate directly in hostilities. Any civilian activity which amounts to "direct {{participation in}} hostilities" temporarily suspends their presumptive civilian protection and exposes them to both direct targeting as a legitimate military target and prosecution for their unauthorised participation in hostilities. Since existing treaty sources of IHL do not provide a definition of what activities amount to "direct participation in hostilities", the ICRC in 2009 released an Interpretive Guide on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities - {{in the hope of}} providing a neutral, impartial and balanced interpretation of the longstanding IHL principle of direct participation in hostilities. While not without criticism, the Interpretive Guide aims to respect the customary IHL distinction between "direct participation in hostilities" and mere involvement in the general war effort. The Guide proposes a three-pronged test which establishes a threshold of harm, and requires direct causation together with a belligerent nexus. Collectively, these criteria limit overly-broad targeting policies, while distinguishing occasions of legitimate military targeting from common, criminal activities. Together with these three criteria, the Guide introduces the notion of the revolving door of protection, together with the concept of a "continuous combat function". Both these new concepts {{have been the subject of}} criticism, as too the idea that a presumption of non-participation status should apply in cases of doubt. Nevertheless "nothing indicates that the ICRC's interpretive guidance is substantively inaccurate, unbalanced, or otherwise inappropriate, or that its recommendations cannot be realistically translated into operational practice" in a way which will ensure that the fundamental principles of distinction and <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> upon which all of IHL is built are observed...|$|E
40|$|This article investigates how {{issues of}} {{political}} responsibility {{connect to the}} combatant/civilian distinction in armed conflict. It does so by looking at an attempted moral justification of terrorism in a democracy by a just war theorist. The attempt was by Igor Primoratz, who claims that civilians who actively support injustice do not merit immunity from targeting. Primoratz suggests amending the principle of <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> to permit targeting of civilians who are culpable for an unjust war. This article argues that culpability plays {{no role in the}} justification of targeting combatants and cannot be used to justify the targeting of civilians. Combatants may be targeted in war because of a convention-dependent permission that they may be treated as instruments. Civilians may not be targeted in war because no such convention-dependent permission exists (and there are no benefits to creating such a convention). Nor can the justification of self-defence be used to justify the targeting of civilians in armed conflict because there is a threshold of culpability to be met before self-defence is permitted, and the citizens of a democracy do not meet that minimum standard...|$|E
40|$|Moral {{philosophers}} {{and the international}} political community alike have traditionally valued the lives of civilians over those of soldiers. The first part of jus in bello, the doctrine which aims to characterise the just conduct of war, states that 'civilians, as non-combatants, must not be attacked or killed', whereas the only requirement concerning the killing of soldiers is that any attack must meet the requirement of proportionality: it must not cause so much harm that the good it does is overridden. Similarly, Article 51 of the Geneva Protocols states that 'the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations', and that 'the civilian population as such, {{as well as individual}} civilians, shall not be the object of attack'. The requirement of proportionality is mentioned only with reference to the protection of civilian life or cultural objects, except in the general statement that 'it is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering. ' The specific protections offered to combatants are limited to wounded, sick or shipwrecked combatants, and prisoners of war - those combatants who most closely resemble civilians. The Protocols do state that all attacks must be limited to 'military objectives', but the definition of these objectives is permissive, to say the least: 'Military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. ' To kill enemy soldiers in large numbers surely offers a definite military advantage. This thesis examines the moral basis for the distinction that these laws and doctrines draw between soldiers and civilians. I explain why the distinction between combatant and non-combatant casualties is not, in a significant proportion of cases, a morally sound one. I argue that any moral justification of the principle of non-combatant immunity must be of a utilitarian nature, pointing to its ability to limit the overall carnage of warfare. The implications for jus in bello of recognising that the principle can be justified only on these grounds are wide-ranging and important. If we want to retain <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity,</b> we must accept a utilitarian simulacrum of that doctrine. I argue that applying utilitarian standards to the just conduct of war will lead us to prefer very different sorts of policies from those currently embodied by jus in bello. Thus what we think about <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> may have consequences for what we think about the moral foundation of our doctrine of just war...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} normative framework {{relative to}} the regulation of means and methods of force is becoming more ?population-centric? in that both states and institutions of international civil society are ascribing greater weight to humanitarian considerations and individual rights. The material conditions {{as well as the}} strategic objectives of contemporary conflicts are two of the major driving forces behind this humanizing transformation. Contemporary jurisprudence, military doctrine and scholarly discourse recognize that the notion of a clear binary distinction between war and peace is untenable. In its place there is a growing appreciation of both the legal and the factual complexity of conflicts which can be described as full-spectrum, mixed or hybrid in character. Namely, in any given conflict there {{is likely to be a}} range of combat, law enforcement and humanitarian activities taking place simultaneously within a single operational theatre that can be characterized as urban, civilianized and transnational. The character of hostilities in these circumstances may frequently be described as unconventional, irregular and asymmetric and civilians are at extreme risk from the immediate and long term consequences of the use of force. Better objective criteria for conflict classification are needed to guide the application of the most appropriate and efficacious legal frameworks and for assessing the parameters of <b>civilian</b> <b>immunity</b> from attack. Connected to this, there needs to be progressive and principled interpretation and coordination of existing legal frameworks {{relative to the}} use of force, i. e. targeting and weaponry law. There are compelling theoretical, legal and strategic arguments for progressive reinterpretation of existing standards...|$|E
