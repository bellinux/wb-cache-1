A row of gingko trees lines the side of the site west of the [...] "Wall of Gratitude", as well as both sides of the wide sidewalk on the Washington Avenue side of the site. Planting beds approximately [...] deep exist behind each glass wall. Ground cover consists of mondo grass and lily turf. Shrubs used at the site include <b>Carolina</b> <b>allspice</b> (Calycanthus floridus), dwarf sweet pepperbush, Harry's garnet sweetspire, [...] "Gulftide" [...] holly osmanthus, and Burkwood viburnum.

5000|$|The mosaic, in {{the style}} of Portuguese pavement, {{is at the heart of}} a series of open and secret glades of lawn and glacier-carved rock outcroppings, bounded by shrubs and mature trees and {{woodland}} slopes, all designated a [...] "quiet zone". A woodland walk winds through edge plantings between the glade-like upper lawn and the steep wooded slopes; it contains native rhododendrons and hollies, <b>Carolina</b> <b>allspice</b> (Calycanthus floridus), mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), viburnums, and jetbead. Wild shrub roses and a mature pink Magnolia Ã— soulangeana flank the main walk. At the farthest northern tip of the upper series of lawns enclosed by woodland are three dawn redwood trees, which lose their needles but regain them every spring, an emblem of eternal renewal. The trees can be expected to reach a height of 36 m within 100 years, and eventually they will be visible from great distances in the park.|$|E
