40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a neuronal <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> based on asynchronous biphasic pulse coding. This system demonstrates {{the first step}} of developing a complete solution with fully integrated circuit architecture with applications to brain-machine interfaces. A parallel recording experiment comparing a <b>commercial</b> <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> (Tucker-Davis Technology (TDT)) and UF’s custom <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> is set up to compare performance. The novel aspect of the UF system is that its output is represented by an asynchronous pulse train, which provides a low-power, low-bandwidth, noise-resistant means for coding and transmission. Taking advantage of neural firing features, the pulse-based approach uses 3 K pulses/second to record from a hardware neural simulator. I...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1980s, most {{recording}} studios used analog multitrack recorders, typically {{based on}} reel-to-reel tape. The first <b>commercial</b> <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> was the Sample-to-Disk 16-bit, 50 kHz digital recording {{option for the}} New England Digital Synclavier II in 1982. The high cost and limited capacity of these solutions limited their use to large professional audio recording studios, and even then, they were usually reserved for specific applications such as film post-production. Stereo audio was not immediately available due to data input and output limitations on hard drives of that time.|$|R

3000|$|We {{will use}} {{simulated}} and real ECG data {{in order to}} test the performance of the algorithms under controlled (synthetic ECG) and real situations (real ECG). The simulated signals come from [11] (see Section 4.1 in [11] for details about the procedure to generate them); the most interesting property of these signals is that the different components correspond to the same patient and session (preserving the electrode position), being only necessary the interpolation during the QRST intervals for the atrial component. The data were provided by the authors and consist of ten recordings, four marked as [...] "atrial flutter" [...] (AFL) and six marked as [...] "atrial fibrillation" [...] (AF). The real recording database contains forty-eight registers (ten AFL and thirty eight AF) belonging to a clinical database recorded at the Clinical University Hospital, Valencia, Spain. The ECG recordings were taken with a <b>commercial</b> <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> with 12 leads (Prucka Engineering Cardiolab system). The signals were digitized at 1, 000 samples per second with 16 bits resolution.|$|R

5000|$|Magnetophon {{recorders}} {{were widely}} used in German radio broadcasts during World War II, although they were a closely guarded secret at the time. The Allies {{were aware of the}} existence of the pre-war Magnetophon recorders, but not of the introduction of high-frequency bias and PVC-backed tape.) [...] their intelligence experts knew that the Germans had some new form of <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> but they did not know the full details of its construction and operation until working models of the Magnetophon were discovered during the Allied invasion of Germany during 1944-45. American audio engineer Jack Mullin acquired two Magnetophon recorders and fifty reels of magnetic tape from a German radio station at Bad Nauheim near Frankfurt in 1945. The allied forces were traveling through Germany during WWII when they first discovered the device. The Allies then handed the Magnetophon over to Mullin. Over the next two years Mullin modified and developed these machines, hoping to create a <b>commercial</b> <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> that could be used by movie studios. American popular vocalist Bing Crosby, dissatisfied with the quality of existing radio network recordings was prevailed upon to invest in this development and would use the technology, as modified by Mullin and the fledgling Ampex company, to record his radio broadcasts in the more relaxed atmosphere of the recording studio, which was a significant break from the then-norm of live studio audience broadcasts. In 2008 at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards Ceremony, Ampex received the company's first Grammy Award for Technical Achievement, to honor their contribution sixty years earlier of the Ampex 200, which [...] "revolutionized the radio and recording industries". Ampex 200 co-designer Myron Stolaroff was among the folks representing Ampex who accepted the award.|$|R
40|$|Catch bulletins provide {{records of}} fishery {{landings}} and their {{value to the}} fishermen during one or more years. This bulletin covering 1957 and 1958 is the 18 th of a series reporting the commercial fish catch of California. Prior records have been published regularly in this form beginning with the 1926 and 1927 landings. The statistical system and methods were fully described in Fish Bulletin 86, catch bulletin for 1950. California's <b>commercial</b> fishery <b>records</b> <b>system</b> contains enumeration of the catch based on receipts completed by the dealer {{at the time he}} receives fish.

40|$|With the {{continued}} miniaturisation of portable embedded <b>systems,</b> wireless EEG <b>recording</b> techniques {{are becoming increasingly}} prevalent in animal behavioural research. However, {{in spite of their}} versatility and portability, they have seldom been used inside water-maze tasks designed for rats. As such, a novel 3 D printed implant and waterproof connector is presented, which can facilitate wireless water-maze EEG recordings in freely-moving rats, using a <b>commercial</b> wireless <b>recording</b> <b>system</b> (W 32; Multichannel Systems). As well as waterproofing the wireless system, battery, and electrode connector, the implant serves to reduce movement-related artefacts by redistributing movement-related forces away from the electrode connector. This implant/connector was able to successfully record high-quality LFP in the hippocampo-striatal brain regions of rats as they undertook a procedural-learning variant of the double-H water-maze task. Notably, there were no significant performance deficits through its use when compared with a control group across a number of metrics including number of errors and speed of task completion. Taken together, this method can expand the range of measurements that are currently possible in this diverse area of behavioural neuroscience, whilst paving the way for integration with more complex behaviours...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{data acquisition}} systems used for seismic exploration are usually expensive equipment. In this work, a low cost {{data acquisition system}} (Geophonino) has been developed for recording seismic signals from a vertical geophone. The signal goes first through an instrumentation amplifier, INA 155, which is suitable for low amplitude signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the MAX 7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the registered signals with the ones obtained through different <b>commercial</b> data <b>recording</b> <b>systems</b> and different kind of geophones. The obtained results show good correlation between the tested measurements, presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data recording.

40|$|A team of physicians, pharmacists, and {{informatics}} professionals {{developed a}} CDSS {{added to a}} <b>commercial</b> electronic medical <b>record</b> <b>system</b> to provide prescribers with patient-specific maximum dosing recommendations based on renal function. We tracked the time spent by team members and used US national averages of relevant hourly wages to estimate costs. The team required 924. 5 hours and $ 48, 668. 57 in estimated costs to develop 94 alerts for 62 drugs. The most time intensive phase {{of the project was}} preparing the contents of the CDSS (482. 25 hours, $ 27, 455. 61). Physicians were the team members with the highest time commitment (414. 25 hours, $ 25, 902. 04). Estimates under alternative scenarios found lower total cost estimates with the existence of a valid renal dosing database ($ 34, 200. 71) or an existing decision support add-on for renal dosing ($ 23, 694. 51).

5000|$|<b>Commercial</b> Electronic Health <b>Record</b> <b>Systems</b> (EHRs) use row-modeling {{for classes}} of data such as diagnoses, {{surgical}} procedures performed on and laboratory test results, which are segregated into separate tables. In each table, the [...] "entity" [...] {{is a composite}} of the patient ID and the date/time the diagnosis was made (or the surgery or lab test performed); the attribute is a foreign key into a specially designated lookup table that contains a controlled vocabulary - e.g., ICD-10 for diagnoses, Current Procedural Terminology for surgical procedures, {{with a set of}} value attributes. (E.g., for laboratory-test results, one may record the value measured, whether it is in the normal, low or high range, the ID of the person responsible for performing the test, the date/time the test was performed, and so on. As stated earlier, this is not a full-fledged EAV approach because the domain of attributes for a given table is restricted, just as the domain of product IDs in a supermarket's Sales table would be restricted to the domain of Products in a Products table.|$|R
40|$|Catch Bulletins provide <b>records</b> of California's <b>commercial</b> fishery {{landings}} {{and their}} value to fishermen. This report for 1959 is the 19 th in the series. Prior records {{have been published}} regularly beginning with those for 1926 and 1927. Bulletin titles have varied slightly through the years, reflecting the increasing importance of marine species as fresh water catches dropped to insignificance. The first 15 bulletins, for the years 1926 through 1952, were entitled, "The Commercial Fish Catch of California" but since 1953 they have been entitled, "The Marine Fish Catch of California. " In recent years, a need has arisen for faster publication of catch statistics. Consequently, figures will henceforth be published annually instead of biennially. The statistical system and methods used to collect the records were fully described in Fish Bulletin 86, which reported the catch for 1950. In the intervening 10 years, methods and equipment have been modified to accelerate production but the basic principles have remained unchanged. California's <b>commercial</b> fishery <b>records</b> <b>system</b> is based on complete enumeration of the catch. Each fish dealer makes a quadruplicate record of every catch he receives from fishermen and {{one of these is}} promptly sent to the Department of Fish and Game. This insures greater accuracy than any known sampling plan. Within the department, many individuals expend considerable effort to insure completeness of basic records. Published figures are of national and international concern and are used by fisheries scientists, legislators, chambers of commerce, members of the fishing industry, educators and others...|$|R
