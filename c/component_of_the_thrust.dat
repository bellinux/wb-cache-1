The tests were performed at a Reynolds number of 0. 3 x 10 (6) based on body diameter and maximum tunnel velocity. It was found that a side force and moment were induced upon the afterbody, the magnitude of which increased with jet deflection and jet thrust. The direction of the induced side force was in a direction opposite to the normal <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> vector.

40|$|A {{description}} and {{an analysis of}} the three methods used to measure the thrust of the SERT n (Space Electric Rocket Test) ion thrusters in flight are given. The first is the use of the MESA (miniature electrostatic accelerometer) to measure the 2 jug’s result-ing from the radial <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust.</b> The second is the use of telemetered beam electrical parameters to calculate thrust. The third is the measurement of orbit change resulting from the thrust. The three methods are shown to yield values of thrust which agree with each other within the error bands of the methods. It is concluded that the thrust was measured to within – 1 percent by the MESA, to within – 2. 2 percent by beam electrical parameters, and to within about – 5 percent by orbit changing. 17.

The electromagnetic <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> is found to follow the familiar quadratic dependence on arc current, while a more complex empirical relation is needed to correlate the gasdynamic contribution with the current and mass flow rate. Using available time-of-flight velocity profiles at a current of 16 kA and a mass flow of 5. 9 g/sec, calculated flux profiles of mass and kinetic energy exhibit a tendency for some fraction of the inlet mass flow to leak out at a low velocity around the central high velocity core...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of {{the present}} work is to present the analysis, through a {{numerical}} approach, of the behaviour in operative conditions of a <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> vector control of a solid rocket motor. This component, a laminated flexible joint, is a fundamental part of the thrust vector control system of such a kind of motors. It is devoted to interface the nozzle with the booster case introducing the flexibility necessary to allow the nozzle to follow the movements imposed by actuators {{in order to obtain}} a deflection of the jet flow. The scope of this component, constituted as a sequence of reinforcement and rubber layers, is to work as much as possible as a spherical joint with centre (pivot point) along the axis of the motor. Most of the difficulties encountered during the study are related to the convergence of the solution, due to the strongly nonlinear behaviour of rubber under pressure and actuation loads. A precise characterization of the constitutive laws of the rubber material under high compression stress state become fundamental when it is modelled as a quasi-incompressible media. 1...|$|E
40|$|In the past, {{research}} into Short Takeoff and Landing aircraft {{has led to}} the investigation of the coupling of a Circulation Control Wing and Upper Surface Blowing engine. The Circulation Control Wing entrains the flow of the engine to be deflected downward such that a <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> is now in the vertical direction. The unfortunate consequence of the Upper Surface Blowing engine is the poor cruise performance due to scrub drag. Cal Poly 2 ̆ 7 s {{research into}} a Cruise Efficient Short Takeoff and Landing Aircraft offers a solution by pylon mounting over the wing engines. Analysis shows that the engine thrust is still deflected downward resulting in very high lift coefficients above 6. 6. In the culmination of this project Cal Poly would like to find a correlation between the location of the engine and the deflection angle of the thrust. The results of this study show some engine deflection for an over the wing engine. The configurations explored were able to provide 3 °- 8. 5 ° of deflection. The deflection falls short of the results by previous static and wind tunnel tests of upper surface blowing engines. The results show that the closer to the wing and further forward the engine is located the more engine deflection will be seen.

40|$|A {{procedure}} is developed for modeling stochastic ocean wave and wind loads as diffusive stochastic differential equations (SDE) {{in a state}} space form to derive <b>the</b> response statistics <b>of</b> offshore structures, specifically wind turbines. Often, severe wind and wave systems are highly nonlinear and thus treatment as linear systems is not applicable, leading to computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulations. Using Stratonovich-form diffusive stochastic differential equations, both linear and nonlinear <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>thrust</b> can be modeled as 2 state SDE. These processes can be superposed with both the linear and nonlinear (inertial and viscous) wave forces, also modeled as a multi-dimensional state space SDE. Furthermore, upon implementing the ESPRIT algorithm to fit <b>the</b> autocorrelation function <b>of</b> any real sea state spectrum, a simple 2 -state space model can be derived to completely describe the wave forces. The resulting compound state-space SDE model forms the input to a multi-dimension state-space Fokker-Planck equation, governing <b>the</b> dynamical response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind turbine structure.

40|$|Geometrically, the single-blade {{centrifugal}} impeller, {{commonly used}} {{today as a}} sewage pump, is not axially symmetric.

40|$|Recent {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Medjerda Zone <b>of</b> northern Tunisia {{has demonstrated}} that <b>the</b> Tunisian Atlas <b>thrust</b> belt extends considerably further south-eastwards than previously recognised, terminating in the North-South axis which forms <b>the</b> mountain front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> system. Therefore, areas hitherto considered to be foreland and autochthonous are now thought to form an allochthonous part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlassie <b>thrust</b> belt. One such area is <b>the</b> Medjerda Zone <b>of</b> northern Tunisia where the traditionally accepted, autochthonous and diapiric structural model has recently been challenged by an allochthonous, thin skinned thrust-tectonics model. Fieldwork undertaken during <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> this studentship in the Fedj el Hadoum and Djebel Goraa areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Medjerda Zone has led to <b>the</b> rejection <b>of</b> both models coupled with <b>the</b> proposal <b>of</b> a revised evolutionary model which recognises the area as forming an allochthonous <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlassie <b>thrust</b> belt. This new model is therefore proposed in which a Triassic template was subject to NW-SE orientated extension which led to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a suite of submarine en-echelon half grabens whose basin-bounding extensional faults faced south-east. Subsequent filling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basins with varying thicknesses of marine Cretaceous-Eocene rocks was followed by <b>the</b> deposition <b>of</b> mostly continental Oligocene-Miocene clastic rocks. The Cretaceous-Eocene succession contains two notable source rocks which were sufficiently buried during the Late Cretaceous in the deeper I parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basin to enable <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> hydrocarbons.

The epizonal Zangla unit overlies the anchizonal Chumik unit. This discontinuous inverse zonation demonstrates a late to post-metamorphic <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first unit over the second. The studied area underwent a complex tectonic history: - The tectonic units were stacked from the NE to the SW, generating recumbent folds, NE dipping <b>thrusts</b> and <b>the</b> regional metamorphism. The compressive movements were active under lower temperature conditions, resulting in late <b>thrusts</b> that disturbed <b>the</b> metamorphic zonation. The discontinuous inverse metamorphic zonation dates from this phase. - A NE vergent backfolding phase occurred at lower temperature conditions. It caused <b>the</b> uplift <b>of</b> more metamorphic levels. - A late extensional phase is revealed by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> NE dipping low angle normal faults, and a major high angle fault, the Sarchu fault. The low angle normal faults locally run along earlier thrusts (composite tectonic contacts). Their throw has been sufficient to reset a normal stratigraphic superposition (young layers overlying old ones), but insufficient to erase the inverse metamorphic relationship. However, <b>the</b> combined action <b>of</b> backfolding and normal faulting can locally lessen, or even cancel, the inverse metamorphic superposition.

This heat release, combined with attainable thrust nozzle characteristics and a modest level of configuration drag, indicated that positive thrust levels could be obtained well into <b>the</b> sub-orbital range <b>of</b> velocities. Development of a stress wave force balance for use in shock tunnels allowed <b>the</b> net <b>thrust</b> generated to be measured for integrated scramjet configurations and, although <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> model size and shock tunnel operating pressure prevented complete combustion <b>of</b> hydrogen, <b>the</b> cruise condition <b>of</b> zero net thrust was achieved at 2. 5 km/s with one configuration, while net thrust was produced with another configuration using an ignition promoter in hydrogen fuel.

The Formation is widely exposed on <b>the</b> western edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hajar Mountains that are a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large and well known Oman-UAE ophiolite. The Formation was deposited as an ophiolite-derived conglomerate with a serpentinite and harzburgite matrix of sand, silt and clay grade constituents. It formed during a heavy, possibly seasonal rainfall that resulted in viscous, slurry-like, rapid mass movement, of diverse grain size that are called debris flows. The Formation is now typically strongly dolomite cemented and therefore stands proud as resistant outcrops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alluvial fans that overlie a sequence of intensively altered ophiolite mantle rocks. There is a very distinctive lithological sequence below the contact, which comprises from the top downwards: silicified and carbonated serpentinite, carbonate-veined serpentinite and carbonate-veined partially serpentinised peridotite that passes downwards into the normal partially serpentinised peridotite. These units are <b>the</b> main source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clasts for the Barzaman Formation. The most common lithology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barzaman Formation is poorly sorted, cobble to boulder conglomerate with clasts largely of harzburgite, serpentinite, silicified serpentinite, gabbro and a minor amount of metamorphic rocks, which are other <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ophiolite <b>thrust</b> stack. They are cemented by dense, hard, weathering-resistant dolomite, which has precipitated from phreatic and locally vadose groundwater. A petrographical study using optical and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the cementation was preferential and it involved, firstly <b>the</b> complete replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serpentinite and harzburgite sand and silt matrix and simultaneously or subsequently it strongly affected clasts. Both, physical erosion of clasts during transportation and exposure to various weathering conditions as well as extensive groundwater-rock interaction during diagenesis contributed to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> highly altered ophiolitic clasts. The mechanical erosion has created fractures and areas of enhanced weaknesses that were subsequently penetrated by groundwater leading to zonal and concentric dolomitization <b>of</b> clasts. <b>The</b> partial dissolution <b>of</b> silicate minerals locally resulted in simultaneous precipitation of clay minerals and/or Fe oxides/hydroxides, leaving a ghost texture as evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> former clasts. Clasts with diverse original composition show distinctively different alteration patterns. The susceptibility to dissolution and subsequent dolomitization of ultramafic and mafic clasts is suggested as follows: harzburgite and serpentinite are the most susceptible followed by gabbro with intermediate susceptibility, and silicified serpentinite as the least prone to alteration. ...|$|R

In <b>the</b> southern sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust,</b> <b>the</b> major element and stable isotope compositions show continuous trends from the Cretaceous limestone in <b>the</b> footwall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> up to <b>the</b> contact with the Verrucano, indicating that the calc-tectonite developed due to progressive deformation from the footwall units. In <b>the</b> northern sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust,</b> <b>the</b> Lochseiten calctectonite has a distinct chemical and stable isotope signature, which suggests that it is largely derived from Infrahelvetic slices, i. e. decapitated fragments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> footwall limestone from <b>the</b> southern sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust,</b> which were tectonically emplaced along <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> further north.

Furthermore, <b>the</b> high oil film pressure induces further elastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> plate, which forms a lubrication pocket with <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> plate, more effectively increasing the oil film pressure between the sliding surfaces. <b>The</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lubrication pocket was confirmed using FEM analysis and lubrication tests on <b>the</b> elastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> plate.

30|$|If <b>the</b> {{thickness}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> sheet is constant, {{the geological}} cross section inferred from the above-mentioned observations is shown as Fig.  11. The slope is inclined at ∼ 25 ^∘ around the terrace, which is approximately equal with <b>the</b> dip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fault. <b>The</b> <b>thrust</b> sheet composed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mare basalts has, therefore, a thickness of ∼ 30  m which is <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terraces. We interpreted that a thin-skinned-type deformation {{has occurred in}} this area. The thin strata made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mare basalts was peeled off from its substrata and crept up along the slope. The mare {{should have had a}} level surface before the faulting. If the mons did not rise after <b>the</b> deposition <b>of</b> Unit D, <b>the</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> sheet can be calculated by the distance between <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> sheet and <b>the</b> horizontal surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mare unit. The vertical displacement is about 200  m, and the displacement along <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> fault is about 1.4  km (Fig.  11).

A simplified {{model of a}} annular thrust slide-bearing with thinner thrust plate submerged in a refrigerant oil VG- 56 was operated under pressure using R- 22 as the pressurizing gas, where the pressure difference was adjusted from 0 to 1. 0 MPa. The friction force and coefficient of friction were measured {{over a wide range}} <b>of</b> orbiting speeds. <b>The</b> wedge angle due to elastic deformation is naturally increased with decreasing thrust plate thickness, resulting in a clear improvement in lubrication characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> slide-bearing. Subsequently, similar lubrication tests were conducted for <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> plate model with a realistic inner form, one as complicated as that in actual scroll compressors, while maintaining <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> plate as in the previous test.
