40|$|High-frequency heavy rail {{operations}} {{are subject to}} performance vari ability, {{partly due to the}} impact of passsenger loads on the system. Specif ically, vehicle dwell times at stations contribute to much of the running time and headway variations, constraining performance and service qual ity. Typically, dwell time is a function of passenger alighting and board ing volumes, and of the on-board <b>crowding</b> <b>level.</b> Based on observations made at stations on the MBTA Red Line, models showing linear effects in passenger boardings and alightings but nonlinear effects in the on-vehicle <b>crowding</b> <b>level</b> explains about 90 % of the observed variation in dwell times.

In this paper the effects of satiation level, temperature and crowding on the dispersal of the house fly predator, Carcinops pumilio (Erichson), was studied under laboratory conditions.

Dispersion was less pronounced at 20 °C than at 30 °C A <b>crowding</b> <b>level</b> of 50 C. pumilio adults per 200 ml container resulted in the least dispersal and did not exceed 2. 5 % per day compared with up to 24 % dispersal at a <b>crowding</b> <b>level</b> of 400 per 200 ml.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a neuro-fuzzy {{system for the}} estimation of the <b>crowding</b> <b>level</b> in a scene. Monitoring {{the number of people}} present in a given indoor environment is a requirement in a variety of surveillance applications. In the present work, crowding has to be estimated from the image processing of visual scenes collected via a TV camera. A suitable preprocessing of the images, along with an ad hoc feature extraction process, is discussed. Estimation of the <b>crowding</b> <b>level</b> in the feature space is described in terms of a fuzzy decision rule, which relies on the membership of input patterns to a set of partially overlapping crowding classes, comprehensive of doubt classifications and outliers. A society of neural networks, either multilayer perceptrons or hyper radial basis functions, is trained to model individual class-membership functions. Integration of the neural nets within the fuzzy decision rule results in an overall neuro-fuzzy classifier. Important topics concerning the generalization ability, the robustness, the adaptivity and the performance evaluation of the system are explored. Experiments with real-world data were accomplished, comparing the present approach with statistical pattern recognition techniques, namely linear discriminant analysis and nearest neighbor. Experimental results validate the neuro-fuzzy approach to a large extent.

40|$|Virus capsid {{assembly}} {{has been}} widely studied as a biophysical system, both for its biological and medical significance and as an important model for complex self-assembly processes. No current technology can monitor assembly in detail and what information we have on assembly kinetics comes exclusively from in vitro studies. There are many differences between the intracellular environment and that of an in vitro assembly assay, however, that {{might be expected to}} alter assembly pathways. Here, we explore one specific feature characteristic of the intracellular environment and known to have large effects on macromolecular assembly processes: molecular crowding. We combine prior particle simulation methods for estimating crowding effects with coarse-grained stochastic models of capsid assembly, using the crowding models to adjust kinetics of capsid simulations to examine possible effects of crowding on assembly pathways. Simulations suggest a striking difference depending on whether or not a system uses nucleation-limited assembly, with crowding tending to promote off-pathway growth in a nonnucleation-limited model but often enhancing assembly efficiency at high <b>crowding</b> <b>levels</b> even while impeding it at lower <b>crowding</b> <b>levels</b> in a nucleation-limited model.

40|$|With an {{increasing}} number of intelligent analytic techniques and increasing networking capabilities, municipal transit authorities can leverage real-time data to estimate transit volume and predict crowding conditions. We introduce a proactive Transit Demand Estimation and Prediction System (TraDEPS) – an approach that has the potential to prevent crowding and improve transit service, by measuring the transit activity (the number of passengers on the individual modes of public transportation and the demand on a route), and estimating crowding levels at a given time. This system utilizes a combination of real-time data streams from multiple sources, a predictive model and data analytics for transit management. The problem of transit crowding is translated into transit activity prediction, as the latter is a straightforward indicator of the former.

40|$|Many {{transit systems}} outside North America are {{characterized}} by networks with extensively overlapping routes and buses frequently operating at, or close to, capacity. This paper addresses the problem of allocating a fleet of buses between routes {{in this type of}} system; a problem that must be solved recurrently by transit planners. A formulation of the problem is developed which recognizes passenger route choice behavior, and seeks to minimize a function of passenger wait time and bus crowding subject to constraints on the number of buses available and the provision of enough capacity on each route to carry all passengers who would select it. An algorithm is developed based on the decomposition of the problem into base allocation and surplus allocation components. The base allocation identifies a feasible solution using an (approx.) minimum number of buses. The surplus allocation is illustrated for the simple objective of minimizing the maximum <b>crowding</b> <b>level</b> on any route. The bus allocation procedure developed in this paper has been applied to part of the Cairo bus system in a completely manual procedure, and is proposed to be the central element of a short-range bus service planning process for that city. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{suggests}} a molecular mechanism {{that explains the}} accumulation of denaturated proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of β-cells. Such states were frequently observed in β-cells experiencing increased demand for insulin production and were shown to lead to secretory dysfunction and diabetes. Here, a self-consistent kinetic model is used to investigate changes in protein translation due to ER overloading. The model {{is based on a}} molecular theory that relates the molecular composition and level of molecular crowding in the ER to the kinetic rates of protein folding/misfolding and transit to the Golgi apparatus (GA). This {{study suggests}} that molecular crowding forces can increase protein misfolding and impair the transport to the GA, thus overwhelming the quality control mechanism in the ER. A continual accumulation of toxic residues in the ER enhances even further the molecular crowding, accelerating protein denaturation. This article shows that molecular crowding affects differently the transit of various proteins through the ER. Apparently, the molecular <b>crowding</b> <b>level</b> that can inhibit the transport of native proinsulin to the GA influences to a lesser extent the transit of proamylin, a much smaller peptide cosynthesized with proinsulin in the ER. Smaller-volume misfolded proinsulin species may also win the passage competition through the ER and move on the secretory track. However, misfolded proinsulin fails the conversion to active insulin. This study can help us to decipher circumstances leading to the alteration of the secretory function in susceptible β-cells and the onset of diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Crowded {{trains are}} {{a feature of}} many railway networks, and {{adversely}} affect both train passengers and rail operators. For passengers, the lack of space or inability to get a seat {{can lead to a}} lack of physical comfort, reduced productivity and increased stress. Crowded trains can also lead to problems boarding and alighting, increasing dwell times and making it harder for operators to provide a reliable service. It is therefore desirable to reduce <b>crowding</b> <b>levels,</b> but it isn’t always practical to achieve this by increasing capacity and other measures need to be considered. Some passengers have shown willingness to change their behavior to avoid crowding, for example by waiting for a later train, and measures to encourage such behavioral changes more widely could be beneficial overall. Better information provision could be one such measure, and a stated preference survey was undertaken on a commuter and airport service in order to investigate this further. It was found that the provision of information about <b>crowding</b> <b>levels</b> and seating availability on alternative trains would encourage some passengers to wait for a less crowded train. While the willingness of passengers to wait for a later train varied with both trip purpose and with the origin station, the findings suggest that real-time information would improve the passenger experience and could form the basis of a revenue neutral demand-management system. The implications for station design are particularly pertinent for countries such as the USA where significant investment in new passenger rail systems is expecte...|$|R
