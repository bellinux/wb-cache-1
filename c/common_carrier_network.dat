40|$|In August 2008, the FCC {{found that}} Comcast's {{restrictions}} on peer-to-peer upload transmissions were unreasonably discriminatory, arbitrarily targeted a particular application, and deprived consumers {{of their rights}} to run Internet applications and use services of their choice. The Comcast ruling represents {{a significant change in}} the FCC's direction: given the FCC's past decisions that broadband Internet access services do not fall within the "common carrier" category, it is notable that the agency has now imposed nondiscrimination requirements on these services. This Article shows that the rationales articulated in the FCC's Comcast order, stressing both (i) concerns about protecting competition and (ii) concerns about protecting consumers from disruption of their ability to communicate freely and privately, are rooted in centuries of Anglo-American law defining he obligations of "common carriers. " The FCC appears to be moving away from its traditional emphasis on the competition policy concerns, which justify asymmetrical regulation of dominant providers for the sake of enabling competition, and toward an emphasis on the consumer protection issues, which justify symmetrical regulation of all service providers regardless whether they have market power. These developments in the U. S. echo the discussion now going on in Europe {{in the context of the}} package of proposals on a new common regulatory framework for telecommunications, released by the European Commission on Nov. 13, 2007, and which is now being debated by the European Parliament and Council. On both sides of the Atlantic, a trend is emerging to permit network discrimination only if the discrimination is narrowly tailored to achieve legitimate objectives. network neutrality, discrimination, <b>common</b> <b>carrier,</b> <b>network</b> management, Comcast, European Directives. ...|$|E

The approach here is to start with an ordered list of the functions that any network must provide in tying two end users together, and then to indicate how this leads naturally to layered peer protocols out of which the architecture of a computer network is constructed. After a discussion of a few block diagrams of private (commercially provided) and public (<b>common</b> <b>carrier)</b> <b>networks,</b> the layer and header structures of SNA and DNA architectures and the X. 25 interface are briefly described.

40|$|Network science, or {{the art of}} {{describing}} system structure, may be useful for the analysis and control of large, complex systems. For example, networks exhibiting scale-free structure {{have been found to}} be particularly well suited to deal with environmental uncertainty and large demand growth. The National Airspace System may be, at least in part, a scalable network. In fact, the hub-and-spoke structure of the commercial segment of the NAS is an often-cited example of an existing scale-free network After reviewing the nature and attributes of scale-free networks, this assertion is put to the test: is commercial air carrier transportation in the United States well explained by this model? If so, are the positive attributes of these networks, e. g. those of efficiency, flexibility and robustness, fully realized, or could we effect substantial improvement? This paper first outlines attributes of various network types, then looks more closely at the <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> air transportation <b>network</b> from perspectives of the traveler, the airlines, and Air Traffic Control (ATC). Network models are applied within each paradigm, including discussion of implied strengths and weaknesses of each model. Finally, known limitations of scalable networks are discussed. With an eye towards NAS operations, utilizing the strengths and avoiding the weaknesses of scale-free networks are addressed. ...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> is {{distinguished}} from a contract carrier (also called a public carrier in UK English), {{which is a}} carrier that transports goods for only {{a certain number of}} clients and that can refuse to transport goods for anyone else, and from a private <b>carrier.</b> A <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> holds itself out to provide service to the general public without discrimination (to {{meet the needs of the}} regulator's quasi judicial role of impartiality toward the public's interest) for the [...] "public convenience and necessity." [...] A <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> must further demonstrate to the regulator that it is [...] "fit, willing, and able" [...] to provide those services for which it is granted authority. <b>Common</b> <b>carriers</b> typically transport persons or goods according to defined and published routes, time schedules, and rate tables upon the approval of regulators. Public airlines, railroads, bus lines, taxicab companies, phone companies, internet service providers, cruise ships, motor carriers (i.e., canal operating companies, trucking companies), and other freight companies generally operate as <b>common</b> <b>carriers.</b> Under US law, an ocean freight forwarder cannot act as a <b>common</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|R

Therefore, the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 regulations, which could only be applied to <b>common</b> <b>carriers,</b> could not be applied to broadband providers.
