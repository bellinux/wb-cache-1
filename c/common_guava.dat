50|$|This {{species has}} been crossed with its relative, the <b>common</b> <b>guava.</b> The {{resulting}} fruits are small, but numerous.|$|E
50|$|This genus was {{described}} first by Linnaeus in 1753. Many {{of the species}} bear edible fruits, {{and for this reason}} several are cultivated commercially. Most important is the <b>common</b> <b>guava,</b> Psidium guajava.|$|E
50|$|When {{cultivated}} from seed, guavas are {{notable for}} an extremely slow growth rate for several months, before a very rapid acceleration in growth rate takes over. From seed, <b>common</b> <b>guavas</b> may bloom and set fruit in {{as few as}} two years or as many as eight. Cuttings and grafting are more commonly used as a propagation method in commercial groves. Highly adaptable, guavas can be easily grown as container plants in temperate regions, though their ability to bloom and set fruit is somewhat less predictable. In some tropical locations, guavas can become invasive. It {{has become a major}} problem in the Galápagos Islands.|$|R
40|$|Field {{infestation}} {{and spatial}} distribution of introduced Bactrocera carambolae Drew and Hancock and native species of Anastrepha in <b>common</b> <b>guavas</b> [Psidium guajava (L.) ] were investigated in the eastern Amazon. Fruit sampling {{was carried out in}} the municipalities of Calc¸oene and Oiapoque in the state of Amapa, Brazil. The frequency distribution of larvae in fruit was fitted to the negative binomial distribution. Anastrepha striata was more abundant in both sampled areas in comparison to Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) and B. carambolae. The frequency distribution analysis of adults revealed an aggregated pattern for B. carambolae as well as for A. fraterculus and Anastrepha striata Schiner, described by the negative binomial distribution. Although the populations of Anastrepha spp. may have suffered some impact due to the presence of B. carambolae, the results are still not robust enough to indicate effective reduction in the abundance of Anastrepha spp. caused by B. carambolae in a general sense. The high degree of aggregation observed for both species suggests interspecific co-occurrence with the simultaneous presence of both species in the analysed fruit. Moreover, a significant fraction of uninfested guavas also indicated absence of competitive displacement. 201...|$|R

Byproducts from pineapple, cocoa, palm kernel, corn gluten meal, <b>common</b> bean, sunflower, <b>guava,</b> cassava bark, cassava stems, cassava foliage, papaya, mango, passion fruit and turnips were evaluated. There were differences between the byproducts as for the potentially neutral detergent fiber (NDF) fraction and the in situ NDF degradation rate in the final volume of the gases generated by fibrous carbohydrates (FC), for the lag time and for the in vitro fractional degradation rate of the FC. There was equivalence between the dNDF values predicted in situ and those observed in vivo; however, there was low precision of estimates. The degradability in the in vitro incubation times of 30 and 48 hours presented equivalence with the values observed, but also did not present precision in the estimates. The equations fitted without lignin were not precise and accurate to estimate the dNDF of agricultural and agro-industrial byproducts. The equation with lignin and with the digestion rate obtained by the in vitro method presented more precise estimates. Byproducts from common bean, cassava bark and papaya presented greater NDF availability, whereas those of guava had the lowest NDF availability. The digestible NDF fraction was best predicted with the in situ incubation time of 72 hours. The equation fitted utilizing in vitro or in situ digestion rates enables the prediction of the NDF availability of agricultural and agroindustrial byproducts...|$|R

The family Myrtaceae is well represented in Hawai'i by both native and introduced species. Two species of the genus Psidium, P. cattleianum (strawberry guava) and P. guajava (<b>common</b> <b>guava),</b> are particularly significant as invasive alien weeds in Hawai'i, where they pose serious threats to native ecosystems. Whereas these species are native to South America, they have been widely distributed throughout warmer regions of the world because of their edible fruit.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{report the}} results of a 2 -yr survey aimed at {{determining}} the identity and abundance of native parasitoids of fruit infesting tephritids attacking Psidium guajava L. (<b>common</b> <b>guava)</b> in the endangered northernmost Yungas forests of Argentina, which are being encroached by commercial citrus groves. The 3, 200 guavas collected during the peak of the short guava fruiting period (February andMarch), yielded 10, 701 Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) andCeratitis capitata (Wiedemann) adults (97. 4 and 2. 6 %, respectively) and 712 native parasitoids. The parasitoid species and proportion in the total sample during the 2 -yr study period were as follows:Doryctobracon areolatus (Szépligeti), 37. 9 %;Doryctobracon brasiliensis (Szépligeti), 17. 7 %; Utetes anastrephae (Viereck), 1. 1 %;Opius bellus (Gahan), 0. 7 %; (all Braconidae, Opiinae), and Aganaspis pelleranoi (Brèthes), 32. 6 % (Figitidae, Eucoilinae). All parasitoids emerged from A. fraterculus pupae (i. e., none from C. capitata). The discovery of D. crawfordi represents the Þrst report for Argentina and the southernmost record for the species. We discuss the practical implications of the role of guava as a reservoir for A. fraterculus and the implications for the biological control of both fruit ßies.

40|$|Agent-based models (ABMs) are {{powerful}} tools for population–environment research but {{are subject to}} trade-offs between model complexity and abstraction. This study strikes a compromise between abstract and highly specified ABMs by designing a spatially explicit, stylized ABM and using it to explore policy scenarios in a setting that is facing substantial conservation and development challenges. Specifically, we present an ABM that reflects key Land Use/Land Cover dynamics and livelihood decisions on Isabela Island in the Galápagos Archipelago of Ecuador. We implement the model using the NetLogo software platform, a free program that requires relatively little programming experience. The landscape is composed of a satellite-derived distribution of a problematic invasive species (<b>common</b> <b>guava)</b> and a stylized representation of the Galápagos National Park, the community of Puerto Villamil, the agricultural zone, and the marine area. The agent module is based on publicly available data and household interviews and represents the primary livelihoods {{of the population in}} the Galápagos Islands—tourism, fisheries, and agriculture. We use the model to enact hypothetical agricultural subsidy scenarios aimed at controlling invasive guava and assess the resulting population and land cover dynamics. Findings suggest that spatially explicit, stylized ABMs have considerable utility, particularly during preliminary stages of research, as platforms for (1) sharpening conceptualizations of population–environment systems, (2) testing alternative scenarios, and (3) uncovering critical data gaps...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} hydrodistilled oils of the leaves of Psidium guajava L. (guava leaf) and Psidium cattleianum Sabine (strawberry guava) was determined by GC/MS analysis to identify their chemotypes. Moreover, in vitro antimicrobial activity of these volatile oils against selected bacteria, yeast, and mycelia fungi was studied. The yield of the volatile oil hydrodistilled from the leaves of P. guajava L. and P. cattleianum Sabine was 1. 6 and 2. 69 g/kg on fresh weight basis, respectively. Limonene was the major identified hydrocarbon in P. guava leaves’ oil (54. 70 %), whereas, 1, 8 -cineole was the major identified oxygenated monoterpenoid (32. 14 %) in <b>common</b> <b>guava</b> leaves. The foliar oil of P. cattleianum was predominated by the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon; β-caryophyllene representing 28. 83 % of the total oil make-up. The antibacterial activity of guava leaf oil was more pronounced against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than that of strawberry guava leaves, while P. cattleianum showed a higher activity against ess. The MIC of the volatile oil of the leaves of P. guajava against S. aureus was 6. 75 μg/ml, while that of P. cattleianum exhibited MIC value of 13. 01 μg/ml against Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
