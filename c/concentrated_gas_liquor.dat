40|$|Reprocessed Bruin 2 D seismic data (recorded in 2006) from New Zealand Hikurangi Margin are {{presented}} and analyzed {{to show the}} presence of gas hydrates. We choose six seismic lines that each showed bottom-simulating reflections (BSRs) that are important indicators {{for the presence of}} gas hydrate. The aim is to obtain a higher resolution image of the shallow subsurface structures and determine the nature of the gas hydrate system in this area. To further investigate the presence of Gas Hydrates was undertaken. There is a strong correlation between anomalous velocities and the depths of BSRs, which supports the presence of gas hydrates in the research area and is useful for detecting areas of both free gas and gas hydrate along the seismic lines. The combination of high-resolution seismic imaging and velocity analysis is the key method for showing the distribution of gas hydrates and gas pockets in our research area. The results indicate that the distribution of both free gas and gas hydrate is strongly localized. The Discussion Chapter gives several <b>concentrated</b> <b>gas</b> hydrate deposits in the research area. Idealized scenarios for the formation of the gas hydrates are proposed. In terms of identifying <b>concentrated</b> <b>gas</b> hydrate deposits we propose the identification of the following key seismic attributes: 1) existence of BSRs, 2) strong reflections above BSRs in the gas hydrate stability zone, 3) enhanced reflections related to free gas below BSRs, 4) appropriate velocity anomalies (i. e. low velocity zones beneath BSRs and localized high-velocity zones above BSRs).

40|$|We have {{performed}} a multi-transition CO {{study of the}} centers of seven doublebarred galaxies that exhibit a variety of molecular gas morphologies {{to determine if the}} molecular gas properties are correlated with the nuclear morphology and star forming activity. Near infrared galaxy surveys have revealed the existence of nuclear stellar bars in a large number of barred or lenticular galaxies. High resolution CO maps of these galaxies exhibit a wide range of morphologies. Recent simulations of double-barred galaxies suggest that variations in the gas properties may allow it to respond differently to similar gravitational potentials. We find that the 12 CO J= 3 − 2 /J= 2 − 1 line ratio is lower in galaxies with centrally <b>concentrated</b> <b>gas</b> distributions and higher in galaxies with CO emission dispersed around the galactic center in rings and peaks. The 13 CO / 12 CO J= 2 − 1 line ratios are similar for all galaxies, which indicates that the J= 3 − 2 /J= 2 − 1 line ratio is tracing variations in gas temperature and density, rather than variations in optical depth. There is evidence that the galaxies which contain more centralized CO distributions are comprised of molecular gas that is cooler and less dense. Observations suggest that the star formation rates are higher in the galaxies containing the warmer, denser, less centrally <b>concentrated</b> <b>gas.</b> It is possible that either the bar dynamics are responsible for the variety of gas distributions and densities (and hence the star formation rates) or that the star formation alone is responsible for modifying the gas properties. – 2...|$|R

5000|$|Scrubbers which {{utilized}} {{water were}} {{designed in the}} 25 years after {{the foundation of the}} industry. It was discovered that the removal of ammonia from the gas depended upon {{the way in which the}} gas to be purified was contacted by water. This was found to be best performed by the Tower Scrubber. This scrubber consisted of a tall cylindrical vessel, which contained trays or bricks which were supported on grids. The water, or weak <b>gas</b> <b>liquor,</b> trickled over these trays, thereby keeping the exposed surfaces thoroughly wetted. The gas to be purified was run through the tower to be contacted with the liquid. In 1846 George Lowe patented a device with revolving perforated pipes for supplying water or purifying liquor. At a later date, the Rotary Washer Scrubber was introduced by Paddon, who used it at Brighton about 1870. This prototype machine was followed by others of improved construction notably by Kirkham, Hulett, and Chandler, who introduced the well-known Standard Washer Scrubber, Holmes, of Huddersfield, and others. The Tower Scrubber and the Rotary Washer Scrubber made it possible to completely remove ammonia from the gas.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Microbiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Sasol plants gasify {{more than}} 30 million {{tons per annum}} of coal via the Fischer- Tropsch process {{resulting}} {{in the production of}} synthesis gas and a condensate stream. After gravimetric separation of the tar products, the solvent extraction of phenolics and the steam stripping of ammonia from the condensate stream, a complex effluent referred to as stripped <b>gas</b> <b>liquor</b> (SGL) is generated. SGL {{has the potential to be}} used as process cooling water. Micro-organisms, scale deposit and corrosion are three major problems associated with the operation of cooling water systems. Parameters that have an influence on the fouling, scaling and corrosion of industrial cooling towers include cycles of concentration (COC), flow velocity (FV) and pH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water. Stripped <b>gas</b> <b>liquor</b> contains hydrocarbons which can interfere with PLFA analysis. There was, therefore, a need to optimise the selective extraction of hydrocarbons so as to eliminate their interference with PLFA analysis. The method used for the extraction of hydrocarbons before silicic acid fractionation succeeded in removing the hydrocarbons and their interference and was, therefore, determined to be appropriate method to use in subsequent analyses. Even though the two lab-scale cooling towers were of identical design their similarity or dissimilarity needed investigation. Physico-chemical analysis results confirmed that the two cooling towers were operated under identical operational conditions. The two cooling towers were found to be similar in terms of the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates as well as microbial community structure. The two cooling towers could be operated in parallel using different operational conditions with any differences in results being a reflection of the effects of operational conditions. The effects of pH, FV and COC on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as microbial community dynamics were evaluated with the aid of a 2 ³ multi-factorial experimental design. Cycles of concentration was found to have the most profound effect on the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates followed by pH. Cycles of concentration and pH were found to have the most profound effect on microbial community dynamics. The use of the 2 ³ multi-factorial experimental design also allowed the determination of optimal conditions for the operation of,the cooling towers using SGE as feed water. These conditions were found to be 5 COC, a pH of 7. 5 and a FV of 0. 6 m/s. In conclusion, the use of a 2 ³ factorial experimental design, physico-chemical, PLFA and DGGE analyses were instrumental in the successful determination of the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in the cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water.

40|$|We {{present the}} first cosmological galaxy evolved using the modern {{smoothed}} particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GASOLINE 2 with superbubble feedback. We show that superbubble-driven galactic outflows powered by Type II supernovae alone can produce L^* galaxies with flat rotation curves with circular velocities ∼ 200 km/s, low bulge-to-disc ratios, and stellar mass fractions that match observed values from high redshift to the present. These features are {{made possible by}} the high mass loadings generated by the evaporative growth of superbubbles. Outflows are driven extremely effectively at high redshift, expelling gas at early times and preventing overproduction of stars before z= 2.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of self-gravitating {{simulations}} of spiral galaxies, modeled by stellar and gaseous components, developed to investigate in particular the role of dissipation {{in the evolution of}} galaxy disks. The gas disk is simulated by the Beam-Scheme method, where it is considered as a self-gravitating fluid. The results suggest that the gravitational coupling between the stars and gas plays a fundamental role in the formation and dissolution of stellar bars, depending on the gaseous mass concentration and on the degree of dissipation. In addition we remark that initially <b>concentrated</b> <b>gas</b> disks can be unstable to the one-armed (m= 1) spiral perturbations, which may explain the lopsided features observed in the gas distribution of the late-type isolated galaxies. The development of the m= 1 feature slows down the radial gas flows towards the center, since the large-scale gravity torques are then much weaker.

We analyze the gas geometry, N-PDF shape, and YSO content of a selection of subregions in the cloud. We find no regions with pure lognormal N-PDFs. The regions with a combination of lognormal and one power law N-PDF have a YSO cluster and a corresponding centrally <b>concentrated</b> <b>gas</b> clump. The regions with a combination of lognormal and two power law N-PDF have significant numbers of typically younger YSOs but no prominent YSO cluster.

We find that for our fixed scale regions, the YSO count roughly correlates with the N-PDF power law index. The correlation appears steeper for single power law regions relative to two power law regions with a high column density cut-off, as a greater dense gas mass fraction is achieved in the former. A stronger correlation is found between embedded YSO count and the dense gas mass among our regions. Comment: 15 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables. Accepted in MNRA...|$|R
