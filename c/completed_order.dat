40|$|A new {{framework}} to perform routing at the autonomous system (AS) level is proposed here. This mechanism, called chain routing framework (CRF), uses <b>complete</b> <b>orders</b> as its main topological unit. Since <b>complete</b> <b>orders</b> are acyclic digraphs that possess a known topology, {{it is possible}} to use these acyclic structures to route consistently packets between a group of ASs. The adoption of <b>complete</b> <b>orders</b> also allows easy identification and avoidance of persistent route oscillations, eliminates the possibility of developing transient loops in paths and provides a structure that facilitates the implementation of traffic engineering. Moreover, by combining CRF with other mechanisms that implement <b>complete</b> <b>orders</b> in time, the authors propose that {{it is possible to}} design a new routing protocol, which can be more reliable and stable than the border gateway protocol...|$|R

50|$|There is {{no cost to}} join Betterware and {{catalogues}} are supplied free of charge. The Betterware catalogue {{is delivered}} door-to-door in the United Kingdom and Ireland {{by a team of}} approximately 5,000 Distributors who then collect <b>completed</b> <b>order</b> forms. The products are then distributed from the company's warehouse in Hurricane Park, sandwiched between the River Tame and the M6. The sales force are all self-employed and work on either a part-time or full-time basis. Distributors report to line managers that the company calls coordinators, each covering a small town and surrounding area, or part of a larger town. They then report to Regional managers are responsible for all coordinators in their area, and they, in turn, report to the national sales director. All activity takes place within pre-determined geographical areas. Turnover is over £50 million. There are subsidiaries in Spain, Cyprus and Central America. In addition to the home delivery catalogue customers can order products directly from head office online. Centrally-placed orders are delivered by the distributor or coordinator covering the relevant area, and regarded as sales found by them. There is also a retail outlet at head office.|$|E
40|$|Background. American {{health care}} is {{transitioning}} to electronic physician ordering. These computerized sys-tems are unique because they allow custom order interfa-ces. Although these systems provide great benefits, there are also potential pitfalls, as the behavioral sciences {{have shown that the}} very format of electronic interfaces can influence decision making. The current research spe-cifically examines how defaults in electronic order tem-plates affect physicians ’ treatment decisions and medical errors. Methods. Forty-five medical residents <b>completed</b> <b>order</b> sets for 3 medical case studies. Participants were ran-domly assigned to receive order sets with either ‘‘opt-in’’ defaults (options visible but unselected) or ‘‘opt-out’ ’ de-faults (options visible and preselected).

40|$|The {{municipality}} {{and county}} administrations of Uppsala {{are planning a}} project for coordination of transports to their institutions and services across Uppsala County, which are today done separately. This report aims to analyze what the profits of such coordination might be, in terms of environmental care, economic and social aspects, given the resources available today. This is done by creating optimization models for both separate and coordinated transports, based on previously <b>completed</b> <b>order</b> tables, and comparing the results. The final results show at best a 13 % improvement in driving distance and a 7 % improvement in driver work time, which transfers into 172 000 SEK savings yearly and significant reductions in CO 2 -emissions while easing workload during high intensity days. Changes in the transport fleet might increase this to up to 272 000 SEK while possibly further reducing emissions but without creating significant increase in workload for drivers...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuation}} of the EOSDIS testbed ('Testbed') has materialized from a multi-task system to a fully functional stand-alone data archive distribution center that once was only X-Windows driven to {{a system that is}} accessible by all types of users and computers via the World Wide Web. Throughout the past months, the Testbed has evolved into a completely new system. The current system is now accessible through Netscape, Mosaic, and all other servers that can contact the World Wide Web. On October 1, 1995 we will open to the public and we expect that the statistics of the type of user, where they are located, and what they are looking for will drastically change. What is the most important change in the Testbed has been the Web interface. This interface will allow more users access to the system and walk them through the data types with more ease than before. All of the callbacks are written {{in such a way that}} icons can be used to easily move around in the programs interface. The homepage offers the user the opportunity to go and get more information about each satellite data type and also information on free programs. These programs are grouped into categories for types of computers that the programs are compiled for, along with information on how to FTP the programs back to the end users computer. The heart of the Testbed is still the acquisition of satellite data. From the Testbed homepage, the user selects the 'access to data system' icon, which will take them to the world map and allow them to select an area that they would like coverage on by simply clicking that area of the map. This creates a new map where other similar choices can be made to get the latitude and longitude of the region the satellite data will cover. Once a selection has been made the search parameters page will appear to be filled out. Afterwards, the browse image will be called for once the search is completed and the images for viewing can be selected. There are several other option pages, but once an order has been selected the Testbed will bring up the order list page and the user will then be able to place their order. After the order has been completed, the Testbed will mail the user to notify them of the <b>completed</b> <b>order</b> and how the images can be picked up...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} Internet's {{resilience}} to instabilities {{caused by the}} mismatch of its topological state and routing information. A first numerical analysis proves that the Internet possesses unused path diversity which could be employed to strengthen its resilience to failures. Therefore, a new routing framework called Chain Routing, which takes advantage of such path diversity, is proposed. This novel idea is based in the mathematical concept of <b>complete</b> <b>order,</b> which is a binary relation that is irreflexive, asymmetric, transitive and complete. More important {{is the fact that}} <b>complete</b> <b>orders,</b> when represented as a graph, are the most connected digraph that does not contain any cycles. Consequently, a <b>complete</b> <b>order</b> could be applied to route information from a source to a destination with the guarantee that cycles will not develop in a path. A second numerical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of implementing Chain Routing as part of a routing protocol. Finally, an analysis is presented on how network stability could be maintained if a routing protocol integrates <b>complete</b> <b>orders</b> in time and topology.
