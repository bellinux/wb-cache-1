5000|$|In early July 2012 Capriles {{published}} a document allegedly {{showing that the}} government had ordered all military personnel not to view private television networks. The publication coincided with a Capriles political ad aimed at the military; the document was alleged by state-run news agency Agencia Venezolana de Noticias to be a crude forgery, showing the document alongside the original and highlighting the changes, with Chávez himself repeating the analysis of the document on television. Based on non-classified military order 4926 from September 2011, the document had been redated to 31 July but was published several weeks before that date, still bearing the original signature of the minister of defense in September 2011, Carlos José Mata Figueroa (who had been replaced in January 2012). The document bore the original document number, and had the [...] "not classified" [...] stamps replaced with [...] "confidential", but retained the original [...] "NOCLAS" [...] ("not classified") <b>classification</b> <b>mark.</b> The source of the document was not identified, but Chávez said that it was [...] "nothing new that opposition forges documents and invents things that never happened".|$|E

This study focused on medical experts ’ opinions concerning the safety of using transdermal patches with printed therapeutic classification marks. We conducted a questionnaire study of cardiac transdermal patch users, including doctors, pharmacists, and nurses. In addition to traditional statistical analyses, we developed a pseudo-distance measure and applied an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to questionnaire data. Medical experts supported the validity of transdermal patches and therapeutic <b>classification</b> <b>mark</b> design. Opinions regarding displays on labels differed by occupation. Following the opinion of pharmacists and nurses, who deal directly with the medications, we conclude that the display of therapeutic classification marks and product names should be promoted...|$|E
40|$|The South African {{consumer}} market is characterised by socio-economic and cultural diversity. Food expenditure patterns, behaviour and preferences differ significantly {{between the various}} socio-economic sub-groups. Packaging information, including red meat classification information, could be an important tangible resource used by consumers to gauge product quality. The first objective of the research reported in {{this paper is to}} investigate the red meat knowledge, usage and perceptions regarding beef and sheep meat classification and related quality parameters among South African consumers. Consumer perceptions of red meat classification were extracted from a comprehensive consumer survey among stratified representative samples of South African low-, middle- and high-income consumers (n = 165, n = 171 and n = 249). The paper also briefly reports on an in-store ‘observational’ research project that was conducted to develop an understanding of the communication of carcass classification to consumers through fresh red meat product labels at independent butchers and large retailers across South Africa (n = 60). Low-income consumers had very limited understanding and gave little attention to red meat classification. Even though middle-class and wealthy consumers also have a limited understanding of red meat classification, about half of these consumers check for a <b>classification</b> <b>mark.</b> Red meat classification was not mentioned by consumers as a major concern regarding red meat, but related aspects were important such as quality, fattiness, tenderness, juiciness, taste, freshness, smell and appearance. Purchase considerations for beef and mutton/lamb focussed largely on safety, appearance, price and eating quality. Labelling information observed at retail outlets gave very little attention to classification. There is a definite need for consumer education relating to the red meat classification system and for the development of an appropriate front-of-pack labelling system to communicate red meat classification.
