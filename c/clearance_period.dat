40|$|Introduction & Objective: Previous {{studies have}} shown {{increased}} ET concentrations in plasma and renal tissues in ischemic or toxic acute renal failure (ARF). These increments were parallel to a reduction of renal blood flow and progression of renal dysfunction. The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential beneficial effect of the novel selective ETA antagonist (UK- 350, 926), on tissue damages occurring during the early phase of ischemia-reperfusion induced ARF. Materials & Methods: In pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, I. P) anaesthetized male Charles River rats’ (290 - 340 g) abdomens were opened via a mid abdominal incision. The urinary bladder was cannulated and renal arteries and veins of both kidneys were carefully cleared. After 2 h rest, a 0. 5 h <b>clearance</b> <b>period</b> was taken for basal levels, followed by two 30 min periods, and then a 4 h experimental <b>clearance</b> <b>period</b> was considered. Finally, both kidneys were removed and fixed in paraffin for histological studies. The rats were divided into three groups (n= 6) : 1) Sham Group, 2) Ischemia/reperfusion Group (I/R), in which 30 min {{after the end of}} control <b>clearance</b> <b>period,</b> renal ischemia was induced by bilateral renal artery clamp for 30 min, and 3) drug treated Group (I/R+D) in which UK- 350, 926 (50 μg/kg. min) was infused I.

There was marked apoptosis and disappearance of brush border in proximal tubular cells in this group that was not observed in I/R+D and sham group.

However, the direct effects of TNF-α on renal hemodynamic and excretory function are not yet clearly defined. We examined the renal responses to infusion of TNF-α (0. 33 ng·g− 1 ·min− 1) in anesthetized mice. Renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined by PAH and inulin clearance. The urine was collected from a cannula inserted into the bladder. Following the 60 -min control <b>clearance</b> <b>period,</b> TNF-α infusion was initiated and 15 min were given for stabilization followed by another 60 -min <b>clearance</b> <b>period.</b> TNF-α alone (n = 7) caused decreases in RBF (7. 9 ± 0. 3 to 6. 4 ± 0. 3 ml·min− 1 ·g− 1) and GFR (1. 04 ± 0. 06 to 0. 62 ± 0. 08 ml·min− 1 ·g− 1) as well as increases in absolute (0. 8 ± 0. 3 to 1. 4 ± 0. 3 μmol·min− 1 ·g− 1) and fractional excretion of sodium (0. 5 ± 0. 2 to 1. 5 ± 0. 4 %) without affecting arterial pressure. TNF-α also increased 8 -isoprostane excretion (8. 10 ± 1. 09 to 11. 13 ± 1. 34 pg·min− 1 ·g− 1). Pretreatment with TNF-α blocker etanercept (5 mg/kg sc; 24 and 3 h before TNF-α infusion; n = 6) abolished these responses. However, TNF-α induced an increase in RBF and caused attenuation of the GFR reduction in mice pretreated with superoxide (O 2 −) scavenger tempol (2 μg·g− 1 ·min− 1; n = 6). Pretreatment with nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (0. 1 μg·g− 1 ·min− 1; n = 6) resulted in further enhancement in vasoconstriction while natriuresis remained unaffected in response to TNF-α.

At baseline, creatinine relative to inulin clearance (ClC/Cll) ranged from 1. 14 to 2. 27. With cimetidine, ClC/Cll approached unity in 8 patients (mean 1. 02 [SD 0. 03]), but considerably exceeded unity in 8 others (1. 33 [0. 14]). Plasma cimetidine/creatinine ratio was smaller in this second group, due to significantly higher renal clearance of cimetidine (333 [136] vs 165 [89] ml/min, p = 0. 01). In a further study, cimetidine dose and, consequently plasma cimetidine concentration, was increased in 6 additional patients who had incomplete inhibited previously. This increased dose completely inhibited tubular creatinine secretion in the third until the sixth hour, so that creatinine clearance equalled GFR.

The R-Cin on each subject was based on two <b>clearance</b> <b>periods</b> during which the plasma inulin concentration ([Pin]) varied by 1. 0 mg/dl or less and the rate of inulin excretion by less than 10 %.

40|$|One of {{the effects}} of a {{decreased}} cardiac output in chronic congestive heart failure is a dispro-portionate decrease in the renal blood flow. We have calculated the renal fraction of the cardiac output to be reduced to about two-fifths of normal and have shown that there is marked efferent ar-teriolar constriction with increased intraglomeru-lar filtration pressure in congestive heart failure (1). Although Merrill and co-workers (2) have demonstrated that renin is present in increased amounts in the renal venous blood of some patients with congestive failure, we wondered if renal vaso-constriction might also result from neurogenic stimulation when the cardiac output falls; in which case, hyperemia should be produced by blocking the reflex pathways. In the present study the interruption of the autonomic vasoconstrictor path-. ways was effected by means of high spinal anes-thesia. As will be seen from the results obtained in these experiments, renal hyperemia does not occur in response to the abolition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor impulses. METHODS Fourteen patients with varying degrees of congestive heart failure were the subjects. They were examined in the post-absorptive state employing the clearance of man-nitol (or sodium thiosulfate in two instances) as a measure of glomerular filtration rate, and the clearance of p-aminohippuric acid 8 as a measure of effective renal plasma flow as described in a previous report (1).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Measuring GFR using {{exogenous}} markers {{without a}} bladder catheter, errors {{can be easily}} made due to incomplete urine collection. The aim was to quantify agreement for 125 I-iothalamate GFR measurements with and without a correction for inaccurate urine collection using 131 I-hippuran. METHODS: The last available GFR measurement of adult patients was included. GFR was measured in two subsequent <b>clearance</b> <b>periods</b> with 125 I-iothalamate by the standard method with correction for inaccurate urine collections using 131 I-hippuran. The uncorrected and corrected GFR measurements were compared within and between the time periods for each individual patient. To study the agreement between both methods, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated and Bland-Altman plots, with accompanying accuracies and precisions, were used. Cohen's kappa was calculated to analyze the agreement of both methods for classifying patients according to the stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). RESULTS: For the 332 stable included patients, the mean GFR of the uncorrected measurements was 77. 8 ml/min (34. 7) and the mean GFR of the corrected measurements was 81. 0 ml/min (34. 9). The ICC was 0. 80 for the uncorrected measurements with an accuracy of 7. 3 ml/min and a precision of 21. 7 ml/min. For the corrected GFR measurements the ICC was 0. 98, with an accuracy of 2. 1 ml/min and a precision of 6. 5 ml/min. Comparison between the methods showed an ICC of 0. 95, an accuracy of 3. 2 and a precision of 11. 0. In total, 86 % of the patients were classified similarly into CKD stages with both methods, overall Cohen's kappa was 0. 81. CONCLUSION: Agreement was better for GFR measurements corrected for inaccurate urine collections. Therefore, GFR measurements with 125 I-iothalamate should be corrected for inaccurate urine collections using 131 I-hippuran. Without such correction the GFR is easily underestimated which may lead to overtreatmen...|$|R

These findings have potential implications for market access monitoring for determining pest freedom, and for biosecurity monitoring programmes in other countries that wish to detect B.

40|$|Three {{findings}} {{characterize the}} unusual purine metabolism of the Dalmatian dog (1) : (a) Unlike other dogs, the urine of the pure bred Dalmatian contains {{large amounts of}} urate and relatively small amounts of allantoin, (b) per unit body weight, the urinary urate excretion of the Dalmatian is several times that of man, (c) although the Dalmatian excretes more urate than man per unit weight, this is accomplished at a plasma urate level much {{lower than that of}} man. In other words, the renal clearance of urate per unit weight per minute is much larger in the Dalmatian than in man. From the available literature, {{it is not clear whether}} the urate clearance of the Dalmatian exceeds the glomerular filtration rate or is merely equal to the glomerular filtration rate. Schaffer, Dill, and Stander (2) estimated urate and urea clearance simultaneously during a study of the renal effects of renin. In three <b>clearance</b> <b>periods,</b> when no renin had been given or after its immediate action had terminated, urate clearance was found to average 435 per cent of the urea clearance. These urate clearances were estimated with a colorimetric total urate method, but the same authors also studied enzymatically determined true urate values in other experiments on Dalmatians. If an average correction is made for the differences found between total urate and true urate values, the urate clearance in their experiments averaged 539 per cent of the urea clearance, a value far in excess of the glomerular filtration rate. Friedman and Byers, however, have presented data which they interpret as indicating an identity of urate clearance and glomerular filtration rate in the Dalmatian (3). It is possible that this discrepancy in results may be methodological in origin. In neither of the studies summarized above was a well accepted pro...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: High {{doses of}} {{furosemide}} can increase urine volume in chronic peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. However, no {{information is available}} about effects on urinary solute excretion in relation to residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary furosemide excretion, and peritoneal solute kinetics. METHODS: Diuretic response and the effect on peritoneal fluid and solute transport parameters were investigated in 7 stable CAPD patients with residual renal function (median urine volume 350 mL/ 24 hours, range 140 - 1900 mL/ 24 hours). Comparisons were made during two <b>clearance</b> <b>periods</b> of 24 hours: one without (P 1) and one during 2 g furosemide (P 2). RESULTS: The median increase in urine volume was 400 mL (range 270 - 910 mL, p < 0. 02) {{and the increase in}} sodium excretion was 54 mmol (range 25 - 118 mmol, p < 0. 02). No change in GFR was found between P 1 (2. 4 mL/ minute, range 0. 6 - 5. 7 mL/min) and P 2 (2. 0 mL/min, range 1. 0 - 4. 8 mL/min). An increase in fractional clearance was found for volume, sodium, potassium, and osmolality (p < 0. 02). No change was found in the fractional clearance of urea and electrolyte-free water. Furosemide excretion in urine was 8. 7 mg/ 24 hours (range 2. 1 - 38 mg/ 24 hours) and in dialysate 4. 9 mg/ 24 hours (range 1. 9 - 7. 8 mg/ 24 hours). Plasma furosemide concentration was 29. 5 mg/L (range 6. 2 - 43. 9 mg/L). A positive correlation was found between residual GFR and total urine furosemide excretion (r = 0. 93, p < 0. 005). Efficiency, expressed as the increase in fractional sodium clearance (percent) per milligram of furosemide excreted per 24 hours, was 1. 2 %/mg (range 0. 3 % - 11. 3 %/mg). CONCLUSION: High-dose furosemide is effective in CAPD patients in increasing urine volume and electrolyte excretion without affecting urea and creatinine clearance. In CAPD patients, the individual response to an identical high dose of furosemide is dependent on the magnitude of residual GF...|$|R
40|$|The {{clearance}} {{of organic}} ions by the tubules {{may contribute to}} the removal of uremic waste products in dialysis patients. The renal excretion of an exogenous anion p-aminohippurate (PAH) was investigated in 10 peritoneal dialysis patients and 10 hemodialysis patients during one <b>clearance</b> <b>period</b> and compared with the clearance of creatinine (Ccr) and inulin (CIn). The <b>clearance</b> <b>period</b> was 24 hours in the peritoneal dialysis patients and one interdialytic interval of 3 days divided in 4 parts [CPA-D] in hemodialysis patients. In peritoneal dialysis patients the renal clearance of total PAH (median 14. 3 ml/min, range 3. 8 - 33. 0) exceeded the CIN (median 3. 2 ml/min, range 1. 6 - 11. 2, p < 0. 005) and Ccr (median 4. 0 ml/min, range 1. 7 - 15. 0, p < 0. 005). A positive correlation was found between the tubular clearances of creatinine (cationic pathway) and of total PAH (anionic pathway, r: 0. 72, p < 0. 02). In hemodialysis patients the clearance of total PAH (CPA: median 2. 0, range 0. 8 - 9. 6; CPD: median 3. 8, range 1. 7 - 15. 4) also exceeded the clearance of inulin (CPA: median 1. 5, range 0. 2 - 3. 4; CPD: median 2. 7, range 0. 9 - 4. 4) in {{the beginning and the end}} of the interdialytic interval (p < 0. 005). The CIN and the clearance of total PAH increased during the interdialytic interval, but the Ccr (CPA: median 2. 2, range 0. 4 - 8. 9, CPD: median 2. 9, range 1. 2 - 4. 6) remained stable. Thus, the change in tubular clearance of creatinine and PAH was opposite during the interdialytic interval: it increased for total PAH and decreased for creatinine. The CTPAH/CIN ratio in hemodialysis patients was lower than in peritoneal dialysis patients. In CPA it was median 1. 6 (range 1. 1 - 5. 6, p < 0. 05) and in CPD it was median 1. 7 (range 1. 1 - 5. 0, p < 0. 02) and in the peritoneal dialysis patients it was median 3. 6 (range 1. 5 - 9. 1). We conclude that tubular clearances contribute to the residual renal function in dialysis patients, but the tubular handling of anions and cations in relation to the residual GFR is different between peritoneal and hemodialysis patients. A difference in clearance of organic acids caused by the dialysis techniques may be an explanation for the differences in clinical outcome between the two dialysis modalitie...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-four female lambs were {{intoxicated}} with a diet {{contaminated with}} 2 ppm aflatoxin {{for a period}} of 37 d. Twelve lambs were maintained as the control group. After this period, the lambs were left for 35 d without aflatoxin in their feed. Performance, hematology and clinical immunology were examined in the intoxicated lambs. A non-significant decrease in body weight was observed in the intoxicated lambs during the intoxication period, whereas a significant decrease (P< 0. 001) in average daily gain was noted {{on the last day of}} intoxication and during the <b>clearance</b> <b>period.</b> No significant differences were observed in erythrocyte count, white blood cell count or differential leukocyte count between the groups. Bacteriostatic activity of the serum was lower in the intoxicated lambs, however, there was no effect on serum opsonic activity. Phagocytosis by the neutrophils was higher during the intoxication period and the levels of IgG were elevated in the intoxicated lambs. In vivo cellular immunity was assessed by intradermal injection of phytohemagglutinin; the response was lower during intoxication period. These results indicate that a lowering in the average daily gain was the most sensitive indicator of aflatoxicosis in lambs, and that the immune response was altered, which could render the animals more susceptible to infectious diseases...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the previously unexamined association between admissions to hospital with chronic disease {{and changes in}} all-cause health service utilization over time. Research Design: A cohort study examining the population of Western Australia with hospitalizations for chronic disease from 2002 to 2010. A “rolling ” <b>clearance</b> <b>period</b> is used to define “cardinal events, ” that is, a disease-specific diagnosis upon hospital admission, where such an event has not occurred in the previous 2 years. Changes {{in the rate of}} cardinal events associated with diag-noses of heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmo-nary disease, cataract with diabetes, asthma, and dialysis are examined. Health service utilization (defined as inpatient days or emergency department presentations) 6 years preceding and 4 years following such events is presented. Results: Cardinal events make up 40 %– 60 % of all chronic disease admissions. A previously undescribed ratchet effect following car-dinal events specifically associated with type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is observed. This involves a 2 - to 3 -fold increase in inpatient days and emergency department presentations that are sustained for at least 4 years. Conclusions: Cardinal events represent an important reference point to understand the impact of chronic disease on health service utilization. Events that herald such a marked transition in health service demand have not been previously described.

40|$|Effect of {{angiotensin}} II and norepinephrine {{on early}} growth response {{genes in the}} rat kidney. Angiotensin II (Ang II) has growth promoting effects {{in a number of}} cells and tissues in vitro. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the in vivo effect of Ang II on the renal expression of the early growth response genes c-fos, Egr- 1 and c-jun. Adult male rats underwent two basal 30 minute <b>clearance</b> <b>periods</b> during which the normal saline vehicle was infused into the left renal artery. Normal saline, Ang II (50 ng/kg/min), or Ang II plus the Ang II antagonist Sar 1 Gly 8 -angiotensin II (10 µg/kg/min) were then selectively infused into the left renal artery for two additional 30 minute periods. MAP was similar during basal and Ang II infusion. Hemodynamic effects (decrease in GFR and RPF and increase in renal vascular resistance) were observed only in the Ang II-infused left kidney allowing the right kidney to serve as a paired control for the effects of anesthesia and surgery. Significant increases in the expression of the early growth response genes Egr- 1 and c-fos, but not c-jun, were found in the Ang II-infused left kidney compared to the control right kidney. The simultaneous infusion of Ang II (50 ng/kg/min) and the Ang II antagonist Sar 1 Gly 8 -angiotensin II (10 µg/kg/min) blocked the increase in Egr- 1 and c-fos expression, demonstrating the specificity of the response to Ang II. To compare the effect of another renal vasoconstrictor on the expression of early growth response genes, norepinephrine (40 ng/kg/min) was infused into the left renal artery. This dose lacked a systemic pressor effect, produced vasoconstriction in the infused left kidney, but did not alter hemodynamics of the right kidney. Norepinephrine significantly increased Egr- 1 and c-fos and c-jun mRNA. In conclusion, intrarenal infusion of Ang II and norepinephrine induced early growth response genes in the kidney, an effect associated with cellular growth in other tissues. The similarity of the response to two different vasoconstrictors raises the possibility that early growth responses may be transduced, in part, from renal hemodynamic effects...|$|R
40|$|Renal {{function}} contributes markedly to {{the adequacy}} of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The best way to measure it in clinical practice has not been established. Ten stable CAPD patients with residual renal function were investigated to compare the GFR measured as inulin clearance (Cli) with the creatinine clearance (Clc), the urea clearance (Clu), and with 0. 5 (Clc + Clu). Thereafter, an analysis of whether the administration of cimetidine could improve the accuracy of these clearances was performed. Two <b>clearance</b> <b>periods</b> (CP) of 24 h were investigated. During CP- 2, patients received 400 mg cimetidine twice daily, for a total dose of 1200 mg. Two h before the urine and dialysate collection period, inulin was administered iv. Calculations were done for each CP for Cli, Clc, Clu, Clc-Cli, the Clc/Cli ratio, and the tubular secretion of creatinine (TSc). No differences between CP- 1 and CP- 2 were present for urinary excretion of volume and solutes, and clearance rates of inulin and urea. The median TSc decreased from 0. 71 mumol/min (range, - 0. 24 to 5. 90) in CP- 1 to 0. 30 mumol/min (range, - 0. 18 to 0. 64) in CP- 2 (P < 0. 05). Therefore, the median ratio of Clc/Cli decreased from 1. 23 (range, 0. 87 to 2. 20) in CP- 1 to 1. 11 (range, 0. 95 to 1. 51) in CP- 2 (P < 0. 05). The median overestimation of the Cli in CP- 1 by the Clc was 0. 90 mL/min (range, - 0. 28 to 3. 80) and by the 0. 5 (Clc + Clu) was 0. 30 (range, - 0. 67 to 1. 52). The median overestimation of Cli during cimetidine treatment in CP- 2 was 0. 43 mL/min (range, - 0. 21 to 1. 20). The range, in differences between Cli and Clc, in CP- 2 was smaller than that between Cli and 0. 5 (Clc + Clu) in CP- 1. The difference between the clearance rate of inulin and creatinine or the combined clearance rate of urea and creatinine was not influenced by {{the magnitude of the}} average GFR. It can be concluded that the administration of cimetidine improved the accuracy of measuring the GFR with the Clc in CAPD patient...|$|R
