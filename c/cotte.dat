5|$|The Palais Rohan (Rohan Palace) in Strasbourg is {{the former}} {{residence}} of the prince-bishops and cardinals of the House of Rohan, an ancient French noble family originally from Brittany. It is a major architectural, historical, and cultural landmark in the city. It was built next to Strasbourg Cathedral in the 1730s, from designs by Robert de <b>Cotte,</b> and is considered a masterpiece of French Baroque architecture. Since its completion in 1742, the palace has hosted a number of French monarchs such as Louis XV, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon and Joséphine, and Charles X.|$|E
5|$|La <b>Cotte</b> de St Brelade is a Palaeolithic site {{inhabited}} before {{rising sea}} levels transformed Jersey into an island. Jersey was a centre of Neolithic activity, {{as demonstrated by}} the concentration of dolmens. Evidence of Bronze Age and early Iron Age settlements can be found in many locations around the island. In June 2012 it was announced what could be Europe's largest hoard of Iron Age coins had been found in Grouville by two persons using metal detectors. The hoard may be worth up to £10 M. People had been searching for this treasure for 30 years. It was reported that the hoard weighed about three quarters of a tonne and could contain up to 50,000 Roman and Celtic coins. In 2012 the same two men had found 60 Iron Age coins in the same area.|$|E

5|$|The {{riverside}} façade {{is formed}} by the main residential bulk and the library wing on the west side, which offers a contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The {{main part of the}} façade is symmetrically arranged around an avant-corps of four columns with Corinthian capitals. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous triangular pediment, again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a semicircular pediment. That pediment was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost. The library wing {{was not part of the}} original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a row of houses on the current rue de Rohan. The architect, Robert de <b>Cotte,</b> was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk on an even grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main staircase to the left (east) of the apartment wing instead of the centre.|$|E

40|$|Neanderthal {{behaviour}} {{has formed}} a popular and debated field of research over the past decades. Within this debate {{the extent to which}} Neanderthals show symbolic behaviour, comparable to that of the Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH), has been an important subject. Artefacts associated with symbolic behaviour have been found within the Châtelperronian layer (authored by Neanderthals) at Grotte du Renne (France). However, the validity to interpret these as indicative of symbolic behaviour amongst Neanderthals is debated: post depositional processes are believed to have transported these artefacts from the superior Protoaurignacien layer (authored by AMH) into that of the Châtelperronian, and could also have transported Neanderthal skeletal remains from the underlying Mousterian layer. As the integrity of the Châtelperronian is generally challenged, and as at the site of Les <b>Cottés,</b> France, a Protoaurignacien, Châtelperronian and Mousterian layer are present, this thesis reconstructs what site formation processes might have taken place at Les <b>Cottés,</b> and how these site formation processes may have influenced the degree of integrity of the Châtelperronian layer. This is done by performing a fabric analysis on the Châtelperronian layer of Les <b>Cottés.</b> Within this analysis, the orientations of all elongated artefacts are used as indicators of the site formation processes that took place. Patterning within the orientations are used to distinguish between different types of site formation processes...|$|R

Some {{researchers}} {{claim that it}} was common at this time for genteel women to pluck these hairs, as they were considered unsightly. In 2007, French engineer Pascal <b>Cotte</b> announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and with visible eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps {{as a result of}} overcleaning. <b>Cotte</b> discovered the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made {{to the size of the}} Mona Lisa's face and the direction of her gaze. He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.|$|E

Clemens considered the plan too ambitious and asked de <b>Cotte's</b> assistant in Bonn, Benoît de Fortier, to revise the plan, reducing three of the wings to one storey, but leaving the garden wing with two. Clemens wrote to de Cotte: [...] "I realized that it would be quite useless to erect so large a building on that site, which is but a cannon shot from town…. For the most part my retinue returns to the city at night, and I keep near me only those who are absolutely necessary to serve me." ...|$|R
40|$|Les <b>Cottés</b> is Palaeolithic cave site {{located in}} the Vienne region in South-Western France. It is located near the Gartempe river. Nowadays {{it is a small}} river but in the past it {{influenced}} the environment in the valley. There is evidence that correlates the river to the site in the form of pebbles and flint but virtually nothing is known about the landscape shaped by the river during occupation of the cave. This thesis is an initial research and tries to comprehend the difficult fluvial landscape here. By mapping the fluvial history research questions can be answered regarding the influence of the environment in the Gartempe valley on human behaviour. With an augering transect eight different units were distinguished of fluvial depositions and erosion and showed the existence of two palaeochannels buried beneath the surface. The oldest channel had an infilling of peat and was studied {{in the form of a}} palynological research. The general picture, which consisted of Pinus and Betula, dated the infilling to the Allerød or Preboreal period. This was done by comparing it to several other sites in France which include the same environment. The local environment in this period shows that the channel got cut off and was not active anymore in this phase. There was still open water present but the accumulation of peat was in progress. The valley would have been characterised by wetland conditions. Two phases identified in this thesis could be of interest for the research at Les <b>Cottés.</b> One interpretation is that the terrace in front of the site is older than the research at Les <b>Cottés</b> and this means that the Pleistocene surface would be buried beneath current floodplain deposits. This terrace in front of the site could have been used as an overview point. The other interpretation is that the terrace was shaped after the occupation at Les <b>Cottes.</b> This would mean that the relative height difference between the cave and the site was very small. Both interpretations would have an impact on the archaeology. This shows that the Gartempe influences could have been bigger in the past...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Middle to Upper Palaeolithic {{transition}} {{is the key}} period for our understanding of Neanderthal and modern human interactions in Europe. The site of Les <b>Cottés</b> in south-west France {{is one of the}} rare sites with a complete and well defined sequence covering this transition period. We undertook an extensive radiocarbon dating program on mammal bone which allows us to propose a chronological framework of five distinct phases dating from the Mousterian to the Early Aurignacian at this site. We found that the Mousterian and Châtelperronian industries are separated from the overlying Protoaurignacian by a gap of approximately 1000 calendar years. Based on a comparison with Upper Paleolithic sites in Europe we see an overlap in the ages of Châtelperronian industries and Aurignacian lithic assemblages, which are usually associated with Anatomical Modern Humans, which is consistent with an acculturation at distance model for these late Neanderthals. The Proto and Early Aurignacian appear contemporaneous indicating that this transition was rapid in this region.

500|$|In 1727 Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan, {{bishop of}} Strasbourg since 1704 and {{cardinal}} since 1712, commissioned the architect Robert de <b>Cotte</b> {{to design the}} palace; deCotte provided initial plans the same year. Seven years prior, in 1720, Cardinal deRohan had already charged deCotte with renovation and embellishment works on his castle in Saverne, the predecessor of the current Rohan Castle. DeCotte had also previously designed the Hôtel du grand Doyenné, the first hôtel particulier in Louis Quinze style built in Strasbourg. The Palais Rohan {{was built on the}} site of the former residence of the bishop, the [...] "bishop's demesne", which is recorded since at least 1262.

2500|$|One long-standing {{mystery of}} the {{painting}} is why Mona Lisa features very faint eyebrows and apparently {{does not have any}} eyelashes. In October 2007, Pascal <b>Cotte,</b> a French engineer and inventor, says he discovered with a high-definition camera that Leonardo da Vinci originally did paint eyebrows and eyelashes. Creating an ultra-high resolution close-up that magnified Mona Lisas face 24 times, <b>Cotte</b> says he found a single brushstroke of a single hair above the left eye. [...] "One day I say, if I can find only one hair, only one hair of the eyebrow, I will have definitively the proof that originally Leonardo da Vinci had painted eyelash and eyebrow," [...] said <b>Cotte.</b> The engineer claims that other eyebrow hairs that potentially could have appeared on the painting may have faded or been inadvertently erased by a poor attempt to clean the painting. In addition, <b>Cotte</b> says his work uncovered proof that her hands were originally painted in a slightly different position than in the final portrait.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{reduction}} model on the retouched blades of layer US 04 (sup.) of Les <b>Cottés</b> was proposed. Reduction is the resharpening of an artefact {{to maintain a}} sharp, usable edge. It has been widely observed both in ethnographic studies as in archaeological cases. It served an argument in the Bordes-Binford debate on what caused the variability in Middle-Palaeolithic assemblages. Reduction is nowadays used to gain information on site functions, such as the use-life of tools, mobility, duration of occupation and raw material availability. In this thesis a model, based on typology, with different parameters was proposed. This model consists of three types of blades {{that are part of}} a continuum of lateral retouch. The site where the material originates from is Les <b>Cottés,</b> Vienne, France. This is a cave site with an excellent sequence covering both the Middle-Palaeolithic and the Upper- Palaeolithic. The layer where the material originates from is US 04 (sup.), which dates to the Aurignacian. Results have been obtained through measuring and classifying artefacts. Measurements were taken with a calliper and a protractor. The results were rather unexpected. Most of the parameters did not follow their hypothesis. A reduction model on the retouched blades could not be confirmed. Several arguments were given on what might have been the cause. Those were 1. methodological aspects, 2. wrong defining of the parameters (and blank selection beforehand), and 3. the abundant raw material in proximity of the site. The level of reduction was generally low and pieces had a short use-life. This would suggest a high mobility and a short occupation span, but the proximity of abundant raw material should be considered. Suggestions for an adjustment to the model and suggestions for further research were given. A reduction model could, at least in this study, not be validated, however it was shown that the gained knowledge from these models is contributing to solving important archaeological issues regarding site functions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to improve}} the {{chronology}} of {{the transition from the}} Middle to Upper Palaeolithic in France through the radiocarbon dating of bone collagen samples. This requires accurate calibration of the radiocarbon time scale for this time interval, reliable extraction of collagen from prehistoric bones and accurate AMS radiocarbon dating. The recent developments in radiocarbon calibration beyond 26, 000 cal BP, which have resulted in the formulation of an internationally agreed calibration curve spanning back to 50, 000 cal BP, are discussed in the introductory section of this thesis. The methodological section of this thesis presents the results of experiments undertaken to establish an optimal procedure for extracting collagen from bone samples for radiocarbon dating. The main objectives of these experiments were to remove contamination from the organic bone fractions, which generally results in younger ages, and to avoid the incorporation of exogenous carbon in the laboratory through careful cleaning of the equipment. In order to achieve these aims, a suite of bone pretreatment methods were adopted and the resulting collagen extracts were sent for dating to different laboratories. The radiocarbon ages obtained from two test bones cover large ranges, which fall significantly beyond measurement error. This may be due to differences in both pretreatment methods and in the set-ups of different AMS facilities. The research undertaken for the present thesis has allowed the author to establish a protocol of laboratory procedures that produces consistent ages for bone collagen older than 30, 000 cal BP This protocol was implemented at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI-EVA) and, in chapter 7 of the thesis, it is adopted to establish a chronological framework for the site of Les <b>Cottés</b> in France. This site has an almost uninterrupted sequence spanning from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic, including Mousterian, Châtelperronian and Aurignacian occupations. The AMS radiocarbon determinations obtained from bone collagen samples, pretreated according to the quality criteria developed in this thesis, accurately date not only the different human cultures which succeeded each other at Les <b>Cottés,</b> but also the climatic episodes and oscillations which characterized the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition. This case study demonstrates that AMS radiocarbon dating of mammal bone collagen can be reliably used for establishing the chronology of sites older than 30, 000 14 C years BP and with well-preserved deposits.

[...] Begun in 1689, construction was halted due to the War of the League of Augsburg; Jules Hardouin-Mansart resumed construction in 1699. Hardouin-Mansart continued working on the project until his death in 1708, at which time his brother-in-law, Robert de <b>Cotte,</b> finished the project (Blondel, 1752–1756; Marie, 1972, 1976; Nolhac, 1912–1913; Verlet, 1985; Walton, 1993). [...] It was to become the largest of the royal chapels at Versailles, and in fact the height of its vaulting alone was allowed to disturb the rather severe horizontality everywhere else apparent in the palace's roof-line, leading to the design being badly treated by some contemporaries at the time, most notably perhaps by the duc de Saint-Simon, who characterized it as an [...] "enormous catafalque". Nevertheless, the magnificent interior has been widely admired to the present day and served as inspiration for Luigi Vanvitelli when he designed the chapel for the Palace of Caserta (Defilippis, 1968).|$|E
40|$|The Protoaurignacian is {{considered}} a cultural proxy {{for one of the}} first expansions of anatomically modern humans across Europe. The stabilization of bladelet industries that characterizes this techno-complex is therefore often used as supporting evidence for the break from previous stone knapping traditions and also for the increase of human mobility through wider territories. Despite the cultural importance that bladelets have gained, a careful inter-regional comparison, stressing similarities and differences, has not yet been attempted. Moreover, the use of traditional typologies has blurred the morpho-metrical variability that characterizes lamellar tools. Here, a study has been carried out on retouched bladelets from three pivotal sites: Fumane (northeast Italy), Isturitz (southwest France), and Les <b>Cottés</b> (northern France). By using morphological, dimensional, and retouching attributes, and by evaluating the statistical significance of the main differences, the first detailed analysis of the variability of retouched bladelets within the Protoaurignacian has been documented. The results indicate that the features that best discriminate the bladelet assemblages are the presence and the relative variability of bladelets with convergent retouch, although a reassessment of existing studies and new methodological approaches are required to test the latter hypothesis. Throughout this paper, we demonstrate the merits of using a unified classification of retouched bladelets for comparing behavior in between groups distant in space. We hope that this paper will be a new incentive to develop unified taxonomies for the study of Early Upper Paleolithic lithics in Western Eurasia...|$|R

Geomagic Design X was used to center and align models around the origin. The data set consists of three-dimensional (3 D) models of experimentally produced lithic artifacts created using both expedient and refined photogrammetric setups and processing protocols. Source images for all models were captured using a 12. 1 megapixel Canon PowerShot SX 260 HS compact digital camera. In our expedient protocol, objects were placed on a wire stand. The photographer moved around the object, and captured photos using Auto mode. In our refined protocol, objects were placed on a rotating turntable under controlled lighting conditions. The camera was placed on a tripod. Shutter speed, f-stop, and ISO were set manually. This refined protocol is described in Porter, S. T., Roussel, M., & Soressi, M. (2016).
