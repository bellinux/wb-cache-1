Solar cooker parts are developed in-house and connected to water heating system compounded with evacuated tubes solar collector and storage tank. The circumference of cooker unit is incorporated with spiral stainless steel heat exchanger and annulus area of the pot is filled with PCM material. PCM releases heat at late evening and effective cooking up to 7 : 30 PM is noticed.

40|$|My {{objective}} in 1992 {{was to start}} a sustainable solar cooking and water pasteurization program solving Nepal’s ever health, environmental and energy problems. Solar cooking was not practiced at the time. My sucesful strategy is: find “champion” organization(s), create Awareness with public/private demonstrations, Build the infrastructure and do Continuous follow-up on programs each year (ABC). I also train how to use, design and fabricate solar cookers, water pasteurizers, dryers, heat-retaining boxes; advise organizations to become successful in solar energy projects, help start new NGO’s and businesses; identify reliable workshops producing quality solar devices on-time; and teach responsible ECO- tourism with trekking organizations and lodgekeepers. I designed a 400 gram solar backpack <b>cooker</b> <b>for</b> effective dissemination and a 3 kg collapsible parabolic (1 m) <b>cooker</b> <b>for</b> remote and rural households and trekking/expedition groups.
