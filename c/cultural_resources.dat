40|$|<b>Cultural</b> <b>resource</b> {{centers have}} been an ongoing and {{integral}} component to creating a more welcoming campus climate for Students of Color since its establishment in the 1960 s. While the racial dynamics may have changed, many of the challenges Students of Color faced on predominantly White campuses have not. Interestingly, <b>cultural</b> <b>resource</b> centers as safe spaces and advocacy spaces have evolved and expanded their missions beyond their traditional student populations. This study utilizes the Multi-contextual Model of Diverse Learning Environments (MMDLE) and organizational behavior theories to understand how <b>cultural</b> <b>resource</b> centers shape and are shaped by their current campus climates. Through an embedded case study design combining survey data, interviews, and document analyses, this study identifies the missions and organizational structures of <b>cultural</b> <b>resource</b> centers, {{as well as its}} interactions with the climate. Major findings include centers converging around an educational mission for a broad population with variations by center type in their areas of emphases. A categorization of institutional models emerged from the study resulting in the Taxonomy of <b>Cultural</b> <b>Resource</b> Centers in Higher Education, serving as a basic model to consider of multicultural, intercultural, and race-specific centers. The case studies revealed the importance of understanding institutional models within their context and the interplay of climate dimensions that serve to either support or hinder their ability to meet their missions. <b>Cultural</b> <b>resource</b> centers have evolved from serving their traditional populations yet the organizational structures to support their missions have not necessarily evolved with them. The case studies indicated a variety of approaches including institutions looking at the <b>cultural</b> <b>resource</b> centers in isolation and those that tried to fit the <b>cultural</b> <b>resource</b> centers within an organizational structure to support campus diversity efforts. The organizational behaviors of the institutions reflected the institutional context and approach to overall diversity efforts as well as highlighted the interplay between the dimensions of the climate. Strategizing for the future within conflicting notions of valuing diversity and rendering race invisible thus needs {{to take into account the}} evolving <b>cultural</b> <b>resource</b> centers as sites of expertise, education, and empowerment...|$|R

5|$|Ranchers grazed {{thousands}} of cattle {{on public land}} that would later {{become part of the}} park, and homesteaders farmed and ranched {{at the base of the}} Rincons, filing homestead applications from the 1890s through 1930. The remains of the former Freeman Homestead, established in 1929, lies along a nature trail in the RMD. The homestead is on the Arizona State Register of Historic Places. Manning Cabin, built in 1905 as a summer retreat for Levi Manning, a wealthy businessman and one-term mayor of Tucson, is part of the infrastructure at Manning Camp near Mica Mountain. Modified and restored after falling into disrepair, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. <b>Cultural</b> <b>resources</b> in the park include more than 450 archeological sites and more than 60 historic structures.|$|E

5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of <b>cultural</b> <b>resources</b> worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{have studied}} the {{prehistory}} of Iowa since the mid-19th century, when large American Indian mounds were first observed along the Mississippi. Early archaeologists such as S.V. Proudfit and Theodore Lewis documented large sites such as earthworks, mounds, and earthlodges. Truly systematic recording of Iowa sites began with Charles R. Keyes and Ellison Orr’s surveys and excavations beginning in the 1920s. Documenting hundreds of sites, often just before they disappeared under the plow, Keyes’ and Orr’s work {{led to the formation}} of the Iowa Archaeological Survey, the Iowa Archeological Society, and the designation of Effigy Mounds National Monument. After their deaths in 1951, the Survey was disbanded, and their efforts were continued by the University of Iowa’s Department of Sociology and Anthropology, which formed the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSA) in 1959. The OSA maintains an extensive list of more than 23,000 recorded archaeological sites in Iowa, and conducts survey and excavation across the state. Other institutions conducting archaeological research in Iowa include the State Historical Society of Iowa, the Iowa Archeological Society, the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, Grinnell College, Luther College, and private archaeological firms. Professional archaeologists in Iowa are represented by the Association of Iowa Archaeologists. Iowa archaeology grew dramatically beginning in the 1960s with the introduction of <b>Cultural</b> <b>Resources</b> Management legislation that required archaeological survey and excavation at many federal projects in Iowa.|$|E
