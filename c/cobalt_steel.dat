5000|$|While Stellite {{remains the}} {{material}} of choice for certain internal parts in industrial process valves (valve seat hardfacing), its use has been discouraged in nuclear power plants. In piping that can communicate with the reactor, tiny amounts of Stellite would be released into the process fluid and eventually enter the reactor. There the cobalt would be activated by the neutron flux in the reactor and become cobalt-60, a radioisotope with a five year half life that releases very energetic gamma rays. While not a hazard to the general public, about a third to a half of nuclear worker exposures could {{be traced to the}} use of Stellite and to trace amounts of <b>cobalt</b> in stainless <b>steels.</b> Replacements for Stellite have been developed by the industry, such as the Electric Power Research Institute's [...] "NOREM", that provide acceptable performance without cobalt. Since the United States nuclear power industry has begun to replace the Stellite valve seat hardfacing in the late 1970s and to tighten specifications of <b>cobalt</b> in stainless <b>steels,</b> worker exposures due to cobalt-60 have dropped significantly.|$|R

50|$|Today, {{among the}} single-point cutters used in mass {{production}} (such as of automotive parts), insert tools using carbide and ceramic far outnumber HSS or <b>cobalt</b> <b>steel</b> tools. In other machining contexts (e.g., job shops, toolrooms, and hobbyist practice), {{the latter are}} still well represented. An entire system of industry-standard notation has been developed to name each insert geometry type. The number of carbide and ceramic formulations continues to expand, and diamond is used more than ever before. Speeds, feeds, depths of cut, and temperatures at the cutting interface continue to rise (the latter counterbalanced by copious cooling via liquid, air, or aerosols), and cycle times continue to shrink. Competition among product manufacturers to lower the unit costs of production continually drives technological development by the tool manufacturers, {{as long as the}} costs of R&D and tooling purchase amortization are lower than the amount of money saved by productivity increases (e.g., wage expense reduction).|$|E
5000|$|These {{have a solid}} smooth {{cylindrical}} rotor, cast of a high coercivity magnetically [...] "hard" [...] <b>cobalt</b> <b>steel.</b> This {{material has}} a wide hysteresis loop (high coercivity), meaning once it is magnetized in a given direction, it requires a large reverse magnetic field to reverse the magnetization. The rotating stator field causes each small volume of the rotor to experience a reversing magnetic field. Because of hysteresis the phase of the magnetization lags behind the phase of the applied field. The result {{of this is that}} the axis of the magnetic field induced in the rotor lags behind the axis of the stator field by a constant angle δ, producing a torque as the rotor tries to [...] "catch up" [...] with the stator field. As long as the rotor is below synchronous speed, each particle of the rotor experiences a reversing magnetic field at the [...] "slip" [...] frequency which drives it around its hysteresis loop, causing the rotor field to lag and create torque. There is a 2-pole low reluctance bar structure in the rotor. As the rotor approaches synchronous speed and slip goes to zero, this magnetizes and aligns with the stator field, causing the rotor to [...] "lock" [...] to the rotating stator field.|$|E
5000|$|John Birch's guitar pickups had {{a unique}} {{construction}} {{compared to other}} pickups of the time. Normally, pickups use Alnico or Ceramic magnets, occasionally Samarium-Cobalt, as in Bill Lawrence's Fender SCN pickups, or even Neodymium, as in Q-Tuner's bass pickups. Birch used <b>cobalt</b> <b>steel</b> magnets, oversized {{to make up for}} their relative weakness as compared to Alnico. However, there are Magnum, Hyperflux, Multiflux and Biflux pickups with smaller Alnico magnets. (J1 Hyperflux/Biflux, J1 Magnum/Biflux and J2 Multiflux, built 1977, these guitars were all built shortly after John Diggins left JBG in 1977.) He also used much finer copper wire than most other pickups because finer wire allows more wire to be wound on the bobbins, which results in a more powerful sound. Finer than normal wire also accentuates high frequencies, though fine wire can have a [...] "thin" [...] sound if not compensated for in other ways, such as higher resistance, shorter coils, or more metal in the magnetic field to raise inductance. Also, he potted the pickups in black epoxy (the 1977 pickups with the alnico magnets were all potted with a cream-coloured epoxy) to fight microphonic feedback caused by unwanted vibrations of the copper wire. The epoxy keeps the wire from moving. The covers to the pickups were stainless steel. Finally, Birch used a row of 9 instead of 6 balance screws as polepieces to create a broader area for the pickup to sense the vibrating string. With Fender single coils or Gibson humbuckers, the strings each have an individual polepiece. However, if the player bends a string, that string can move over an area where there is no pole, and the sound will get weaker.|$|E

[...] On the basis of parallelogram approximations analytical models of the circumferential-flux hysteresis motor have been given. The motor field equations are then solved, to predict the terminal quantities, using the digital B-H loop modelling. The air-gap power of the hysteresis motor is studied as a function of coercive force, remanent flux density, saturated relative permeability and unsaturated relative permeability of the hysteresis material. A series of tests were carried out using 17 % <b>cobalt</b> <b>steel</b> hysteresis rotor. The reasonably close agreement between the terminal quantities predicted form the digital simulation and those measured experimentally validates the usefulness of digital simulation of the hysteresis motor...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{bearings}} are {{the subject}} of a new NASA Lewis Research Center and U. S. Army thrust with significant industry participation, and cooperation with other Government agencies. The NASA/Army emphasis is on high-temperature applications for future gas turbine engines. Magnetic bearings could increase the reliability and reduce the weight of these engines by eliminating the lubrication system. They could also increase the DN (diameter of bearing times the rpm) limit on engine speed and allow active vibration cancellation systems to be used, resulting in a more efficient, "more electric" engine. Finally, the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) program, a joint Department of Defense/industry program, identified a need for a high-temperature (1200 F) magnetic bearing that could be demonstrated in their Phase III engine. This magnetic bearing is similar to an electric motor. It has a laminated rotor and stator made of <b>cobalt</b> <b>steel.</b> Wound around the stator's circumference are a series of electrical wire coils which form a series of electric magnets that exert a force on the rotor. A probe senses the position of the rotor, and a feedback controller keeps it centered in the cavity. The engine rotor, bearings, and casing form a flexible structure with many modes. The bearing feedback controller, which could cause some of these modes to become unstable, could be adapted to varying flight conditions to minimize seal clearances and monitor the health of the system...|$|E

Laser micro-hole drilling service provides access to world leading precision hole drilling technology. This service {{can be used for}} R&D through to full production. Minimum micro-hole sizes can be as low as 1 micron in thin materials. For micro-holes above 20 microns in, we can use proprietary treppaning technology to generate micro-holes of unsurpassed roundness with controlled taper. Using a variety of IR, visible and UV sources, we select the correct wavelength and pulse duration, develop the laser micro-hole drilling process and produce the parts. Numbers of micro-holes per part can range from one to tens of thousands. Typical quantities of parts range from one-off for R&D, to tens of thousands per month. Microdrills are typically made of either <b>cobalt</b> <b>steel</b> or micrograin tungsten carbide. The steel drills are less expensive and easier to grind but are not as hard or strong as the tungsten carbide drills. The drill point angle is based on the material to be drilled. The normal point angle is 118 degrees and 135 degrees is used for hard materials. The larger included point angle provides more strength at the drill pointdameter. Microdrilling has one major disadvantage because of the drill geometry. Because of the drill point, a flat-bottomed hole can not be produced.

40|$|Purpose: The {{effects of}} {{relevant}} metallurgical factors on the structure, fracture mode and {{properties of the}} high cobalt and cobalt free maraging steel has been studied. The aim was to better understand structure-property relations and enhance mechanical properties of the steels. To provide data needed for production and manufacturing technology, the high temperature deformability using physical simulation method was used. Design/methodology/approach: To study structure-property relation, broad range of the experimental techniques was used: quantitative metallography, X-ray diffraction phase analysis, transmission electron microscopy and SEM fractography. The flow properties {{in the range of}} hot working processes were determined by physical simulation approach, using Gleeble 3800 system. Findings: The cobalt-free maraging steel proved to be a valuable structural steel. At much higher fracture toughness it had only about 100 MPa lower yield stress, compared to that of high <b>cobalt</b> <b>steel.</b> Fracture surface morphologies were highly dependent on the steel grade and type of the mechanical test. The hot stress-strain characteristics were established for cobalt free maraging steel and compared to that of a stainless steel. Research limitations/implications: To fully evaluate potential field of applications, deeper comparative studies of the high cobalt and cobalt-free maraging steels are needed, particularly fracture modes and service properties of some parts. Practical implications: Very high mechanical properties and fracture toughness values obtained for the steels studied, make them suitable for advanced structural applications. The studies on the hot deformation behaviour of the steels are of practical value for the hot working process development. Originality/value: Detailed evaluation of the metallurgical purity, microstructure and fracture modes, allowed for better understanding of the microstructure-property relationships in selected high strength steels.

40|$|NASA and the Army are {{currently}} exploring {{the possibility of}} using magnetic bearings in gas turbine engines. The use of magnetic bearings in gas turbine engines could increase the reliability by eliminating the lubrication system. The use of magnetic bearings could also increase the speed {{and the size of the}} shafts in the engine, thus reducing vibrations and possibly eliminating third bearings. Magnetic bearings can apply forces to the shafts and move them so that blade tips and seals do not rub. This could be part of an active vibration cancellation system. Also, whirling (displacing the shaft center line) may delay rotating stall and increase the stall margin of the engine. Magnetic bearings coupled with an integral starter generator could result in a more efficient 'more electric' engine. The IHPTET program, a joint DOD-industry program, has identified a need for a high temperature, (as high as 1200 F), magnetic bearing that could be demonstrated in a phase m engine. A magnetic bearing is similar to an electric motor. The magnetic bearing has a laminated rotor and stator made out of <b>cobalt</b> <b>steel.</b> The stator has a series of coils of wire wound around it.

The magnetic bearing can only pull and is basically unstable before active control is applied The engine shafts, bearings, and case form a flexible structure which contain a large number of modes.
