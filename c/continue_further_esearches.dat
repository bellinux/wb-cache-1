40|$|Abstract [...] This urvey is {{concerned}} with academic and clinical researches related {{to the problems of}} gas embolism in the human body which have commonly been regarded as a dreaded complication of a variety of surgical, therapeutic and diagnostic technics. The gas emboli may be found in the human body through surgery, decompression, transfusion of oxygenerated blood, and anesthesia, etc. The survey indicates that the cases so far investigated can be classi-fied into those in the cardiovascular, muscalar, respiratory, and reproductive systems {{and other parts of the}} human body. Most of the existing literature deals with detection, identification, prevention and treatment procedures. No apparent effort has been made on the study of their dynamic behavior in the blood, interstitial f uids and organs where they are formed. An attempt is made to prompt <b>further</b> <b>esearch</b> in the field of embolus dynamics by describing what needs to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues for}} the use of {{contrasts}} to test a priori interaction hypotheses in 2 -way analysis of variance designs. It focuses on 3 underused types of interaction contrast tests: a "matching " pattern for cognate levels of row and column factors; the "qualitative quadratic, " for monotonic profiles of means in the same direction but with opposed concavities; and a "differential curvilinearity " test for differ-ences in the curvature of two profiles with the same direction of concavity. The circumstances that best capitalize on the potential advantages of a priori contrast tests are indicated, and an effect size measure for contrasts is presented. Investi-gators are urged to examine residuals after accounting for the variation attributable to the chosen contrast for patterns that may provide hints for more textured hy-potheses in <b>further</b> <b>esearch.</b> If a posteriori contrasts are used, their effect sizes should be noted. Contrasts are widely recognized as a useful tool for analyzing patterns of systematic variation between means within an analysis of variance (ANOVA; Har...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} compares seven approaches {{from the}} literature to the selection of part types for simultaneous production over the next time horizon. A flexible approach to the selection of part types and the simultaneous determination ftheir mix ratios so as to balance aggregate machine workloads i presented. Constraints on tool magazine capacity are considered. Simulation studies are conducted on realistic, detailed models of flexible flow systems (FFSs) configured as pooled machines of equal sizes. The simulated settings are constructed toevaluate the impact of such factors as blocking, transportation, buffer utiliza-tions, and fixture requirements and limitations of various types. One {{of the goals of}} this study is to encourage industry to relax, for those FMS types for which the procedure isappropriate, what is essentially an artificial constraint: hat tool changing be isolated in time, to a period between batches. For other types of FMSs, batching may be appropriate. The results indicate that using the flexible approach enables the system to be more highly utilized. It is also observed that the batching approaches tend to require more fixtures of each type than the flexible approach. The system utilizations for the batching approaches seem to be more sensitive to restrictions on the number of fixtures of each type. <b>Further</b> <b>esearch</b> needs are also discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{review article}} {{concerns}} amethodology for solving numerically, for engineering purposes, bound-ary and initial-boundary value problems by a peculiar approach characterized bythe following features: the continuous formulation iscentered on integral equations {{based on the}} combined use of single-layer and double-layer sources, so that he integral operator {{turns out to be}} symmetric with respect to a suit-able bilinear form. The discretization is performed either on a variational basis or by a Galerkin weighted residual procedure, the interpolation and weight functions being chosen so that the variables in the approximate formulation are generalized variables in Prager's ense. As main consequences of the above provisions, symmetry is exhibited by matrices with {{a key role in the}} algebraized versions; some quadratic forms have a clear energy meaning; variational properties characterize the solutions and other esults, invalid in traditional boundary element methods enrich the theory underlying the compu-tational applications. The present survey outlines recent heoretical nd computational developments of the title methodology with particular reference to linear elasticity, elastoplasticity, fracture mechanics, time-dependent problems, variational pproaches, singular integrals, approximation issues, sensitivity analysis, coupling of boundary and finite elements, and computer implementations. Areas and aspects which at present require <b>further</b> <b>esearch</b> are identified, and comparative assessments are attempted with respect to traditional boundary integral-elements.
