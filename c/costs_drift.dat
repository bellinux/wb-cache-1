Expendable {{instruments for}} both shipboard and aircraft use were developed which yield moderate {{accuracy and precision}} at a low or moderate unit cost and which may be deployed by less trained personnel on less specialized platforms both in more extreme environmental conditions and while underway.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is dedicated}} to study the modeling of drift control in foreign exchange reserves management and design the fast algorithm of statistical inference with its application in high dimensional data analysis. The thesis has two parts. The first topic involves the modeling of foreign exchange reserve management as an drift control problem. We show that, under certain conditions, the control band policies are optimal for the discounted <b>cost</b> <b>drift</b> control problem and develop an algorithm to calculate the optimal thresholds of the optimal control band policy. The second topic involves the fast computing algorithm of partial distance covariance statistics with its application in feature screening in high dimensional data. We show that an O(n log n) algorithm for {{a version of the}} partial distance covariance exists, compared with the O(n^ 2) algorithm implemented directly accordingly to its definition. We further propose an iterative feature screening procedure in high dimensional data based on the partial distance covariance. This procedure enjoys two advantages over the correlation learning. First, an important predictor that is marginally uncorrelated but jointly correlated with the response can be picked by our procedure and thus entering the estimation model. Second, our procedure is robust to model mis- specification. Ph. D...|$|R

Consumption and leisure respond asymmetrically to a rise and {{a decline in}} trend inflation. As a result, an increase in the variance of shocks to the trend inflation process decreases welfare not only by increasing the volatilities of consumption and leisure, but also by decreasing their average levels.

40|$|A {{directional}} jet drift chamber with PAD readout {{is proposed}} here which can select vertex originated muons {{within a given}} time window and eliminate those muons which primarily originate upstream, using only a PAD readout. Drift time provides the Z-coordinate, {{and the center of}} gravity of charge distribution provides the r-{psi} coordinates. Directionality at the trigger level is obtained by the timing measurement from the PAD hits within a given time window. Because of the long drift time between the bunch crossings, a muon collider enables one to choose a drift distance in the drift chamber as long as 50 cm.

It is very important to set up reasonable soil Pressure {{in the chamber}} for controlling the ground settlement, promoting the peed of drift and lowering the <b>cost</b> of <b>drifting.</b> Take some subway tunnel for example, and carry out the 3 D finite element simulation. In order to investigate the influence on ground settlement from soil pressure in the chamber, take 15 % of the progressive increase in earth pressure to simulate over-balance conditions and also take 15 % of the progressive decrease in earth pressure to simulate under-balance conditions. The results indicated that while the soil pressure achieves equilibrium, the swell and the settlement are all small. While over-equilibrium, the swell increases, on the contrary, the settlement increases while under-equilibrium. So, a good control over the soil pressure {{is one of the most}} effective therapies for decreasing the ground settlement...|$|R

40|$|Drift is an {{important}} issue that impairs the reliability of gas sensing systems. Sensor aging, memory effects and environmental disturbances produce shifts in sensor responses that make initial statistical models for gas or odor recognition useless after a relatively short period (typically few weeks). Frequent recalibrations are needed to preserve system accuracy. However, when recalibrations involve numerous samples they become expensive and laborious. An interesting and lower <b>cost</b> alternative is <b>drift</b> counteraction by signal processing techniques. Orthogonal Signal Correction (OSC) is proposed for drift compensation in chemical sensor arrays. The performance of OSC is also compared with Component Correction (CC).

To this end, we study, in this paper, a challenging problem that mining from multi-label data streams with limited labeling resource.

An UAV platform does not derogate to this need, but its payload has to be lighter than this installed onboard so the manufacturer needs to find an alternative to heavy sensors and navigation systems. For the georeferencing of these data, a possible solution could be to replace the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) by a camera and record the optical flow. The different frames would then be processed thanks to photogrammetry so as to extract the External Orientation Parameters (EOP) and, therefore, the path of the camera. The major advantages of this method called Visual Odometry (VO) is low <b>cost,</b> no <b>drifts</b> IMU-induced, option for the use of Ground Control Points (GCPs) such as on airborne photogrammetry surveys. In this paper we shall present a test bench designed to assess the reliability and accuracy of the attitude estimated from VO outputs.

We have also developped a methodology applied to this test bench for the calibration of the external parameters and the computation of the surveyed point coordinates.

40|$|Firms are {{coping with}} a {{competitive}} scenario characterized by quick changes produced by internationalization, concentration, restructuring, technological innovation processes and financial market crisis. On the one hand market enlargement have increased the number and the segmentation of customers and have raised the number of competitors, {{on the other hand}} technological innovation has reduced product life cycle. So firms have to adjust their management models to this scenario, pursuing customer satisfaction and respecting cost constraints. In a context where price is a variable fixed by the market, firms have to switch from the cost measurement logic to the cost management one, adopting target costing methodology. The target costing process is a price driven, customer oriented profit planning and cost management system. It works, in a cross functional way, from the design stage throughout all the product life cycle and it involves the entire value chain. The process implementation needs a costing methodology consistent with the cost management logic. The aim of the paper is to focus on Activity Based Costing (ABC) application to target costing process. So: -it analyzes target costing logic and phases, basing on a literary review, in order to highlight the costing needs related to this process; -it shows, through a numerical example, how to structure a flexible ABC model â€“ characterized by the separation between variable, fixed in the short and fixed costs - that effectively supports target costing process in the <b>cost</b> measurement phase (<b>drifting</b> <b>cost</b> determination) and in the target cost alignment; -it points out the effectiveness of the Activity Based Costing as a model of cost measurement applicable to the supplier choice and as a support for supply cost management which have an important role in target costing process. The activity based information allows a firm to optimize the supplier choice by following the method of minimizing the total cost of ownership (TCO). Moreover the activity based analyses reveals the opportunities for rationalizing the supply related activities and containing costs and it enables the effective involvement of the supplier in the process of target costing when he provides activity based information on the costs sustained to produce the product/service: the purchaser can evaluate the impact, in terms of cost, of the activities requested of the supplier and, as a result, he has the chance to rationalize these activities by reducing their number or intensity and enables the effective involvement of the supplier in the process of target costing. The paper gives a contribution in the advancement of costing methodologies applicable to the target costing, proposing the use of a flexible model that supports the decision process according to different time horizons so that effectively supports target costing. The model is suitable for production characterized by high complexity in terms of number and intensity of activitie...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the range of}} coverage options available to TopSat like small satellites, both singly and in a small constellation. TopSat is a low-cost, high resolution and image quality, optical small satellite, due for launch in October 2004. In particular, the paper considers the use of tuned, repeat ground track orbits to improve coverage for selected ground targets, {{at the expense of}} global coverage. TopSat is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of small satellites for high value remote sensing missions. It is a 108 kg, sun-synchronous satellite, designed to provide 2. 5 m resolution imagery direct to users {{in the vicinity of the}} imaged area. Its objectives are to demonstrate the capability to cost performance available from small satellites, the utility of direct reception of remotely sensed imagery, and the affordability of constellations and individually owned assets. A description of the satellite, and update on the development and flight build of the satellite is given, as of June 2003. Two coverage improving augmentations to the TopSat satellite are discussed, namely the addition of a propulsion system and more capable attitude actuators. With limited orbit control, achievement and maintenance of tuned orbits, and phasing of a constellation within orbits, become practicable. TopSat is an agile small satellite, allowing boresight reorientation required for slews during imaging. The capability for performing multiple images in a single target pass is considered, with the existing and improved torque actuator implementations. Similar options for performing stereo imaging with 2 formation flying TopSats are outlined. Reconfiguration of repeat ground track orbits for a single satellite is analysed in terms of fuel <b>cost</b> and <b>drift</b> orbit options. A one day repeat orbit case is presented which would allow daily coverage of a fixed target, with orbit reconfiguration required to allow global access. A typical mission for such a satellite is summarised, along with practical requirements for the propulsion system. Coverage options for constellations of between 2 and 4 satellites are then also scrutinised, with fuel estimates for the most promising options explored. Again, the benefits that could be achieved by using repeat ground track orbits are weighed against the fuel requirements, to maintain and reconfigure such a constellation. The TopSat mission is a collaboration between four UK partners. QinetiQ are leading the mission and providing data handling and ground segment elements. Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) are developing the camera, Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) are providing the bus, and InfoTerra are responsible for developing potential data markets.

The ASC SCOUT model is based on a self-propelled, GPS-positioned, autonomous surface craft that can be pre-programmed, autonomous, or directed in real time. Each vessel can communicate wirelessly with deployment vessels and other similar buoys directly or via satellite. Engineering options for short or longer term power requirements are considered, in addition to future options for improved energy delivery systems. Methods of reducing buoy drift and position-maintaining energy requirements for self-locating buoys are also discussed, based on the potential of incorporating traditional maritime solutions to these problems. We here include discussion of the advanced Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) communications draft protocol which offers improved wireless communication capabilities underwater, to adjacent vessels, and to satellites. DTN is particularly adapted for noisy or loss-prone environments, thus it improves reliability. In addition to existing buoy communication via commercial satellites, a growing network of small satellites known as PICOSATs can be readily adapted to provide low-cost communications nodes for buoys. Coordination with planned vessel Automated Identification Systems (AIS) and International Maritime Organization standards for buoy and vessel notificat- - ion systems are reviewed and the legal framework for deployment of autonomous surface vessels is considered...|$|R
40|$|In {{this era}} of the Internet of Things and Big Data, a {{proliferation}} of connected devices continuously produce massive amounts of fast evolving streaming data. There {{is a need to}} study the relationships in such streams for analytic applications, such as network intrusion detection, fraud detection and financial forecasting, amongst other. In this setting, it is crucial to create data mining algorithms that are able to seamlessly adapt to temporal changes in data characteristics that occur in data streams. These changes are called concept drifts. The resultant models produced by such algorithms should not only be highly accurate and be able to swiftly adapt to changes. Rather, the data mining techniques should also be fast, scalable, and efficient in terms of resource allocation. It then becomes important to consider issues such as storage space needs and memory utilization. This is especially relevant when we aim to build personalized, near-instant models in a Big Data setting. This research work focuses on mining in a data stream with concept drift, using an online bagging method, with consideration to the memory utilization. Our aim is to take an adaptive approach to resource allocation during the mining process. Specifically, we consider metalearning, where the models of multiple classifiers are combined into an ensemble, has been very successful when building accurate models against data streams. However, little work has been done to explore the interplay between accuracy, efficiency and utility. This research focuses on this issue. We introduce an adaptive metalearning algorithm that takes advantage of the memory utilization <b>cost</b> of concept <b>drift,</b> in order to vary the ensemble size during the data mining process. We aim to minimize the memory usage, while maintaining highly accurate models with a high utility. We evaluated our method against a number of benchmarking datasets and compare our results against the state-of-the art.

We aimed to achieve high ROI without compromising on the accuracy of the result. Our experimental results indicate that we achieved this goal...|$|R
40|$|The diatom Fragilariopsis kerguelensis and the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis {{antarctica}} play {{an important}} role in the phytoplankton community in the Southern Ocean and contribute to a great extent to the global primary production. At the Alfred-Wegener-Institute in Bremerhaven Germany both species are kept by means of serial subculturing for research purposes. Because of several disadvantages concerning serial subculturing such as high <b>costs,</b> time, genetic <b>drift</b> and possible contamination, several cryoprotective strategies were tested in this study to cryopreserve these algal species. Cryopreservation is the storage of organic material in liquid Nitrogen (LN 2) at - 196 °C. Most common fluids such as algal medium and other intracellular fluids in algae form ice when being frozen, which harms the cells during cryopreservation. Therefore special strategies must be applied to ensure that after having thawed the samples the algae will recover and grow. These strategies include the treatment with cryoprotective agents (CPA) before freezing, the freezing and thawing method and the post-cryopreservation treatment. In this study a combination of penetrating (p) and non-penetrating (np) CPA were tested as well as the single application of npCPA when plunging the samples directly into LN 2. After thawing, both algal species showed viability for each of the CPA treatments proved by vital staining. In some cases there was a statistical significant difference in viability between samples treated with only npCPA and those treated with npCPA+pCPA. It was revealed for the colony-forming P. antarctica samples and for F kerguelensis samples that directly after thawing the differences in mean viability levels were significant between the methyl cellulose (MC) and the fish gelatine (FG) treated samples, the two npCPA. The highest percent numbers of living cells of F. kerguelensis were reached when using MC as npCPA. For the colony-forming P. antarctica samples the combination of a pCPA with MC led to the highest mean viability values. Whereas for the attached aggregates (AA) P. antarctica samples, those treated with a combination of methanol and FG (MeOH+FG) resulted in the highest mean viability values. Two weeks after thawing, in almost all samples viable cells were observed in the vital staining analysis. However four weeks after thawing, no algae growth was recorded. Instead, growth of bacteria especially in all FG treated samples was observed. It was presumed that the main factor, having an impact on recovery and growth, was the behaviour of algae being dependent on seasons. Results of other studies and a self-implemented preliminary study showed good growth despite bacteria when performed at another time than the Antarctic winter season...|$|R
