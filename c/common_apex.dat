50|$|The tent of {{this species}} is among the largest built by any tent caterpillar. It is {{constructed}} in the crotch of the host tree and is typically oriented with the broadest wall facing the southeast {{to take advantage of}} the morning sun. The caterpillars typically add silk to the surface of the structure at the onset of each of their daily activity periods. The silk is laid down under slight tension and it eventually contracts, causing the newly spun layer of silk to separate from the next layer. The tent thus consists of discrete layers separated by gaps within which the caterpillars rest. The tent has openings to allow them to enter and exit.

40|$|Apex predators play a {{key role}} in {{ecosystem}} stability across environments but their numbers in general are decreasing. By contrast, European catfish (Silurus glanis), the European freshwater apex predator, is on the increase. However, studies concerning apex predators in freshwaters are scarce in comparison to those in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The present study combines stomach content and stable isotope analyses with diet preferences of catfish to reveal its impact on the ecosystem since stocking. Catfish niche width is extremely wide in comparison to the typical model predator, Northern pike (Esox lucius). Catfish and pike have different individual dietary specialization that results in different functional roles in coupling or compartmentalizing distinct food webs. The role of both species in the ecosystem is irreplaceable due to multiple predator effects. The impact of catfish is apparent across the entire aquatic ecosystem, but herbivores are the most affected ecological group. The key feature of catfish, and probably a <b>common</b> feature of <b>apex</b> predators in general, is utilization of several dietary strategies by individuals within a population: long-term generalism or specialization and also shortterm specialization. Catfish, similar to other large-bodied apex predators, have two typical features: enormous generalism and adaptability to new prey sources...|$|R
40|$|Industrially-manufactured, {{spiral bevel}} gears with {{complementary}} tooth-end surfaces as a rule have reduced tooth thickness and subsequently reduced strength at the tooth ends. The weakened tooth ends of octoid gearing are generally produced by machining, inevitably resulting in a certain lengthwise dimensional discrepancy and slight profile difference. This in turn very often leads to systematic breakage of teeth. Serious, systematic damage occurs irrespective of the transmission tightness of the outer or inner tooth ends. Gear manufacturers currently use several solutions to avoid such breakages, including artificial inclination near to the teeth or deliberately reducing the back or outer cone angle and increasing the front or root cone angle. This paper outlines an improved design of gear blanks, with optimised tooth ends. Our research concluded {{that it is possible}} to optimise rectangular-generated, spiral bevel pinion/gear pairs with constant tooth height and a <b>common</b> pitch cone <b>apex.</b> We can successfully achieve this through recalculation of the gear blanks, without any changes in the flank geometry or tooth-cutting process. Thus the gear pair with optimised tooth ends can be cut without interference to the customary tooth-cutting process. To prove the concept, an example of the recalculation is provided. These improvements result in increased tooth strength, simplification of the gear blank geometry and more suitable geometry for modern machining, as well as a smaller outer diameter of the gear...|$|R

5000|$|Where a {{junction}} {{forms in}} a tree and bark is incorporated into the join, this {{is referred to as}} an 'included bark junction' or 'bark inclusion'. A common cause of bark being incorporated into the junction is that the junction is braced by the touching of branches or stems set above that junction (in arboriculture, these branch interactions are termed 'natural braces'). Such included bark junctions can be substantially weaker in strength than normal tree forks, and can become a significant hazard {{in a tree}}, particularly when the bracing branches are shaded out or pruned out of the tree.

The most reliable measure of trunk deformity is the chin-brow vertical angle. Materials and Methods: Thirty-four ankylosing spondylitis patients with cervical ankylosis who had underwent pedicle sub-traction extension osteotomy for correction of kyphotic deformity were studied.

At the higher Mach numbers, the wave drag is always increased. If, in addition to a constant volume, a given maximum thickness-chord ratio is imposed, then canting the two surfaces results in higher wave drag at all Mach numbers.

A narrow jet from the northern source L 1448 C(N) {{was observed in}} the SiO and the high-velocity CO. The jet consists of a chain of emission knots with an inter-knot spacing of ~ 2 " (500 AU) and a semi-periodic velocity variation. The innermost pair of knots, which are significant in the SiO map but barely seen in the CO, are located at ~ 1 " (250 AU) from the central source, L 1448 C(N). Since the dynamical time scale for the innermost pair is only ~ 10 yr, SiO may have been formed in the protostellar wind through the gas-phase reaction, or been formed on the dust grain and directly released into the gas phase by means of shocks. It is found that the jet is extremely active with a mechanical luminosity of ~ 7 L_sun, which {{is comparable to the}} bolometric luminosity of the central source (7. 5 L_sun). The mass accretion rate onto the protostar derived from the mass-loss rate is ~ 10 ^{- 5 } M_sun/yr. Such a high mass accretion rate suggests that the mass and the age of the central star are 0. 03 - 0. 09 M_sun and (4 - 12) x 10 ^ 3 yr, respectively, implying that the central star is in the very early stage of protostellar evolution.

The present paper discusses this problem under the restrictions that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and that the blade rows consist of an infinite number of infinitely thin blades so that axially symmetric flow is assumed. It is shown, in general, that the velocity components in a plane through the turbomachine axis may be expressed in terms of the angular momentum and the leading-edge blade force normal to the stream surfaces. The relation is a nonlinear differential equation to which analytic solutions may be obtained conveniently only after the introduction of linearizing assumptions. A quite accurate linearization is effected through assuming an approximate shape of the stream surfaces in certain nonlinear terms. The complete linearized solution for the axial turbomachine is given in such form that blade loading, blade shape, distribution of angular momentum, or distribution of total head may be prescribed. Calculations for single blade rows of aspect ratio 2 and 2 / 3 are given for a radius ratio of 0. 6. They indicate that the process of formation of the axial velocity profile may extend both upstream and downstream of a high-aspect-ratio blade row, while for low aspect ratios the major portion of the three-dimensional flow occurs within the blade row itself. When the through-flow velocity varies greatly from its mean value, the simple linearized solution does not describe the flow process adequately and a more accurate solution applicable to such conditions is suggested. The structure of the first-order linearized solution for the axial turbomachine suggested a further approximation employing a minimizing operation. The simplicity of this solution permits the discussion of three interesting problems: Mutual interference of neighboring blade rows in a multistage axial turbomachine, solution for a single blade row of given blade shape, and the solution for this blade row operating at a condition different from the design condition. It is found that the interference of adjacent blade rows in the multistage turbomachine may be neglected when the ratio of blade length to the distance between centers of successive blade rows is 1. 0 or less. For values of this ratio in excess of 3. 0, the interference may be an important influence. The solution for the single blade row indicated that, for the blade shape considered, the distortion of the axial velocity profile caused by off-design operation is appreciably less for low- than for high-aspect-ratio blades. To obtain some results for a mixed-flow turbomachine comparable with those for the axial turbomachine as well as to indicate the essential versatility of the method of linearizing the general equations, completely analogous theoretical treatment is given for a turbomachine whose inner and outer walls are concentric cones with <b>common</b> <b>apex</b> and whose flow is that of a three-dimensional source or sink. A particular example for a single rotating blade row is discussed where the angular momentum is prescribed similarly to that used in the examples for the axial turbomachine...|$|E
