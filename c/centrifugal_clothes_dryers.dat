30|$|Residential <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> were {{available}} in the early 1940 s; however, they were expensive, and most families could not afford them. In 1955, only 10 % of US households had one (Morris 2017). After 1955, companies were able to sell automatic <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> {{at a much lower}} price; therefore, <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> sales increased considerably. According to the United States Energy Information Administration (2009), 79.4 % of US households have a <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> (63.2 % electric <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer,</b> 15.3 % gas <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer,</b> and 0.9 % propane <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer).</b> The averaged number of annual dryer loads varies in different households, but is estimated to be 439 (McCowan et al. 2015). However, using a <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> is a habit peculiar to the US and Canada (81 % in 2009; Statista 2017). Many Europeans and Asians who can afford to purchase <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> still tend to hang clothes up to dry. It is possible that US consumers prefer convenience and time saving and worry that clothes hung outdoor will absorb environmental dust and/or car exhausts. Many people in other countries, however, consider having a <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> a waste of energy and money. In addition, most households do not have enough room for both a washer and a dryer.|$|R
30|$|To {{address this}} issue, new <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> technologies, such as heat pumps, was {{introduced}} in Europe for more than 10  years (Meyers et al. 2010) and have recently become available in the US market (Evergreen Economics 2016). Heat pump <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> cool the warm, moist air produced in the drying process and condense the moisture into water. The cool, dry air is then heated and re-circulated back into the drum. Depending on the model, the manufacturers claim that heat pump dryers use 25 – 70 % less energy than the average electric dryer. Consumer Reports (2015) tested a heat pump <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> {{and found that the}} heat pump <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> used about 40 % less electricity, but took 112  min to dry a 12 -pound load, 38  min longer than the time used in a regular <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer.</b> Heat pump <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> are not popular among US consumers, with a market share of almost zero (Evergreen Economics 2016). Meyers et al. (2010) found that heat pump <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> had economic benefits only for households with high <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> usage (over 700 cycles per year), which were 6 % of the sample households, or for households in regions with high electricity price (i.e., the Northeast of the US and California) after about 500 cycles of usage per year. Another study, conducted by Martin et al. (2016), found that although the heat pump <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> used less electricity than a conventional dryer, it released significantly more heat than a conventional dryer, leading to an increase of energy used to cool the house.|$|R
5000|$|The {{environmental}} impact of <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> is especially severe in the US and Canada, where over 80% of all homes have a <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer.</b> According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, if all residential <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> sold in the U.S. were energy efficient, [...] "the utility cost savings would grow to more than $1.5 billion each year and more than 22 billion pounds of annual greenhouse gas emissions would be prevented”.|$|R
50|$|A hand-cranked <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> {{was created}} in 1800 by M. Pochon from France. In 1892 George T Sampson invented the patent for the {{mechanical}} <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer.</b> A born slave, his invention was registered a generation after slavery was ended. J. Ross Moore, an American inventor from North Dakota, developed designs for automatic <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> during the early 20th century. His design for an electrically operated dryer was developed and {{released to the public}} in 1938. Industrial designer Brooks Stevens developed the first electric dryer with a glass window in the 1940s.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, the U.S. Fire Administration in a 2012 report {{estimated}} that from 2008 to 2010, fire departments responded {{to an estimated}} 2,900 <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> fires in residential buildings each year across the nation. These fires resulted in an annual average loss of 5 deaths, 100 injuries, and $35 million in property loss. The Fire Administration attributes “Failure to clean” (34%) as the leading factor contributing to <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> fires in residential buildings, and observed that new home construction trends place <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> and washing machines in more hazardous locations away from outside walls, such as in bedrooms, second-floor hallways, bathrooms, and kitchens.|$|R

40|$|Heat pump <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> (HPCDs) {{can be as}} much as 50 {{percent more}} {{energy-efficient}} than conventional electric resistance <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers,</b> and therefore have the potential to save substantial amounts of electricity. While not currently available in the U. S., there are manufacturers in Europe and Japan that produce units for those markets. Drawing on analysis conducted for the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE) current rulemaking on amended standards for <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers,</b> this paper evaluates the cost-effectiveness of HPCDs in American homes, as well as the national impact analysis for different market share scenarios. In order to get an accurate measurement of real energy savings potential, the paper offers a new energy use calculation methodology that takes into account the most current data on clothes washer cycles, <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> usage frequency, remaining moisture content, and load weight per cycle, which is very different from current test procedure values. Using the above methodology along with product cost estimates developed by DOE, the paper presents the results of a life-cycle cost analysis of the adoption of HPCDs in a representative sample of American homes. The results show that HPCDs have positive economic benefits only for households with high <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> usage or for households with high electricity prices and moderately high utilization...|$|R
