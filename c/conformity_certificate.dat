50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>Conformity</b> <b>Certificate</b> in Russia: the GOST Certificate of Conformity to National Standards, and the Certificate of Conformity to a Technical Regulation. The {{explanation}} of this is that the Technical Regulations began to be developed and enforced only recently, and do not yet fully regulate the certification process in Russia. Until the Technical Regulations replace the GOST Standards, the latter continue to play a part in the certification process on the Russian territory. It should also mentioned proving correspondence to Technical Conditions (TC), but generally this method is used in voluntary certification.|$|E

40|$|International audienceInternational {{trade is}} {{increasingly}} regulated through standardization, certification, and accreditation. To ensure that consumers can trust that the products they buy meet regulators’ standards, third-party certifiers and accreditation bodies, which “certify the certifiers,” act as intermediaries enlisted to deliver <b>conformity</b> assessment <b>certificates</b> to producers. This article explores how a few third-party certifiers have exploited their position between multiple regulators and diverse targets {{to invest in}} a growing number of sectors, expand globally, and become preferred advisers to regulators. As regulators enlist them to standardize certification practices, big third-party certifiers (BTPCs) advise regulators to set system-based regulations that are better suited to their own organizations and networks of international subsidiaries...|$|R
40|$|Accreditation reduces {{risk for}} {{business}} and its customers by assuring them that accredited bodies are competent {{to carry out the}} work they undertake. Accreditation bodies that are members of the International Accreditation Forum, Inc. (IAF) are required to operate at the highest standard and to require the bodies they accredit to comply with appropriate international standards and IAF Guidance to the application of those standards. Accreditations granted by accreditation body members of the IAF Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA), based on regular surveillance to assure the equivalence of their accreditation programs, allows companies with an accredited <b>conformity</b> assessment <b>certificate</b> {{in one part of the}} world to have that certificate recognized everywhere else in the world. Therefore certificates in the fields of management systems, products, services, personnel and other similar programs of conformity assessment issued by bodies accredited by members of the IAF MLA are relied upon in international trade.

40|$|The {{research}} {{made by the}} PhD candidate Francesca Pontis {{focuses on}} the analytical study of criminal issues in the product damages liability and especially on the connection between this question and the principle of guilt as capital principle of criminal law. The interest for this matter comes from the always stronger consideration of our society as a “society of risk”, in which the product damage is the best exemplification of how the fundamental interests are exposed to constant dangers and the classical criminal law institutes are in crisis. In this specific case is really interesting {{the issue of the}} subjective charge of the event, that testifies the metamorphosis of the subjective element of negligence in the post-modern society, from being an exception to become a consolidated rule. Furthermore the analysis conducted concentrates on the model of the criminal offences connected to production, distribution and use of defective products {{as an example of the}} always more detailed configuration of the criminal negligence as a prevalent collective offence, synchronic or diachronic, conscious or unconscious. The PhD candidate especially points out how in the industrial production, medical surgery, vehicles circulation and in other so called “first aid activities” is often hard to correlate, by a trial certain beyond all reasonable doubts, a certain damaging event to a certain behaviour, chargeable to easily identifiable people, with a consequent risk of survival in the juridical system of the classical criminal law principle of personality of the criminal liability, enforced by art. 27, co. 1 of the Italian Constitution. Starting from the analysis of this principle, as a leit motiv of the whole project, it was possible to determinate the aim of the study on the research of the best charging criteria of criminal negligence in case of a collective contribution to the damaging event. Against the backdrop of these guidelines, the research is divided into three fundamental parts. The first part is dedicated to presenting the object of the study and starts by criminal negligence’s analysis both in its general dimension and in its collective shape. The second part concentrated itself on the product damages liability as a collective contribution to the damaging event connected to the uncertain production, distribution and use of products risks, while the third part looks at the specific case of medical devices damages liability in order to underline when and why surgeon will be find guilty of patient’s death, with a special attention given to the case in which defective device had CE <b>conformity</b> <b>certificate...</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of IAF is two-fold. Firstly, to ensure that its {{accreditation}} body members only accredit bodies that are competent {{to do the work}} they undertake and are not subject to conflicts of interest. The second purpose of the IAF is to establish mutual recognition arrangements, known as Multilateral Recognition Arrangements (MLA), between its accreditation body members which reduces risk to business and its customers by ensuring that an accredited certificate may be relied upon anywhere in the world. The MLA contributes to the freedom of world trade by eliminating technical barriers to trade. IAF works to find the most effective way of achieving a single system that will allow companies with an accredited <b>conformity</b> assessment <b>certificate</b> {{in one part of the}} world, to have that certificate recognized else where in the world. The objective of the MLA is that it will cover all accreditation bodies in all countries in the world, thus eliminating the need for suppliers of products or services to be certified in each country where they sell their products or services. Certified once - accepted everywhere.|$|R

It is not intended or appropriate for certification purposes or regulatory or contractual use. Any offer to certify, or claims to be certified, to ISO 26000 would be a misrepresentation of the intent and purpose and a misuse of this International Standard. As this International Standard does not contain requirements, any such certification {{would not be a}} demonstration of conformity with this International Standard." [...] This statement includes that ISO 26000 cannot be used as basis for audits, <b>conformity</b> tests and <b>certificates,</b> or for any other kind of compliance statements. It can however be used as a statement of intention by the CEO and this is seen as its main value.|$|R
40|$|The Russian Federation’s (RF) {{accession}} to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) {{took place on}} 22 August 2012. The final report of the accession working party recommending that RF be admitted to WTO (November 2011) made multiple observations about RF’s sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) system not complying with the SPS Agreement, with special attention paid to the ‘GOST’ standards and certification system that is still found in devolved form {{throughout most of the}} Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Significantly, the RF in accounting for its SPS measures actually spoke on behalf of the Customs Union (CU) of RF, Belarus and Kazakhstan throughout most of the negotiations on RF’s accession. Hence it is important to examine such CU non-tariff measures as mutual recognition of <b>conformity</b> assessment <b>certificates</b> because previous work has shown that the CU’s SPS regime with the GOST heritage may create non tariff barriers to trade with other countries and in particular with trade from outside the CU in transit through the CU to other non-CU states. A factor {{to be taken into account}} is the potential impact on trade at CU border crossings of a new wave of Russian SPS-related laws and regulations originating at regional level (Oblast, Krai) of the RF as well as Russian Federal legislation. status: publishe...|$|R
