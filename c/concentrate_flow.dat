40|$|Riparian buffers in {{agricultural}} landscapes {{are designed to}} trap pollutants in overland flow by slowing, filtering, and infiltrating surface runoff entering the buffer via sheet flow. However, observational evidence suggests that <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> is prevalent from agricultural fields. Also, over time sediment can accumulate in riparian buffers forming berms that restrict sheet flow from moving into the buffers; these berms ultimately back up surface runoff, resulting in an eventual breakthrough which concentrates runoff. Breakthrough by <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> can lead to gully formation that may reduce the filtering capacities of buffer systems by providing direct conduits to stream channels. This study explores the frequency of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> paths in riparian buffers at both the field and watershed scale. At the field scale, intensive topographic surveys were conducted at 10 field sites in southern Illinois to characterize <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> paths, accumulated berm sediments, and field area drained by <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow.</b> Detailed digital elevation models (DEMs) were created for each site and riparian buffer and agriculture field characteristics were analyzed to assess the development and occurrence of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> paths. At each site, soil samples were analyzed to characterize sediment deposition patterns within the buffer. To assess the prevalence of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> paths at the watershed scale, three watersheds in southern Illinois were selected for walking stream surveys. Five stream segments, approximately 1000 m long, were randomly selected within each watershed and surveyed for the occurrence and size of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> paths. These data were analyzed with respect to riparian buffer vegetation, buffer width, and surrounding land cover data. <b>Concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> paths were identified in all topographic surveys and all walking stream surveys indicating a common occurrence {{in agricultural}} watersheds of southern Illinois. Among field scale sites, <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> accounted for 82. 5 - 100 % of the drainage areas contributing to riparian buffers. Results from the watershed scale analysis suggest that <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> paths are significantly more abundant in agricultural land cover, than forested land.

40|$|<b>Concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion {{processes}} are distinguished from splash and sheetflow processes in their enhanced ability to mobilize and transport {{large amounts of}} soil, water and dissolved elements. On rangelands, soil, nutrients and water are scarce and only narrow margins of resource losses are tolerable before crossing the sustainability threshold. In these ecosystems, <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> {{processes are}} perceived as indicators of degradation and often warrant the implementation of mitigation strategies. Nevertheless, this negative perception of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> processes may conflict {{with the need to}} improve understanding of the role of these transport vessels in redistributing water, soil and nutrients along the rangeland hillslope.

40|$|<b>Concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> {{experiments}} {{using a small}} hydraulic flume and {{a constant}} flow discharge and bed slope have been conducted in order to investigate the effects of rock fragment cover (Rc) on sediment yield for an initially wet and an initially air-dry loamy topsoil. The experimental results indicate that Re reduces <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion rates (E) in an exponential way (i. e., E = e(-bRC)), {{which is similar to}} previously reported relations for other water erosion processes such as interrill erosion and sheet-rill erosion measured on runoff plots. The decay rate (b) of this exponential relationship increased throughout the experiments because of scour-hole development and bed armouring. The <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion rates and b-values also depend on the initial moisture content of the topsoil. Depending on Re, mean <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion rates were 20 % to 65 % less on initially wet compared to initially air-dry topsoils. The mean value for b was 0. 032 for the initially wet, but only 0. 017 for the initially air-dry topsoil, indicating that a rock fragment cover is less efficient in reducing <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion rates when the topsoil is initially air-dry than when it is initially wet. The results help explain the data scatter in reported relationships between Re and inter-rill-rill erosion rates. They also indicate that a given surface rock fragment cover will offer more protection to wet topsoils than to dry topsoils, which are very common in Mediterranean environments.

The aim of the test was to formulate a model to represent effect of grass roots density on topsoil erosion by <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> for lateritic topsoil of Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, India. The detachment rates of undisturbed topsoil samples collected from twenty (three bare soil, eight scatter grass and nine densely grasses) soil monitored through a 1. 82 m long, 0. 094 m wide hydraulic flume under two different slope condition (25 and 35 %).

In this study, the effectiveness of three biological geotextiles in reducing soil losses during <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> is investigated. Hereto, runoff was simulated in a <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> flume, filled with an erodible sandy loam on three slope gradients (13 · 5, 27 · 0 and 41 · 5 %). Treatments included three biological geotextiles (borassus, buriti and bamboo) and one bare soil surface. Darcy–Weisbach friction coefficients ranged from 0 · 01 to 2 · 84. The highest values are observed for borassus covered soil surfaces, followed by buriti, bamboo and bare soil, respectively. The friction coefficients are linearly correlated with geotextile thickness. For the specific experimental conditions of this study, borassus geotextiles reduced soil detachment rate on average to 56 %, buriti geotextiles to 59 % and bamboo geotextiles to 66 % of the soil detachment rate for bare soil surfaces. Total flow shear stress was the hydraulic parameter best predicting soil detachment rate for bare and geotextile covered surfaces (R² = 0 · 75 – 0 · 84, p < 0 · 001, n = 12 – 15). The highest resistance against soil detachment was observed for the borassus covered soil surfaces, followed by buriti, bamboo and bare soil surfaces, respectively.

40|$|Froth {{recovery}} measurements {{have been}} conducted in both the presence (three-phase froth) and absence (two-phase froth) of particles of different contact angles in a specially modified laboratory flotation column. Increasing the particle hydrophobicity increased the flow rate of particles entering the froth, while the recovery of particles across the froth phase itself also increased for particle contact angles to 63 and at all vertical heights of the froth column. However, a further increase in the contact angle to 69 resulted in lower particle recovery across the froth phase. The reduced froth recovery for particles of 69 contact angle was linked to significant bubble coalescence within the froth phase. The reduced froth recovery occurred uniformly across the entire particle size range, and was, presumably, a result of particle detachment from coalescing bubbles. Water flow rates across the froth phase also varied with particle contact angle. The general trend was {{a decrease in the}} <b>concentrate</b> <b>flow</b> rate of water with increasing particle contact angle. An inverse relationship between water flow rate and bubble radius was also observed, possibly allowing prediction of water flow rate from bubble size measurements in the froth. Comparison of the froth structure, defined by bubble size, gas hold-up and bubble layer thickness, for two- and three-phase froths, at the same frother concentration, showed there was a relationship between water flow rate and froth structure.

The spatial concentration of flow, and the episodic nature of runoff events, resulted in a strong and spatially structured differentiation of local flow velocities within the catchment. There were large differences in the time spent by the laterally flowing water at different depths, with turnover times of lateral flow across a one m wide soil pedon ranging from under one hour at 10 - 20 cm depth to a month at 70 - 80 cm depth.

Aim: The aim of the work is to demonstrate the features of the application of exergy analysis method for sorption and desorption processes via example of the deaerator. Materials and Methods: The advantage of the exergy method is in the accounting not only the quantity but also the quality of energy flows and multicomponent material flows that characterize the energy balance of any power technology system that puts this method on the first place on their objectivity in comparison with traditional methods of thermodynamic analysis. Complexity of the exergy analysis devices with multi-component flows, where separation processes such as water solutions occur, is that the main technical effect of the process is shown in two ways: in one case, the major problem is to obtain clean water flow, and in another case to obtain the <b>concentrate</b> <b>flow.</b> For those processes, where the main objective is to obtain clean water, an exergy effect is manifested in the increase of the exergy flow.

40|$|Soil erosion on {{agricultural}} land and its detrimental environmental and economical effects has aroused increased interest among both {{the research and}} policy-making communities. The call for erosion control measures adapted to local farming practices is high, especially in Europe where farmers are reluctant to adopt soil conservation techniques. This study investigates a new technique for controlling <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion rates in the loess belt of central Belgium: i. e. double drilling of cereals in zones of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow.</b> Cross-sectional areas of erosion channels as well as crop yield parameters in single- and double-drilled zones were compared. The technique {{is based on the}} combined effect of the increased density of plant shoots and roots for reducing soil loss. Results indicate that double drilling can reduce soil loss through <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> by 25 % on average and by up to 40 % under optimal conditions. No net change in wheat grain yield was observed, and farmers who participated in the experiments were satisfied with the results and the easy application of the technique.

For positions in the landscape with a contributing drainage area larger than ca. 0. 75 ha, the effectiveness of double drilling can be doubted.

When cover crops freeze {{at the beginning of}} the winter period, the above-ground biomass becomes less effective in protecting the soil from water erosion, but roots can still play an important role in improving soil strength. However, information on root properties of common cover crops growing in temperate climates (e. g. Sinapis alba (white mustard), Phacelia tanacetifoli (phacelia), Lolium perenne (ryegrass), Avena sativa (oats), Secale cereale (rye), Raphanus sativus subsp. oleiferus (fodder radish)) is very scarce.

Results showed this approach was a significant improvement explaining 13 % more {{of the variation in}} mean velocity compared to traditional methods. Results from the first study were used to compare hydraulic parameters on shrub- and grass-dominated plots in the second study. Previous research has suggested microtopography in shrublands acts to <b>concentrate</b> <b>flow,</b> leading to increased runoff velocity compared to grasslands. However, present findings showed that flow velocities were similar on many grass and shrub plots; only plots with ground cover > 90 % exhibited significantly lower flow velocities, and some shrub-dominated plots had lower flow velocities than grass-dominated plots implying that horizontal water flux is reduced under certain states of woody plant encroachment. In terms of ground cover characteristics, velocity increased rapidly with increases in the fraction of bare soil, up to a value of ~ 20 % bare soil. Above ~ 20 % bare soil, basal gap became a dominant factor suggesting a possible threshold where spatial metrics related to the distance between plants become important indicator of shallow flow velocity. The third study tested an approach to quantify woody plant canopy metrics over large areas. Radar has been used to map biomass in forests but few studies have examined open canopy ecosystems. Field measurements of shrublands were compared to satellite images to identify the relationship between radar signal and height and cover of woody vegetation. Results indicated that radar signal increased positively with shrub height or shrub volume explaining 74 % and 90 % of the variation, respectively. The effect of surface roughness and sub-canopy species on radar signal appears reduced when images are collected at large incidence angles...|$|E
40|$|Agglomerated milk powders are {{produced}} to give improved properties such as flowability, dispersibility, reduced dustiness and decreased bulk density. A key function of these powders is to dissolve "instantly" upon addition to water {{and because of}} this they are also called "instant milk powders". They {{are produced}} by agglomerating the undersized fines that are returned {{to the top of the}} spray drier with milk concentrate droplet spray. Interaction occurs in a collision zone, often with multiple sprays and fines return lines. Agglomeration can be a difficult process to control and operators find it hard to fine tune the process to produce specific powder properties. This work aimed to understand the effects of key droplet and fines properties on the extent of agglomeration to allow a mechanistic understanding of the process. Three scales of spray drier were investigated in this study with different rates of evaporation; a small scale drier (0. 5 - 7 kg water h- 1), a pilot scale drier (80 kg water h- 1) and a range of commercial production scale driers (4 - 15 000 kg water h- 1). A survey of operators of commercial scale driers showed that control of instant milk powder production to influence bulk density is highly intuitive. Fines recycle rates were expected to be important in control of agglomeration processes and were estimated on a specific plant by using the pressure drop measured in the fines return line. A model based on pressure drop along a pneumatic pipeline under-predicted the experimental values for pressure drop due to solids, which means a calibration curve should be generated for each specific drier. Fines recycle rates were predicted to be significantly higher at 95 to 130 % of production rates compared to those expected by operators of 50 %. Experimental measurements agreed with existing models for the effect of temperature on the density and viscosity of milk concentrates. Experimental results showed that the surface tensions of concentrated milks were within the same range as literature values for standard milks below 60 °C, but were significantly higher for milk above 60 °C. This is thought to be linked to the mechanism of skin formation due to disulphide cross linking at high temperatures and concentrations. Powder properties were also established for selected products produced on the commercial scale driers. These powders were then used in experiments on the two smaller driers. Because collision frequency depends on the velocity and droplet size of sprays; these properties were measured for the small scale drier and estimated, where possible, for the pilot and commercial driers. The small scale agglomerating spray drier was configured to alter droplet and particle properties when interacting a vertical fines particle curtain with a horizontal spray sheet. An extensive design and improvement process was carried out to ensure the system consistently delivered these streams in a controllable manner. The processes of collision and adhesion occur very quickly inside the spray drier. In order to assess the extent of agglomeration that has occurred, the feed streams must be compared to the final product stream. An ideal way to do this is to use an agglomeration index which compares the particle size distributions of the feed (fines recycle and spray streams) and the particle size distribution of the product stream (the agglomerated powder). The index described changes between these steams across the particle size distribution and is called an agglomeration efficiency, ξg. However, it was found that the presence of fines in the product of the one-pass design obscured the agglomerates formed. The agglomeration efficiency, ξg, was modified to become ξh which subtracted the fines stream from the agglomerated product distribution. In this way ξh models industrial operation where the fines are recycled, by effectively just comparing the spray and product streams entering and leaving the process. The small scale drier was used for an experimental study on natural and forced agglomeration, where the drier was operated with spray only, then with spray and fines. For natural agglomeration, SEM images of the product powder indicated that little agglomeration occurred between spray droplets. The product yield was unacceptably low (~ 40 %) due to adhesion of spray droplets to the drying chamber wall opposing the horizontal spray. When the fines curtain was introduced in the forced agglomeration experiments, product yield increased above 50 % because the fines acted as collectors for the spray droplets. However, the agglomeration performance of the modified spray drier was lower than expected. The equipment design was then optimised by considering three key issues; fines dispersion, droplet dispersion and stickiness, and agglomerate breakdown. Final experiments studied agglomeration at low fines to spray mass flux ratios and showed that increasing the fines size had a positive effect on agglomeration efficiency,ξh. The agglomeration study at pilot scale identified the effect of key variables, total solids, concentrate and fines flow rate, and fines size on the agglomeration efficiency. A dimensionless flux approach was used to explain the experimental results. The fines to spray mass flux ratio and the projected area flux ratio (at constant <b>concentrate</b> <b>flow</b> rate) were found to be the most suitable to represent the physical processes during agglomeration. Experimental results showed that a higher dimensionless flux resulted in more agglomeration and as well as small fines size and atomising low solids concentrate. The critical Stokes number highlighted the importance of particle size and collision velocity on the outcome of the collision as well as the importance of stickiness on adherence following the collision. A statistical analysis established a relational model for predicting the agglomeration efficiency based on fines size, total solids and the fines to spray mass flux ratio. This thesis has gained insight into agglomeration processes during spray drying and knowledge about how to define the extent of agglomeration. Practical findings from this research can have a significant impact on successful spray drying operation for instant powders. There are some practical steps to be taken industrially to promote the control of agglomerating spray driers. The first step is to measure and control the flow of fines recycled to the top of the spray drier. The next step is to validate the findings at industrial scale and link the agglomeration index to the bulk powder properties. However, there are many challenges that remain to be tackled in the area of milk powder agglomeration. Milk powder agglomeration at the top of the spray drier is a complex process involving many different variables. A more detailed study of the micro processes that occur during agglomeration will give increased understanding of the relationships between key operating variables and agglomerate properties...|$|E
40|$|Many studies {{attribute}} {{the effects of}} vegetation in reducing soil erosion rates {{to the effects of}} the above-ground biomass. The effects of roots on topsoil resistance against <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion are much less studied. However, in a Mediterranean context, where the above-ground biomass can temporarily disappear because of fire, drought or overgrazing, and when <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion occurs, roots can {{play an important role in}} controlling soil erosion rates. Unfortunately, information on Mediterranean plant characteristics, especially root characteristics, growing on semi-natural lands, and knowledge of their suitability for gully erosion control is often lacking. A methodological framework to evaluate plant traits for this purpose is absent as well. This paper presents a methodology to assess the suitability of plants for rill and gully erosion control and its application to 25 plant species, representative for a semi-arid Mediterranean landscape in southeast Spain. In this analysis determination of suitable plants for controlling <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion is based on a multi-criteria analysis. First, four main criteria were determined, i. e. (1) the potential of plants to prevent incision by <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion, (2) the potential of plants to improve slope stability, (3) the resistance of plants to bending by water flow and (4) the ability of plants to trap sediments and organic debris. Then, an indicator or a combination of two indicators was used to assess the scores for the four criteria. In total, five indicators were selected, i. e. additional root cohesion, plant stiffness, stem density, the erosion-reducing potential during <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> and the sediment and organic debris obstruction potential. Both above- and below-ground plant traits were taken into account and measured to assess the scores for the five indicators, i. e. stem density, sediment and organic debris obstruction potential, modulus of elasticity of the stems, moment of inertia of the stems, root density, root diameter distribution, root area ratio and root tensile strength. The scores for the indicators were represented on amoeba diagrams, indicating the beneficial and the weak plant traits, regarding to erosion control. The grasses Stipa tenacissima L. and Lygeum spartum L. and the shrub Salsola genistoides Juss. Ex Poir. amongst others, were selected as very suitable plant species for rill and gully erosion control. Stipa tenacissima can be used to re-vegetate abandoned terraces as this species is adapted to drought and offers a good protection to <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion and shallow mass movements. Lygeum spartum can be used to vegetate <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> zones or to obstruct sediment inflow to channels at gully outlets. Stipa tenacissima and Salsola genistoides can be used to stabilize steep south-facing slopes. The methodology developed in this study can be applied to other plant species in areas suffering from rill and gully erosion. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|While it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in numerous studies that the aboveground characteristics of the vegetation are of particular importance with respect to soil erosion control, this study argues the importance of separating the influence of vegetation on soil erosion rates into two parts: the impact of leaves and stems (aboveground biomass) {{and the influence of}} roots (belowground biomass). Although both plant parameters form inseparable constituents of the total plant organism, most studies attribute the impact of vegetation on soil erosion rates mainly to the characteristics of the aboveground biomass. This triggers the question whether the belowground biomass is of no or negligible importance with respect to soil erosion by <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow.</b> This study tried to answer this question by comparing cross-sectional areas of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> channels (rills and ephemeral gullies) in the Belgian Loess Belt for different cereal and grass plant densities. The results of these measurements highlighted the fact that both an increase in shoot density as well as an increase in root density resulted in an exponential decrease of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion rates. Since protection of the soil surface in the early plant growth stages is crucial with respect to the reduction of water erosion rates, increasing the plant root density in the topsoil could be a viable erosion control strategy.

40|$|Gully erosion is an {{important}} soil degradation process in Mediterranean environments. Revegetation strategies for erosion control rely in most cases {{on the effects of}} the above-ground biomass on reducing water erosion rates, whereas the role of the below-ground biomass is often neglected. In a Mediterranean context, the above-ground biomass can temporally disappear because of fire or overgrazing and when <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion occurs, roots can play {{an important}} role in controlling soil erosion rates. Unfortunately, information on root characteristics of Mediterranean plants, growing on semi-natural lands, and their effects on the topsoil resistance to <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion is lacking. Therefore, typical Mediterranean grass, herb, reed, shrub and tree root systems of plants growing in habitats that are prone to <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion (i. e. in ephemeral channels, abandoned fields and steep badland slopes) are examined and their erosion-reducing potential was evaluated. Root density (RD), root length density (RLD) and root diameters are measured for 26 typical Mediterranean plant species. RD values and root diameter distribution within the upper 0. 10 – 0. 90 m of the soil profile are then transformed into relative soil detachment rates using an empirical relationship in order to predict the erosion-reducing effect of root systems during concentrated runoff. Comparing the erosion-reducing potential of different plant species allows ranking them according to their effectiveness in preventing or reducing soil erosion rates by <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow.</b> RD in the 0. 10 m thick topsoil ranges between 0. 13 kg m− 3 for Bromus rubens (L.) and 19. 77 kg m− 3 for Lygeum spartum (L.), whereas RLD ranges between 0. 01 km m− 3 for Nerium oleander (L.) and 120. 43 km m− 3 for Avenula bromoides ((Gouan) H. Scholz.) Relative soil detachment rates, compared to bare soils, range between 0. 3 × 10 - 12 and 0. 7 for the 0. 10 m thick topsoil. The results show that grasses such as Helictotrichon filifolium ((Lag.) Henrard), Piptatherum miliaceum ((L.) Coss.), Juncus acutus (L.), Avenula bromoides ((Gouan) H. Scholz), Lygeum spartum (L.) and Brachypodium retusum ((Pers.) Beauv.) have the highest potential to reduce soil erosion rates by <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> in the 0 – 0. 1 m topsoil. But also shrubs such as Anthyllis cytisoides (L.) and Tamarix canariensis (Willd.), having high root densities in the topsoil, can reduce erosion rates drastically. Among the species growing in channels, Juncus acutus (L.) has the highest erosion reducing potential, whereas Phragmites australis (Cav.) is the least effective. On abandoned fields, Avenula bromoides ((Gouan) H. Scholz) and Plantago albicans (L.) are the most effective species in reducing <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion rates, while Thymelaea hirsuta (L. (Endl.)) and Bromus rubens (L.) perform the worst. On steep badland slopes, Helictotrichon filifolium ((Lag.) Henrard) and Anthyllis cytisoides (L.) perform the best in the analysis of erosion reducing potential, while Ononis tridentata (L.) is the least effective species. These findings have implications for ecological restoration and management of erosion-prone slopes.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that soil erosion by water causes {{considerable}} on-site and off-site problems, farmers in Europe are reluctant to adopt prevention and control measures when such measures require additional labour and material inputs. This paper documents the impact of multiple sowing of small grains on <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion rates and grain production for a winter triticale field (X Triticosecale Wittmack ex. A. Camus) in the Belgian loess belt. Multiple sowing refers to drilling {{more than once in}} zones of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> erosion in order to increase the total root mass in this zone. Multiple sowing strongly altered the morphology of erosion channels and reduced soil loss significantly. Statistical analysis confirmed that differences in channel dimensions could be explained by the seedling density. Doubling the root mass in the topsoil by multiple sowing' resulted on average in a reduction of soil loss by 42 % for the whole growing season. For the winter period, soil loss reduction, mainly attributed to the triticale roots, amounted even to 53 %, showing the tremendous impact of seedling roots on soil erosion by <b>concentrated</b> overland <b>flow</b> {{in the early stages of}} vegetation growth. Furthermore, total grain yield in the multiple drilled zones was not significantly smaller compared to the conventionally drilled parts of the field. Grain size of cereals was slightly smaller. The results of this case study indicate that double sowing in <b>concentrated</b> overland <b>flow</b> zones may be a viable soil erosion control technique. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Soil erodibilty during <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> (K-c) and {{critical}} flow shear stress (tau(cr)), both reflecting the soil's resistance to erosion by concentrated runoff, are important input parameters in many physically-based soil erosion models. Field {{data on the}} spatial and temporal variability of these parameters is limited but crucial for accurate prediction of soil loss by rill or gully erosion. In this study, the temporal variations in K-c and tau(cr) for a winter wheat field on a silt loam soil under three different tillage practices (conventional ploughing, CP; shallow non-inversion tillage, ST; deep non-inversion tillage, DT) in the Belgian Loess Belt were monitored during one growing season. Undisturbed topsoil samples (0. 003 m(3)) were taken every three weeks and subjected to five different flow shear stresses (tau = 4 - 45 Pa) in a laboratory flume to simulate soil detachment by <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow.</b> To explain the observed variation, relevant soil and environmental parameters were measured {{at the time of}} sampling. Results indicated that after two years of conservation tillage, K-c(CP) > K-c(DT) > K-c(ST). K-c values can be up to 10 times smaller for ST compared to CP but differences strongly vary over time, with an increasing difference with decreasing soil moisture content. The beneficial effects of no-tillage are not reflected in tau(cc). K-c values vary from 0. 006 to 0. 05 sm(- 1) for CP and from 0. 0008 to 0. 01 sm(- 1) for ST over time. Temporal variations in K-c can be mainly explained by variations in soil moisture content but consolidation effects, root growth, residue decomposition and the presence of microbiotic soil crusts as well play a role. tau(cr) values increase with increasing soil shear strength but K-c seems more appropriate to represent the temporal variability in soil erosion resistance during <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow.</b> The large intra-seasonal variations in K-c, which are shown to be at least equally important as differences between different soil types reported in literature, demonstrate the importance of incorporating temporal variability in soil erosion resistance when modelling soil erosion by <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow.</b> (C) 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Terraces are {{a common}} feature of Mediterranean landscapes. In many places {{they are no longer}} {{maintained}} so that the number of intact terraces is in prolonged decline. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the effect of terrace removal and failure on hydrological connectivity and peak discharge in an agricultural catchment (475 ha) in south-east Spain. The situation of 2006 is compared to that in 1956 and to a scenario without terraces (S 2). The spatial distribution of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> was mapped after four storms in 2006. The degree of connectivity was quantified by means of connectivity functions and related to storm characteristics, land use and topography. For 1956, 2006 and scenario S 2, connectivity functions and peak discharge to the river were determined for a storm with a return period of 8. 2 years. The results show that the decrease in intact terraces has led to a strong increase in connectivity and discharge. The contributing area to the river system has increased by a factor 3. 2 between 1956 and 2006. If all terraces were to be removed (scenario S 2), the contributing area may further increase by a factor 6. 0 compared to 2006. The spatial extent of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> and the degree of connectivity are related to storm magnitude as expressed by the erosivity index (EI 30). Although a large part of the <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> (25 - 50 %) occurs on dirt roads, it appears that croplands become a major source of runoff with increasing rainfall.

We suggest that the eruption was characterized by closely timed hydromagmatic pulses giving rise to eruption clouds rich in water vapor and steam. The coarser material was not significantly transported in the eruptive cloud and it probably deposited in the caldera depression area. The finer material was extensively transported in the cloud, creating turbulent flows which surmounted the caldera rim barrier and dispersed in a southward direction, forming widespread deposits in the Piano area.

40|$|Erosion {{rates of}} {{overland}} flow on rangelands {{tend to be}} relatively low, but under certain conditions where <b>flow</b> is <b>concentrated,</b> soil loss can be significant. Therefore, a rangeland site can be highly vulnerable to soil erosion where overland flow is likely to concentrate and exert high shear stress on soil grains. This concept is commonly applied in cropland and wildland soil erosion modeling using predictions of flow effective shear stress (shear stress applied on soil grains). However, historical approaches to partition shear stress in erosion models are computationally complex and require extensive parameterization. Furthermore, most models are not capable of predicting {{the conditions in which}} <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> occurs on rangelands. In this study, we investigated the rangelands conditions at which overland flow is more likely to become concentrated and developed equations for partitioning the shear stress of <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> on rangelands. A logistic equation was developed to estimate the probability of overland <b>flow</b> to become <b>concentrated.</b> Total shear stress of rangeland overland flow was partitioned into components exerted on soil, vegetation, and rock cover using field experimental data. In addition, we investigated the vegetation cover limit at which the effective shear stress component is substantially reduced, limiting the erosion rate. The results from the partitioning equations show that shear stress exerted on soil grains was relatively small in sheet flow. Shear stress exerted on soil grains in <b>concentrated</b> <b>flow</b> was significantly higher when bare soil exceeded 60 % of the total surface area but decreased significantly when the bare soil area was less than 25 % or when the plant base cover exceeded 20 %. These percentages could be used as relative measures of hydrologic recovery for disturbed rangelands or as triggers that indicate a site is crossing a threshold beyond which soil erosion might accelerate due to the high effective shear stress...|$|R
