40|$|Abstract]: There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies associated with the measurement of biologically effective UV (UVBE) irradiances for the solar zenith angles (SZA) observed during summer. However, {{only a small amount}} is known about UVBE levels related to the larger SZA seen during the autumn and winter months. Spectral UV irradiance measurements were made under clear sky conditions at a sub-tropical Southern Hemisphere site. Biologically effective UV levels for fish melanoma, DNA damage and cataract induction was investigated beneath four specific shade settings, for relatively cloud-free sky conditions and changing solar zenith angle (SZA) between 33 o to 63 o. The biologically damaging UV in the shade was significant for fish melanoma. Compared to that in full sun, the UVBE associated with DNA damage, cataract and fish melanoma were at levels of approximately 76, 78 and 65 % respectively, beneath the shade umbrella. DNA damage, cataract and fish melanoma irradiance levels {{in the shade of a}} northern facing covered veranda were significantly less than those beneath the shade umbrella, with levels of approximately 19, 19 and 15 % respectively. Although no action spectrum exists for human melanoma and cataract development, the fish melanoma and porcine <b>cataract</b> <b>action</b> spectra may provide an indication of the effective wavelengths. The relative UVBE in the shade compared to full sun depends on the action spectrum that is being considered. The reduction in the UVBE for the different action spectra is not related to the reduction in the unweighted total UV. Shade is important as a UV minimisation strategy, but for long periods, shade alone does not provide enough protection from some biologically damaging UV...|$|E
50|$|Cataracts {{were also}} used as an {{over-speed}} safety device for direct-acting water pumps. A seesaw or 'differential' lever was placed between the pump's piston rod and a cataract adjusted for the pump's normal working speed. If the pump suddenly accelerated, owing to the pump bursting or similar, the piston would overtake the <b>cataract</b> and the <b>action</b> of the differential lever would then close the pump's steam inlet valve and stop the pump, limiting possible damage.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} {{published}} version. It first appeared at [URL] The majority of dogs with diabetes mellitus develop blinding mature <b>cataracts</b> through the <b>action</b> of the enzyme aldose reductase producing sorbitol with osmotic action drawing water into the lens thus causing opacification. Here we evaluate the use of OcuGLO™ a formulation including the aldose reductase inhibitor alpha lipoic acid, grapeseed extract, carotenoids, omega- 3 -fatty acids, and coenzyme Q 10 {{in the prevention of}} canine diabetic cataract in a prospective placebo-controlled double-masked study. Materials and methods: Dogs with diabetes mellitus but as yet without the development of blinding diabetic cataracts were given either OcuGLO™ or a placebo containing antioxidant vitamins. Dogs were examined monthly and their degree of lens opacification documented photographically using a Genesis D fundus camera at + 10 D. Time to progression of lens opacification was documented and compared between the OcuGLO™ group and the placebo group, using Kaplan Meier survival curve statistics Results: Mean time without change in lens opacification was 278 ± 184 days with OcuGLO Rx™ and 77 ± 40 days in the placebo group this difference being statistically significant at p= 0. 0005. Twelve of 15 dogs taking the placebo developed significantly increased lens opacification while 5 of 15 dogs taking OcuGLO Rx™ developed significant cataract. of these five dogs four animals did not receive daily OcuGLO Rx™ as directed due to unrelated concurrent illness or owner non-compliance. The remaining dog progressed despite Ocu-GLO Rx™ administration. In two dogs, diabetic cataract was reversed with regained vision on Ocu-GLO Rx™. Discussion: This small preliminary study demonstrates that oral Ocu-GLO Rx™ has beneficial effects in delaying cataract formation in dogs with diabetes mellitus. We look forward to further studies with larger case populations but note that the statistical significance reached between placebo and supplement-treated group, even with a small study population, demonstrates the efficacy of this commercially available dietary supplement...|$|R
