40|$|This thesis aims at {{outlining}} {{the importance and}} the value proposition of Financial Supply Chain Management to increase shareholder value. According to recent studies {{a huge amount of}} working capital is tied up in the Supply Chain. Process-oriented activities in the Supply Chain such as quali cation, invoice and claim management and nance-oriented activities such as management of working capital, valorization and <b>capital</b> <b>appropriation</b> and demand release working capital bundled in the Supply Chain. This is realized by a reduction in Days-Sales-Outstanding, which consequently shortens the Cash-to-Cash Cycle. Thus leading to higher liquidity and increased shareholder value. Understanding that a huge potential lies in Financial Supply Chain Management can make the difference between competitiveness or failure, especially in times of crisis, as we experience right now with the global nancial crisis.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the change in Illinois higher education governance structure impacted the financial allocations and to compare perceptions of board members and the chief financial officers of Illinois public universities. A survey was used to gather perceptions. The results of the survey were mixed. The majority of individuals responding perceived the change as having had a positive impact on the universities they represented. The minority expressed concerns about "mission creep," the potential loss of cohesiveness in Illinois public universities as a group, and the need for the Illinois Board of Higher Education. The financial allocations were compared by general revenue fund appropriations, university income fund <b>appropriations,</b> and new <b>capital</b> <b>appropriations</b> as reported in Illinois higher education Data Books. The findings indicated relatively little change in the amount that each university received. The exception was in new <b>capital</b> <b>appropriations,</b> which had no clear pattern of distribution. In conclusion, operating funds for Illinois state universities remained at the same distribution level, and the majority of persons surveyed viewed the governance change as a positive change...|$|R

40|$|The item {{veto power}} forms an {{important}} {{check on the}} legislature in many states, including Alaska. The power allows the governor to veto individual items in an appropriations bill rather than vetoing or signing the bill as a whole. In 2011 the Alaska State Legislature contemplated challenging this crucial executive power. A proposed draft of the annual <b>capital</b> <b>appropriations</b> bill contained language that linked each energy appropriation to all the others, providing that if the governor struck one item then none of the items would go into effect. Further, the legislature inserted language providing {{that none of the}} proposed energy appropriations would go into effect if the section of the bill linking them together were successfully challenged in court. While neither provision was included in {{the final version of the}} bill signed into law, they prompted a controversy about whether such language would comport with the requirements of the state constitution.
