Such estimates of profitability are closer to those provided by the national accounts than to the estimates usually derived from business data.

FeatherstoneLand is {{typically}} the highest value <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> that {{farmers and ranchers}} have on their balance sheets. The value of land is affected by inflation. Understanding the effect of inflation on the land market helps farmers make better land pricing decisions and better asset management decisions. Using Treasury Bills and Farm Credit Bonds, future inflation expectations and agricultural risk premiums can be estimated. With the recent government stimulation {{of the economy and}} the resulting large amount of money infused into the economy, inflation is becoming an increasing concern with investors. Economic theory suggests that this infusion of money will affect future interest rates and ultimately the value of land given the inverse relationship between interest rates and the value of land. These lingering affects occur with {{the rise and fall of}} yield rates for Treasury Bills and Farm Credit bonds. Farm Credit bonds are sold at a premium over Treasury Bills. This premium indicates the market-assessed additional risk that farmers have to pay for their operating loans and other mortgages. Even though land values are affected by inflation, other things affect land values such as recreational use, development, and natural resource exploration. A combination of inflation and these other affects can greatly affect land prices...|$|E

The impact of pension schemes on asset composition Table 1 shows how the asset composition of the UK personal sector {{has changed over the}} last 40 or so years. There has been a steady fall in the share of net financial assets in total assets since the 1950 s. This was exacerbated by the high inflation of the 1970 s, but the share has stabilised {{as a result of the}} low inflation environment of the 1980 s and 90 s. Housing assets have been on a rising trend over the period, although there have been three booms over the period (the one in the mid 1970 s is clearly discernible in the table). The share of consumer durable assets has been on a steady downward trend over the period. But the striking feature of the table is the phenomenal growth in the share of pension assets in total wealth since the war. It has doubled from 23 per cent to 46 per cent, with the growth in private sector pension assets being particularly noticeable. Pension assets are now the largest single <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> held by the UK personal sector.

At the end of the paper I mentioned what involves protecting intellectual property rights and brought little concerned how our country is perceived to protect such rights.

30|$|Overall, it is {{probably}} fair to make two generalizations concerning wealth holding across the different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> households. First, native households’ distribution of wealth holdings across the different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> is more uniform. In contrast, immigrants’ asset holdings are more “lumpy”, with bulk holdings in stocks and housing equity assets. The second generalization is that, in many respects, mixed households more closely resemble native households, (e.g., public aid receipts, household size and social security income). However, in other respects, they are similar to immigrant households (e.g., real estate holdings {{as a percentage of}} total wealth).|$|R

Continuing previous conducted research we have investigated this time the specific accounting policies of the sampled SMEs from Bihor County and the way these policies are understood by practitioners and implemented in order to prepare financial statements.
