50|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>dyeing</b> is “a {{method of}} dyeing blend or {{combination}} fabrics {{to two or}} more shades {{by the use of}} dyes with different affinities for the different fibers”. The <b>cross</b> <b>dyeing</b> process can be used to create heather effects, and plaid, check, or striped fabrics. Cross dyed fabrics may be mistaken for fiber or yarn dyed materials as the fabric is not a solid color, a characteristic considered typical of piece dyed fabrics. It is not possible to visually differentiate between cross dyed fabrics and those dyed at the fiber or yarn stage. An example is <b>cross</b> <b>dyeing</b> blue worsted wool fabric with polyester pin stripes. When dyed, the wool yarns are dyed blue, whereas the polyester yarns remain white.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>dyeing</b> is {{commonly}} used with piece or fabric dyed materials. However, the same concept is applicable to yarn and product dyeing. For example, silk fabric embroidered with white yarn can be embroidered prior to dyeing and product dyed when an order is placed.|$|E
40|$|The time-resolved {{photothermal}} {{methods are}} used {{in order to establish}} the yield of intersystem (singlet-triplet) <b>crossing</b> of <b>dyes</b> that are candidates for the application in photodynamic therapy. It is known that molecules with long living triplet state cause efficient photosensitization by direct interaction with the cells or by singlet oxygen generation...|$|R
50|$|Tarentel is a band {{based in}} San Francisco, California, which formed in 1995. Initially, the band {{consisted}} of Danny Grody and Jefre Cantu-Ledesma. The line-up altered {{over the years}} and has included John Hughes, Trevor Montgomery, Patricia Kavanaugh, Kenseth Thibideau, Jeffrey Rosenberg, Jim Redd, Tony <b>Cross,</b> Steve <b>Dye</b> and others.|$|R
5000|$|Tapa can be {{decorated}} by rubbing, stamping, stencilling, smoking (Fiji: [...] "masi Kuvui") or dyeing. The patterns of Tongan, Samoan, and Fijian tapa usually form {{a grid of}} squares, each of which contains geometric patterns with repeated motifs such as fish and plants, for example four stylised leaves forming a diagonal <b>cross.</b> Traditional <b>dyes</b> are usually black and rust-brown, although other colours are known.|$|R
50|$|The lone run of {{the game}} was scored in {{the top half of}} the fourth inning. Charlie Hayes hit a deep fly ball to center that Marquis Grissom {{appeared}} to have, but at the last second Jermaine <b>Dye</b> <b>crossed</b> in front of him and Grissom dropped the ball. Hayes advanced to second on the error, moved to third on a groundout by Bernie Williams, and scored on a double by Cecil Fielder.|$|R
40|$|A {{photometer}} microscope with a computer-controlled fast scanning {{table is}} described. With a special software program <b>cross</b> sections of <b>dyed</b> human hair {{can be analyzed}} automatically with respect o dye distribution from the outside {{to the inside of}} the hair shaft. Very important for such a measurement is the production of microtome cross ections of defined thickness in a reproducible manner. With some direct dyestuffs the influence of dyeing time on the dye-distribution profile across the hair section is demonstrated. The advantage of carrying out these measurements at a specific wavelength at which the dyestuff has its maximum absorption is shown...|$|R
40|$|In cancer, {{neoplastic}} {{cells can}} develop resistance {{to a variety}} of drugs, even to those drugs that cells have never come across. This makes the cancer therapy even more demanding and challenging, as clinicians have to take into consideration that the heavy medication they administer to the patients can be ine↵ective. This phe- nomenon acts as a motivation to explore the mechanisms behind molecular transport across the cell membrane. Using cancer cells and fluorescent dyes, we can detect experimentally whether a dye molecule can enter the cell. The most important aim of this research work is to detect whether there is a link between physical pa- rameters of the cell, like the membrane charge density and the ionic accumulation, and the molecule’s transport. We then build a mathematical model to explain and predict what happens during the experimental procedure. Our experiments show that the <b>dye’s</b> <b>crossing</b> is influenced by alteration of the membrane potential. In de- tails, when the di↵erence in potential across the membrane increases, then more <b>dye</b> molecules <b>cross</b> the membrane. Using our mathematical approach, we approximate the <b>dye</b> <b>crossing</b> the cell membrane via competition between di↵usion and electro- static forces. In that way, we are able to predict a molecule’s movement from the outside {{to the inside of the}} cell when the potential, the distribution of ions and the electrostatic properties of the membrane are known. Furthermore, it is possible to predict the transport time of the molecule as well as its distribution in the vicinity of the membrane area...|$|R
40|$|Our {{findings}} show that the extinction spectrum of core-shell type plasmonic particles can be effectively controlled by changing their geometric factor. This tuning capability allows the surface plasmons of the core-shell particles to be designed {{in such a way}} that the absorption of dye molecules is maximized in dye sensitized solar cells. When plasmonic particles with a metallic nanoshell and a dielectric core are incorporated into a TiO 2 mesoporous photoelectrode, the optical <b>cross</b> section of <b>dye</b> sensitizers and the energy conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are increased. The enhanced photon-electron conversion is attributed to localized surface plasmons of the core-shell particles, which increase the absorption and scattering of incoming light in the photoelectrode. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to the optimisation of a reliable protocol for localising proteins in art samples, we have analysed (in water solution) the interaction between some of the fluorescent stains commonly used in gel electrophoresis (Figure 1) and proteinaceous paint binders. Of these, dyes 1 and 3 have also been used to detect proteins in paint <b>cross</b> sections. <b>Dyes</b> 1 and 2 bind to the proteins in a non-covalent way; dyes 3, 4 and 5 undergo covalent binding. As for biosubstrates dried egg white (EW) based on ovalbumin, casein (CAS) from dried cow milk, rabbit skin glue (RSG) based on partially hydrolysed collagen and, as a standard reference, purified chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA) were taken into account. The affinity constants for binding of the fluorescent stains to different protein matrices were obtained by fluorescence titrations in aqueous solution. Moreover, the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) technique [3, 4] was used to analyse the binding features. The results obtained contribute {{to our understanding of the}} different affinity of the dyes for selected proteins and to shed light on the binding mechanism in these complex systems. Moreover, it is demonstrated that CPL spectroscopy can be applied in the analysis of complex matrices of practical interest and that it can give information about the occurrence of an interaction when fluorescence or ECD methods fail...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVessel {{length is}} an {{important}} but understudied dimension of variation in angiosperm vascular anatomy. Among other traits, vessel length mediates an important tradeoff between hydraulic efficiency and safety that could influence how plants respond to extreme weather with climate change. However, the functional significance of vessel length variation within individual stems is poorly known, in part because existing data analysis methods handle uncertainty {{in a way that}} makes vessel length distributions difficult to compare. We provide a solution to this problem through a hierarchical Bayesian framework for estimating vessel lengths and we demonstrate the flexibility of this method by applying it to data from serial <b>cross</b> sections of <b>dye</b> injected stems. Our approach can accelerate data collection and accommodate associated uncertainties by statistically correcting for bias and error that result from subsampling images. We illustrate our analytical framework by estimating and comparing vessel length distributions for 21 woody species characteristic of a North American forest. The best-fit model corrected for both bias due to secondary growth and sampling error within and among species. Vessel length estimates from this model varied by almost an order of magnitude and parameters of these distributions correlated with point estimates derived from a different, commonly used method. Furthermore, we show how key contrasts can be estimated with the Bayesian framework, and in doing so, we show that the shape of the vessel length distribution differed between ring-and diffuse-porous species, suggesting that within-stem vessel length variation corresponds to water stress seasonality and contributes to landscape-level habitat segregation. Our analysis method revealed the importance of within-stem variation in vessel length, and our results complement work on between-species variation in average vessel length, further illuminating how vascular anatomy can influence woody plants' responses to water stress...|$|R
