40|$|Abstract-This paper {{presents}} a novel surface micromachined low-loss integrated <b>cavity</b> <b>filter</b> {{with a pair}} of transmission zeros using a simple source-load coupling scheme for emerging 60 GHz applications. The proposed method eliminates the dielectric loss by elevating the cavity-based filter into the air with the aid of the polymer-core conductor surface micromachining technology. The electrical fields of the cavity are thus entirely in air. A coplanar waveguide input and output interface is designed for easy integration with other planar electronics. The inter-cavity inductive coupling is realized through the use of pillar array iris, with the source-load capacitive coupling achieved with integrated coplanar waveguide lines. This combination of couplings creates a pair of transmission zeros to help achieve better selectivity. A measured insertion losses as low as 1. 92 dB, along {{with a pair of}} transmission zeros, has been observed at 60 GHz.

40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} demand on wireless technologies, communication devices are being overloaded {{with a variety}} of wireless standards. In order to achieve better performance, and better spectrum efficiency, many modern and evolving standards operate over several bands in the frequency spectrum. Such multi-band operation makes designing RF front-ends a challenging task. Conventional solutions, such as placing RF switches between antennas and a bank of filters, are not scalable since switches degrade RF performance, and the large number of filters (10 s in today 2 ̆ 7 s mobile phones) can consume larger area. As a result, there have been significant research efforts recently on designing high-performance tunable and adaptable RF front-ends, especially for RF filters, since they can affect the performance of the whole system. Amongst several tunable technologies, evanescent-mode <b>cavity</b> <b>filters</b> have shown feasible advantages compared to competing technologies in terms of tuning range, quality factor (Q), and power consumption. Those advantages inspired many novel implementations for highly adaptive RF front-ends. Evanescent-mode <b>cavity</b> <b>filters,</b> however, have few limitations that affect their reliability and long-term use. The objective of this dissertation is to present solutions and mitigation techniques for those limitations to further advance the feasibility of evanescent-mode <b>cavity</b> <b>filters.</b> ^ First, a vibration mitigation technique is presented. Since evanescent-mode <b>cavity</b> <b>filters</b> are sensitive to mechanical perturbation, the presented technique senses the vibration, and then modifies a tuning signal such that it counteracts the effect from vibration. Measurements show that the effect of vibrations, in terms of sidebands, is suppressed by 24 - 26 dB. ^ Then, two monitoring and control techniques are introduced and experimentally validated. Both of which can operate with spectrum-aware capabilities. The presented systems read the frequency of the filter, and compensates the tuning signal such that the frequency is tuned to, and maintained at, the target operating frequency. The monitoring and control systems are applied to a variety of filter setups. The systems also show the capability of locating a jammer in the spectrum and suppressing it in real time by up to 45 dB.
