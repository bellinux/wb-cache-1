25|$|The {{standard}} {{approach is to}} test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. A <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore {{the probability that the}} estimator belongs to the <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> given that null hypothesis is true (statistical significance) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn't belong to the <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.|$|E

25|$|The MIR155HG RNA {{transcript}} {{does not}} contain a long open reading frame (ORF), however, it does include an imperfectly base-paired stem loop that is conserved across species. This non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is now defined as a primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA). Once miR-155 pri-miRNA is transcribed, this transcript is cleaved by the nuclear microprocessor complex, of which the core components are the RNase III type endonuclease Drosha and the DiGeorge <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> 8 (DGCR8) protein, to produce a 65 nucleotide stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-mir-155) (see Figure 2).|$|E
25|$|In {{a famous}} example of {{hypothesis}} testing, {{known as the}} Lady tasting tea, Dr. Muriel Bristol, a female colleague of Fisher claimed {{to be able to}} tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance. The null hypothesis was that the Lady had no such ability. The test statistic was a simple count of the number of successes in selecting the 4 cups. The <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> was the single case of 4 successes of 4 possible based on a conventional probability criterion (<nbsp&5%; 1 of 70 ≈nbsp&1.4%). Fisher asserted that no alternative hypothesis was (ever) required. The lady correctly identified every cup, which would be considered a statistically significant result.|$|E

40|$|Structure-function {{relationships}} for mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor {{were examined}} by generating {{a series of}} small deletions scanning {{the entire length of the}} molecule. Deletions of three amino acids were introduced at intervals of five amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis of the mature mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene. The mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and assayed for biological activity. This procedure identified four <b>regions</b> <b>critical</b> to activity. These <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> were further delineated by additional three-amino acid deletion mutants. Larger deletions at each terminus were also made, as well as changes of specific amino acid residues. The four <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> span amino acid residues 18 - 22, 34 - 41, 52 - 61, and 94 - 115. The disulfide bridge between Cys- 51 and Cys- 93 was also shown to be essential for activity, whereas that between Cys- 85 and Cys- 118 could be removed without loss of activity.

40|$|International audience— A {{combinatorial}} {{approach has}} been recently proposed for multi-parametric quadratic programming and has shown {{to be more effective}} in finding the complete solution than existing geometric methods for higher-order systems. In this paper, we propose a method for exploring the combinatorial tree which exploits some of the underlying geometric properties of adjacent <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> as the supplementary information in combinatorial approach to exclude a noticeable number of feasible candidate active sets from combinatorial tree. This method is particularly well-suited for cases where many combinations of active constraints are feasible but not optimal. Results indicate that this method can find all <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> corresponding to non-degenerate multi-parametric programming. A post-processing algorithm can be applied to complete the proposed method in the cases in which some <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> might not be enumerated due to degeneracies in the problem...|$|R
25|$|The early {{twelfth century}} saw {{the rise of}} Alexander's younger brother, David. The latter's close {{connections}} with the English likely contributed to his eventual acquisition of {{a substantial part of}} southern Scotland from Alexander. In about 1113, David married Maud de Senlis (died 1131), a wealthy English widow, and through her came into possession of extensive lordship that {{came to be known as}} the Honour of Huntingdon. As the mid-part of the century approached, the balance of power along the northern part of the Anglo-Norman realm began to shift in favour of David. In 1120, Henry I's only legitimate son died along with Richard d'Avranches, Earl of Chester (died 1120) in the White Ship disaster. The latter's lordship in the Welsh March was a <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> of Henry I's realm, and the English king responded by transplanting Ranulf le Meschin (died 1129) from his lordship of Carlisle to Richard d'Avranches' former lordship along the Welsh frontier.|$|E
500|$|During an {{experiment}} on August 21, 1945, Daghlian {{was attempting to}} build a neutron reflector manually by stacking a set of [...] tungsten carbide bricks in an incremental fashion around a plutonium core. The purpose of the neutron reflector was to reduce the mass required for the plutonium core to attain criticality. He was moving the final brick over the assembly, but neutron counters alerted Daghlian {{to the fact that}} the addition of that brick would render the system supercritical. As he withdrew his hand, he inadvertently dropped the brick onto the center of the assembly. Since the assembly was nearly in the critical state, the accidental addition of that brick caused the reaction to go immediately into the prompt <b>critical</b> <b>region</b> of neutronic behavior. This resulted in a criticality accident.|$|E

In this paper codal detailing rules for designing longitudinal and transverse reinforcement of primary elements as function of curvature ductility are assessed. Four seismic codes are considered: Italian code, New Zealand code, Eurocode 8 and American code. Non-linear monotonic moment-curvature analyses are performed on some sections of columns and beams detailed in according to the considered codal provisions. In the analyses the confinement effects within the concrete core have been taken into account as well.

2500|$|The {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA) {{structure of}} the hairpins in a pri-miRNA is recognized by a nuclear protein known as DiGeorge Syndrome <b>Critical</b> <b>Region</b> 8 (DGCR8 or [...] "Pasha" [...] in invertebrates), named for its association with DiGeorge Syndrome. DGCR8 associates with the enzyme Drosha, a protein that cuts RNA, to form the Microprocessor complex. In this complex, DGCR8 orients the catalytic RNase III domain of Drosha to liberate hairpins from pri-miRNAs by cleaving RNA about eleven nucleotides from the hairpin base (one helical dsRNA turn into the stem). The product resulting has a two-nucleotide overhang at its 3' end; it has 3' hydroxyl and 5' phosphate groups. It is often termed as a pre-miRNA (precursor-miRNA). Sequence motifs downstream of the pre-miRNA that are important for efficient processing have been identified.|$|E

Positional candidate genes which may {{contribute to the development of}} cardiovascular malformations associated with 1 p 36 deletions include DVL 1, SKI, RERE, PDPN, SPEN, CLCNKA, ECE 1, HSPG 2, LUZP 1, and WASF 2. Similarly, haploinsufficiency of PRDM 16 -a gene which was recently shown to be sufficient to cause the left ventricular noncompaction-SKI, PRKCZ, RERE, UBE 4 B and MASP 2 may contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy. When treating individuals with 1 p 36 deletions, or providing prognostic information to their families, physicians should take into account that 1 p 36 deletions which overlie these cardiac <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> may portend to cardiovascular complications. Since several of these cardiac <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> contain more than one positional candidate gene-and large terminal and interstitial 1 p 36 deletions often overlap more than one cardiac critical region-it is likely that haploinsufficiency of two or more genes contributes to the cardiac phenotypes associated with many 1 p 36 deletions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe life {{assessment}} for a component subjected to high strain concentration in <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> {{can be treated}} as a crack growth estimation starting from the first cycle of the component life. This approach assumes that the presence of same small surface defects or slip bands causes a quickly crack nucleation in <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> where Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) design is adopted. The work is focused on the analysis of LCF tests carried out by the aim of smooth cylindrical specimens and specimens with semi-circular notches made of a quenched and tempered steel. The crack growth has been monitored using a thin acetate-foil based replica technique. Two different approaches have been analyzed in order to define a model able to predict the crack growth rate for high constant strain amplitudes. Such a tool is useful to assess the residual life of a component in presence of a crack in <b>critical</b> <b>regions</b> where high stress concentrations cause cyclic yielding of the material. Finally a new analytical model able to predict the crack growth rates is presented...|$|R
