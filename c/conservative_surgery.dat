To be sure, the critic sometimes appears in the panoply of the savages whom we have supplanted on this continent; {{and it is hard}} to believe that his use of the tomahawk and the scalping-knife is a form of <b>conservative</b> <b>surgery.</b> It is still his conception of his office that he should assail those who differ with him in matters of taste or opinion; that he must be rude with those he does not like. It is too largely his superstition that because he likes a thing it is good, and because he dislikes a thing it is bad; the reverse is quite possibly the case, but he is yet indefinitely far from knowing that in affairs of taste his personal preference enters very little. Commonly he has no principles, but only an assortment of prepossessions for and against; and this otherwise very perfect character is sometimes uncandid to the verge of dishonesty. He seems not to mind misstating the position of any one he supposes himself to disagree with, and then attacking him for what he never said, or even implied; he thinks this is droll, and appears not to suspect that it is immoral. He is not tolerant; he thinks it a virtue to be intolerant; it is hard for him to understand that the same thing may be admirable at one time and deplorable at another; and that it is really his business to classify and analyze the fruits of the human mind very much as the naturalist classifies the objects of his study, rather than to praise or blame them; that there is a measure of the same absurdity in his trampling on a poem, a novel, or an essay that does not please him as in the botanist's grinding a plant underfoot because he does not find it pretty. He does not conceive that it is his business rather to identify the species and then explain how and where the specimen is imperfect and irregular. If he could once acquire this simple idea of his duty he would be much more agreeable company than he now is, and a more useful member of society; though considering the hard conditions under which he works, his necessity of writing hurriedly from an imperfect examination of far more books, on a greater variety of subjects, than he can even hope to read, the average American critic--the ordinary critic of commerce, so to speak--is even now very, well indeed.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Although {{radiotherapy}} {{is a well}} codified {{treatment for}} laryngeal carcinomas, the management of local recurrence after failed radiotherapy remains controversial. Total laryngectomy is the classical salvage surgical approach. Recent evidence showed that selected laryngeal recurrences may be successfully treated with partial laryngectomies with comparable survival rates, acceptable morbidity, tracheostomy closure, effective swallowing, and satisfactory voice intelligibility. RECENT FINDINGS: Recurrent laryngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy failure requires a comprehensive clinical, radiological and pathological restaging. Strict selection criteria are mandatory for the identification of radiotherapy failure cases amenable to <b>conservative</b> laryngeal <b>surgery.</b> Although larger series confirmation is necessary, <b>conservative</b> salvage <b>surgery</b> seems definitely promising.

30|$|CONCLUSION: <b>Conservative</b> laparoscopic <b>surgery</b> {{to relieve}} {{ureteral}} obstruction and remove pathologic tissue is {{the management of}} choice.

50|$|Laparoscopic {{surgical}} approaches include {{excision of}} ovarian adhesions and of endometriomas. Endometriomas frequently require surgical removal and excision {{is considered to}} be far superior in terms of permanent removal of the disease and pain relief. Surgery can sometimes have the effect of improving fertility but can have the adverse effect of leading to increases in cycle day 2 or 3 FSH for many patients. Laser surgery and cauterization are considered to be far less effective and only burn the top layer of endometrial tissue, allowing for the endometrioma and endometriosis to grow back quickly. Likewise, endometrioma drainage or sclerotherapy are somewhat controversial technique for removing endometriomas with varied degrees of success. <b>Conservative</b> <b>surgery</b> can be performed to preserve fertility in younger patients but as earlier stated can have the effect of raising FSH values and making the ovaries less productive, especially if functional ovarian tissue is removed in the surgical process. Operative laparoscopic surgery can provide pain relief and improved fertility. Radical surgical options could include singular or bilateral oophorectomy.|$|E

5000|$|Fergusson's {{reputation}} {{is that of}} a brilliant operator and a great [...] "conservative" [...] surgeon. The term <b>conservative</b> <b>surgery,</b> first applied by Fergusson in 1852 to operations for the preservation of parts of the body which would otherwise have been sacrificed, does not denote merely operations which he originated or improved, for James Syme had already been very successful in this line of procedure. But Fergusson extended the principle from the operation of excision of the elbow joint to many others. No portion of the body which could be usefully preserved was too small for him to make efforts to save. Among operations with which his name is specially identified are those for harelip and cleft palate, and operations on the jaws, the excision of joints, notably the hip, knee, and elbow, lithotomy and lithotrity, and amputations of limbs. His skill in dissection, and his careful study of the actions of the muscles which he had to cut through, were of essential importance to his success. In his lectures at the College of Surgeons he was able to speak of three hundred successful operations of his own for harelip. The operation for cleft palate had been largely abandoned till he took it up anew. His manipulative and mechanical skill was shown both in his modes of operating, and in the new instruments he devised. The bulldog forceps, the mouth-gag for cleft palate, and various bent knives attest his ingenuity. A still higher mark of his ability consisted in his perfect planning of every detail of an operation beforehand; no emergency was unprovided for. Thus, when an operation had begun, he proceeded with remarkable speed and silence till the end, himself applying every bandage and plaster, and leaving, as far as possible, no traces of his operation. So silently were most of his operations conducted, that he was often imagined to be on bad terms with his assistants. His punctuality and his hatred of unnecessary waste of time were very marked.|$|E
