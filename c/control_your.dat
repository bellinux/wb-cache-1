500|$|Rivera {{exhibited}} a reserved demeanor {{on the field}} that contrasted with the emotional, demonstrative temperament {{of many of his}} peers.

If you don't <b>control</b> <b>your</b> emotions, your emotions will <b>control</b> <b>your</b> acts, and that's not good." [...] His ability to compartmentalize his successes and failures impressed fellow reliever Joba Chamberlain, who said, [...] "He's won and lost some of the biggest games in the history of baseball, and he's no worse for the wear when he gives up a home run."

"Black Zombie" [...] is an impassioned, self-reflective {{critique}} of problems afflicting the African-American community, including prejudice ("You believe {{when they say}} we ain't shit, we can't grow / All we are is dope dealers and gangstas and hoes"), economic insolvency ("What do we own? The skin on our backs / We rent and we ask for reparations, then they hit us with tax"), and dependency ("I'ma Colombia record slave / So get paid / <b>Control</b> <b>your</b> own destiny, you are a genius / Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie"). Its socially conscious lyrics deride media stereotypes of African Americans, inequality in the educational system, and black-on-black violence. According to writer Dax-Devlon Ross, the song foreshadowed the themes and [...] "world view" [...] of Nas' subsequent albums. [...] "Poppa Was a Playa" [...] features uncredited co-production by Kanye West, and discusses Nas' complicated relationship with his father, jazz musician Olu Dara, addressing his lusty, itinerant lifestyle throughout Nas' youth.

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{recurring}} themes within Lynch's work, leading film critics Le Blanc and Odell {{to state that}} [...] "his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas". One of the key themes that they noted was the usage of dreams and dreamlike imagery and structure within his works, something they related to the [...] "surrealist ethos" [...] of relying [...] "on the subconscious to provide visual drive". This {{can be seen in}} John Merrick's dream of his mother in The Elephant Man, Agent Cooper's dreams of the red room in Twin Peaks and the [...] "dreamlike logic" [...] of the narrative found in Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire. Discussing his attitude to dreams, Lynch has stated that [...] "Waking dreams {{are the ones that are}} important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep, you don't <b>control</b> <b>your</b> dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose... right there is the power of cinema." [...] His films are known for their use of magic realism.|$|E

[...] He then asked Sun Ce to dismount from his horse and said, [...] "The terrain here is deep and dangerous. You can't <b>control</b> <b>your</b> horse well under such conditions, so you should travel on foot, guide your horse along, and arm yourself with a bow and arrows. I'm good in using a spear and I'll lead the way." [...] After reaching flat ground, Sun Ce mounted his horse again and asked Yu Fan, [...] "You don't have a horse. What are you going to do?" [...] Yu Fan replied, [...] "I can travel on foot. I'm capable of travelling 300 li in a day. Since the start of the campaigns, no one has been able to match my pace. You can try letting a horse run and I'll catch up with it on foot." [...] They encountered a signaller at the main road. Sun Ce took the signaller's horn and blew it. His men recognised the sound of the horn and rushed there to join him. They patrolled the area and pacified the three commanderies.|$|E
