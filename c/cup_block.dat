2500|$|The cup {{involves}} three players, {{arranged in}} a semi-circular cup-shaped formation, one {{in the middle and}} back, the other two on the sides and forward. One of the side players marks the handler with a force, while the other two guard the open side. Therefore, the handler will normally have to throw into the cup, allowing the defenders to more easily make <b>blocks.</b> With a <b>cup,</b> usually the center <b>cup</b> <b>blocks</b> the up-field lane to cutters, while the side <b>cup</b> <b>blocks</b> the cross-field swing pass to other handlers. The center cup usually also has the responsibility to call out which of the two sides should mark the thrower, usually the defender closest to the sideline of the field. The idea of the cup is to force the offense into making many short passes behind and around the cup. The cup (except the marker) must also remember to stay 3 meters or more away from the offensive player with the disc. [...] The only time a player in the cups can come within 3 meters of the player with the disc is when another offensive player comes within 3 meters of the person with the disc, also known as [...] "crashing the cup".|$|R

Therefore cup markings, and other archaic markings are not unknown or suspicious things in a genuine pile structure in Scotland. Why, then, suspect them at Dumbuck? At Dumbuck the cups occur on a triangular block of sandstone, 14.5 inches long and 4 inches thick. Another <b>cupped</b> <b>block</b> is of 21.5 inches by 16.5. {74} ...|$|R

5000|$|Jiaobei blocks {{can be used}} {{separately}} {{to receive}} a straightforward answer, or they are accompanied by fortune sticks to clarify an oracle. When used alone, jiaobei blocks are first purified by revolving the blocks around the incense burner three times. The querent then kneels and says their name, date of birth, residence, and question while <b>cupping</b> the <b>blocks</b> between their hands in prayer. After the querent poses the question to the gods, the blocks are {{dropped to the floor}} and land in a specific position.|$|R

He played two more seasons in Edmonton and was selected as an all-star in each.

40|$|Inserts which {{carried the}} CUP gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Mucor racemosus {{were used as}} {{hybridization}} probes to measure the methylation state and expression of the CUP gene from Mucor rouxii {{at different stages of}} growth. It was observed that the fungus contains a CUP multigene family. All the CUP genes were present in a hypermethylated DNA region in nongrowing and isodiametrically growing spores and were not transcribed at these stages. After germ tube emergence, CUP genes became demethylated and transcriptionally active. Development, demethylation, and transcription of <b>CUP</b> genes were <b>blocked</b> by the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor 1, 4 -diaminobutanone. These results suggest that genes that are activated during development became demethylated in this fungus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, stroke {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} causes of severe adult disability in the world. Virtual reality and haptic technologies have emerged as promising assistive tools for effective diagnosis and rehabilitation intervention. The objective of this paper is to develop and test a set of five virtual exercises on top of a framework, which is designed for the diagnosis and rehabili-tation of patients with hand impairments. We have implemented task-oriented exercises based on well-established and common exercises, namely the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and the Box and Block Test. These include moving a <b>cup,</b> arranging <b>blocks,</b> navigating a maze, training with a dumbbell, and grasping a rub-ber ball. Furthermore, key performance measures (metrics) are proposed for each exercise to quantitatively evaluate and judge the performance of stroke patients. Our evaluation of these exercises shows promising potential to define “golden ” reference metrics for healthy subjects, against which the performance of a patient is compared. This will facilitate the ability of occupational therapists to assess the patient’s progress.

Similar to a study hall, students were required to complete [...] "Academic Activities". Students could leave their Charge it Up! rooms in order to attend club meetings, take missed tests, use the media center for projects or papers, or ask teachers for help with schoolwork. However, in order to leave their Charge it Up! rooms, students were required to get their passes signed by their destination teacher, coach, or supervisors and then have it signed by their Charge it Up! teachers. Mondays are [...] "No Movement" [...] days, in which no students was allowed to use his or her pass. Every other Monday, the students would receive a small [...] "Charger Lesson" [...] that usually discussed DCHS events.
