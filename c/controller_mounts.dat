The aerodynamic and control effectiveness characteristics are presented along with an analysis of the effectiveness of the controller in making a bank maneuver for Mach 18 flight conditions.

A safety interlock was provided, to reduce the likelihood of the motor being damaged by careless driving, and brakes manufactured by Lockhead or Girling were fitted to all four wheels.

By 1943, a 25-30 cwt model had been added to the range. A more modern design of cab had been introduced in 1939, and as the Second World War ended, Metrovick ceased to make battery electric road vehicles, selling its designs and manufacturing rights to Brush. Consequently, early Brush designs are virtually indistinguishable from later Metrovick designs.|$|R

Analysis of ten rhesus macaques that controlled viremia for 2 years post-infection found accumulation of proviral gag and nef CD 8 + T-cell escape mutations in four of them. These four <b>controllers</b> <b>mounted</b> CD 8 + T cells targeting Gag, Nef, and other viral proteins at 4 months, suggesting that broadening of CD 8 + T-cell targets can be an indicator of the beginning of viral control failure. The remaining six aviremic SIV controllers, however, harbored proviruses without mutations and showed no or little broadening of their CD 8 + T-cell responses in the chronic phase. Indeed, three of the latter six exhibiting no change in CD 8 + T-cell targets showed gradual decreases in SIV-specific CD 8 + T-cell frequencies, implying a concomitant reduction in viral replication. Thus, stability of the breadth of virus-specific CD 8 + T-cell responses may represent a status of lasting HIV containment by CD 8 + T cells...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{aerodynamic}} control of long-span suspension bridges {{and seek to}} raise the critical flutter wind speeds, while simultaneously suppressing buffeting. The control system design study {{is based on a}} simple flexible bridge section model that interacts with a constant-velocity air stream. A streamlined bridge deck is assumed and non-steady thin aerofoil theory is used to describe the interactions between the bridge deck and the air stream. Classical turbulence models, first developed in the aircraft industry, are used to model the buffet forces acting on the deck. While a wide variety of control systems is possible, we focus on a compensation scheme that can be implemented using passive mechanical components such as springs, dampers and a rack and pinion mechanism. A single-loop control system is investigated that controls a trailing-edge flap by sensing movements of the bridge deck; several such mechanisms are contemplated. The first finding is that the critical wind speed for flutter can be greatly increased, with good robustness characteristics, through passive feedback control. It is also possible simultaneously to suppress flutter using the same passive mechanical controller by solving a passive mixed H 2 /H control problem.

In this study, we examined CD 8 + T-cell responses in blood and rectal mucosa from 17 “elite controllers” (viral load 10 [*] 000 copies/mL), and 10 antiretroviral-treated persons (< 75 copies/mL). Production of interferon-γ, interleukin- 2, tumor necrosis factor-α, macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β, and CD 107 a by CD 8 + T cells in response to HIV- 1 Gag stimulation was measured using flow cytometry. Our hypothesis was that “polyfunctional” T cells producing multiple antiviral factors would be most abundant in mucosal tissues of HIV controllers. Mucosal CD 8 + T-cell responses were significantly stronger and more complex in controllers than in antiretroviral-suppressed persons (P =. 0004). The frequency of 4 -function responses in rectal mucosa was higher in controllers than in noncontrollers and patients on therapy (P <. 0001). Mucosal responses in controllers were frequently stronger and more complex than blood responses.

40|$|Introduction: Electronic Assistive Technology {{including}} Environmental Control Systems (ECS) {{is typically}} considered a specialist area by occupational therapists (Verdonck, McCormack, & Chard, 2011). However, occupational therapists {{need to consider}} ECS in their interventions because ECS use {{has been associated with}} improved quality of life (Rigby, Ryan, & Campbell, 2011) and autonomy for people with high SCI (Verdonck, Chard, & Nolan, 2011). This poster describes a simple ECS starter-pack, the Generic Electronic Assistive Technology pack (GrEAT), developed by an occupational therapist and intended for non-specialist occupational therapists. Method: The starter pack was based on the desires and experiences of users and potential users elicited in a focus group study. The commercial contents were {{selected on the basis of}} an internet search and consultation with experts and suppliers. In addition, supporting audio visual materials were compiled from scratch by the author in order to demonstrate the materials included in the pack. The pack included ECS <b>controllers,</b> <b>mounts,</b> telephones, electric sockets, switches, and an alarm. An information booklet and demonstration DVD included in the pack were compiled during a single person 3 -week pilot study of the starter pack. Results:Modifications were made to the starter-pack during the pilot trial and the GrEAT was subsequently customised for 6 people for use in their own homes for 8 week periods. A collaborative approach was adopted during installations. Five of the six participants used the GrEAT successfully and reported feeling enabled through its use.

A three dimensional finite element model is utilized to model the magnetic field distribution due to the probe and how the probe voltage changes as it scans the crack.

The final section summarizes the major accomplishments of the present work, {{the elements of the}} future R&D needs and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using this system in the laboratory and field. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP The experimental setup consists of a tensile testing machine, a two axis scanner and controller, the self nulling probe and its instrumentation and a PC to control all the instruments and for the storage of information. The scanner is attached to the load frame and has the flexibility to be placed anywhere vertically depending on the sample size and cross head location. Resolution of the motors in the controller is 10 microns in both directions. Figure 1 shows the specimen, probe and the <b>controller</b> <b>mounted</b> on the tensile testing machine. The self nulling probe has been discussed in detail in a number of publications [2] - [4]. The most unique feature of this probe is the self-nulling capability that significantly simplifies the instrumentation for the probe.

40|$|Sponsoring {{organization}} Title and subtitle Lifetime Monitoring of Wind Turbines (Livstidsövervakning av vindkraftverk) The aim of {{this thesis}} was to design and implement a lifetime monitoring system for a GE Energy wind turbine. Monitoring the loads on {{the main components of}} a wind turbine makes it possible to keep the lifetime of the components monitored. This information can be used to enable more flexible planning of a wind turbine’s maintenance. Knowing the estimated remaining lifetime makes it possible to change the components before they break. This increases both the security and availability of the wind turbine. The information from the lifetime monitoring system could possibly also be used directly by the wind turbine’s main controller in order to optimize the operation of the wind turbine regarding its components lifetime and the turbine’s energy capture. Several load-cycle counting methods were investigated and compared to each other and the rainflow counting method was found to be the most suitable. It was adapted, implemented and tested on a PLC (Programmable Logical <b>Controller)</b> <b>mounted</b> to a HITL (Hardware In The Loop) real-time simulation system that simulated the behavior of a GE 1. 5 s/sl wind turbine. A method for calculating the fatigue, using the result from the rainflow counting, was implemented. The whole monitoring system was designed and implemented to work online, i. e., continuously calculating and displaying the lifetime of the monitored components. In order to realize an online rainflow counter, a novel approach for classification of the data-series was developed. A prototype of the system was installed on a GE Energy wind turbine in Salzbergen, Germany. Several tests were here performed in order to validate the system and to compare the simulated results with the measured results.
