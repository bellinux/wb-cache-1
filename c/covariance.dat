40|$|Genetically {{correlated}} traits do not evolve independently, and the <b>covariances</b> between traits {{affect the}} rate at which a population adapts to a specified selection regime. To measure the impact of genetic <b>covariances</b> on the rate of adaptation, we compare the rate fitness increases given the observed G matrix to the expected rate if all the <b>covariances</b> in the G matrix are set to zero. Using data from the literature, we estimate the effect of genetic <b>covariances</b> in real populations. We find no net tendency for <b>covariances</b> to constrain the rate of adaptation, though the quality and heterogeneity of the data limit the certainty of this result. There are some examples in which <b>covariances</b> strongly constrain the rate of adaptation but these are balanced by counter examples in which <b>covariances</b> facilitate the rate of adaptation; in many cases, <b>covariances</b> have little or no effect. We also discuss how our metric can be used to identify traits or suites of traits whose genetic <b>covariances</b> to other traits have a particularly large impact on the rate of adaptation...|$|R

40|$|DETECT (Zhang & Stout, 1999 a, 1999 b) is a nonparametric {{procedure}} that determines the latent dimensional {{structure of a}} test of dichotomous items, based on conditional <b>covariances</b> between the items. In estimating the DETECT index, the conditional score to compute conditional <b>covariances</b> plays a critical role and it directly affects the precision of what the procedure yields. Currently two methods are available to compute conditional <b>covariances</b> with bias corrections: (a) Kim (1994) proposed computing <b>covariances</b> conditional upon the total score of the remaining items and centered {{with respect to the}} average convariance of all item pairs; (b) Zhang and Stout (1999 b) proposed taking the average of conditional <b>covariances</b> based on the total score of the test and the total score of remaining items on the test.

40|$|Trade-offs among life-history {{traits are}} central to {{evolutionary}} theory. In quantitative genetic terms, trade-offs may be manifested as negative genetic <b>covariances</b> relative to the direction of selection on phenotypic traits. Although the expression and selection of ecologically important phenotypic variation are fundamentally multivariate phenomena, the in situ quantification of genetic <b>covariances</b> is challenging. Even for life-history traits, where well-developed theory exists with which to relate phenotypic variation to fitness variation, little evidence exists from in situ studies that negative genetic <b>covariances</b> are {{an important aspect of}} the genetic architecture of life-history traits. In fact, the majority of reported estimates of genetic <b>covariances</b> among life-history traits are positive. Here we apply theory of the genetics and selection of life histories in organisms with complex life cycles to provide a framework for quantifying the contribution of multivariate genetically based relationships among traits to evolutionary constraint. We use a Bayesian framework to link pedigree-based inference of the genetic basis of variation in life-history traits to evolutionary demography theory regarding how life histories are selected. Our results suggest that genetic <b>covariances</b> may be acting to constrain the evolution of female life-history traits in a wild population of red deer Cervus elaphus: genetic <b>covariances</b> are estimated to reduce the rate of adaptation by about 40 %, relative to predicted evolutionary change in the absence of genetic <b>covariances.</b> Furthermore, multivariate phenotypic (rather than genetic) relationships among female life-history traits do not reveal this constraint.

25|$|The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is a Monte Carlo {{implementation}} of the Bayesian update problem: given a probability density function (pdf) {{of the state of}} the modeled system (the prior, called often the forecast in geosciences) and the data likelihood, the Bayes theorem is used to obtain the pdf after the data likelihood has been taken into account (the posterior, often called the analysis). This is called a Bayesian update. The Bayesian update is combined with advancing the model in time, incorporating new data from time to time. The original Kalman Filter assumes that all pdfs are Gaussian (the Gaussian assumption) and provides algebraic formulas for the change of the mean and the <b>covariance</b> matrix by the Bayesian update, as well as a formula for advancing the <b>covariance</b> matrix in time provided the system is linear. However, maintaining the <b>covariance</b> matrix is not feasible computationally for high-dimensional systems. For this reason, EnKFs were developed. EnKFs represent the distribution of the system state using a collection of state vectors, called an ensemble, and replace the <b>covariance</b> matrix by the sample <b>covariance</b> computed from the ensemble. The ensemble is operated with as if it were a random sample, but the ensemble members are really not independent – the EnKF ties them together. One advantage of EnKFs is that advancing the pdf in time is achieved by simply advancing each member of the ensemble. For a survey of EnKF and related data assimilation techniques, see G. Evensen.|$|E
