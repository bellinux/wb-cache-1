Passengers had to drop in the exact fare on leaving the tram. Rotating turnstiles were fitted at the entrance, which {{is located at the}} rear of a tram. Conductors were no longer needed and most of them retrained to become motormen.|$|E

5000|$|Coin roll hunting (often {{abbreviated}} [...] "CRH") is {{the hobby}} of searching and sorting coinage pulled from circulation for collectible coins. This is achieved through obtaining rolled <b>coin,</b> <b>boxed</b> <b>coin,</b> or bagged coin from banks and credit unions.|$|R

50|$|Tubular {{pin tumbler}} locks are {{generally}} considered to be safer and more resistant to picking than standard locks. This is primarily because they are often seen on <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> for vending machines and coin-operated machines, such as those used in a laundromat. However, the primary reason the locks are used in these applications is their lack of the depth requirement that most other locks require.|$|E
5000|$|... 1976 {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of International Subscriber Dialling (ISD) enabling local subscribers to dial direct to over 250 million telephones in 26 countries. However, ISD was not available from <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> until July 1982 when POA boxes were replaced with Post Office CT22B type electronic payphones. In 1979 the Board introduced a Motorola single channel radio paging system, which was upgraded to a two channel system. It is now operated by the Jersey Airport Department of Electronics.|$|E

50|$|As this {{decision}} was issued prior to a final disposition in the case, the facts presented here were still in dispute and the Court summarized the testimony given before the Grand Jury. On December 22, 1984, four young black men (Troy Canty, Darryl Cabey, James Ramseur, and Barry Allen) boarded a subway car in the Bronx. Two {{of the men were}} carrying screwdrivers in their coats, which they later admitted were planned to be used to break into arcade game <b>coin</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Redemption games such as Skee Ball {{have been}} around {{since the days of the}} {{carnival}} game - well earlier than the development of the electronic game, however with modern advances many of these games have been re-worked to employ electronic scoring and other game mechanics. The use of electronic scoring mechanisms has allowed carnival or arcade attendants to take a more passive role, simply exchanging prizes for electronically dispensed coupons and occasionally emptying out the <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> or banknote acceptors of the more popular games.|$|E
50|$|From {{that time}} all {{machines}} {{in use in}} the UK were of the electro-mechanical type. This used a standard mechanical coin-weigher unit and mechanical stacking for booklets, but had an electronic arm on a rotating cam for dispensing the booklets. They were manufactured by Hillday Automation of Attleborough, Norfolk and designated Type B52. Two versions were built with either long or short <b>coin</b> <b>boxes,</b> easily recognised from {{the length of the}} case. Initially set to dispense 4 x 25p stamps in a folded booklet in exchange for a £1 coin, different combinations were later employed as postage rates in the UK continued to rise.|$|E
50|$|Another {{common type}} of kiddie ride is the {{miniature}} carousel type. These rides are usually {{in the form of}} a small-sized carousel and newer models have the coin-box on the main pillar whereas older units have the <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> on a pole sticking out of the side of the ride.|$|R
50|$|On September 24, 2008, Vennes' Shorewood, Minnesota {{home was}} raided by federal agents in {{connection}} with an investigation of Minnesota businessman Tom Petters' $3.5 billion Ponzi scheme.

50|$|The 1950s and 1960s was the {{pinnacle}} of the motel industry in the United States and Canada. As older mom-and-pop motor hotels began adding newer amenities such as swimming pools or color TV (a luxury in the 1960s), motels were built in wild and impressive designs. In-room gimmicks such as the coin-operated Magic Fingers vibrating bed were briefly popular; introduced in 1958, these were largely removed in the 1970s due to vandalism of the <b>coin</b> <b>boxes.</b> The American Hotel Association (which had briefly offered a Universal Credit Card in 1953 as forerunner to the modern American Express card) became the American Hotel & Motel Association in 1963.|$|E
50|$|Born in Chicago, Illinois to Sicilian parents,after {{serving in}} the U.S Navy he {{returned}} to Chicago and started committing small-time crimes such as breaking open pay telephone <b>coin</b> <b>boxes,</b> he joined Dean O'Banion's North Side Gang, which {{had taken over the}} formerly legal breweries and distilleries {{in that part of the}} city giving them massive profits from illicit production of alcohol, in addition to shakedowns and other rackets. Often described as mainly Irish-American, after O'Banion's death the North Side Gang was successively headed by Hymie Weiss, Drucci and Bugs Moran who were respectively of Polish, Italian and French descent, while the most influential members who never became leader were Louis Alterie, of Spanish parentage, Samuel Morton who was from a Jewish background, and the German Albert Kachellek.|$|E
5000|$|More moves, items, and {{interactivity}} between {{characters and}} the environment are also possible in the Game Gear game. Upon defeating an enemy, the player can choose to have Ristar use an enemy's hat as a weapon, or use its leftover spear as a stepping point when plunged into a wall, allowing Ristar to reach previously out-of-reach higher areas. A [...] "red star" [...] item gives Ristar temporary invincibility, speeds up his movement, increases his jump speed, and allows him to damage enemy upon contact. Colored square boxes, similar to the <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> in the Super Mario series, are also only present in this version, and like with enemies, they are eliminated by using the [...] "headbutt" [...] attack rather than by jumping into them.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{numerous}} {{tray and lid}} compartments in Victorian trunks, ranging from basic to complex. A basic tray system comprised a hat box, a shirt compartment, a <b>coin</b> <b>box,</b> and a document box. A complex tray system, however, could consist two hat boxes, several other shirt compartments, a <b>coin</b> <b>box,</b> several document boxes and even secret compartments strategically placed so that people of unwanted access would pass up if not wary. Beautiful lithographs would be placed over the lids or dome of the trunk and truly capture the Victorian aesthetic of that day. There {{were numerous}} chromolithographs that a trunk maker could use, {{and they could be}} indicative of who the trunk was intended for, such as ladies or men. A bride's chest usually had a lot of floral pictures or lithographs of other ladies, while men's had pictures of [...] "village" [...] or country scenes. It was up to the malletier what to put on the lids and trays.|$|R
50|$|The {{establishment}} of Digital Library is in process. It has the Open Access System {{and also the}} OPAC System which will surely help to render more effective service to the students and staff.A special provision is made to help poor, deserving, SC and ST students by providing one set of books for one complete year. The library is provided with audio, video, Internet. Xerox and <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> telephone facilities.|$|R
50|$|Used {{to collect}} offerings, a saisen box is in essence a {{standard}} <b>coin</b> <b>box,</b> {{except that the}} top cover is a grate. This design allows coins to be tossed in, while still preventing the money to be retrieved easily. Those with better designs typically have grates made of round bars, or have their top surfaces act as a slope, allowing the money to slide into the box easily.|$|R
50|$|By {{the last}} half of the 1970s, more than a million Magic Fingers units had been {{installed}} in American and European hotels and houses. The devices started to seem out of date and somewhat sleazy, because of the bed's association with seedy motels, and their popularity declined starting in the 1980s as other in-room entertainment options became available and theft of money from the <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> started to become more common. Houghtaling sold the rights to the Magic Fingers name after he retired in the 1980s, with the new owner manufacturing units for home use at the time of his death in 2009. Though the devices are rarely seen in the 21st century, they were still available in motels in the Western United States at the time of his death.|$|E
5000|$|The {{need for}} a fund to benefit colleagues who fell on hard times was seen {{by many in the}} early days of motion pictures. It began with <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> at studios, where {{industry}} workers would drop their spare change for their colleagues. The MPTF was created by such industry luminaries as Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Conrad Nagel, Milton Sills, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and D. W. Griffith. In 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was incorporated with Joseph M. Schenck as first president, Pickford was vice president and the Reverend Neal Dodd (who portrayed ministers in more than 300 films) as administrator, each with a benevolent spirit intent on providing assistance to those in the motion picture industry who were in need. The original Board of Trustees included prominent names in Hollywood such as Charles Christie, Cecil B. DeMille, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., William S. Hart, Jesse L. Lasky, Harold Lloyd, Mae Murray, Hal Roach, Donald Crisp and Irving Thalberg.|$|E
5000|$|The paper's humour style {{reflects}} its motto: [...] "Sola Veritas Est Qui Facit Ut Me in Merda", {{which translates}} to [...] "Only The Truth Gets Me In Shit". Its printed humour is diverse, running {{the gamut from}} absurdist sketches and short stories to political satire and commentary on current events. Practical jokes have also figured prominently in its history, and are typically revealed in subsequent issues. Published parodies have included Queen's Journal (often appearing more than 24 hours early {{to coincide with the}} Journals publication day), the Queen's Gazette (for faculty and staff), the Kingston Whig-Standard, and a national newspaper, The Globe and Mail. (When parodied in the 1980s, The Globe and Mail itself reported that the engineers had actually inserted the ersatz versions into the <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> in the Globes own lobby.) In September 1989, the masthead staff stole the Greasepole (an engineering icon) from the first year students charged with protecting it - and ransomed it back to them for 100 cases of beer. The paper maintains a friendly rivalry with the Journal.|$|E
50|$|Dated {{from the}} distant 1920s, {{it was the}} {{installation}} of the first public access telephones in Brazil. The population of the country then reached, back then, 30,635,605 inhabitants. Equipped with a <b>coin</b> <b>box,</b> adapted to a common apparatus, these semi-public telephones were found in commercial establishments that signed a contract with Companhia Telefônica Brasileira, a Canadian-owned company that was then responsible for telephony in the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais.|$|R
50|$|Some {{cabinets}} {{are constructed}} entirely by hobbyists to mimic an arcade cabinet using emulators such as MAME and a PC {{to replace the}} game hardware. These home built cabinets have many {{of the features of}} real arcade cabinets (such as a <b>coin</b> <b>box,</b> marquees etc.). MAME arcade units can combine several arcade controls (such as two types of joysticks and a trackball) in one unit to enable play of many different games.|$|R
50|$|Phone tokens {{started in}} Chicago, where public phones would accept only tokens. These {{were used in}} the U.S. until 1944 when they were {{eliminated}} and most of the tokens were melted down to make shell casings. The earliest-known telephone token dates from 1885, when it was produced for the PAN Telephone Company in Saint Louis, Missouri. Rather than being deposited in the phone, the token was given to an attendant or placed in a <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> {{to gain access to the}} phone booth.|$|R
5000|$|Fancy Pants Adventures {{features}} Fancy Pants Man as the playable {{character of}} the series. He is a two dimensional stick figure with spiky, choppy hair, wearing only a pair of colored triangular-shaped pants. Fancy Pants Mans home is Squiggleville, a small country town run by the Mayor (first introduced in World 2).The mayor is introduced more in World 3. Players guide Fancy Pants Man through open levels which feature obstacles to overcome and enemies to avoid or defeat. These enemies include spiders, snails, and mice armed with guns. Enemies can be defeated by being jumped upon and crushed by Fancy Pants Man, who can also launch off them to perform an augmented leap. World 2 introduced the snail enemy, which retracts into its shell when jumped on, after which it can be kicked to stun other enemies. Originally the snail shell was merely a novelty feature in the World 2 demo; however, during development, BETA testers made a game out of getting the snail shell to hard-to-reach spots. Brad used this as inspiration to incorporate [...] "Snail Shell Golf" [...] which adds replayability to World 2 by allowing the player {{to gain access to}} different colored pants for the playable character. It is possible to earn a combo by keeping the snail shell in the air. As Fancy Pants Man runs through the different levels, there are many [...] "squiggles" [...] floating in mid-air. They serve two important functions. Firstly, they refill Fancy Pants Mans life meter by 5% if he has been damaged, and they also give the player an extra life for every hundred collected. In the source code, these [...] "squiggles" [...] are referred to as [...] "coins"; possibly as a reference to Nintendos Mario video game series. Another possible reference to the Mario franchise {{comes in the form of}} a box which can be jumped at from beneath to release several squiggles, like the <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> in many Mario games. Similarly, Sonic the Hedgehog styled [...] "S-Tubes" [...] made an appearance in some levels of Fancy Pants, controlling in almost the same manner, with Fancy Pants rolling down the tunnel. Both worlds of Fancy Pants Adventures contain different kinds of small trophies that can be collected while playing the game. At the end of each world of Fancy Pants Adventures players fight a boss. In World 1 the boss is an angry penguin, who Fancy Pants Man accidentally falls upon and wakes from sleeping. This is the extent of the story in World 1, while World 2 has a more significant plotline. In World 2 an angry rabbit steals Fancy Pants Mans ice cream. Players must pursue and ultimately defeat the rabbit in a confrontation at the end of the game in order to reclaim the ice cream. In World 3, his sister, Cutie Pants, is kidnapped by pirates because she defeats their captain, and want to make her captain. The first time Fancy Pants tries to bring her back, she doesnt want to leave, and has assumed the role of [...] "Princess Pirate". The second time, though, she agrees to come home because, she saw ninjas and pirates hate ninjas.|$|E

40|$|Payphones, {{parking meters}} and vending {{machines}} illustrate the modern business practice of substituting manpower with machinery. These do not eliminate manual labor completely, {{for it is}} still needed to replace full coin-boxes and to stock vending machines. This makes fill-time prediction of such coin-boxes an important problem. There are risks to both underand over-estimation. This paper suggests methods to predict, with desired accuracy, the fill-time for such <b>coin</b> <b>boxes.</b> The methodology uses collection history and specifies common prior distributions over average daily fill-rate and standard deviation at each box. The methodology is implemented and tested on data collected on 11, 308 payphones over a large geographical region. When the desired accuracy is 95 %, our methods provide better optimal fill-rate predictions than current methods in at least 69. 9 % of the cases. This translates into an average potential collection cost reduction of at least 21 %. Ranjan Maitra is Assis [...] ...|$|E

5000|$|On Saturday 20 January 1973 at 15:08, a male caller with an English accent {{rang the}} {{telephone}} exchange in Exchequer Street, Dublin, {{with the following}} bomb warning: [...] "Listen love, there is a bomb in O'Connell Street at the Bridge". Although the call was placed from a <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> in the Dublin area, the exact location was never determined. The telephonist immediately contacted the Garda Síochána. The streets of central Dublin were more crowded than usual as Ireland was playing the All Blacks at an international rugby match being held that afternoon in Lansdowne Road.|$|R
5000|$|At {{exactly the}} same time the carbomb detonated in Eden Quay, the Belfast Newsletter {{received}} a telephone call from a man using a <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> speaking with a [...] "Belfast/English" [...] type of accent. He issued a warning that two bombs would explode in Dublin. He gave the locations as Liberty Hall and Abbey Street behind Clerys department store. The newspaper immediately phoned the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), who in turn relayed the warnings to the Garda Control Room Dublin Castle at 20:08. A team of Gardaí were sent to investigate the area around Sackville Place and Earl Street.|$|R
