The Results show important developments of Forward Markets Commission. <b>Commodity</b> futures and <b>derivatives</b> have a crucial {{role to play in}} the price risk management process, especially in agriculture sector. The significance of <b>commodity</b> <b>derivatives</b> has increased in the current scenario. India has long history of trade in <b>commodity</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Organized <b>commodity</b> <b>derivatives</b> in India started as early as 1875, barely about a decade after they started in Chicago.

40|$|Financial {{investors and}} {{commodity}} markets 1 Commodities have attracted considerable interest {{as a financial}} investment in recent years. This article discusses the factors behind their growing appeal and assesses {{the extent to which}} market characteristics, such as price volatility, have changed as a result.

JEL classification: G 11, G 15, Q 41. The sharp increase in commodity prices, especially for energy and base metals since 2002, has gone hand in hand with growing derivatives market activity (Graph 1).

This is problematic given the high volatility and increased short-termism of these markets in the context of financialisation. The effects on producers depend on the market structure in producer countries. Burkina Faso and Mozambique have different types of national cotton price stabilization schemes in place while global coffee price fluctuations are transmitted directly to producers in Ethiopia.

40|$|This article {{documents}} the massive increase in trading in <b>commodity</b> <b>derivatives</b> {{over the past}} decadeâ€”growth that far outstrips the growth in commodity production {{and the need for}} derivatives to hedge risk by commercial producers and users of commodities. During the past decade, many institutional portfolio managers added <b>commodity</b> <b>derivatives</b> as an asset class to their portfolios. This addition {{was part of a larger}} shift in portfolio strategy away from traditional equity investment and toward derivatives based on assets such as real estate and commodities. Institu - tional investorsâ€™ use of commodity futures to hedge against stock market risk is a relatively recent phenomenon. Trading in <b>commodity</b> <b>derivatives</b> also increased along with the rapid expansion of trading in all derivative markets. This trading was directly related to the search for higher yields in a low interest rate environment. The growth was both in organized exchanges and over-thecounter (OTC) trading, but the gross market value of OTC trading was an order of magnitude greater. This growth is important to note because a critical factor in the recent crisis was counterparty failure in OTC trading of mortgage derivatives...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that <b>commodity</b> <b>derivatives</b> speculation contributed to extraordinary patterns of grain price volatility {{that led to}} a global food crisis in 2007 â€“ 11. People in countries throughout the world are increasingly dependent on international commodity markets for access to food. Almost everywhere, now, the value of food is determined by a single condensed symbol of its worthâ€”its price. Persuaded of the need to ensure that this measure of value is not put at risk of distortion in the pursuit of financial profit, governments in the US and in the EU are now implementing new regulations designed to curb â€˜excessiveâ€™ levels of speculation in derivative markets. Carrying out an analysis of these regulatory measures, the article demonstrates that both sets of reforms suffer from a critical limitation: They are predicated on an inaccurate understanding of how activity in <b>commodity</b> <b>derivative</b> markets can impact on underlying food prices. If the new regulations for <b>commodity</b> <b>derivative</b> markets are not up to the task, as this article argues that they are not, a more fundamental revision of global economic structures may be required if the basic needs of human beings are not to be subsumed to the interests of financial capital in the years to come...|$|R

40|$|Liberalization in {{commodity}} markets {{has brought}} profound {{changes in the}} way price risks are allocated and managed in commodity subsectors. Price risks are increasingly allocated to private traders and farmers rather than absorbed by the government. The success of market reform depends on the ability of the emerging private sector to make full use of the available range of modern commodity marketing, price risk management and financing instruments. Because farmers do not generally have access to these instruments, intermediaries must be developed. Larger private traders and banks are {{in the best position to}} become these intermediaries. Preconditions needed for accessing modern commodity marketing, price risk management, and financing instruments are: a) creating an appropriate legal, regulatory, and institutional framework; b) reducing government intervention; c) providing training and raising awareness; and d) improving creditworthiness and reducing performance risk. The use of <b>commodity</b> <b>derivative</b> instruments to hedge commodity price risk is not new. The private sectors in many Asian and Latin American countries have been using commodity futures and options for some time.
