5000|$|As a {{bacterium}} {{there are some}} physical attributes that are common for all bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria consists of an external plasma membrane, followed by periplasmic space and finally a peptidoglycan layer, which faces {{the interior of the}} bacteria. The external plasma membrane is very important for bacteria because this is how cells recognize the possible pathogenesis of the bacteria. Peptidoglycan is also called murein and is made up of a series of sugars. Within gram-positive bacteria the peptidoglycan layer is much thicker than gram-negative bacteria. The actual lattice that comprises peptidoglycan {{is referred to as the}} S-layer; this lattice is linked to the peptidoglycan layer. Unfortunately, the S-layer is normally lost when processing the bacteria under laboratory conditions, which can affect measuring adhesion. When the S-layer is dissolved with high concentration levels of substances that break down hydrogen bonds the S-layers have a survival time of about 20 minutes with each generation. L.brevis contains approximately two promotors within this area, meaning that there is significant transcription of the S-layer by high levels of transcribing of the sIpA gene. [...] SipA is a gene that has been found to aid in the coding for the production of murin (peptidoglycan) within the bacteria. The purpose of transcription is to <b>copy</b> <b>DNA</b> into a mRNA, which is used to create proteins. The promoter is used during transcription to identify the appropriate location to begin transcribing.

40|$|New {{methods have}} been applied to the {{determination}} of single <b>copy</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence differences between the sea urchin species Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, S. franciscanus, S. drobachiensis, and Lytechinus pictus. The thermal stability of interspecies DNA duplexes was measured in a solvent (2. 4 M tetraethylammonium chloride) that suppresses the effect of base composition on melting temperature. The lengths of duplexes were measured after digestion with S 1 nuclease and correction made for the effect of length on thermal stability. The degree of base substitution that {{has occurred in the}} single <b>copy</b> <b>DNA</b> during sea urchin evolution is significantly larger than indicated by earlier measurements.

40|$|The {{observation}} that repetitive and single copy sequences are interspersed in animal DNAs {{has suggested that}} repetitive sequences are adjacent to single copy structural gene sequences. To test this concept, single <b>copy</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences contiguous to interspersed repetitive sequences were prepared from sea urchin DNA by hydroxyapatite fractionation (repeat-contiguous DNA fraction). These single copy sequences included about {{one third of the}} total nonrepetitive sequence in the genome as determined by the amounts recovered during the hydroxyapatite fractionation and by reassociation kinetics. 3 H-labeled mRNA from sea urchin gastrula was prepared by puromycin release from polysomes and used in DNA-driven hybridization reactions. The kinetics of mRNA hybridization reactions with excess whole DNA were carefully measured, and the rate of hybridization was found to be 3 – 5 times slower than the corresponding single <b>copy</b> <b>DNA</b> driver reassociation rate. The mRNA hybridized with excess repeat-contiguous DNA with similar kinetics relative to the driver DNA. At completion 80 % of that mRNA hybridizable with whole DNA (approximately 65 %) had reacted with the repeat-contiguous DNA fraction (50 %). This result shows that 80 – 100 % of the mRNA molecules present in sea urchin embryos are transcribed from single <b>copy</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences adjacent to interspersed repetitive sequences in the genome...|$|E

At a standard criterion for reassociation (0. 12 M phosphate buffer, 60 ° C, hydroxyapatite binding) we observe the following extents of reaction and reductions in thermal stability for single <b>copy</b> <b>DNA</b> reassociation between Strongylocentrotus purpuratus tracer and heterologous driver DNA: S. dröbachiensis 68 % and 2. 5 °C; S. franciscanus 51 % and 3. 5 ° C; Lytechinus pictus 12 % and 7. 5 ° C. The implied extents of sequence relatedness {{are consistent with}} the phylogenetic relationships of these species. The rate of single copy sequence divergence in the evolutionary lines leading to the Strongylocentrotus species is estimated to be 0. 06 – 0. 35 % per million years. The rate of divergence of total single copy sequence has been compared to that of structural gene sequences represented in S. purpuratus gastrula polysomal messenger RNA. When closely related species, S. purpuratus and S. franciscanus, are compared, these polysomal sequences are found to diverge at a lower rate than does the total single copy sequence. For two very distantly related species, S. purpuratus and L. pictus, {{a small fraction of the}} single <b>copy</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence is probably conserved.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the change-point {{inference}} problem {{motivated by the}} genomic data that were collected {{for the purpose of}} monitoring <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number changes. <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number changes or copy number variations (CNVs) correspond to chromosomal aberrations and signify abnormality of a cell. Cancer development or other related diseases are usually relevant to <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number changes on the genome. There are inherited random noises in such data, therefore, {{there is a need to}} employ an appropriate statistical model for identifying statistically significant <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number changes. This type of statistical inference is evidently crucial in cancer researches, clinical diagnostic applications, and other related genomic researches. For the high-throughput genomic data resulting from <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number experiments, a mean and variance change point model (MVCM) for detecting the CNVs is appropriate. We propose to use a Bayesian approach to study the MVCM for the cases of one change and propose to use a sliding window to search for all CNVs on a given chromosome. We carry out simulation studies to evaluate the estimate of the locus of the <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number change using the derived posterior probability. These simulation results show that the approach is suitable for identifying copy number changes. The approach is also illustrated on several chromosomes from nine fibroblast cancer cell line data (array-based comparative genomic hybridization data). All <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number aberrations that have been identified and verified by karyotyping are detected by our approach on these cell lines. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Genomic {{instability}} {{with frequent}} <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number alterations {{is one of}} the key hallmarks of carcinogenesis. The chromosomal regions with frequent <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number gain and loss in human gastric cancer are still poorly defined. It remains unknown how the <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number variations contributes to the changes of gene expression profiles, especially on the global level. Principal Findings: We analyzed <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number alterations in 64 human gastric cancer samples and 8 gastric cancer cell lines using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) arrays based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Statistical analysis was applied to correlate previously published gene expression data obtained from cDNA microarrays with corresponding <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number variation data to identify candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. We found that gastric cancer samples showed recurrent <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number variations, including gains at 5 p, 8 q, 20 p, 20 q, and losses at 4 q, 9 p, 18 q, 21 q. The most frequent regions of amplification were 20 q 12 (7 / 72), 20 q 12 – 20 q 13. 1 (12 / 72), 20 q 13. 1 – 20 q 13. 2 (11 / 72) and 20 q 13. 2 – 20 q 13. 3 (6 / 72). The most frequent deleted region was 9 p 21 (8 / 72). Correlating gene expression array data with aCGH identified 321 candidate oncogenes, which were overexpressed and showed frequent <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number gains; and 12 candidate tumor suppressor genes which were down-regulated and showed frequent <b>DNA</b> <b>copy</b> number losses in human gastric cancers.
