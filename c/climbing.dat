5|$|Hill was a gymnast {{early in}} life, nearly broke {{a world record}} lifting weights, and ran competitively. She took to <b>climbing</b> at a young age, showing a natural {{aptitude}} for the activity, and {{became a part of}} the <b>climbing</b> community in Southern California and Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley. She traveled around the United States during the early 1980s <b>climbing</b> increasingly difficult routes and setting records for first female ascents and for first ascents. From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's most accomplished sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1992, Hill left competitive <b>climbing</b> and returned to her first love: traditional <b>climbing.</b> She set for herself the challenge of free <b>climbing</b> The Nose of El Capitan, her greatest <b>climbing</b> feat. Hill continues to climb and has not stopped taking on ambitious climbs. As of 2013, she was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company and owned a small business that offered <b>climbing</b> courses.|$|E
5|$|The Black Canyon is {{a center}} for rock <b>climbing</b> in a style known as {{traditional}} <b>climbing.</b> Most of the climbs are difficult and attempted only by advanced climbers.|$|E
50|$|Individual topo {{gives the}} {{approximate}} {{shape of the}} route, the important rock formations close to the route and details of the grade and protection of each section of the <b>climb.</b> Topo guides usually also include {{the length of the}} <b>climbs,</b> where exactly each <b>climb</b> starts, and how to get to the area of the <b>climbs.</b> It will usually specify if a <b>climb</b> is a sport <b>climb</b> (with fixed protection) or a trad <b>climb</b> (traditional, e.g. needing gear to install protection during <b>climb).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The main fundraiser AFCA {{utilizes}} {{to fulfill}} its mission is called <b>Climb</b> Up So Kids Can Grow Up. This fundraiser consists of outdoor events, which cater to individuals of any age or ability: <b>Climb</b> Up: Kilimanjaro, <b>Climb</b> Up: Nigeria, <b>Climb</b> Up: Nepal, <b>Climb</b> Up: New Zealand and <b>Climb</b> Up: Peru {{are some of the}} events currently supporting AFCA's work.|$|R
50|$|Pierre Rolland scored {{points on}} more <b>climbs</b> {{than any other}} rider; on a total of 18 <b>climbs,</b> {{compared}} to the King of the Mountains Nairo Quintana, who scored points on only 6 <b>climbs.</b> However, the <b>climbs</b> that Quintana scored points on included {{all three of the}} Hors Category <b>climbs</b> that were at stage finishes - the <b>climbs</b> that offered the most amount of points. Of the <b>climbs</b> the riders placed in the points for, Quintana averaged 24.5 points per <b>climb,</b> compared to Rolland who averaged just 6.6 points. In total, Quintana won 97% of his points on Hors Category <b>climbs,</b> Chris Froome 79%, Rodriguez 92%, Riblon 88% and Nieve 86%, compared to Rolland who only won 48% of his points on HC <b>climbs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Additionally, solo climbers must {{fill out}} a solo <b>climbing</b> request form and receive written {{permission}} from the Superintendent before attempting to climb.|$|E
5|$|Artificial <b>climbing</b> {{walls are}} used to {{simulate}} boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at <b>climbing</b> gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{is a form}} of rock <b>climbing</b> that is {{performed}} on large boulders, small rock formations or artificial rock walls, without the use of ropes or harnesses. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use <b>climbing</b> shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo <b>climbing,</b> which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20ft.) tall. Artificial <b>climbing</b> walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders. Bouldering competitions, which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.|$|E
50|$|From the west, the <b>climb</b> {{starts at}} Thônes, {{from where the}} summit is 12.8 km. Over this distance, the road <b>climbs</b> 842 m at an average {{gradient}} of 6.6%. En route, the <b>climb</b> passes through the village of Manigod. This is the <b>climb</b> used on the 2013 Tour de France, although the race turns onto the <b>climb</b> shortly before reaching Thônes, thus shortening the <b>climb</b> to 11.3 km at 7%; the <b>climb</b> is ranked category 1.|$|R
50|$|The <b>climb</b> phase, {{also known}} as <b>climb</b> out, of a typical flight of an {{aircraft}} is the period during which the aircraft <b>climbs</b> to a predetermined cruising altitude after take-off. The <b>climb</b> phase immediately follows take-off and precedes the cruise phase of the flight. Although a single <b>climb</b> phase is typical, multiple <b>climb</b> phases may alternate with cruise phases, particularly for very long flights in which altitude is increased as the weight of fuel aboard decreases (see step <b>climb).</b>|$|R

5|$|By the mid-1930s, {{more than}} a dozen {{different}} <b>climbing</b> routes had been established on Grand Teton including the northeast ridge in 1931 by Glenn Exum. Glenn Exum teamed up with another noted climber named Paul Petzoldt to found the Exum Mountain Guides in 1931. Of the other major peaks on the Teton Range, all were climbed by the late 1930s including Mount Moran in 1922 and Mount Owen in 1930 by Fritiof Fryxell and others after numerous previous attempts had failed. Both Middle and South Teton were first climbed on the same day, August 29, 1923, by a group of climbers led by Albert R. Ellingwood. New routes on the peaks were explored as safety equipment and skills improved and eventually climbs rated at above 5.9 on the Yosemite Decimal System difficulty scale were established on Grand Teton. The classic climb following the route first pioneered by Owen, known as the Owen-Spalding route, is rated at 5.4 due a combination of concerns beyond the gradient alone. Rock <b>climbing</b> and bouldering had become popular in the park by the mid 20th century. In the late 1950s, gymnast John Gill came to the park and started <b>climbing</b> large boulders near Jenny Lake. Gill approached <b>climbing</b> from a gymnastics perspective and while in the Tetons became the first known climber in history to use gymnastic chalk to improve handholds and to keep hands dry while <b>climbing.</b> During the latter decades of the 20th century, extremely difficult cliffs were explored including some in Death Canyon, and by the mid-1990s, 800 different <b>climbing</b> routes had been documented for the various peaks and canyon cliffs.|$|E

50|$|In aviation, {{the top of}} <b>climb,</b> also {{referred}} to as the TOC or T/C, is the computed transition from the <b>climb</b> phase of a flight to the cruise phase, {{the point at which the}} planned <b>climb</b> to cruise altitude is completed. The top of <b>climb</b> is usually calculated by an on-board flight management system, and is designed to provide the most economical <b>climb</b> to cruise altitude, or to meet some other objective (fastest <b>climb,</b> greatest range, etc.). The top of <b>climb</b> may be calculated manually with considerable effort.|$|R
50|$|Carlyle, Lamb's son, first <b>climbed</b> Longs Peak in 1879 and <b>climbed</b> Longs Peak 146 {{times over}} 40 years. Lamb's second wife, who <b>climbed</b> the peak on her 70th birthday, {{and his son}} often <b>climbed</b> the peak with him.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, for which points were awarded for reaching {{the top of a}} <b>climb</b> before other riders. Each <b>climb</b> was categorised as either first, second, or third-category, with more points available for the more difficult, higher-categorised <b>climbs.</b> For first-category <b>climbs,</b> the top six riders earned points; on second-category <b>climbs,</b> four riders won points; on third-category <b>climbs,</b> only the top three riders earned points. The leadership of the mountains classification was marked by a pink jersey.|$|R

5|$|Mossy fibers project {{directly}} to the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei. <b>Climbing</b> fibers project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals {{directly to}} the deep nuclei. The mossy fiber and <b>climbing</b> fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|E
5|$|Mountain <b>climbing</b> on Mount Rainier is difficult, {{involving}} traversing {{the largest}} glaciers in the U.S. south of Alaska. Most climbers require {{two to three}} days to reach the summit, with a success rate of approximately 50%. <b>Climbing</b> teams require experience in glacier travel, self-rescue, and wilderness travel. About 8,000 to 13,000people attempt the climb each year, about 90% via routes from Camp Muir on the southeast flank.|$|E
50|$|This {{measures}} {{the difficulty of}} mixed <b>climbs</b> combining ice and rock. Mixed <b>climbs</b> have recently been <b>climbed</b> and graded as high as M14.|$|R
50|$|The HC <b>climb</b> is {{the most}} {{difficult}} type of <b>climb</b> in a race. It is more demanding than a Category 1 <b>climb</b> which in turn is more demanding than a Category 2 <b>climb</b> and so on. The easiest category is Category 4.|$|R

5|$|One of Glynne's main {{interests}} was mountaineering {{and rock}} <b>climbing,</b> although {{her family did}} not support the hobby, as her mother's cousin, Owen Glynne Jones {{died at the age of}} 32 in a <b>climbing</b> accident on Dent Blanche. Despite this, Glynne climbed throughout her life, including in Australia and New Zealand whilst she was touring there. She recorded the second ever ascent of Mount Spencer in New Zealand, the first by a woman. When she returned to Europe, she climbed major Alpine peaks such as Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, La Meije and Aiguille du Dru in the 1930s. She carried on <b>climbing</b> into her 60s, ascending Mount Fuji in Japan in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The Snowdon Massif {{includes}} {{a number of}} cliffs, and holds an important place {{in the history of}} rock <b>climbing</b> in the United Kingdom. Clogwyn Du'r Arddu is often colloquially known as 'Cloggy' among climbers, and was the site of the first recorded climb in Britain, in 1798. It was carried out by Peter Bailey Williams and William Bingley, while searching for rare plants. It is now considered {{to be one of the}} best cliffs in Britain for rock <b>climbing.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, for which points were awarded for reaching {{the top of a}} <b>climb</b> before other riders.

The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awards more points than the other first-category <b>climbs,</b> with nine riders scoring points. At 2757 m, the Cima Coppi for the 2017 Giro d'Italia is the Stelvio Pass.|$|R
5|$|The Three Sisters are {{a popular}} <b>climbing</b> {{destination}} for hikers and mountaineers. The United States Forest Service requires permits for use from Memorial Day until {{the beginning of}} September, and dogs must be kept on leashes on the Green Lakes, Moraine Lakes, South Sister, Soda Creek, Todd Lake, and Crater Ditch trails from July 15 through September 15. Horses are prohibited, and ice axes are required during the winter <b>climbing</b> season for safety reasons.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of neurons {{in the deep}} nuclei have large cell bodies and spherical dendritic trees with a radius of about 400μm, and use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. These cells project {{to a variety of}} targets outside the cerebellum. Intermixed with them are a lesser number of small cells, which use GABA as a neurotransmitter and project exclusively to the inferior olivary nucleus, the source of <b>climbing</b> fibers. Thus, the nucleo-olivary projection provides an inhibitory feedback to match the excitatory projection of <b>climbing</b> fibers to the nuclei. There is evidence that each small cluster of nuclear cells projects to the same cluster of olivary cells that send <b>climbing</b> fibers to it; there is strong and matching topography in both directions.|$|E
50|$|These five {{categories}} {{are defined by}} their steepness and length. In addition, their position on the route can play a role. For instance, a <b>climb</b> that would normally be a Category 1 <b>climb</b> can become a HC <b>climb</b> {{if it is the}} final <b>climb</b> of a stage.|$|R
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, the leadership of which was marked by a red and white polka-dot jersey.
