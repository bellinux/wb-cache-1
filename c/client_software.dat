Later, lwIP was integrated into the ReactOS's network stack.

5|$|The V7 {{client is}} {{the seventh and}} latest {{generation}} of the Folding@home <b>client</b> <b>software,</b> and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It was released on March22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.|$|E

XSS vulnerabilities (even in other applications running on the same domain) allow attackers to bypass CSRF prevention efforts.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the rise}} of thin client {{computing}} using HTML as an intermediate format has reduced the need for ODBC. Many web development platforms contain direct links to target databases – MySQL being very common. In these scenarios, {{there is no direct}} client-side access nor multiple <b>client</b> <b>software</b> systems to support; everything goes through the programmer-supplied HTML application. The virtualization that ODBC offers is no longer a strong requirement, and development of ODBC is no longer as active as it once was.|$|E
25|$|Many Internet service providers, {{and many}} other Internet sites, operate news servers for their users to access. ISPs that do not operate their own servers {{directly}} will often offer their users an account from another provider that specifically operates newsfeeds. In early news implementations, the server and newsreader were a single program suite, running on the same system. Today, one uses separate newsreader <b>client</b> <b>software,</b> a program that resembles an email client but accesses Usenet servers instead. Some clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird and Outlook Express provide both abilities.|$|E

25|$|Mirabilis is an Israeli {{start-up}} which pioneered {{instant messaging}} (IM) and {{was bought by}} America Online. By giving away their ICQ product for free and preventing interoperability between their <b>client</b> <b>software</b> and other products, {{they were able to}} temporarily dominate the market for instant messaging. Because of the network effect, new IM users gained much more value by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and join its large network of users) than they would using a competing system. As was typical for that era, the company never made any attempt to generate profits from their dominant position before selling the company.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} are {{individual}} utilities that allow a user {{to take control}} of a remote computer over the network. In case of Remote Assistance, the remote user needs to receive an invitation and the control is cooperative. In case of RDC, however, the remote user opens a new session on the remote computer and has every power granted by its user account's rights and restrictions. Fast User Switching allows users to switch between user accounts on the local computer without quitting software and logging out. Fast User Switching is part of Winlogon and uses RDS to accomplish its switching feature. Third-party developers have also created <b>client</b> <b>software</b> for RDS. For example, rdesktop supports Unix platforms.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} security {{provided by}} Acrobat PDF {{consists of two}} different methods and two different passwords: a user password, which encrypts the file and prevents opening, and an owner password, which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted, which can include modifying, printing, or copying text and graphics out of the document, or adding or modifying text notes and AcroForm fields. The user password encrypts the file, while the owner password does not, instead relying on <b>client</b> <b>software</b> to respect these restrictions. An owner password can easily be removed by software, including some free online services. Thus, the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed; this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.|$|E

25|$|The various {{services}} are currently not interoperable, though those {{that use the}} same DRM system (for instance the several Windows Media DRM format stores, including Napster, Kazaa and Yahoo Music) all provide songs that can be played side-by-side through the same player program. Almost all stores require <b>client</b> <b>software</b> of some sort to be downloaded, and some also need plug-ins. Several colleges and universities, such as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, have made arrangements with assorted Internet music suppliers to provide access (typically DRM-restricted) to music files for their students, to less than universal popularity, sometimes making payments from student activity fee funds. One {{of the problems is}} that the music becomes unplayable after leaving school unless the student continues to pay individually. Another is that few of these vendors are compatible with the most common portable music player, the Apple iPod. The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property (to HMG in the UK; 141 pages, 40+ specific recommendations) has taken note of the incompatibilities, and suggests (Recommendations 8—12) that there be explicit fair dealing exceptions to copyright allowing libraries to copy and format-shift between DRM schemes, and further allowing end users to do the same privately. If adopted, some acrimony may decrease.|$|E

PokerTracker reads these files and extracts the relevant information, which it converts into a database for later review or statistical analysis. [...] The software is capable of combining hand history details of multiple accounts from different online poker services, which allows a user to aggregate his or her data. Statistical summaries can be consolidated from different poker sites regardless of whether the user's screen name is the same at each site.|$|E
