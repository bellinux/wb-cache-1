5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and <b>contrast.</b> According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to <b>contrast,</b> infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and <b>contrast</b> is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain <b>contrast</b> in their own word use.|$|E

A generalization of these <b>contrasts</b> is proposed: it aims at obtaining <b>contrasts</b> with improved statistical performances. A link with existing time-domain <b>contrasts</b> is established.

40|$|Fruit color {{changes during}} {{ripening}} are typically {{viewed as an}} adaptation to increase signal efficacy to seed dispersers. Plants can increase signal efficacy by enhancing chromatic (wavelength related) and/or achromatic (intensity related) <b>contrasts</b> between fruit and background. To assess how these <b>contrasts</b> determine the detectability of fruit signals, we conducted 2 experiments with free-flying crows (Corvus ossifragus) under semi-natural conditions in a 2025 m 2 aviary. Crows searched first for artificial red and black fruits and detected red fruits from a larger distance. Because artificial red fruits had higher chromatic and lower achromatic <b>contrasts</b> against foliage than artificial black fruits, crows apparently prioritized chromatic <b>contrasts.</b> Thus, the common change in fruit color from red to black during ripening does not increase signal efficacy to crows. In a second trial, crows searched for UV-reflecting and black blueberries (Vaccinum myrtillus) against backgrounds of foliage and sand. Against foliage, UV-reflecting berries had higher chromatic and achromatic <b>contrasts</b> than black berries, and crows detected them from a larger distance. Against sand, UV-reflecting berries had low achromatic <b>contrasts</b> and black berries low chromatic <b>contrasts.</b> Crows detected both fruit types equally, suggesting that they used chromatic <b>contrasts</b> to detect UV-reflecting berries and achromatic <b>contrasts</b> to detect black berries. Birds prioritized chromatic <b>contrasts</b> when searching for artificial red fruits in foliage but not when searching for blueberries on sand. We suggest that {{the relative importance of}} chromatic and achromatic <b>contrasts</b> is contingent on the chromatic and achromatic variance of the background. Models of signal perception can be improved by incorporating background-specific effects...|$|R

This paper introduces a twostage process that {{works from the}} premise that an appropriate goal for regional models is to produce reasonable behavior over dominant environmental gradients. We demonstrate two techniques for <b>contrasting</b> models with data, one based on the shape of modeled relationships (functional <b>contrasts)</b> and the other based on {{an examination of the}} residuals (residual <b>contrasts)</b> between the model and an empirically derived surface fit to field data. Functional <b>contrasts</b> evaluated the differences between the response of simulated net primary production (NPP) to climate variables and the response observed in field measurements of NPP. Residual <b>contrasts</b> compared deviations of NPP from the empirical surface to identify groupings (for example, vegetation classes, geographic regions) with model deviations {{different from those of the}} field data.

Two languages, Arabic and Japanese, which utilize vowel duration contrastively, were examined.

A group of Australian English (OZ) speakers who do not know either Arabic or Japanese participated as a control group. Despite the expectation that native listeners positively transfer and generalize the L 1 knowledge to process unknown languages with equivalent phonetic characteristics, both the NA and NJ groups were clearly less accurate in discriminating vowel length <b>contrasts</b> in unknown languages. Further, they showed no advantage over the OZ listeners who have limited experience with vowel length <b>contrasts</b> in their L 1. These results suggest that, not only for stop place <b>contrasts</b> examined previously, but also for vowel length <b>contrasts,</b> experience with specific phonetic <b>contrasts</b> may not be sufficient for attaining truly nativelike discrimination accuracy. 16 page(s...|$|R
