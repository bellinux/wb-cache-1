40|$|Chronic lateral epicondylalgia (LE) is {{a common}} {{musculoskeletal}} condition which {{has been associated with}} the presence of distinct local sensorimotor abnormalities. Despite this, little is known about central motor system function and forearm/wrist kinesthetic acuity in cases of <b>chronic</b> <b>LE.</b> The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether there are adaptive neurophysiological changes occurring at the corticomotor level in individuals presenting with chronic unilateral lateral epicondylalgia, and whether the same individuals present deficits in proprioceptive acuity for weight discrimination and manual dexterity. Methods. For this descriptive, case-controlled study, 14 individuals with <b>chronic</b> <b>LE</b> and 16 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited. LE-related disability was measured with the quickDASH questionnaire and proprioceptive acuity was estimated by way of a weight discrimination task. The Grooved Pegboard Test was used to derive an index of manual dexterity and transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess four indices of corticomotor excitability in wrist extensor muscles. Results. Proprioceptive acuity was decreased in the affected arms of LE participants (p= 0. 001). There were no differences in manual dexterity or indices of corticomotor excitability between arms (p > 0. 05) for both groups, but manual dexterity of each the affected and unaffected arms was correlated with resting corticomotor thresholds (p= 0. 0001 and p= 0. 04, respectively) a relationship which was not found in the control group. Discussion. Proprioceptive acuity was deteriorated in our sample of <b>chronic</b> <b>LE.</b> Though the clinical significance in this population is unknown, it is hypothesized that such deficits may hamper force perception during functional activities. The relationships existing bilaterally between manual dexterity and motor thresholds suggest that "crossed" modulation of corticomotor excitability may be further influenced by the presence of musculoskeletal dysfunction and/or chronic musculoskeletal pain. While mechanisms responsible for such changes are unclear, these findings merit confirmation in larger patient samples...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the diagnostic performance {{and reliability of}} ultrasonography (US) in detecting and grading common extensor tendon (CET) tear in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis (LE), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the reference standard. The study comprised fifty-eight <b>chronic</b> <b>LE</b> patients. Each patient underwent US and MRI. CET status was classified as: high-grade tear (≥ 50 % thickness), low-grade tear (< 50 % thickness), suspected tear (possible but not evident tear), no tear. Additionally, the following dichotomous scale was used: confirmed or unconfirmed CET tear. Relative US parameters (versus MRI) for detecting CET tear included: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy. The agreement between US and MRI findings was measured using the weighted Cohen kappa coefficient (κ). US showed moderate agreement with MRI in detecting and grading CET tear (κ = 0. 49). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in CET tear detecting by US were 64. 52 %, 85. 19 %, and 72. 73 %, respectively. PPV and NPV of US were 83. 33 % and 67. 65 %, respectively. No patient with unconfirmed CET tear on US had high-grade CET tear on MRI. Ultrasonography is a valuable imaging modality {{that can be used}} as a screening tool to exclude high-grade CET tear in <b>chronic</b> <b>LE</b> patients. Once a tear is evident on US, MRI should be considered to assess precisely the extent of tendon injury...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{literature}} suggests that abnormal sonographic findings of the common extensor origin (hypoechogenicity, neovascularity, calcifications, irregular margin, presence of adjacent fluid, irregular fibrillar pattern, thickness, tear) and of the lateral epicondyle (cortical irregularities) {{can be used to}} confirm the presence of Lateral Epicondylalgia (LE) in elbows which have been initially diagnosed using the clinical diagnosis for LE. The association of these abnormal sonographic findings and the initial clinical diagnosis for LE were studied. Methodology: The participants were recruited in Metro Manila (Philippines) through advertisements and referral by doctors and physiotherapists. LE was determined if participants reported lateral elbow pain on one elbow which was replicated by any of the Cozen’s, Mill’s, or Maudsley’s tests. Acuity of elbow symptoms was determined using six weeks since symptom onset as the time differentiating acute from <b>chronic</b> <b>LE.</b> A prospective blinded sonographic assessment of both elbows of participants was performed using a valid and reliable scanning protocol. Results: Fifty-one participants provided 55 symptomatic and 46 asymptomatic elbows (one elbow ineligible due to congenital shortening).

40|$|Introduction. Patients {{with chronic}} lateral elbow (LE) tendinopathy, {{commonly}} known as tennis elbow, often experience prolonged symptoms and frequent relapses. Astym treatment, evidenced in animal studies to promote the healing and regeneration of soft tissues, is hypothesized to improve outcomes in LE tendinopathy patients. This study had two objectives: (1) to compare the efficacy of Astym treatment to an evidence-based eccentric exercise program (EE) for patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>LE</b> tendinopathy, and (2) to quantify outcomes of subjects non-responsive to EE who were subsequently treated with Astym treatment. Study Design. Prospective, two group, parallel, randomized controlled trial completed at a large orthopedic center in Indiana. Inclusion criteria: age range of 18 – 65 years old, with clinical indications of LE tendinopathy greater than 12 weeks, with no recent corticosteriod injection or disease altering comorbidities. Methods. Subjects with <b>chronic</b> <b>LE</b> tendinopathy (107 subjects with 113 affected elbows) were randomly assigned using computer-generated random number tables to 4 weeks of Astym treatment (57 elbows) or EE treatment (56 elbows). Data collected at baseline, 4, 8, 12 weeks, 6 and 12 months. Primary outcome measure: DASH; secondary outcome measures: pain with activity, maximum grip strength and function. The treating physicians and the rater were blinded; subjects and treating clinicians could not be blinded {{due to the nature}} of the treatments. Results. Resolution response rates were 78. 3 % for the Astym group and 40. 9 % for the EE group. Astym subjects showed greater gains in DASH scores (p = 0. 047) and in maximum grip strength (p = 0. 008) than EE subjects. Astym therapy also resolved 20 / 21 (95. 7 %) of the EE non-responders, who showed improvements in DASH scores (p < 0. 005), pain with activity (p = 0. 002), and function (p = 0. 004) following Astym treatment. Gains continued at 6 and 12 months. No adverse effects were reported. Conclusion. This study suggests Astym therapy is an effective treatment option for patients with LE tendinopathy, as an initial treatment, and after an eccentric exercise program has failed. Registration/Funding. Ball Memorial Hospital provided limited funding. Trial registration was not required by FDAAA 801. Known about the Subject. Under the new paradigm of degenerative tendinopathy, eccentric exercise (EE) is emerging as a first line conservative treatment for LE tendinopathy. EE and Astym treatment are among the few treatment options aiming to improve the degenerative pathophysiology of the tendon. In this trial, Astym therapy, which has shown success in the treatment of tendinopathy, is compared to EE, which has also shown success in the treatment of tendinopathy. Clinical Relevance. There is a need for more effective, conservative treatment options. Based on the current efficacy study, Astym therapy appears to be a promising, non-invasive treatment option...|$|E

Based on this observation, {{we have tried}} to establish a cutaneous LE model of C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) mice, B 6 T cell receptor (TCR) -α–/– mice and B 6 TCR-δ–/– mice treated with FU and/or ultraviolet B light (UVBL) in order to clarify the role of T cells and the cytokine profile of cutaneous lupus lesions. Cutaneous LE-like skin lesions could be induced in TCR-α–/– mice with low FU (0 · 2 mg) plus UVBL, and in B 6 mice treated with a high dose of FU (2 · 0 mg) plus UVBL. In contrast, low FU plus UVBL induced such skin lesions in TCR-δ–/– mice at a very low incidence. Specifically, the skin lesions of TCR-α–/– mice with low FU plus UVBL appeared more rapidly and were more severe than lesions in B 6 mice. The former had the common characteristic features of human <b>chronic</b> cutaneous <b>LE</b> such as typical histology, positive IgG at the dermoepidermal junction, low antinuclear antibody and low mortality.

40|$|Aim: To {{provide an}} {{evidence-based}} scientific {{report on the}} efficacy of three common injection treatment modalities for Lateral Epicondylalgia (LE). These injections are contemporary and frequently used in clinical practice. Objective: To systematically locate and appraise RCTs (Randomised Controlled Trials) of three comparative injection modalities (Corticosteroid Injection (CSI), Platelets Rich Plasma (PRP), and Autologous Blood Injection (ABI) and to review their efficacy {{in the management of}} pain and dysfunction associated with LE. Search strategy: RCTs that compare {{at least two of the}} three injections modalities and published from January 2005 to September 2015 were systematically searched. The following online search engines were utilised: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central), Web of Sciences, PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Academic Search Premier. The following search terms were used: “tennis elbow”, “lateral epicondylitis”, “corticosteroid injection”, “autologous blood injection”, “platelets rich plasma” and “randomised controlled trial”. The terms “tennis elbow” or “lateral epicondylitis” or “lateral epicondylalgia” were combined with each one of the injection modalities and the term “randomised controlled trial”. Methodological assessment was conducted by applying Sign 50 tool and The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias. This systematic review protocol was conducted according to the standards presented in the Cochrane Handbook and recommendations in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Results: Seven RCTs were included within this review. Overall methodological quality was high, mostly level I studies. Three RCTs compared the effects of PRP and ABI, three studies concerned the comparison between PRP and CSI, and one RCT related to the effectiveness of ABI and CSI. Conclusion: Corticosteroid injections failed to demonstrate long-lasting significant clinical effects in <b>chronic</b> <b>LE.</b> However, PRP and ABI were shown to have a progressive and increasing effect from 6 months to one year following the injections. PRP and ABI demonstrated comparable effects in terms of pain and function. Further studies are warranted to justify the higher costs associated with the use of PRP...|$|E
40|$|O lúpus eritematoso (LE) raramente ocorre na infância e, quando aparece, manifesta-se, mais freqüentemente, sob a forma de lúpus eritematoso sistêmico. A forma restrita à pele é extremamente incomum e pode apresentar-se nas variantes lúpus eritematoso discóide, lúpus eritematoso cutâneo subagudo (LECS) e lúpus {{neonatal}} (LN). Em razão dessa raridade e com vistas aos dados reportados na literatura, apresentamos dois casos de lúpus cutâneo em crianças. O caso um refere-se a um paciente masculino, branco, cinco anos, com lesões de pele eritematoso-descamativas, alopecia, artralgia e dificuldade para deambular. O exame neurológico evidenciou paraparesia espástica com sinais de liberação piramidal. O caso dois refere-se a um lactente de um mês, masculino, filho de mãe com LECS, com lesões de pele eritematoso-ovalares presentes ao nascimento, além de anemia, plaquetopenia e evidência ecocardiográfica de canal arterial pérvio. O diagnóstico de LN foi baseado nos dados clínicos, laboratoriais, histopatológico e antecedentes familiares. Concluímos com a apresentação desses casos que, em razão da raridade do lúpus cutâneo na infância, diante de casos suspeitos, deve-se estar atento para o diagnóstico precoce e acompanhamento dos pacientes, de modo a prevenir possíveis complicações e sistematização da doença. Although Lupus Erythematosus (LE) rarely {{occurs in}} childhood {{when it does}} the most frequent form is the systemic one (SLE). Lupus Erythematosus restricted to the skin is particularly rare and can be classified into three variants: <b>chronic</b> discoid <b>LE</b> (CDLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), and neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). Based on literature data and in the rarity of the disease, we present two cases of cutaneous lupus in infants. One case of SCLE started in a four-month child presenting systematization manifested by neurological disorder {{by the age of}} 5 years old; and one of LN. This case refers to a white, male, 5 year-old patient, with multiple round lesions with papulosquamous, alopecia, arthralgias and walking disorder.

In the second case we report neonatal lupus erythematosus in a one-month child, whose mother had SCLE, presenting annular erythematous skin lesions noticed at birth. Other clinical features included anemia, thrombocytopenia and patent ductus arteriosus. The diagnosis of NLE was based on laboratory, histology, and family antecedents clinical data.

Twenty participants with LE, were aged 50. 7 years (SD = 7. 05) and had their condition for 10. 2 months (range 2 - 80) were matched by age and sex to 22 healthy participants. All participants indicated their pressure pain threshold (PPT) over the lateral epicondyle(s) before and during a conditioning noxious heat stimulus was applied over the calf. A conditioned pain modulation (CPM) score was calculated as the difference between the PPT before and during the heat pain-conditioning stimulus expressed as a percentage of PPT before the heat pain-conditioning stimulus. The condition (LE v Control) by Side (Affected v Unaffected) analysis of variance revealed a significant condition effect (p= 0. 001), but not side effect (p= 0. 192) or side by condition interaction effect (p= 0. 951).

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the course and prognosis of cutaneaous LE. 68 patients with cutaneous variants, CDLE and SCLE, were prospectively followed up and examined twice in 1985 - 1994 und 2002 - 2003, with a minimal interval of ten years. Forty-eight women and six men aged 35 - 83 years at the time of the second documentation (SD). Fourteen patients with cutaneous LE died during the observation period. The cause of death of thirteen patients could not be verified, and one patient died due to the sequelae of LE. Prominent cutaneous manifestations of CDLE and SCLE were shown with 88. 9 % of the patients at the first visit (FD) compared to 22. 2 % at the second documentation (SD), whereas the incidence of acrolocalized vasculitis increased (FD 18. 5 %, SD 50 %), as did that of Raynaud phenomenon (FD 17. 3 %, SD 29. 9 %). Mild extracutaneous symptomatology was found in 64. 8 % (FD) and in 53. 7 % (SD) of the patients with cutaneous LE. Arthralgia (FD 22. 2 %, SD 44. 4 %) and symptoms suggesting some involvement of the peripheral or central nervous system (FD 9. 3 %, ZE 20. 4 %) were noted most frequently. In addition a significant correlation between the presence of acrolocalized vasculitis and arthralgia was found (5. 6 % FD, 31. 5 % SD). In order to asses the significance of some clinical and laboratory criteria in the course and prognosis of cutaneous LE, patients were divided in three groups according to the severity of symptoms. The severity of signs at the first documentation determined the grouping of patients. Three groups were classified: low severity (27. 3 % FD, 43. 6 % SD), moderate severity (5, 6 % FD, 1. 8 % SD), high severity (67. 3 % FD, 52. 7 % SD). In 10 to 17 years follow-up 14. 5 % improved, 58. 2 % remained unchanged and 27. 3 % of the patients with cutaneous LE deteriorated and were reclassified into the group with high severity. The aim of this longitudinal study was to assess whether significant clinical and serological parameters are suitable for the prognosis of the severity of clinical signs of LE. The statistical starting point was the univariate statistical analysis, which has been carried out in a cross-sectional study (Tebbe et al. 1997), to asses the value of seven selected variables for distinguishing between the CDLS/SCLE and SLE groups. Assuming that the sum of verified clinical and serological criteria predict a benign or malignant progression, a score value was calculated. From 43 patients, which actually remained in their original severity group or improved, respectively, 35 patients were correctly classified. From eight patients, which changed for the worse and were reclassified into the high severity group, seven were correctly predicted. The establishment of the individual score-value and the grouping according to severity at the first documentation provided for almost all patients with cutaneous LE (824 %) in this study a correct prediction of the future course of disease and it made prognostic assessments concerning the aggravation of the condition possible...|$|R

Toisena tarkoituksena oli kokeellisin menetelmin selvittää mm UV-säteilyn aiheuttamia ihon varhaisvaiheen solumuutoksia näissä taudeissa, sillä UV-säteilyn ihottumaan johtavat perusmekanismit ovat epäselviä. Yhtenä kliinisenä tutkimusmenetelmänä käytettiin pienen ihoalueen valottamista UV-säteilyllä tarkoituksena aikaansaada alueelle lievä ihottuma. Tutkituista 67 LE-potilaasta 67 - 100 %:lle, alatyypistä riippuen, kehittyi ihottuma UV-säteilylle. Tämä ihottuma oli kuitenkin useammin MMVI:n kuin LE-ihottuman kaltaista sekä kliinisesti että histologisesti tarkastellen puoltaen aikaisempaa alustavaa havaintoa näiden tautien yhteisesiintyvyydestä. Laajan, 94 MMVI-potilaan seurantatutkimuksessa totesimme kuitenkin, että pitkänä seuranta-aikana LE-ihottumaa ei kehittynyt MMVI-potilaille useammin kuin normaaliväestölle. On kuitenkin mahdollista, että MMVI-potilaiden laajassa joukossa on LE:lle altistuneita henkilöitä, mahdollisesti perinnöllisesti määräytyneenä. Tämä olisikin mielenkiintoinen lisätutkimuskohde. Vaikka seurantatutkimuksessa ei todettukaan LE- taudin kehittymisalttiutta MMVI-potilailla, totesimme heille kehittyvän useita erilaisia autoimmuunioireita sekä kilpirauhashäiriöitä oletettua enemmän, joten näiden tautien huomioonottaminen MMVI-potilaiden seurannassa on tärkeää.

This thesis deals with two photoaggravated skin diseases, {{lupus erythematosus}} (LE) and polymorphous light eruption (PLE), and comprises two clinical and three experimental, original investigations. The thesis {{was carried out}} in collaboration with the Departments of Dermatology, Tampere and Oulu University Hospitals, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland and Karolinska Hospital, Sweden. LE is a spectrum of diseases with only minor skin lesions in one extremity and a severe systemic disease with disabling symptoms from several organs in the other end. The three main subtypes of <b>LE</b> are <b>chronic</b> cutaneous <b>LE</b> (CCLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Each of them has distinct cutaneous symptoms, although some overlapping exists. CCLE usually presents with skin symptoms only, while in SCLE and SLE patients, other organ systems are often affected and serological abnormalities are observed as well. Photosensitivity is an important feature of all subsets of LE and in SLE, it is accepted as one of 11 criteria for the classification of SLE compiled by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). However, in spite of its impressive role in diagnosing SLE, the definition of photosensitivity has remained vague. Also the type of photosensitivity has been inadequately examined. As PLE, {{the most common form of}} idiopathic photosensitivity diseases, may simulate clinically and histologically early skin lesions of CCLE, it has been speculated whether there is a relationship between these two photoaggravated skin disorders. Furthermore, in our earlier questionnaire study, we found out that 49 % of the LE patients had experienced PLE-like symptom, in some cases more than ten years before the first LE symptoms. The possibility that PLE patients would be prone to develop LE in the long run has been inadequately examined. In order to get a more objective view of the photosensitivity, 67 LE patients were now photoprovoked with UVAR and UVBR. With these photoprovocations we could confirm the previous findings that both UVAR and UVBR induces a pathological UVR reaction in LE patients. Either UVR spectrum induced a pathological reaction in 64 %, 70 % and 100 % of the DLE, SLE and SCLE patients, respectively. However, only 16 % of the pathological reactions were strong and long-lasting, reminiscent of LE, while 48 % were moderate or weak and transient, clinically reminding PLE. Also histologically, most (53 %) of the reactions biopsied showed features of PLE or an unspecific inflammatory reaction. In the second, questionnaire-based follow-up study, the possibility that LE develops in PLE patients in the long run was investigated. Of the cohort of 138 PLE patients, thoroughly evaluated 23 years earlier on the average, 94 patients returned the questionnaire on clinical characteristics of PLE disease and overall health status. Only two female patients had developed LE, one SLE and the other SCLE. However, the prevalence of any type of autoimmune disease, and especially of thyroid disease, was considerably higher, 15 %. The prognosis of PLE symptoms was quite favourable: 24 % of the 94 patients were free of PLE symptoms, 51 % experienced milder symptoms, and 24 % experienced equal or worse symptoms than during the previous follow-up 16 years earlier. In conclusion of the clinical studies it can be stated that LE patients suffer from photoaggravated LE skin lesions but also from photosensitivity symptoms resembling clinically and histologically PLE. However, our long-term follow-up study of PLE patients revealed that PLE patients are not predisposed to LE specifically, although they are apt to develop some type of autoimmune disease or thyroid disorders in the long run. The exact pathogenesis of UVR-induced LE and PLE skin lesions has not been resolved, although some hypotheses have been presented. Thus, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity is the most favoured hypothesis for antibody-associated SLE and SCLE, whereas a DH mechanism has been suggested as the pathogenesis for non-antibody-associated CCLE lesions and PLE lesions. Three experimental studies concerning the photoimmunological events of the UVR-induced or spontaneous skin lesions in LE compared with PLE were conducted in the present thesis. Firstly, epidermal urocanic acid (UCA) contents in 16 DLE and 12 PLE patients were examined. UCA is considered as one of the most important epidermal photoreceptors. A photoreceptor is a prerequisite for the initiation of any photobiological response. The cis-UCA content was significantly lower in light-protected uninvolved buttock skin in DLE patients than in PLE patients and in control persons. As cis-UCA is a strong immunosuppressant, this refers to the possibility of a less cis-UCA-mediated suppression of DH reaction towards UVR-induced neo-antigen in DLE skin lesions. In the second experimental study, we examined the markers of naive (CD 45 RA and CD 31 antigens) and memory (CD 45 RO antigen) T lymphocytes in epidermal and dermal inflammatory cell infiltrations. Typically, CD 45 RA+ cells were the prevailing inflammatory cell population in DLE lesions, whereas CD 45 RO+ cells prevailed in both diseases and in healthy controls. Thus, as CD 45 RO+ cells are the prominent T cell subtype in cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, the profound infiltration of these T cell subtypes now observed in both DLE and PLE lesions is in concert with the hypothesis of DH reaction. Furthermore, our results refer to the pathogenetical role of CD 45 RA+ cells in DLE lesions, but not in PLE lesions. In addition to the absorption of UVR energy, the development of a UVR-induced neo-antigen is a prerequisite for either ADCC or DH reaction. Such a neo-antigen could be an intracellular autoantigen, such as Ro (SSA) or La (SSB) which are shown to relocalize on the surface of keratinocytes due to UVR-induced apoptotic cell death in in vitro experiments. As a third experimental study, UVA and UVB irradiation- induced keratinocyte apoptosis and localization of La (SSB), a possible autoantigen, were examined in DLE, SCLE, SLE and PLE patients. We observed that in some LE and PLE patients, apoptosis was more prolonged than in control persons. The nuclear La (SSB) signal was more intense and more frequent in healthy, intact skin than in skin lesions in any of the patient groups. In the patients, the La (SSB) signal was observed also in the cytoplasm, in LE patients even on the cell membrane. These results are concurrent with the previous findings performed in cultured keratinocytes from SLE patients. In conclusion of the three experimental studies, the pathogenesis of UVR-induced LE skin lesions seems to differ from that of PLE lesions in terms of epidermal and dermal immune cell infiltration and antigen relocalization in UVR-irradiated keratinocytes. The dissimilar epidermal cis-UCA content in DLE and PLE patients may also regulate the immune response differently...|$|R
40|$|Lung cancer {{patients}} experience significant physical symptoms, psychological distress and have many supportive care needs impacting {{their quality of}} life. In récognition of the complex health needs of patients with lung cancer and the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer (EPAAC) recommendations, the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV) aimed to integrate an Advanced Practice Nurse in Lung Cancer (APNLC) within the specialized Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) of the Thoracic Cancer Center. To date, there are limited data {{on the effectiveness of}} APNLC interventions for improving lung cancer patient outcomes. The poor performance status and low survival rates of lung {{cancer patients}} pose a number of methodological barriers that hamper interventional supportive care studies in this population. Introducing a new Advanced Practice Nursing (APN) rôle is a complex process and the full intégration of this rôle depends both on successful rôle development and implementation. International recommendations for developing APN rôles recommend pilot testing to assess the feasibility and acceptability of novel APN rôles prior to formally assessing the effectiveness of the these rôles for patients, providers and organizations. This doctoral thesis project aimed to 1) develop and implement an APNLC rôle {{within the context of the}} CHUV Thoracic Cancer Center, 2) explore the acceptability of the new APNLC rôle from the perspective of a multidisciplinary health care team (MDT) and patients cared for by the APNLC, 3) assess the feasibility of the APNLC consultations and the ability to collect patient- reported outcome measures (PROMs) during first-line treatment, 4) explore the relative contribution of the APNLC interventions in relation to changes in i) perceived self-efficacy for managing lung cancer-related symptoms, ii) symptom intensity/burden and iii) unmet supportive care needs of lung cancer patients during first-line treatment. To develop and implement the APNLC rôle we employed the first 7 phases of the "The Participatory, Evidence-based, Patient-focused process for APN rôle development, implementation, and évaluation" (PEPPA framework). Focus groups were conducted with nurses (n= 5 nurses) and physicians (n= 6 physicians) to explore the acceptability of the APNLC rôle. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with lung cancer patients (n= 4) and the APNLC to gain additional insights. The others aims were addressed using a convenience sample of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients receiving systemic therapy with/without radiotherapy. In order to assess the feasibility of the APNLC consultations and the ability to collect PROMs, an exact single-stage phase II design was applied. The study was considered as feasible if at least 55 % of patients received ail the scheduled APNLC-led consultations and completed PROMs assessments at the three time-points [Baseline, T 1 (between day 4 - 50) and T 2 (between day 71 - 95) ]. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and mixed effect models was applied to explore the relative contribution of the APNLC intervention to changes in perceived self-efficacy for managing lung cancer-related symptoms, symptom intensity/burden and unmet supportive care needs during first-line treatment. Following the first seven phases of the PEPPA framework, the APNLC rôle was designed based on consensus of key stakeholders within the MDT. This enabled us to define the APNLC rôle based to fill the identified gaps in the previous model of care with the specific aim of improving the team's ability to meet patient supportive care needs. The APNLC rôle focused on providing psychological support, enhancing symptom self-management as well as providing therapeutic éducation and information about disease/treatments to patients and families. The APNLC rôle is also tasked with facilitating communication and information exchange within the MDT to improve collaboration and promote continuity of care. The designed APNLC-led intervention included four systematic, alternate face-to-face/telephone consultations with lung cancer patients during first- line treatment. Three main themes emerged describing the acceptability of the APNLC rôle: "rôle identification", "role-specific contributions" and "providing flexible service". Physicians and patients alike clearly recognized the APNLC rôle and emphasized the contribution to continuity of care, providing psycho-social support and enabling symptom self-management. Oncology nurses within the MDT perceived the APNLC rôle as overlapping with their own rôle and they expressed concern about losing part of their traditional rôle. Flexibility in providing care was seen as strength of the APNLC rôle yet this also posed organizational challenges related to work-load. Among the 46 patients enrolled in the feasibility study, 35 met the feasibility criteria receiving the four APNLC consultations (76 %, 95 % Cl: 0. 61 - 0. 87) and 26 completed PROMs assessments at the three timepoints (56 %, 95 % Cl: 0. 41 - 0. 71). These initial findings were promising for the feasibility of APNLC consultations and the ability to collect PROMs during first-Iine treatment. Unfortunately, recruitment was stopped prior to reaching the target enrollment (n= 71) due to limited resources and staffing issues. Longitudinal analysis of patient outcomes showed a trend towards improved patient self-efficacy for managing symptoms between baseline and T 1, which remained stable at T 2. Notably, the intensity of prédominant symptoms increased over time yet unmet information needs decreased significantly between baseline and T 2 (OR= 0. 15 [95 % Cl: 0. 03 - 0. 68] p< 0. 01) while sexuality related needs increased significantly between baseline and T 1 (OR= 4. 04 [95 % Cl: 1. 13 - 14. 53] p< 0. 03). For the first time in Switzerland, we describe the development process of an APNLC rôle within a multidisciplinary thoracic cancer team. Findings of this thesis highlight the applicability and the utility of the PEPPA framework as a structured approach for developing and implementing new APNLC rôles - particularly in the context of the Swiss health care system where APN rôles are yet in early stages of development. Importantly, the new APNLC rôle appears to be well-accepted by patients and physicians. Barriers identified during the implementation of the APNLC rôle were primarily related to intra-professional rather than inter-professional factors. In light of these observations of intra-professional tension, study results underscore the importance of developing a national Swiss définition of APN rôle and régulations guiding APN rôles to support their expansion in the country and enhance acceptability of these rôles. While target enrollment was not met, initial results were promising in terms of feasibility suggesting that APNLC-led consultations were appropriate and perceived as bénéficiai for many patients. Indeed, implementation of the APNLC rôle in the MDT seems to contribute to the improvement and maintenance of patient's perceived self-efficacy for managing symptoms and decreased unmet supportive care needs. However, to better support lung cancer patients in their symptoms self- management and decrease their symptom burden, findings of this research point to adjustments that could be made to improve the effectiveness of the APNLC rôle. First, we propose to adjust the dose of APNLC intervention by increasing the frequency and intensity of consultations. Second, we propose to develop an interdisciplinary approach involving joint APNLC-physicians consultations for managing complex lung cancer patients. In light of the current political and economic debate regarding Swiss healthcare and the evolving rôles of APNs in Switzerland, we posit that this doctoral thesis might provide guidance for future investigations assessing the clinical impact of the APN rôles as part of MDTs in cancer care and possibly other <b>chronic</b> diseases. [...] <b>Les</b> patients atteints d'un cancer du poumon reportent d'intenses symptômes psychologiques et physiques et expriment plusieurs besoins en soins de support, impactant négativement leur qualité de vie. En regard de la complexité des besoins en santé de cette population et en accord avec les recommandations de l'European Partnership for Action Against Cancer, le Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudoise (CHUV) a souhaité intégrer une Infirmière de Pratique Avancée en Cancer du Poumon (IPACaP) au sein de l'équipe multidisciplinaire du Centre des tumeurs thoraciques. A ce jour, les données probantes concernant l'efficacité des interventions dispensées par l'IPACaP sur les résultats cliniques des patients atteints d'un cancer du poumon sont limitées. L'état de santé précaire et le faible taux de survie des patients atteints d'un cancer poumon engendrent un certain nombre de barrières méthodologiques qui limitent la conduite d'études auprès de cette population. Introduire un nouveau rôle d'Infirmière de Pratique Avancée (IPA) est un processus complexe et dépend à la fois du succès de la phase de développement et de celle d'implantation. Les recommandations internationales pour le développement des rôles d'IPA mettent en évidence l'importance de tester la faisabilité et l'acceptabilité de ces nouveaux rôles avant d'étudier l'efficacité pour les patients, les prestataires de soins et les organisations de santé. Cette thèse de doctorat visait à : 1) développer et implanter le rôle d'IPACaP au sein du Centre des tumeurs thoraciques du CHUV, 2) explorer l'acceptabilité du nouveau rôle d'IPACaP auprès de l'équipe multidisciplinaire et des patients, 3) évaluer la faisabilité des consultations menées par l'IPACaP et la capacité à recueillir des résultats de santé déclarés par les patients (Patient Reported Outcomes Measures, PROMs) au cours du traitement de première ligne et finalement 4) explorer la contribution relative des interventions de l'IPACaP envers le sentiment d'auto-|$|R
