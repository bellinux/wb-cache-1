This court had jurisdiction over a broad array of political offences, including black marketeering, work slowdowns and defeatism. These actions were viewed by Freisler as Wehrkraftzersetzung (undermining defensive capability) and were punished severely, with many death sentences. The People's Court under Freisler's domination almost always sided with the prosecuting authority, to the point that being brought before it was tantamount to a <b>capital</b> <b>charge.</b> Its separate administrative existence beyond the ordinary judicial system increased its notoriety, and despite its judicial trappings it rapidly turned into an executive execution arm and psychological domestic terror weapon of Nazi Germany's totalitarian regime, in the tradition of a revolutionary tribunal more than a court of law.|$|E

500|$|Since Athenian {{politicians}} were often indicted by their opponents, {{there was not}} always {{a clear distinction between}} [...] "private" [...] and [...] "public" [...] cases, and thus a career as a logographer opened the way for Demosthenes to embark on his political career. An Athenian logographer could remain anonymous, which enabled him to serve personal interests, even if it prejudiced the client. It also left him open to allegations of malpractice. Thus for example Aeschines accused Demosthenes of unethically disclosing his clients' arguments to their opponents; in particular, that he wrote a speech for Phormion (350 BC), a wealthy banker, and then communicated it to Apollodorus, who was bringing a <b>capital</b> <b>charge</b> against Phormion. Plutarch much later supported this accusation, stating that Demosthenes [...] "was thought to have acted dishonorably" [...] and he also accused Demosthenes of writing speeches for both sides. It has often been argued that the deception, if there was one, involved a political quid pro quo, whereby Apollodorus secretly pledged support for unpopular reforms that Demosthenes was pursuing in the greater, public interest (i.e. the diversion of Theoric Funds to military purposes).|$|E

40|$|This paper explores empirically {{the effect}} of {{consolidation}} in the French banking industry and of Basel II {{on the availability of}} credit for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Consolidation has been associated with {{an increase in the number}} of banks the average firm borrows from and this has improved credit availability. Furthermore, the paper shows, for France, that the current Basel II proposal would result in lower <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> on SME loans due to portfolio diversification effects and low default correlations of SMEs. It also argues that the current Basel II proposal is conservative: <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> could be even lower if they were based on our estimates of SME loan portfolio risk. Overall, in France, credit rationing of SMEs does not seem to be a serious problem and Basel II is unlikely to hold back SME lending.

40|$|A central goal of risk based capital rules, such as Basel II, is the {{assimilation}} of regulatory and economic risk capital.

40|$|Bank risk {{managers}} {{follow the}} Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) recommendations that recently proposed shifting the quantitative risk metrics system from Value-at-Risk (VaR) to Expected Shortfall (ES). The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2013, p. 3) noted that: “a number of weaknesses {{have been identified}} with using VaR for determining regulatory capital requirements, including its inability to capture tail risk”. The proposed reform costs and impact on bank balances may be substantial, such that the size and distribution of daily <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> under the new rules could be affected significantly. Regulators and bank risk managers agree that all else being equal, a “better” distribution of daily <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> is to be preferred. The distribution of daily <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> depends generally on two sets of factors: (1) the risk function that is adopted (ES versus VaR); and (2) their estimated counterparts. The latter is dependent on what models are used by bank risk managers to provide for forecasts of daily <b>capital</b> <b>charges.</b> That is to say, while ES {{is known to be}} a preferable “risk function” based on its fundamental properties and greater accounting for the tails of alternative distributions, that same sensitivity to tails can lead to greater daily <b>capital</b> <b>charges,</b> which is the relevant (that is, controlling) practical reference for risk management decisions and observations. In view of the generally agreed focus in this field on the tails of non-standard distributions and low probability outcomes, an assessment of relative merits of estimated ES and estimated VaR is ideally not limited to mean variance considerations. For this reason, robust comparisons between ES and VaR will be achieved in the paper by using a Stochastic Dominance (SD) approach to rank ES and VaR...|$|R

40|$|A {{portfolio}} of non-performing loans needs economic capital. We present two models for forecasting the non-performing portfolio’s loss and derive the probability distribution. In the first model, the loss for each loan is a Gaussian random variable, {{and the risk}} determinants are the portfolio concentration, as well as systematic and idiosyncratic risk. Our second model allows for diversification with a performing portfolio, because an investor typically owns a combination of performing and non-performing loans. This model is a mixture model. For both models, formulae for the economic capital and the fair contribution of a single loan are given. We calibrate the models with times series data and a benchmark portfolio. Our main finding is that the credit portfolio risk of non-performing loans depends on the volatility of economic activity, on the granularity of the portfolio and on the performing portfolio. Finally, we compare the economic <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> for nonperforming loans from our models with the regulatory <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> of Basel II.
