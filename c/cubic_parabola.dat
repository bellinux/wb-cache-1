40|$|Purpose: This paper evaluates all the {{available}} transition curve types related to road and railway alignments and proposes a new, well verified, transition curve type that combines the accuracy of clothoid curve and the simplicity of <b>cubic</b> <b>parabola</b> curve. Method: A methodology similar to clothoid's curve formation is used to introduce a new transition curve type called of clothoid Symmetrically Projected Transition Curve (SPTC). All three transition curve types are being compared to each other, {{for a variety of}} transition length value versus Radius value combinations. The <b>cubic</b> <b>parabola</b> is a simple function of the form of y=f(x). Clothoid is a transition curve in the form of x=f(l), y=f(l), having as main characteristic the linearity of curvature variation versus its length. A new transition curve will be defined in the form of y=f(x) having also as main characteristic the linearity of curvature variation versus its projection length on axis X. By using the same calculation procedure as the clothoid, the new transition curve will be fully defined. A relation similar to (1) was used as base, by defining a parameter Α similar to the one used in the clothoid. The new curve will be called Symmetrically Projected Transition Curve (SPTC). Results: Some remarkable results that derived from transition curves comparison are: There are {{no significant differences between the}} 3 curves in the area of short transition lengths. For long transition lengths, <b>cubic</b> <b>parabola</b> is diverging from the other 2. The deviation of the <b>cubic</b> <b>parabola</b> from the other curves for large values of Χ, ratios Χ/Α > 0. 7, as well as the affinity of the clothoid with the SPTC are obvious. The most remarkable observation than can be made in the table is the fact that ΔΧ always zero for the SPTC (10 terms). Thus, the SPTC curve is symmetrically projected on its basic tangent. This property contributes to the simplicity of the alignment design. That is another reason to prefer the SPTC curve. Conclusions: The use of <b>cubic</b> <b>parabola</b> in combination with approximate value of diversion can lead to design problems.

40|$|Historical {{development}} {{had formed}} in Vojvodina, {{as well as}} in Yugoslavia, a big number of small agricultural holdings and a relatively little number of laxge capitalistic holdings. The latter ones were liquidated immediately after the last world war by the Land Reform and the Law on Agricultural Land Fund in Sosial Ownership. The land maximum in private ownership was fixed to 10 ha of cultivable land and jn this way the eventual reconstitution of capitalistic holdings in agriculture has been prevented.,,,. Though the relatively fragmented landed estates of individual holdings represents the real obstacle to the increase of agricultural production, the agrarian policy has accepted the principle that in relation to the small and the middle peasants no uneconomic compulsory measures should be undertaken in order to organize collectives or change ownership relations. In accordance with the basic views of marxism, the specific conditions of our socialistic development and the complete voluntary and economical interests of producers, the cooperation between individual and social holdings started to be organized with the intention to improve the agricultural production on land of individual holdings. The socialization of land takes place in different forms but the social purchase of land has become the main form of the transfer of land into social ownership. Different factors influence the selling of land by individual holdings and the buying of land by social holdings. The investigation and study of these factois is very important because {{it is the only way}} of conceiving the possibilities for further socialization of land. ■. The author calculated the coefficients and indexes of correlations (square and <b>cubic</b> <b>parabola)</b> for 29 factors which have an influence upon the socialization of land. According to this the most important factors which positively influence the socialization of land are the next ones: — employment of people out of their holdings, — social changes in the structure of individual holdings-households, — insufficient supply of individual holdings with different kinds of implements for work (means of production), — insufficient territorialization of individual holdings, — more developed cooperation between social and individual holdings and more intensive social renting of private land, — the larger expansion of the social sector, — credit facilities for the social purchase of land. The manifestation of stated factors resulted in the increase of the supply of land and the decrease of the intensity of the interpeasants’ selling and buying of land which have created the possibilities for social holdings to enlarge their land capacities. Especially these factors contributed to this: employment of agricultural labour power in nonagricultural activities and the increase of the number of part-time, nonagricultural and aged holdings. However, the realization of the created opportunities foi 110 socialization of land actually depends on the activity and the economical interests of social holdings for the enlargement of their land-fund. So far social holdings have been very active in this respect, partly due to the fact that considerable credit means were given to them for this purpose. Factors that negatively influence the socialization of land are the next ones: — high proportion of »pure« agricultural holdings, — high proportion of holdings with bigger landed estates and of those which are well equipped with the means of production, — high prices of land. This is an indication that rural households whose existence still depends mostly on the income from the holding are not able to separate themselves from the land and therefore they do not sell their land so much but even buy it. So the supply is lower than the demand of land and this causes the high price of land. In such circumstances social holdings have no possibilities to enlarge their land capacities by the purchase of land from individual holdings. On the base of the effects of the stated positive and negative factors of the socialization of land the author concludes that in Vojvodina there are conditions for the considerable increase of the land area in social owmership in the future period. By the increase of the employed persons in nonagricultural activities to 36. 10 %, as it is anticipated by the plan of socioeconomical development of Vojvodina, 19. 01651 % or 235, 805 ha of cultivable area can pass from individual to social ownership till 1970...|$|E
