5|$|Like most European {{restaurant}}s, La Caravelle had a {{menu that}} changed daily. This made the restaurant popular with new customers and also {{brought them back}} regularly. Salvador Dalí, John Lindsay, Leland Hayward and Dorothy Kilgallen often dined at the restaurant in its early years. The journalist and broadcaster Walter Cronkite was a regular visitor to La Caravelle and enjoyed eating pike quenelles in lobster <b>cream</b> <b>sauce.</b> Other frequent visitors included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Marlene Dietrich.|$|E
25|$|In Northern Iran, Mâst Chekide is {{a variety}} of kefir yogurt with a {{distinct}} sour taste. It is usually mixed with a pesto-like water and fresh herb purée called delal. Yogurt is a side dish to all Iranian meals. The most popular appetizers are spinach or eggplant borani, Mâst-o-Khiâr with cucumber, spring onions and herbs, and Mâst-Musir with wild shallots. In the summertime, yogurt and ice cubes are mixed together with cucumbers, raisins, salt, pepper and onions and topped with some croutons made of Persian traditional bread {{and served as a}} cold soup. Ashe-Mâst is a warm yogurt soup with fresh herbs, spinach and lentils. Even the leftover water extracted when straining yogurt is cooked to make a sour <b>cream</b> <b>sauce</b> called kashk, which is usually used as a topping on soups and stews.|$|E
500|$|The Times Literary Supplement commented, [...] "French Provincial Cooking {{needs to}} be read rather than {{referred}} to quickly. It discourses at some length the type and origin of the dishes popular in various French regions, {{as well as the}} culinary terms, herbs and kitchen equipment used in France. But those who can give the extra time to this book will be well repaid by dishes such as La Bourride de Charles Bérot and Cassoulet Colombié," [...] (respectively, a Provençal dish of fillets of white fish in an aïoli and <b>cream</b> <b>sauce,</b> and a Languedoc casserole of beans with pork, mutton, sausage and goose.) Reviewing the 1977 edition, The Times called it [...] "arguably the most influential cookery book of our age, one which brought food writing into the realms of literature." ...|$|E
25|$|Ground {{white pepper}} {{is used in}} Chinese and Thai cuisine, but also in salads, <b>cream</b> <b>sauces,</b> light-coloured sauces, and mashed {{potatoes}} (where black pepper would visibly stand out). White pepper has a different flavour from black pepper; it lacks certain compounds present in the outer layer of the drupe.|$|R
50|$|Mature red Fresno peppers provide less {{flavor and}} more heat. They are often added to salsas, relishes, ceviches, and marinades. They make good {{toppings}} for tacos, tostadas, burgers, sausages and hot dogs. They are {{large enough to}} stuff with cheeses, potatoes, seafood and meat. Specific recipes include versions of Romesco and rojo <b>cream</b> <b>sauces.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Soups {{made with}} cream and {{mushrooms}} are {{much older than}} the canned variety. Ancient Italian (Salsa colla) and French (Béchamel) <b>cream</b> <b>sauces,</b> and soups based on them have been made for many hundreds of years. In America, the Campbell Soup Company began producing its well-known [...] "Cream of Mushroom Soup" [...] in 1934, {{the same year that}} it introduced [...] "Chicken with Noodles".|$|R
500|$|Fats and {{proteins}} {{reduce the}} perception of tannins on the palate. When Cabernet Sauvignon is paired with steak or dishes with a heavy butter <b>cream</b> <b>sauce,</b> the tannins are neutralized, allowing {{the fruits of the}} wine to be more noticeable. In contrast, starches such as pastas and rice will have little effect on tannins. The bitterness of the tannins can also be counterbalanced by the use of bitter foods, such as radicchio and [...] endive, or with cooking methods that involve charring like grilling. As the wine ages and the tannins lessen, more subtle and less bitter dishes will pair better with Cabernet Sauvignon. The oak influences of the wine can be matched with cooking methods that have similar influences on the food-such as grilling, smoking and plank roasting. Dishes that include oak-influenced flavors and aromas normally found in Cabernet Sauvignon—such as dill weed, brown sugar, nutmeg and vanilla—can also pair well.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{restaurants}} in Roskilde is the Raadhuskælderen, in a building dated to 1430, noted for its salmon steak with tartar sauce and grilled chicken and <b>cream</b> <b>sauce</b> dishes. Also of note is La Brasserie on Algade, the Gimle Musikcafe on Ringstedgade, which is an English-style pub-restaurant with live music, and Restaurant Toppen {{at the top of}} a [...] water tower, built in 1961, with fine views of the town. The 76-room Hotel Prindsen has foundations which date to 1695. It has been a hotel for over 100 years and is decorated in the Nordic style with wooden floors and contains the large luxury Hans Christian Andersen suite. Scandic Hotel Roskilde is a 98-room chain-run hotel established in 1989, with a restaurant serving Danish and international cuisine. The thatched-roof Svogerslev Kro is an 18-room inn dated to 1727 in the Svogerslev area, about 2.5 miles to the west of Roskilde's centre.|$|E
2500|$|A {{combination}} bolus/multiwave bolus is {{the combination}} of a standard bolus spike with an extended bolus square wave. [...] This shape provides a large dose of insulin up front, and then also extends the tail of the insulin action. [...] The combination bolus is appropriate for high carb high fat meals such as pizza, pasta with heavy <b>cream</b> <b>sauce,</b> and chocolate cake.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} uses of mastic was as chewing gum; hence, the name. Mastic-flavored chewing gum is sold in Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and Greece. Mastic is used in ice <b>cream,</b> <b>sauces,</b> and seasoning in Lebanon. In Egypt, mastic is used in vegetable preserves, in jams that have a gummy consistency, in soups, and {{in the preparation of}} meats. In Morocco, mastic is used in the preparation of smoked foods.|$|R

2500|$|Indeed, in French {{the animal}} (as {{well as a}} popular {{preparation}} of it in <b>cream</b> <b>sauce)</b> is called coquille St. Jacques. In German, they are Jakobsmuscheln – literally [...] "James' mussels". Curiously the Linnaeus name Pecten jacobeus {{is given to the}} Mediterranean scallop, while the scallop endemic to Galicia is called Pecten maximus due to its bigger size. The scallop shell is represented in the decoration of churches named after St. James, such as in St James' Church, Sydney, where it appears in a number of places, including in the mosaics {{on the floor of the}} chancel.|$|E
2500|$|In {{food and}} wine pairings, the most basic element {{considered}} is [...] "weight"-the balance between {{the weight of the}} food (a heavy, red sauce pasta versus a more delicate salad) and the weight or [...] "body" [...] of the wine (a heavy Cabernet Sauvignon versus a more delicate Pinot grigio). In wine tasting, body is determined primarily by the alcohol level of the wine and can be influenced by the perceptions of tannins (from the grape skins or oak) and extract (the dissolved solids in the wine derived from winemaking processes like extended maceration and sur lie aging). An oaked Chardonnay from a warm wine region, such as Australia will be [...] "heavier" [...] in body than a stainless steel fermented Chardonnay from a cooler wine region such as Chablis. Pairing heavy wines with light dishes or vice versa, can result in one partner overwhelming the other. The [...] "weight" [...] of a food can also be described in terms of the intensity of its flavors-such as delicate and more subtle flavors versus dishes that have more robust and hearty flavors. A key to pairing upon this principle is to identify the dominant flavor of the dish. Sauces can be the dominant flavor instead of the meat or main component. While poached fish is usually light bodied and better served with a light white, if the fish is served with a heavy <b>cream</b> <b>sauce</b> it could be better balanced with a fuller bodied white wine or light red.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only other}} people I invited," [...] {{said the old}} lady with a grim grin, [...] "were the King of Norway, and the Prime Minister of Spain, and neither of them could come." [...] Annie said no more, but hurrying back to the house, she ordered dinner to be served immediately. At first the meal {{was not a very}} lively one. The young hostess pro tempore {{explained}} the absence of the mistress of the house by stating that she had had a nervous attack--which was quite true--and that she begged them to excuse her until after dinner. The two guests expressed their regret at this unfortunate indisposition, but each felt a degree of embarrassment at the absence of Mrs Keswick. Roberta, who had heard many stories of the old woman, guessed at the true reason, and if the distance had not been so great, she would have gone home that afternoon. Lawrence Croft, of course, could imagine no reason for the old lady's absence, except the one that had been given them, but he suspected that there must be some other. He did his best, however, to make pleasant conversation; and Roberta, who began to have a tender feeling for the little lady {{at the head of the}} table, who, she could easily see, had been placed in an unpleasant position, seconded his efforts with such effect that, when the little party had concluded their dinner with a course of hot pound cake and <b>cream</b> <b>sauce,</b> they were chatting together quite sociably.|$|E
25|$|Chenin blanc {{can be a}} very {{versatile}} {{player in}} food and wine pairings, but the wide range of wine styles needs to be taken into account. Lighter, dry styles can pair well with light dishes such as salads, fish, and chicken. The sweeter styles of Chenin blanc can balance the spicy heat of some Asian and Hispanic cuisines. The acidity and balance of medium-dry styles can pair well with <b>cream</b> <b>sauces</b> and rich dishes like pâté.|$|R
5000|$|The {{style of}} formal dining changed {{drastically}} in the 19th century, becoming successive courses served {{one after the}} other over a period of time. Some traditional hors d'oeuvres would remain on the table throughout the meal. These included olives, nuts, celery and radishes. The changing, contemporary hors d'oeuvres, sometimes called [...] "dainty dishes" [...] became more complicated in preparation. Pastries, with meat and <b>cream</b> <b>sauces</b> among other elaborate items, had become a course served after the soup.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} ways to cook chanterelles. Most of the flavorful {{compounds}} in chanterelles are fat-soluble, making them good mushrooms to sauté in butter, oil or cream. They also contain smaller amounts of water- and alcohol-soluble flavorings, which lend the mushrooms well to recipes involving wine or other cooking alcohols. Many popular methods of cooking chanterelles include them in sautés, soufflés, <b>cream</b> <b>sauces,</b> and soups. They are not typically eaten raw, as their rich and complex flavor is best released when cooked.|$|R
