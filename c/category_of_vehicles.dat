50|$|Epoch Ib may {{be viewed}} as the middle period from 1893 to 1912. The K.Bay. Sts.B. {{continued}} to capital letters to indicate the overall <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles,</b> but changed the meanings in some cases to make them more 'intuitive'. For example, G became a covered (Gedeckter) goods van, S were flat wagons (Schienenwagen = rail-carrying wagon) and V were livestock vans (Viehwagen). In addition, lower case letters were used to further define the class of vehicle, indicating e.g. the maximum load, height of the sides etc., and additional axles were indicated by doubling or tripling the letters. So Xm was a departmental wagon with a maximum load over 10 t and SSml was a long, eight-wheeled flat wagon capable of carrying over 10 tonnes.The owner inscription was just K.Bay. Sts.B. without any coat of arms.|$|E
5000|$|Motoemil {{was one of}} the few Greek {{producers}} {{that survived}} the end of the [...] "three-wheeler era" [...] in that country, as it had developed a completely new breed of heavier, four-wheel trucks in the mid-1970s. The Autofarma model was an all-terrain 4x4 truck with 2 tonne payload and a Mercedes-Benz Diesel engine, perfectly placed in the [...] "farm truck" [...] category according to Greek law. In that respect, it was similar to other Greek vehicles (all locally developed), like the Agricola, the AutoDiana Unicar, the Balkania Autotractor, the EBIAM, the Petropoulos Polytrak and others. However, the Autofarma was produced in numbers exceeding those of all others combined, sold through a network of dealers throughout the country. It was simultaneously a very rugged, reliable all-terrain vehicle requiring minimal maintenance costs (suited for the extremely harsh treatment farm vehicles were exposed to), with a significant payload, a relatively comfortable cabin and a reasonably smooth road behavior for longer drives. A minor facelift was done on the model in 1979, but by the mid-1980s this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> was not competitive anymore due to changes in Greek Law combined with more [...] "sophisticated" [...] demands of Greek customers, met by competitively priced imported types. This was a change the Northern Greek company was not able to cope with, ceasing all truck production in 1985. For one more time, though, it was able to adjust to market opportunities, switching to development and production of light (mostly for boat transport) and heavier trailers. The company name was subsequently changed to Emilios Trailers under which it successfully operates to date.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} a new methodology for estimating fuel consumption and emissions by enabling a correct comparison between freight transportation modes. The {{approach is developed}} and integrated {{as a part of}} an intelligent transportation system dealing with goods movement. A key issue is related to energy consumption ratios and consequent CO 2 emissions. Energy consumption ratios are often used based on transport demand. However, including other ratios based on transport supply can be useful. Furthermore, it is important to indicate which factors are associated with variations in energy consumption and emissions; especially of interest are parameters that have a higher incidence and order of magnitude, in order to fairly compare and understand the difference between transport modes and sub-modes. The study finds that the use of an energy consumption equation can improve the quality of the estimates. The study proposes that coefficients that define the energy consumption equation should be tested to determine market niches and sources of improvement in energy consumption according to the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles,</b> fuel types used, and classes of products transported...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports an {{investigation}} into the age-of-acquisition of object names and object knowledge in a cross-sectional study of 288 children aged between 3 years 7 months and 11 years 6 months, comprising equal numbers of boys and girls. The objects belonged to four categories: animals, fruit and vegetables, implements and vehicles; and were presented in three image types: line drawings, black-and-white and coloured photographs. In the knowledge test, five probe questions were asked for each object given the spoken name. Results showed that line drawings were more difficult to name than either black-and-white photographs or coloured photographs, which did not differ. The boys significantly out-performed the girls at naming and knowing, both overall and specifically for the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Naming and knowledge increased steadily with age but while young children below about 6 years 6 months showed an advantage to naming, older children showed an advantage to knowing. Similarly, age of acquisition measures for each item revealed a significant shift in the relationship between naming and knowing at around 80 months. We argue that differences in learning experience lead younger and older children to associate object names with different types of information, and suggest that this difference probably accounts for the age-of-acquisition effects reported in adult object naming...|$|E

Each <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> is modeled separately. However {{the structure of the}} economic model used to estimate impacts is essentially the same. The first section of this chapter provides a summary of the economic impact results for each of the categories of vehicles affected by the rule.

We then discuss the concept of fuel efficiency gains resulting from the emissions control program and how they have been incorporated into the economic analysis. Also addressed is the potential for product attribute changes that may result due to the regulation. This is followed by a description of the methodology used to develop the economic model and the supply and demand elasticity estimates. The remainder of the chapter takes each vehicle category in turn and describes the baseline market characterization, the per vehicle control costs of the regulation, the future years in which the costs are expected to be incurred, and the economic impact results generated from the model (excluding fuel efficiency gains).

40|$|AbstractTwo {{or three}} lane two-way {{undivided}} roads are a ubiquitous presence in any city in India {{and they are}} typically mixed traffic roads with vehicles of widely varying static and dynamic characteristics and with poor or no lane discipline. Hence multi-class speed flow equations are more relevant to these types of facilities rather than single class flow speed models. In addition, the available research for the operation {{of these types of}} facilities in India is very limited. Hence this paper aims to study the traffic flow in a three-lane two-way undivided road in the city of Chennai through developing multi-class speed-flow relationships using both linear and Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) models. It has been found from the study that models with total volume perform the same irrespective of units used being vehicles or PCU and models with class-wise (with and without direction) consistently perform better than total volume models. It was also found that linear models work better than other models for all vehicle classes modelling 2 -wheeler speeds and two-wheelers, cars and LCVs have the greatest influence on the speeds of almost all the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and the stream. One of the other important conclusions from the study is that an optimum use of class-wise and class& direction-wise models can offer models of better fit than two individual class and class-direction models...|$|E

However the above mentioned Regulations leave open some issues regarding the Euro 5 b and the Euro 6 emission standards to be addressed and defined before the entry into force of these pieces of legislation.
