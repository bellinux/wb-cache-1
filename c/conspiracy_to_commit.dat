50|$|Criminal {{trials for}} treason, murder and manslaughter, or {{attempts}} and <b>conspiracies</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> them, were {{reserved for the}} High Court. Civil matters relating to constitutional issues, wills and marriages were also restricted to the High Court.|$|R
50|$|Harmer's {{practice}} was {{mainly in the}} criminal courts, and experience there made him an advocate of reform in criminal procedure. He came across police <b>conspiracies</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> perjury, <b>to</b> secure convictions. In 1816 {{he was one of}} those who exposed the thief-taking scandal, and the corruption of the system of rewards.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 he {{was indicted}} {{on charges of}} aggravated forgery, <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>committing</b> a crime, suborning perjury and {{attempted}} fraud, all relating to his 1999 election campaign, in which he allegedly offered businessman Meir Manor NIS 100,000 to fraudulently collect 30,000 signatures. He was eventually convicted as part of plea bargain in 2007 and sentenced to six months in prison.|$|R
5|$|Also, in 2006, Moussaoui, who some {{originally}} suspected {{might have}} been the assigned 20th hijacker, was convicted for the lesser role of <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> acts of terrorism and air piracy. He is serving a life sentence without parole in the United States. Mounir el-Motassadeq, an associate of the Hamburg-based hijackers, is serving 15 years in Germany for his role in helping the hijackers prepare for the attacks.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the trial}} in Alexandria, six of LaRouche's {{associates}} were also found guilty. His chief fund-raiser, William Wertz, was convicted on ten mail fraud counts. LaRouche's legal adviser and treasurer, Edward Spannaus, along with fund raising operatives Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg, Michael Billington, and Joyce Rubinstein, were convicted of <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> mail fraud.

The others received three-year terms and various fines.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} trial, a further 26 {{defendants}} were still {{due to be}} tried on charges relating to the riot. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted plea bargains where defendants pleaded guilty to violent disorder {{in exchange for the}} dropping of other charges, or in some cases all charges were dropped completely. On 20 September 1993 the last remaining defendant to maintain a plea of not guilty went on trial, and he was convicted of <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> grievous bodily harm and sentenced to thirty months imprisonment.|$|E
50|$|Thus, we have {{allegations}} {{of what are}} called <b>conspiracies</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> crimes which are nowhere adequately described. And I cannot think that such pleading should find toleration in any criminal action. An indictment ought to set out with fair certainty the charge to which the accused must respond. If crime has been committed, a fairly capable prosecuting officer can definitely describe it.|$|R

5|$|In July 2004, Hamdan {{was charged}} with <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> terrorism, and the Bush {{administration}} made arrangements to try him before a military commission, established by the Department of Defense under Military Commission Order No. 1 of March 21, 2002. He was assigned a defense counsel, LCDR Charles D. Swift from the Navy JAG, who with a legal team filed a petition for Hamdan in US District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging {{the constitutionality of the}} military commission, and saying that it lacked the protections required under the Geneva Conventions and United States Uniform Code of Military Justice.|$|E
5|$|Kasab {{was convicted}} of all 86 charges on 3 May 2010. He {{was found guilty of}} murder for {{directly}} killing seven people, <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> murder for the deaths of the 164 people killed in the three-day terror siege, waging war against India, causing terror, and of conspiracy to murder two high-ranking police officers.

40|$|How should <b>conspiracies</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> money {{laundering}} {{that rely on}} stale evidence be handled by the federal government? Marusarz argues that {{an amendment to the}} Money Laundering Control Act is needed to preserve a defendant’s interest in having a conspiracy prosecution based on evidence proving the existence of a {{money laundering}} conspiracy long after the actual <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> launder money has ended. The Money Laundering Control Act is widely applicable and implies that prosecutors have an unlimited amount of time to bring an indictment for <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> launder money due to the complexity of money laundering crimes. Marusarz proposes amendments to the Money Laundering Control Act that provide temporal limits on conspiracy charges brought under the Act. The proposed amendment provides that prosecutions under 18 U. S. C. § 1956 must be brought within five years of the last overt act committed in furtherance of any money laundering offenses...|$|R
5|$|On September 4, 2007, {{charges against}} Carwin Jones and Theo Shaw {{were reduced to}} aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy, as were those of Robert Bailey, Jr. on September 10. Bryant Purvis was arraigned on reduced charges of aggravated battery and <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> aggravated battery on November 7, 2007, and pleaded not guilty. Because Louisiana law {{considers}} seventeen-year-olds to be adults for purposes of criminal culpability, the charges for these four were unaffected by the appellate ruling overturning Bell's conviction.|$|E
5|$|The FALN {{was led by}} Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, {{who was one of}} the FBI's {{most wanted}} criminals. The group served as the {{predecessor}} of the Boricua Popular Army. Several of the organization's members were arrested and convicted for <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> robbery and for firearms and explosives violations. On August 11, 1999 then United States President Bill Clinton offered clemency to sixteen of the convicted militants under the condition that they renounce any kind of violent manifestation. This decision drew criticism towards the Clinton administration from figures that include the Office of the United States Attorney, the FBI, and the United States Congress.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru {{was also}} known for his history of legal problems. He {{was a member of}} Satan's Choice, a biker gang. He was convicted of assault, {{trafficking}} cocaine and bombing a police station. In 2005, Croitoru was arrested for the murder of lawyer Lynn Gilbank and her husband Fred. After a lengthy investigation, the charges were dropped in June 2006 because of insufficient evidence. He worked as a security guard in Vancouver, British Columbia, until being arrested in May 2009 for <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> murder. On January 24, 2011, Croitoru was charged with first degree murder in connection with the 2008 killing of Jonathan Barber in Burnaby, British Columbia.|$|E
5000|$|Conspiracy exists {{when two}} or more persons come to an {{agreement}} concerning the commission of a felony and decide <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> it. <b>Conspiracy</b> can also be proven based on the idea of [...] "unity of purpose" [...] and acts leading to a common design. There is proposal when the person who has decided <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> a felony proposes its execution to some other person or persons. <b>Conspiracy</b> and proposal <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> a felony are generally not punishable, except for <b>conspiracy</b> and proposal <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> treason, coup d’Etat, and rebellion. Whilst not generally punishable, conspiracy can determine the degree of participation in criminal offenses in order to determine criminal liability.|$|R

5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 in about three hours. They presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother took the stand and gave her final testimony, and her version of the story. The judge told prosecutors {{that they had to}} choose to charge the defendants with capital murder or <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought the death penalty for both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1999, President Bill Clinton offered {{conditional}} clemency to sixteen {{members of}} the FALN convicted for <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> robbery, conspiracy to bomb-making, and sedition, {{as well as for}} firearms and explosives violations. None of the sixteen were convicted of bombings or any crime which injured another person, and all of the sixteen had served nineteen years or longer in prison, which was a longer sentence than such crimes typically received, according to the White House. Clinton offered clemency, on condition that the prisoners renounce violence, at the appeal of 10 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, President Jimmy Carter, the Archbishop of New York, and the Archbishop of Puerto Rico. The commutation was opposed by U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and criticised by many including former victims of FALN terrorist activities, the Fraternal Order of Police, and members of Congress. Hillary Clinton in her campaign for Senator also criticised the commutation, although she had earlier been supportive.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E

Diana tells him that she {{will have a lot}} of job offers in New York, but Paul says that no one will be interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his business papers in the home safe. Diana kisses Paul, {{and at the same time}} she takes his house keys from his pocket and she breaks into his house. Diana does not find anything and, in anger, she smashes Paul's possessions. Diana calls a mystery person and arranges for them to hurt Paul. She then goes to Rebecca and tells her about her husband's affair. Someone goes to the Lassiter's mezzanine and pushes Paul from it. Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) discovers one of Diana's earrings at the scene and he stops her at the airport. During questioning, Diana tells him to speak to Rebecca again after revealing her affair with Paul. Andrew, Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) follow Diana and see her meeting with Jack Ward (Peter Lowrey), a hitman she called on the night Paul was pushed. Natasha retrieves Jack's phone and the group listen to a message left by Diana, telling him to leave town. Andrew confronts Diana at her hotel and Mark arrives to arrest her for <b>conspiracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> murder.

40|$|AbstractThe {{existence}} of a conspiracy may make the detection of a fraud by an auditor less probable, because of the ability of conspirators to falsify apparently independent items of evidence. At the same time, the {{existence of}} a conspiracy makes detection by management or other agencies more probable because of the chance that one of the conspirators or someone who has been approached <b>to</b> join the <b>conspiracy</b> will report the fraud. However, the discovery of major <b>conspiracies</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> fraud and financial crime in companies, such as Enron and the Madoff Investment Securities case, where the auditor was himself convicted as one of the conspirators, suggests the need to re-evaluate the reasonability of asking auditors to assess the risk of a criminal conspiracy existing and the probability of financial crimes committed by the conspirators remaining undetected. This paper proposes a model for the auditor to use in making such an assessment, thereby enhancing the auditor's assessment of the reliability of the overall audit...|$|R
