5|$|The many {{achievements}} of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known planked boats, Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty, made with the Hittites. Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.|$|E

25|$|In Sassanid {{times the}} {{imperial}} flag was a leather rectangle {{covered with a}} thin layer of silk ornamented with jewels, with a four-pointed star at the centre, indicating the four <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> This is the same star referred to as Akhtare Kaviani ("the Kaviani star") by Ferdowsi in the epic Shahnameh (Book of Kings). The flag was larger than the original Derafsh Kaviani apron and suspended from a lance, the point of which appeared above it. Attached to the lower edge were tassels of yellow, magenta, and scarlet, with large pendant jewels. The flag was destroyed by invading Muslim Arabs after their decisive defeat of the Sassanids.|$|E

This march, known as the Dandi March, was sensationalized by the international press; film clippings and pictures of Mahatma Gandhi were relayed to distant <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Gandhi reached Dandi on 6 April 1930. After his morning bhajan, he waded in to the sea shore {{and picked up a}} handful of salt, proclaiming that with the handful of salt he was proclaiming the end of the British Empire. The police arrived and arrested thousands of national leaders including Gandhi. Gandhi's bold defiance of the salt law encouraged other Indians to break the law as well.|$|E
25|$|At Abney Park Cemetery {{there are}} also some of the early {{settlers}} in Britain from the four <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> such as the African, Thomas Caulker, the son of the King of Bompey (now Sierra Leone), who signed an anti-slavery agreement that became part of an Act of Parliament in the 1850s; and Leota, a native of the Samoa Islands whose life in London was due to the work of the London Missionary Society who sought to build schools and bring scripture to the inhabitants of the South Seas. Abney Park {{is one of the main}} burial places of 19th-century missionaries; here, for example is the burial place of William Ellis, John Williams' wife and son, Dr Walter Henry Medhurst, and Edward Stallybrass. Also Sarah Buzacott, the wife of Aaron Buzacott the elder, who was a teacher at the London Missionary Society college at Rarotonga in the South Seas. Many nonconformist divines are also buried here, for example Dr Alexander Fletcher, 'The Children's Friend'.|$|E
25|$|During the Dutch Golden Age, the Dutch – {{using their}} {{expertise}} in doing business, cartography, shipbuilding, seafaring and navigation – {{traveled to the}} far <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> leaving their language embedded {{in the names of}} many places. Dutch exploratory voyages revealed largely unknown landmasses to the civilized world and put their names on the world map. The Dutch came to dominate the map making and map printing industry by virtue of their own travels, trade ventures, and widespread commercial networks. As Dutch ships reached into the unknown corners of the globe, Dutch cartographers incorporated new geographical discoveries into their work. Instead of using the information themselves secretly, they published it, so the maps multiplied freely. For almost 200 years, the Dutch dominated world trade. Dutch ships carried goods, but they also opened up opportunities for the exchange of knowledge. The commercial networks of the Dutch transnational companies, i.e. the VOC and West India Company (WIC/GWIC), provided an infrastructure which was accessible to people with a scholarly interest in the exotic world. The VOC's bookkeeper Hendrick Hamel was the first known European/Westerner to experience first-hand and write about Joseon-era Korea. In his report (published in the Dutch Republic) in 1666 Hendrick Hamel described his adventures on the Korean Peninsula and gave the first accurate description of daily life of Koreans to the western world. The VOC trade post on Dejima, an artificial island off the coast of Nagasaki, was for more than two hundred years the only place where Europeans were permitted to trade with Japan. Rangaku (literally 'Dutch Learning', and by extension 'Western Learning') is a body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave of Dejima, which allowed Japan to keep abreast of Western technology and medicine in the period when the country was closed to foreigners, 1641–1853, because of the Tokugawa shogunate's policy of national isolation (sakoku).|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{told that}} when God began {{to create the}} first person, God began to collect dust from the four <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> – red, black, white, and yellow. Explaining why God {{gathered}} the first person's dust from the four <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> God said that if a person should travel from the east to the west, or from the west to the east, and the time should come for the person to depart from the world, then the earth {{would not be able}} to tell the person that the dust of the person's body was not of the earth there, and that the person needed to return to the place from which the person had been created. This teaches that in every place where a person comes or goes, should the person approach the time to die, in that place is the dust of the person's body, and there the person's body will return to the dust, as [...] says, [...] "For dust you are, and to dust shall you return." ...|$|E
