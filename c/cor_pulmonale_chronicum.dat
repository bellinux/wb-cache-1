40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PH) is a disease, {{which is}} characterized by the increase of the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) in the lung-circulation over 25 mmHg in rest and over 30 mmHg in movement. Due to the chronically overload of the right ventricle the heart is always affected by a PH and is often developing a so called <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> <b>chronicum</b> which can lead to a right heart failure. There are five groups in the clinical WHO-Venice-classification which are arranged after pathogenetical, clinical and therapeutical criteria. In addition an adjusted NYHA-classification helps to grade the significance of the diseases-stadium. Principally one classifies a mostly isolated form of the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and other secondary forms of the PH which are developing on the ground of already existing problems such as left-heart diseases, hypoxic lung-diseases, pulmonary embolism and infections. The pathophysiological reasons for a PH are just as various as the different manifestations. Yet there are generally four main alterations in the walls of the pulmonary vessels. These contain vasoconstriction, rarefaction of vessels, vascular remodeling and the occlusion of vascular lumen by a thrombus with subsequently structural remodeling of the vascular and mounted extracellular matrix. The diagnostic procedure should be algorithm-oriented and contains anamnesis, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), thoracic x-ray and echocardiography. To confirm the diagnosis and for a better measuring of the prognosis, an examination with a right-heart flow-directed balloon-tipped catheter is favorable. Because of the change of the pathophysiological concepts of the PH from a vasoconstrictive to a vasoproliferative genesis, additional pharmacological targets are developed for therapeutic treatment. Today the former regime of therapy with high-dosed calcium-channel blockers as vasodilatators only finds application after pharmacological testing at so called responders. The current scheme of therapy is focused on the synergic effects of different drugs, such as prostacyclines, endothelial-receptor blockers and phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors. After failure of pharmacological treatments the endarteriectomy and lung-transplantation remain as last therapy options, although they are accompanied by poor survival rates. During the last years enormous efforts have been established related to improvement in treatment and diagnostics and understanding of the pathophysiology. However, there is no in-depth scientometric analysis of the topic pulmonary hypertension available. Therefore the present study was carried out to evaluate the recent developments and the state of research in the field of pulmonary hypertension in using large scale data analysis, bibliometric approaches and density-equalizing procedures. Via research into the development of published items, the involved authors, the Journale, the publishing countries, international collaborations and citation quantities with the aid of scientometric parameters such as citation-rates, impact-factors and h-index it was possible to perform a objective critical analysis. The analysis show that the number of published items per year progressively increased from the year 1958 to 2007. Whereas more than 80 % of all publications originate from the time span starting in 1990. The majority of all published items is written in English and belongs to the document type ‘article’. The most important journal regarding pulmonary hypertension is Circulation, which is supported by the quantity of publications and the impact-factor. Furthermore, the New England Journal of Medicine is responsible for few but very qualitative papers, which can be shown by the very high average citation-rate per article and the impact-factor. Regarding the productivity of authors, Simonneau, G is ranked first but with a large fraction of co-authorships. Abman, SH holds the biggest percentage of both first- and senior-authorships among the most productive authors. The most cited author is Rubin, LJ followed by Simonneau, G ranked second, whereas Zapol, WM has the highest average citation-rate concerning the papers published in senior-authorship, which belongs to most cited study dealing with pulmonary hypertension. It can be demonstrated, that the most productive authors are in general the most cited authors as well. The most important country for research in pulmonary hypertension is the US, which is involved in over 40 % of all published items. Furthermore they play the biggest role in international cooperation-studies. In Europe, the most productive countries are the UK, France and Germany where on the other hand the percentage of cooperation-items is bigger than in the US. Beside the biggest number of publications, the US is ranked on the first place in both, total number of citations and h-index. Analogous to the increasing number of published items per year, the number of author per article is developing. At the time, there are averagely more than five author involved in each article. The number of international cooperation-items almost develops in the same matter, whereas in the majority of the cooperation-items just two countries are collaborating. It is remarkable, that the cooperation-items are more often quoted than the average item, which relates to the big relevance of those papers. The citation-analysis showed a clear tendency towards an increasing number of citations per item in form of literature references. Furthermore there was a peak in the average citation per item for the years from 1992 to 1993. In addition, the percentaged fraction of each year after the publishing-date in the total citation-rate was measured which showed {{that the majority of the}} citations a paper receives come from the first seven years after the publishing date. It was possible to show, that the first seven years and in particular the first two years after publication are the most important regarding the citation rate. The scientometric analysis showed for the first time the evolution in medical publications and research in pulmonary hypertension since 1934 and measured, visualized and critical evaluated the results. Thus, it was possible to point out the leading researchers, Journale, countries and international collaborations. The h-index proofed to be a suitable assessment criterion for the evaluation of countries, whereas it is also affected by the cooperation-items. The citation-analysis showed a latency period of two years until the maximum fraction of the citations per year. All in all it was possible to show a progressive evolution in research quantities, which leaded to subsumable results like pathophysiological and therapeutical concepts as well as international clinical classifications. The actual therapy regimens which resulted from the intense research-activities aim on a synergic effect of different single-drugs. They can improve the quality of life and lifespan for the patients. However, in failed drug-therapy there only remains the endarteriectomy or lung-transplantation as the last therapy option, which is accompanied by low survival rates. It is to hope, that a continued worldwide research will lead to further improvements for patient with pulmonary hypertension...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Of the electrocardiographic {{changes in}} chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) patients, {{a shift of}} the P wave axis greater than 900 which is highly characteristic, {{is said to be}} due to {{hyperinflation}} and does not occur in interstitial lung disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe the electrocardiographic changes in chronic obstructive lung disease patients. METHODS: The electrical axis of the various waves of the ECG using the hexiaxial reference system in 92 Nigerian patients with COLD were examined, 39 of whom had associated <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale,.</b> P wave axis greater than 900 was present in 2 (19. 1 %) of 17 patients with COLD alone and 15 (41. 7 %) out of 36 with development of <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> (p< 0. 001). The mean P wave axis was 64. 7 ± 10. 6 0 in those without <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> while it was significantly shifted to the right (83. 90) in those with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale.</b> The mean QRS axis was 53. 50 ± 21. 20 and 89. 0 ± 12. 40 in those without and with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> respectively (p= 0. 7716). The QRS axis was normal in all but one of those without <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> while there was a right axis deviation in 51. 7 % of those with it. ST and T wave changes were mainly present in those with associated <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale.</b> CONCLUSION: The study shows that a shift of the electrical axis of the heart occurs in COLD patients mainly with the development of right ventricular hypertrophy (<b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale),</b> rather than the hyperinflation.

The study recruited 81 patients with advanced COPD and 40 age-matched controls. The patients were divided into two groups: those with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> and those without. Echocardiography was used to evaluate RV function and morphology, and the value of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) less than 16 mm was considered RV dysfunction. Plasma myostatin levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were analyzed as a comparison of myostatin. The data detected <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> in 39 / 81 patients, with the mean value of TAPSE of 14. 3 mm. Plasma myostatin levels (ng/mL) were significantly higher in patients with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> (16. 68 ± 2. 95) than in those without (13. 56 ± 3. 09), and much higher than in controls (8. 79 ± 2. 79), with each p< 0. 01. Significant differences were also found in plasma BNP levels among the three groups (p< 0. 05). Multivariate regression analysis suggested that myostatin levels were significantly correlated with the values of TAPSE and RV myocardium performance index among the COPD patients, and that BNP levels were significantly correlated only with systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, with each p< 0. 05. Plasma myostatin levels are increased in COPD patients who have <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale.</b> Stronger correlations of plasma myostatin levels with echocardiographic indexes of the right heart suggest that myostatin might be superior to BNP in the early diagnosis of <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> in COPD...|$|R

Whilst the levels of ANP and BNP are increased in conditions such as congestive heart failure and <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale,</b> abnormal levels of CNP in these conditions have not been reported. METHODS [...] Plasma levels of CNP were measured by specific radioimmunoassay in 12 young normal controls, 12 elderly normal controls, 12 patients with NYHA grade III-IV congestive heart failure, and in 16 patients with hypoxaemic <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale.</b> RESULTS [...] Mean (SE) plasma levels of CNP were similar in young normal controls (0. 46 (0. 03) pmol/l), elderly normal controls (0. 43 (0. 05) pmol/l), and in patients with congestive heart failure (0. 33 (0. 2) pmol/l). In patients with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale,</b> however, plasma levels of CNP were raised (1. 39 (0. 27) pmol/l) 3. 2 -fold compared with age-matched controls.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pathogenesis}} of oedema in hypoxic <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> {{is poorly}} understood. One possibility {{is a failure}} of atrial natriuretic peptide release, leading to salt and water retention. This hypothesis was tested by observing the response to an intravenous saline challenge in patients with and without <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale.</b> METHODS: Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations were measured before and for three hours after an intravenous saline load (0. 1 ml 2. 7 % saline/kg/min for 60 minutes) in 20 patients with chronic obstructive airways disease. Ten patients with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale,</b> as judged clinically {{by the presence of}} peripheral oedema with a previously documented increase in the jugular venous pressure or pleural effusions during an acute exacerbation of airway obstruction (mean (SE) age 67 (3) years, FEV 1 0. 73 (0. 08) 1, arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2) 6. 4 (0. 4) kPa, and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2) 6. 7 (0. 3) kPa), were compared with 10 patients with hypoxic chronic obstructive airways disease who had never had oedema (mean age 63 (1) years, FEV 1 1. 07 (0. 09) 1, PaO 2 8. 6 (0. 4) kPa, and PaCO 2 5. 3 (0. 2) kPa). All patients were studied fasting and after diuretics had been stopped for three days. No supplemental oxygen was given. RESULTS: The mean four hourly urine sodium excretion was less in the patients who had oedema (27 (4. 6) mmol, 13 % of the intravenous load) than in those without oedema (82 (15. 5) mmol, 43 % of the load). Initial mean plasma atrial natriuretic peptide values were significantly higher in the patients with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> (19. 1 (1. 6) compared with 10. 2 (0. 7) pmol/l) and the mean peak rise in atrial natriuretic peptide after the intravenous saline load had been given was 13 (8. 0) pmol/l in the patients with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> and 5. 5 (2. 3) pmol/l in the controls.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{receptor}} {{for advanced}} glycation end products (RAGE) is a multiligand signal transduction receptor that can initiate and perpetuate inflammation. Its soluble isoform (sRAGE) {{acts as a}} decoy receptor for RAGE ligands, and is thought to afford protection against inflammation. With the present study, we aimed at determining whether circulating sRAGE is correlated with emphysema and chronic <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Methods In 200 COPD patients and 201 age- and sex-matched controls, we measured lung function by spirometry, and sRAGE by ELISA method. We also measured the plasma levels of two RAGE ligands, N-epsilon-carboxymethyl lysine and S 100 A 12, by ELISA method. In the COPD patients, we assessed the prevalence and severity of emphysema by computed tomography (CT), and the prevalence of chronic <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> by echocardiography. Multiple quantile regression was used to assess the effects of emphysema, chronic <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale,</b> smoking history, and comorbid conditions on the three quartiles of sRAGE. Results sRAGE was significantly lower (p = 0. 007) in COPD patients (median 652 pg/mL, interquartile range 484 to 1076 pg/mL) than in controls (median 869 pg/mL, interquartile range 601 to 1240 pg/mL), and was correlated with the severity of emphysema (p Conclusions sRAGE is significantly lower in patients with COPD than in age- and sex-matched individuals without airflow obstruction. Emphysema and chronic <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> are independent predictors of reduced sRAGE in COPD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Non-invasive {{measurements}} {{of right and}} left ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF, LVEF) by multiple-gated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography were performed in 18 control subjects, 16 patients with angina pectoris, and 45 patients with hypoxic chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The mean RVEF in the control subjects was 0. 62 +/- 0. 09 (SD), which was {{not significantly different from}} the mean RVEF in the patients with angina (0. 60 +/- 0. 09), but was significantly higher (p less than 0. 01) than the mean value in patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema (0. 45 +/- 0. 11). LVEF was not significantly different in the groups studied. There was a significant correlation between LVEF and RVEF only in patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema (p less than 0. 001). Those patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema who had clinical evidence of <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> {{at the time of the}} study had significantly lower values of RVEF and LVEF (p less than 0. 001) than patients with no previous <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> or those who had had <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> in the past. There was a significant correlation between RVEF and arterial oxygen (p less than 0. 01) and carbon dioxide tensions (p less than 0. 05). Reduced RVEF in patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema may be an early indicator of the development of <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> and may be useful as a non-invasive method of assessing the effects of therapeutic interventions...|$|R
