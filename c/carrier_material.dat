25|$|In {{the case}} {{catalytic}} or adsorbent systems where a metal species is dispersed upon a support (or <b>carrier)</b> <b>material</b> (often quasi-inert oxides, such as alumina or silica), {{it is possible}} for an adsorptive species to indirectly adsorb to the support surface under conditions where such adsorption is thermodynamically unfavorable. The presence of the metal serves as a lower-energy pathway for gaseous species to first adsorb to the metal and then diffuse on the support surface. This is possible because the adsorbed species attains a lower energy state once it has adsorbed to the metal, thus lowering the activation barrier between the gas phase species and the support-adsorbed species.|$|E

40|$|Rhizobia are {{bacteria}} that {{are able to}} nodulate leguminous plants and fix nitrogen to make it utilizable to plants thus making it beneficial as microbial biofertilizer. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the survival of locally isolated rhizobia (Burkholderia sp. USM B 20) from Mucuna bracteata in various <b>carrier</b> <b>materials</b> namely peat, rice husk and local kaolin. The <b>carrier</b> <b>materials</b> which were inoculated with the rhizobia were stored in two different temperatures; 4 and 28 C (room temperature) for eight weeks. Samples from the <b>carrier</b> <b>materials</b> were taken every week and tested for the survivability of the rhizobia in it by determining viable cell count (CFU g - 1). Besides that, samples were also tested for the changes in pH and moisture content. The results showed that after eight weeks of storage, treatment of carrier peat stored at 28 C was able to sustain the highest viable cell number of rhizobia. Peat also had acceptable changes in pH value and moisture content as compared to rice husk and the mixture of rice husk and kaolin. For other treatments, the addition of kaolin to rice husk in treatment mixture of rice husk and kaolin showed that addition of kaolin increases the moisture holding stability. Thus, it was concluded that peat was the best carrier type and the addition of kaolin may increase the attributes of rice husk as potential <b>carrier</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

The applicability of MELDI for rapid protein profiling was evaluated with human serum samples.

40|$|In a near-surface nuclear explosion, vaporized device {{materials}} {{are incorporated into}} molten soil and other <b>carrier</b> <b>materials,</b> forming glassy fallout upon quenching.

A surface deposition layer was observed preserved at interfaces where two aerodynamic fallout glasses agglomerated and fused. Eleven such boundaries were studied using spatially resolved analyses to better understand the vaporization and condensation behavior of species in the fireball. Using nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), we identified higher concentrations of uranium from the device in 7 of the interface layers, as well as isotopic enrichment (> 75 % 235 U) in 9 of the interface layers. Major element analysis of the interfaces revealed the deposition layer to be chemically enriched in Fe-, Ca- and Na-bearing species and depleted in Ti- and Al-bearing species. The concentration profiles of the enriched species at the interface are characteristic of diffusion. Three of the uranium concentration profiles were fit with a modified Gaussian function, representative of 1 -D diffusion from a planar source, to determine time and temperature parameters of mass transport. By using a historical model of fireball temperature to simulate the cooling rate at the interface, the temperature of deposition was estimated to be ∼ 2200 K, with 1 σ uncertainties in excess of 140 K. The presence of Na-species in the layers at this estimated temperature of deposition is indicative of an oxygen rich fireball. The notable depletion of Al-species, a refractory oxide that is highly abundant in the soil, together with the enrichment of Ca-, Fe-, and 235 U-species, suggests an anthropogenic source of the enriched species, together with a continuous chemical fractionation process as these species condensed...|$|R
