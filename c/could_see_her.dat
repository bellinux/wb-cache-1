5|$|Castor and Pollux– An elderly {{conjoined}} twin, they usurped the Oracle of Delphi {{and decided}} who <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> When Kratos attempted {{to see the}} Oracle without any offerings, the twin made themselves younger by using the Amulet of Uroborus and then fought Kratos. They attempted to kill the Oracle so that Kratos could not see her. After crushing the Oracle under rocks, Kratos then killed the twin and took the amulet. Castor and Pollux were voiced by David W. Collins and Brad Grusnick, respectively, in Ascension.|$|E
5|$|After Marie Henriette's death, Leopold's {{relationship}} with Caroline became flagrantly open, and he placed her across from his Laeken mansion, in the Villa Vanderborght, even building a pedestrian bridge (above the ground, {{and over the}} fences of the mansion) so he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> at will. The bridge reveals the king's jealousy, although {{this may have been}} justified, as her former lover Durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions. Caroline tried to pass him off as her brother when Leopold caught the two together; one publication reported that she and Durrieux had placed secret electric bells in all her residences so that servants could warn her when the king was approaching.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Tony {{married the}} family's {{housekeeper}} Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario. Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him. They {{would have a}} strained relationship for many years afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so that the boys <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> underwear.|$|E

And then from behind another tree another woman came up and she said, 'Well, my name is Shirley Little Dove, {{and this is my}} sister Devi White Dove, and we are descended from Pocahontas.' And as they stood there, I mean I took a picture of both of them, and between their faces was Pocahontas' face in my mind – I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

500|$|According to Donald Spoto in The Dark Side of Genius, Hitchcock's wife, Alma Reville, {{spotted a}} blooper {{in one of}} the last {{screenings}} of Psycho before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> blink. According to Patricia Hitchcock, talking in Laurent Bouzereau's [...] "making of" [...] documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh's character appeared to take a breath. In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences. Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimation to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.|$|E
500|$|Discussing Simmons' {{actions in}} the episode, Henstridge noted that the {{previous}} episodes in the season had established the character's new position high in the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy so that this episode <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> abuse that power, using her position to help her friends, including the now ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Johnson, rather than the agency of its director. Henstridge said that [...] "this is the whole reason that she [...] {{but it is a}} turning point for because in that moment she could've gone the other way" [...] and chose to protect her new position. Henstridge appreciated the episode exploring the relationship between Simmons and Johnson, feeling that there was [...] "so much bad blood" [...] between them after the events of the third season that could be explored. She compared this to a relationship between sisters.|$|E
500|$|Christy's role as {{a villain}} has been widely praised by {{television}} commentators, though Patterson's performance {{was the subject of}} negative criticism. Spanos placed Christy as number three on its list of 161 of the series' antagonist as rated by scariness. Demain praised Christy as an interesting character following the reveal that she was secretly working for the Triad. Gavin Hetherington, on the other hand, wrote he was indifferent about Christy, and found Billie to be the stronger character of the two. The story arc was criticized by Digital Spys Hugh Armitage, who felt it was weakened by Patterson's [...] "habit of pulling 'evil' faces when no one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> like a pantomime villain". Jon Langmead of PopMatters summarized Patterson's acting as [...] "huff and puff through her on-camera time".|$|E

500|$|His wife Maria, who {{had been}} {{suffering}} from poor health for many years, became very ill {{in the spring of}} 1853 and died on October 27 of tuberculosis. Just before her burial, her coffin was opened so that her daughter Mabel <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face while Lowell [...] "leaned for a long while against a tree weeping", according to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his wife, who were in attendance. In 1855, Lowell oversaw the publication of a memorial volume of his wife's poetry, with only fifty copies for private circulation. Despite his self-described [...] "naturally joyous" [...] nature, life for Lowell at Elmwood was further complicated by his father becoming deaf in his old age, and the deteriorating mental state of his sister Rebecca, who sometimes went a week without speaking. He again cut himself off from others, becoming reclusive at Elmwood, and his private diaries from this time period are riddled with the initials of his wife. On March 10, 1854, for example, he wrote: [...] "Dark without & within. M.L. M.L. M.L." [...] Longfellow, a friend and neighbor, referred to Lowell as [...] "lonely and desolate".|$|E
500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> in prison?" ...|$|E

Clapton had initially left the series, but returned for the final two episodes of the season to design four different costumes. In an interview, Michele Clapton spoke about the process and meaning behind Cersei Lannister's gown and crown in the season finale. Clapton stated that she had four to five weeks to create the gown, but once she received the script for the episode, she was [...] "immediately sure" [...] of how the dress should look. She stated in the interview, [...] "I {{knew it had to}} be leather and I knew it had to be linked to Tywin. I wanted a distinct, strong silhouette, so I squared her shoulders. I also wanted the dress to skim her ankles, so that you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> feet—again, strength. The silver shoulders are decorated in a similar manner to Jaime's gold hand—the one person that she still has something with." [...] Clapton also noted that every part of the dress represents something, saying, [...] "There is no 'decoration' to Cersei." [...] She stated that she additionally chose to make the dress black in order to represent mourning, as well as a [...] "deadness inside her." ...|$|E

500|$|After various failed relationships, Lex finally {{believes}} he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang. In [...] "Hypnotic", {{in an effort to}} stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drives Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons. Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years, but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on—he succeeded. When Clark and Lana's relationship crumbled, because of Clark's deceit, Lex was waiting. Rosenbaum believes that Lana was [...] "tired of the boy and wanted a man around". By contrast, Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship [...] "turned into much more". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because [...] "she knows she will never really love him." [...] Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in [...] "Void", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex. Kreuk feels that if Lex had chosen a different path after the events of [...] "Lexmas", then Lana {{would have been able to}} truly love him.|$|E
500|$|The {{beginning}} of season five saw, for the first time, Clark and Lana in a happy relationship together, one that was void of dishonesty and secrets. The return of Clark's powers in [...] "Hidden", {{as well as the}} secrets and lies that accompany them, caused stress on their relationship. In the series' 100th episode, Clark finally took a chance and told Lana the truth. When it resulted, indirectly, in her death and he was allowed to live the day over again Clark chose not to tell her his secret. In [...] "Hypnotic", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drove Lana into Lex's arms.

One Handley Page dropped out for mechanical reasons, but the NBS-1s dropped six bombs in quick succession between 12:18pm and 12:31pm. Bomb aiming points were for the water near the ship.
