In standard cell culture conditions zeta potential approached zero, indicating the high probability of particle agglomeration.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 years, {{each of the}} four {{countries}} in the UK has attempted to resolve continuing difficulties with duplication of assessment and lack of shared information in community care, by developing approaches to shared assessment. Relevant literature reviews have previously focused on challenges to partnership working between health and social care, and on different approaches to assessment. The literature review described here differs in three key respects. Firstly, the literature was selected on the basis that it addressed shared assessment specifically. Secondly, it included evidence from the four countries within the UK, providing a cross-national basis to the evidence. Thirdly, this study was undertaken to identify whether benefits from shared assessment were evident, in addition to the challenges. While the evidence of benefits at this stage is relatively limited, it is clear that some have emerged, including two relating directly to relevant policy objectives: improved communication, service user and carer involvement; improved partnership and joined up working. As approaches to shared assessment are currently under review in Scotland, England and Wales, and implementation underway in Northern Ireland, and in light of the economic recession and demographic <b>challenges,</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> key aspects of the evidence may be timely...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests environmental change {{to be most}} severe across the semi-arid subtropics, with past, present and projected drying of the Mediterranean Basin posing a key multidisciplinary <b>challenge.</b> <b>Consideration</b> <b>of</b> a single climatic factor, however, often fails to explain spatiotemporal growth dynamics of drought-prone ecosystems. Here, we present annually resolved and absolutely dated ring width measurements of 871 Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) from 18 individual plot sites in the Central Spanish Pinar Grande forest reserve. Although comprising tree ages from 6 to 175 years, this network correlates surprisingly well with the inverse May–July diurnal temperature range (r = 0. 84; p < 0. 00011956 – 2011). Ring width extremes were triggered by pressure anomalies of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the long-term growth decline coincided with Iberian-wide drying since the mid- 1970 s. Climate model simulations not only confirm this negative trend over the last decades but also project drought to continuously increase over the 21 st century. Associated ecological effects and socio-economic consequences should be considered to improve adaptation strategies of agricultural and forest management, as well as biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to raise {{awareness}} surrounding child and adolescent mental health {{in an effort to}} reduce preconceived stigmas in relation to this specialized field. This project presented a literature review of the current state of child and adolescent mental health in Canada today, including the prevalence and several treatment options for young people confronting mental health <b>challenges.</b> <b>Consideration</b> <b>of</b> the powerful role of the education system upon youth with mental health issues became evident, specifically regarding early identification and prevention. A needs assessment was conducted to gather feedback from the clinical practitioners of a Section 23 classroom within a Southern Ontario hospital. This assessment was used to develop an informational and pedagogical workshop resource to extend practitioner understanding of this pertinent issue and support the social and emotional needs of young people confronting mental heath challenges. Results of the assessment indicated the significant need for such a workshop resource, and these responses were used to guide the development of Group Chat: A Workshop to Support the Emotional and Social Needs of Youth. The latter was subsequently presented to participants, whereby evaluative questionnaires indicated the efficacy and usefulness of this workshop resource to both practitioners and students alike...|$|R

30|$|In recent years, {{the network}} {{community}} from academia and industry {{has focused on}} the creation and management of virtual networks [1].

The procedures and mechanisms used to manage these virtual networks are part of the so-called Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) topic.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1985 Contrary to {{expected}} results, black-legged and red-legged kittiwakes on St. George Island exhibited {{more variability}} in annual breeding performance than black-legged kittiwakes at Cape Peirce. Thick-billed and common murres at St. George also showed more annual variability than common murres at Cape Peirce. Kittiwakes at St. George exhibited improved breeding performance during years with colder water temperatures and lower summer wind speeds. Correlations between breeding performance in kittiwakes and murres and environmental conditions at Cape Peirce were inconclusive. A general {{decline in the}} annual breeding success of kittiwakes and murres at St. George between 1976 and 1984 coincided with reduced abundance of juvenile walleye pollock.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} integrated biological systems across scales is difficult, with challenges {{arising from the}} modeling, understanding, and search of complex system design spaces. This paper explores these <b>challenges</b> through <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> how sto-chastic nanoscale phenomenon relate to higher level systems functioning across many scales. A domain-independent methodology is introduced which uses multi-agent simula-tions to predict emergent system behavior and structure–behavior–function (SBF) repre-sentations to facilitate design space navigation. The methodology is validated through a nanoscale design application of synthetic myosin motor systems. In the multi-agent simu-lation, myosins are independent computational agents with varied structural inputs that enable differently tuned mechanochemical behaviors. Four synthetic myosins were designed and replicated as agent populations, and their simulated behavior was consist-ent with empirical studies of individual myosins and the macroscopic performance of myosin-powered muscle contractions. However, in order to configure high performance technologies, designers must effectively reason about simulation inputs and outputs; we find that counter-intuitive relations arise when linking system performance to individua...|$|R

40|$|The Altiplano-Puna ultralow-velocity zone in {{the central}} Andes, South America, is the largest active magma body in Earth’s {{continental}} crust. Space geodetic observations reported an uplift in the Altiplano-Puna proper {{at a rate of}} ~ 10 mm/year; however, the nature of the inferred inflation source has been uncertain. We present data showing that the uplift has persisted at a nearly constant rate over the past two decades, and is surrounded by a broad zone of subsidence. We show that the ongoing uplift and peripheral subsidence may result from a large mid-crustal diapir fed by partial melt from the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body. There is a long-standing debate on themech-anisms of transport of silicic melts fromthe source region to the final emplacement levels in the upper crust. Once-prevailing views of slow transport of silicic melts in crustal diapirs (1) have been <b>challenged</b> by <b>considerations</b> <b>of</b> thermal viability of diapirs and suggestions that most of granitic melts are transported to the upper crust in dikes (2, 3).
