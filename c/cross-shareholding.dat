2500|$|Control and {{ownership}} structure {{refers to the}} types and composition of shareholders in a corporation. In some countries such as most of Continental Europe, ownership is not necessarily equivalent to control due {{to the existence of}} e.g. dual-class shares, ownership pyramids, voting coalitions, proxy votes and clauses in the articles of association that confer additional voting rights to long-term shareholders. Ownership is typically defined as the ownership of cash flow rights whereas control refers to ownership of control or voting rights. Researchers often [...] "measure" [...] control {{and ownership}} structures by using some observable measures of control and ownership concentration or the extent of inside control and ownership. Some features or types of control and ownership structure involving corporate groups include pyramids, cross-shareholdings, rings, and webs. German [...] "concerns" [...] (Konzern) are legally recognized corporate groups with complex structures. Japanese keiretsu (系列) and South Korean chaebol (which tend to be family-controlled) are corporate groups which consist of complex interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. <b>Cross-shareholding</b> are an essential feature of keiretsu and chaebol groups [...] Corporate engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders can differ substantially across different control and ownership structures.|$|E
2500|$|Today, the Jardine Matheson Group {{is still}} very much active in Hong Kong, being one of the largest {{conglomerates}} in Hong Kong and its largest employer, second only to the government. Several landmarks in present-day Hong Kong are named after the firm and the founders Jardine and Matheson like Jardine's Bazaar, Jardine's Crescent, Jardine's Bridge, Jardine's Lookout, Yee Wo Street, Matheson Street, Jardine House and the Noon Day Gun. Jardines is also active in China, North America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East and parts of Africa. [...] It went through several major internal changes throughout the 19th and 20th century. [...] In 1947, a secret Trust was formed by members of the family to retain effective control over the company. [...] Jardine, Matheson and Co. offered its shares to the public in 1961 under the tenure of Sir Hugh Barton and was oversubscribed 56 times. The Keswick family, in consortium with several London-based banks and financial institutions, bought out the controlling shares of the Buchanan-Jardine family in 1959, but subsequently sold most of the shares during the 1961 public offering, retaining only about 10% of the company. The company had its head office redomiciled to Bermuda in 1984 under the tenure of Simon Keswick to maintain control after nearly being taken over by Chinese tycoon Li Ka-shing of Cheung Kong after a hostile raid in 1980. Li, who bought nearly 20% of the company at that time the largest shareholding in the company, agreed to sell his shares to Hongkong Land, a sister company of Jardines, at a premium. [...] Another reason for the move was fear of the Chinese take-over of Hong Kong and the threat of Chinese retaliation for Jardines drug smuggling past. [...] Subsequent events led to the <b>cross-shareholding</b> structure between Jardine, Matheson & Co. and Hongkong Land which was first instigated in 1980 by then taipan David Newbigging. [...] In 1988, instigated by Brian Powers, the first American taipan of Jardines, the entire corporate structure of Jardine, Matheson & Co., including all its allied companies, were restructured so that a holding company based in London and controlled by the Keswick family would have overall policy and strategic control of all Jardine Matheson Group companies. [...] The firm delisted from the Hong Kong Stock exchange (Hang Seng Index) in 1994 under the tenure of Alasdair Morrison and placed its primary listing in London and its secondary listing in Singapore. [...] The present Chairman of Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. is Sir Henry Keswick, who is based in the UK, was the company's tai-pan from 1970 (aged 31) to 1975 and was the 6th Keswick to be tai-pan of the company. His brother, Simon, was the company's taipan from 1983 to 1988 and is the 7th Keswick to be tai-pan. Both brothers are the 4th generation of Keswicks in the company. [...] The firm's present managing director or tai-pan is Anthony Nightingale who is based in Hong Kong. [...] The organizational structure of Jardines has changed almost totally, but the members of the family of Dr. William Jardine still control the firm through a complex <b>cross-shareholding</b> structure, several allied shareholders and a secretive 1947 Trust.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We have {{developed}} a simple approach to valuing risky corporate debt when corporations own securities issued by other corporations. We assume that corporate debt can be valued as an option on corporate business asset value, and derive payoff functions when there exist cross-holdings of stock or debt between two firms. Next we show that payoff functions with multiple cross-holdings can be solved by the contraction principle. The payoff functions which we derive provide a number of insights about the risk structure of company cross-holdings. First, the Modigliani-Miller theorem can obtain when there exist cross-holdings between firms. Second, by establishing <b>cross-shareholdings</b> each of stock holders distributes a part of its payoff values to the bond holder of the other's firm, so that both firms can decrease credit risks by <b>cross-shareholdings.</b> In the numerical examples, we show that the correlation in firms can be a critical condition for reducing credit risk by cross-holdings of stock using Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, we show we can calculate the default spread easily when complicated cross-holdings exist in many firms by a simulation that includes the contraction principle method. By using our method, we can reevaluate which cross-held shares are beneficial or disadvantageous for the cross-holding firms. 1...|$|R
40|$|SSRN Working PaperThere is {{a common}} {{perception}} that the Japanese takeover market excludes foreign companies. But this is not because Japanese takeover law is designed to protect target companies. Comparing Japanese takeover law with the UK Takeover Code and the European Takeover Directive, this thematic and content- based investigation reveals that Japan does not have overt anti-takeover legislation. There is no stake-building control to alert a target company; there is no provision against virtual bids; post-bid undertaking is not legally binding on the bidder; {{the equivalent of the}} mandatory bid under the UK Takeover Code and the EU Directive is set at a much higher level so making it less costly for a bidder to obtain corporate control; there is no price control to protect minority shareholders. Yet the traditional symbiotic relationship between management and shareholders through <b>cross-shareholdings</b> and shareholder perks remains a major obstacle to a successful unsolicited takeover. Measures have been introduced to increase the success of unsolicited takeover bids by reducing <b>cross-shareholdings</b> through tax incentive measures and increasing board independence through a soft-law based governance code. These are unlikely to {{have a major impact on}} removing the existing obstacles. Adopting the UK Takeover Code or the EU Takeover Directive would not cure the problem and would more likely entrench the existing situation...|$|R
