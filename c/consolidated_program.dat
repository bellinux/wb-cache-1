The <b>consolidated</b> <b>program</b> 2 ̆ 7 s new title will be the Dean Rusk Center - International, Comparative 2 ̆ 6 Graduate Legal Studies. The executive director is Associate Dean and Charles H. Kirbo Professor Gabriel Wilner, former director of International and Graduate Legal Studies.

Wilner will also continue to direct the Brussels Seminar, an intensive three-week course on European Union law taught in cooperation with the universities in Brussels, which Dean Rusk and he founded in 1973. Dean and Virginia Rusk Professor Thomas Schoenbaum, executive director of the Rusk Center for the past 18 years, has returned to full-time teaching at the University and will become executive director of UGA 2 ̆ 7 s proposed Center for European Studies effective July 1, 2000.

40|$|The article {{reports a}} case study of an {{evaluation}} of an elementary school in northern California in receipt of large amounts of Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title I and state <b>Consolidated</b> <b>Program</b> funds. Technical aspects of the evaluation report are described and criticized as being determined by federal and state government regulations. The official evaluation report’s unfortunate effects on the school are noted. It is suggested that the case study has revealed further serious weaknesses in mandated evaluation. n recent years, there have been many criticisms of state and 1 federal government expectations of evaluation of schools in receipt of Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title I or similarly targeted state funds for the education of disadvantaged students. One stream of criticism focuses on the inadequacy of data compiled in state and federal program evaluation; another stream has chartered the narrowing effects mandated tests have had on curricula. This article has a different emphasis. It is a commentary on a school district evaluation of a northern California elementary school. The school’s enrollment of a very high proportion of low-income and minority students qualified it for additional government funds. The evaluation reported here was conducted by the school district acting in compliance with state and federal regulations. The author’s curiosity in the effects on schools of mandated formula-based evaluation arose from a visit to the school in question on a day when, by chance, the superintendent’s team responsible for the evalua-tion reported its findings to staff. The writer was struck by differences between what was readily observable about the school, such as th...|$|E
40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{involving the}} insertion of the disabled in sports and activities keeps growing. Disabilities, minor and major, concern one in six people in the European Union (EU); that is, about 80 million people {{are not able to}} fully participate in everyday social and economic life. (Communication from the European Commission-European Disability Strategy 2010 - 2020 : A renewed commitment to a barrier-Brussels 2010). The organization of events therefore becomes a movement of significant importance to which innovation and new identity is necessary. Our research was based on the validity and the return of a sports event called “Una giornata abilmente…diversa” (“An ably diverse day”), dedicated to the disabled. Three associations for the disabled participated in the event, as well as secondary schools of the commune Santa Maria Capua Vetere. The event took place at the public pool of Santa Maria Capua Vetere on May 15, 2012 and saw: Recreational activities; Activities linked to water autonomy; Activities regarding lifesaving. Subjects without disabilities also took part in the events. The analysis and the elaboration of the data, as well as a survey given to the disabled subjects, the operators, family members and managers of the associations involved in the event, found that such an initiative results in moments of true inclusion, and the possibility to take advantage of certain structures and therefore carry out physical activities. The organization of the event demonstrated that the synergy between the players, the local organizations, the universities and schools, sports associations and social associations, can bring about moments of confrontation and development to allow the realization of a <b>consolidated</b> <b>program</b> for the physical activities for the disabled...|$|E
