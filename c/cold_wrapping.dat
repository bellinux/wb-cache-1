Vitamin E {{has been shown to}} be a potent endogenous antioxidant and free radical scavenger under both physiological and pathological conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether <b>cold</b> <b>wrap</b> restraint stress altered in vivo intestinal fluid absorption in rats, and whether vitamin E administration prior to the induction of <b>cold</b> <b>wrap</b> restraint stress could prevent such changes in intestinal secretion. Jejunal, ileal and colonic fluid and electrolyte transport rates were measured in vivo using an isolated loop technique. <b>Cold</b> <b>wrap</b> restraint stress reduced in vivo fluid absorption in the ileum and colon, but not in the jejunum. Administration of vitamin E prior to the <b>cold</b> <b>wrap</b> restraint stress procedure completely prevented this alteration of ileal and colonic fluid absorption...|$|R

At age 18, his knee was badly injured by {{a horse and}} he successfully treated the affliction using cold compresses. Initially, he met a monk who advised him to wash his stiff joint with wet cloths several times a day.

Now being aware {{of the effectiveness of}} the newfound method, he started using compresses for wounds, bruises, swellings, and stiffness of the joints for both humans and animals. He acquired a reputation as a healer of domestic animals, and subsequently used this treatment on injured humans. Later he introduced steam baths and full-body wraps for individuals without injuries as a means of naturopathic healing. From observations of sick animals that refused to eat, Schroth developed the idea of an austere diet for humans that included a regimen of [...] "dry and drinkable days". Soon his curative methodology of <b>cold</b> <b>wraps,</b> steam and diet was touted as a means of purification and detoxification of the entire body, physical and mental.|$|R

50|$|On September 5, the NHC {{indicated}} {{that the development of}} a tropical cyclone was possible in the East Atlantic over subsequent days. A tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa on September 6, slowly coalescing into Tropical Storm Ian by 06:00 UTC on September 12. Steered north and the northeast by an approaching upper-level trough, the cyclone struggled within an environment of high shear, with its low-level center displaced west of its associated convection. An upper-trough became superimposed with the storm's center by late on September 14, yielding a more subtropical-like appearance on conventional satellite. As a result, Ian briefly transitioned into a subtropical storm around 18:00 UTC, but re-acquired tropical characteristics just 18 hours later while moving northeastward away from the aforementioned trough. By 06:00 UTC on September 16, a small mid-level eye became apparent and Ian began to intensify, with winds reaching 60 mph (95 km/h) at that time. However, deep convection soon dissipated as <b>cold</b> air <b>wrapped</b> into the center, marking Ian's transition into an extratropical cyclone around 120:00 UTC. On September 17, Ian's remnants were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone and soon dissipated.|$|R

Madame Defarge being sensitive to <b>cold,</b> was <b>wrapped</b> in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large earrings.

5000|$|It {{appears that}} PMA elevates body {{temperatures}} dramatically; {{the cause of}} this property is suspected to be related to its ability to inhibit MAO-A {{and at the same time}} releasing large amounts of serotonin, effectively causing serotonin syndrome. [...] Amphetamines, especially serotonergic analogues such as MDMA, are strongly contraindicated to take with MAOIs. Many amphetamines and adrenergic compounds raise body temperatures; whereas some tend to produce more euphoric activity, or peripheral vasoconstriction, or tend to favor one effect over another, it appears that PMA activates the hypothalamus much more strongly than MDMA and other drugs like ephedrine, thereby causing rapid increases in body temperature (which is the major cause of death in PMA mortalities).

40|$|This project {{aimed to}} {{understand}} the mechanisms of heat transport into and through moving granular beds; develop accurate, validated models describing this heat transport; and transfer this new knowledge into {{the operations of the}} sponsors. To achieve these goals an ambitious program of work involving both experimental and numerical modelling was completed. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop models that are capable of predicting the temperature profile in the pilot kiln and its variation with change in operating parameters, as this would indicate that the model is capable of simulating the heat transfer processes in an actual operating kiln. The project was completed in July 2005 with research conducted in three areas. Pilot Kiln studies: A series of experiments to collect data on heat transfer have been carried out for two particle size distributions, varying rotation speed, temperature and feed rate. This provides a valuable set of data in a realistic but controlled experimental arrangement {{that can be used for}} model development and validation. DEM modelling: Heat conduction and advection have been added to the DEM code in work carried out outside this project. A model with a 2 D simulation of a 1 m diameter lab-scale kiln operating at 30 % critical speed shows strong mixing towards thermal homogeneity as the initially separated hot and <b>cold</b> regions <b>wrap</b> around each other. These simulations establish that the heat conduction model is operating reasonably. CFD Modelling: The CFD modelling work was delayed waiting for experimental data to be obtained. Modelling of the flame of the pilot kiln has been carried out as the first stage of the model development, and this has been linked to a 1 D model of the bed. A 2 D model of heat transfer within the pilot kiln bed was developed, using heat transfer relationships obtained from the laboratory experiments and DEM simulations. The model was run, together with the coupled flame / longitudinal bed model for all the Waterford pilot kiln operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between storms and extreme ocean {{waves in the}} North Sea is assessed using a long-period wave dataset and storms identified in the Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). An ensemble sensitivity analysis is used to provide information on the spatial and temporal forcing from mean sea-level pressure and surface wind associated with extreme ocean wave height responses. Extreme ocean waves in the central North Sea arise due to intense extratropical cyclone winds from either the cold conveyor belt (northerly-wind events) or the warm conveyor belt (southerly-wind events). The largest wave heights are associated with northerly-wind events which tend to have stronger wind speeds and occur as the <b>cold</b> conveyor belt <b>wraps</b> rearwards round the cyclone to the cold side of the warm front. The northerly-wind events provide a larger fetch to the central North Sea to aid wave growth.

40|$|We are {{describing}} an SC quadrupole {{where the}} field is created {{not only by the}} poles but with the wall current distributions in equal proportions. This delivers a good field quality in all apertures allowing a compact and inexpensive design. This type of quadrupole designed for Cornell ERL could be recommended for ILC also. Dipole corrector with single-layer coil is described also. 1. Overview There are several publications describing the SC quad design for TESLA [2] and for ILC [3] which could be useful for implementation in ERL. Design of [3] repeats earlier design described in [2]. However neither of these publications contains the field throughthe-lens-integrals as function of transverse offset. Meanwhile 3 D field behavior is crucial for the low emittance beams, which are ILC and ERL. On the other hand {{it is clear that the}} field generation with the poles requires precise profiling which is difficult to keep unchanged in wide specifications for feeding current. So we chose a different approach, which allows, theoretically, a good-field region coinciding with entire aperture (100 %) available for the beam [4]. Coils for this type of lens is single layered and could be manufactured with minimal efforts [5]. Numerical calculations made with MERMAID successfully used for design of CESR-C wigglers for taking into account real properties of yoke (Steel 1010). Lenses and dipole correctors working well with 4. 2 o K Helium; usage of Helium with lower temperature, say 2 o K (which is in use for RF structure) is welcomed as it allows to have the margins for current to be up to 15 % higher, so operation at 2 o K might bring some cost reduction.
