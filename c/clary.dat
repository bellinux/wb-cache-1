5|$|By 1795, Bonaparte {{had become}} engaged to Désirée <b>Clary,</b> {{daughter}} of François <b>Clary.</b> Désirée's sister Julie <b>Clary</b> had married Bonaparte's elder brother Joseph. In April 1795, {{he was assigned}} to the Army of the West, which was engaged in the War in the Vendée—a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in Vendée, a region in west central France on the Atlantic Ocean. As an infantry command, it was a demotion from artillery general—for which the army already had a full quota—and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting.|$|E

5|$|On {{the sixth}} {{night of the}} Games, Lochte swam his last two finals, with only 30 minutes in between. First, he won the bronze medal in the 200m backstroke, {{finishing}} behind compatriot Tyler <b>Clary</b> and Japan's Ryosuke Irie. His time of 1.53.94 tied the time he swam {{four years ago when}} he won the gold medal at the 2008 Games, which was then a world record. Half an hour later, Lochte took on Phelps in the 200m individual medley. He won a silver medal behind Phelps in what was thought at the time to be the last head-to-head race of their careers, as Phelps retired after the Games. This was the third consecutive Olympics in which Lochte won a medal in the 200m individual medley.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} {{football}} at the Naval Academy is debated among historians. The most accepted occurrence was in 1869, when a midshipman (a student) {{returned from his}} leave with a football. While throwing the ball with a friend, it was dropped {{and a group of}} fellow midshipmen attempted to take it. A contest was eventually organized, which ended abruptly when the ball was kicked into the Severn River. However, biographer C. Douglas Kroll stated that the first evidence of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward, a theory supported by journalist Jack <b>Clary.</b> Regardless, the sport had been banned for several years prior to 1879.|$|E
5|$|After the assault, the 33rd Division {{pursued the}} {{retreating}} German forces, while the 38th stayed close behind {{ready to take}} over the advance or assault strongly-held German positions as needed. On 9 October, <b>Clary</b> was liberated and the next day the divisional artillery was firing in support of the 33rd which had made contact with German forces. Over the next few days, the 33rd Division pursued the Germans to the River Selle and launched a bloody assault on the defended eastern bank during the opening stages of the Battle of the Selle. While a bridgehead was secured, it was abandoned due to losses and the 38th Division was moved forward. On the night of 13/14 October, the division took over the line near Troisvilles and Bertry. Over the next six days, the division prepared itself: conducting reconnaissance, constructing bridges and moving up heavy artillery. During these preparations, the Germans bombarded elements of the division's artillery with gas shells.|$|E
