40|$|Based on {{previous}} Bureau of Mines research indicating that improved high-temperature properties {{could be achieved}} for periclase refractories through <b>chemical</b> <b>additions,</b> the Bureau investigated the properties of full-size bricks produced from chemically modified periclase refractory grains and the suitability of making such <b>chemical</b> <b>additions</b> to Mg(OH) 2 slurries prior to production of the periclase grains. In full-size brick testing, strength values, both hot and cold, for the optimized bricks were superior to those for a commercial 98 -wt-pct-MgO refractory. The best results were obtained for a natural magnesite with an adjusted CaO:Si 02 (C:S) ratio of 3. 0 and a 1. 0 -wt-pct addition of Zr 02 and for a seawater periclase with an adjusted C:S ratio of 2. 5 and a 0. 5 -wt-pct addition of Mn 02. For samples produced from chemically modified Mg(OH) 2 slurries, additions of both Mn 02 and Zr 02 {{and an increase in}} C:S ratios produced significant increases in hot flexural strength, similar to those resulting from <b>chemical</b> <b>additions</b> made to periclase grains. The most effective modifications were additions of Mn 02 to brine-derived periclases having a C:S ratio adjusted to 3. 0.

40|$|Biofilters degrade {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the natural organic matter (NOM) contained in seawater which is the leading cause of biofouling in downstream processes. This work studies the effects of <b>chemical</b> <b>additions</b> on NOM biodegradation by biofilters. In this work, biofiltration of seawater with an empty bed contact time (EBCT) of 6 min and a hydraulic loading rate of 10 m h- 1 reduces the biological oxygen demand (BOD 7) by 8 %, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by 6 % and the UV absorbance at 254 nm (A 254) by 7 %. Different amounts of ammonium chloride are added to the seawater (up to twice the total dissolved nitrogen in untreated seawater) to study its possible effect on the removal of NOM by a pilot-scale biofilter. Seawater is amended with different amounts of easily biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) supplied as sodium acetate (up to twice the DOC) for the same purpose. The results of this work reveal that the ammonium chloride additions do not significantly affect NOM removal and the sodium acetate is completely consumed by the biofiltration process. For both types of <b>chemical</b> <b>additions,</b> the BOD 7, DOC and A 254 in the outlet stream of the biofilter are similar to the values for the untreated control. These results indicate that this biofilter easily removes the BDOC from the seawater when the EBCT is not above 6 min.

5000|$|DNA {{damage is}} an {{abnormal}} alteration {{in the structure}} of DNA that cannot, itself, be replicated when DNA replicates. In contrast, a mutation is a change in the nucleic acid sequence that can be replicated; hence, a mutation can be inherited {{from one generation to the}} next. Damage can occur from <b>chemical</b> <b>addition</b> (adduct), or structural disruption to a base of DNA (creating an abnormal nucleotide or nucleotide fragment), or a break in one or both DNA strands. When DNA containing damage is replicated, an incorrect base may be inserted in the new complementary strand as it is being synthesized (see [...] ). The incorrect insertion in the new strand will occur opposite the damaged site in the template strand, and this incorrect insertion can become a mutation (i.e. a changed base pair) in the next round of replication. Furthermore, double-strand breaks in DNA may be repaired by an inaccurate repair process, non-homologous end joining, which produces mutations. Mutations can ordinarily be avoided if accurate DNA repair systems recognize DNA damage and repair it prior to completion of the next round of replication. At least 169 enzymes are either directly employed in DNA repair or influence DNA repair processes. Of these, 83 are directly employed in the 5 types of DNA repair processes indicated in the chart shown in the article DNA repair.|$|E
