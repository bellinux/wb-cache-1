40|$|Studies {{of student}} {{retention}} and progression overwhelmingly appear adopt definitions that place the institution, {{rather than the}} student, at the <b>centre.</b> <b>Retention</b> is most often conceived in terms of linear and continuous progress between institutionally identified start and end points. This paper reports on research that considered data from 38 in-depth interviews conducted with individuals who had characteristics often associated with non-traditional engagement in higher education who between 2006 and 2010 had studied an ‘Introduction to HE’ module at one distance higher education institution, {{some of whom had}} progressed to further study at that institution, some of whom had not. The research deployed a life histories approach to seek a finer grained understanding of how individuals conceptualise their own learning journey and experience, in order to reflect on institutional conceptions of student retention. The findings highlight potential anomalies hidden within institutional retention rates – large proportions of the interview participants who were not ‘retained’ by the institution reported successful progression to and in other learning institutions and environments, both formal and informal. Nearly all described positive perspectives on lifelong learning which were either engendered or improved by the learning undertaken. This attests to the complexity of individuals’ lives and provides clear evidence that institution-centric definitions of retention and progression are insufficient to create truly meaningful understanding of successful individual learning journeys and experiences. It is argued that only through careful consideration of the lived experience of students and a re-conception of measures of retention, will we be able to offer real insight into improving student retention...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to improve pathology services in selected remote health centres from the Northern Territory (NT) through the implementation of a quality managed point-of-care pathology testing (POCT) service. DESIGN: Study of the efficacy of the POCT service after 1 year and qualitative survey of POCT device operators. SETTING: The study was set in thirty-three remote health centres in the NT administered by the NT Department of Health. PARTICIPANTS: Remote health centre staff at participating remote health centres participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: The introduction of the i-STAT device to perform on-site POCT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures used in the study were the number of remote staff trained, volume of testing performed and satisfaction of POCT device operators. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-four health professional staff were trained to perform i-STAT POCT during the first year of the program. A total of 2290 POCT tests were performed on the i-STAT. The volume of testing consistently increased across the year. Tests for international normalised ratio were the most frequently performed (averaging 70 tests per month). Stakeholder satisfaction with the i-STAT device was high, with a statistically significant improvement in satisfaction levels with pathology service provision being reported after the introduction of POCT. Greater than 80 % of respondents stated POCT was more convenient than the laboratory service and assisted in the stabilisation of acutely ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: The NT POCT Program has been operationally effective and well received by staff working as i-STAT POCT operators in remote health <b>centres.</b> <b>Retention</b> of remote health centre staff is the most significant challenge to ensuring the program's long-term viability.

It analyses {{the state of}} early career teaching attrition and turnover in Chile over a ten-year period, and goes on more closely {{to the study of}} new teacher trajectories over their first two years of teaching. In line with literature on issues of retention/attrition it considers the impact of school conditions and changes in professional satisfaction and self-efficacy perceptions {{in the early years of}} teaching. Data sources include econometric analysis of existing databases as well as surveys, interviews and narratives. Quantitative results indicate high attrition rates of early career teachers in Chile, and teacher narratives show "critical" as well as "protective" conditions that foreshadow decisions to leave or the stay in the profession.

40|$|Successful {{treatment}} of people infected with HIV requires that patients are retained in HIV care, use combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and ultimately reach and sustain viral suppression. Our {{aim was to}} identify health facility characteristics associated with these steps in the cascade of HIV care. Retrospective cohort study. We included data from all adult HIV- 1 -infected patients who entered care in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2013 (N =  7120). Multivariate logistic regression {{was used to examine}} the associations between health facility characteristics and the outcomes 'currently in care', 'initiated cART', and 'viral suppression'. The proportion of patients 'currently in care' was high in all 26 treatment centres. cART initiation was positively associated with the accreditation of the health facility [OR (odds ratio) : 1. 62; 95 % CI (confidence interval) : 1. 18 - 2. 23] and the performance of an internal audit in the preceding 3 years (OR: 1. 36; 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 81). The odds of cART initiation were higher in middle-sized (OR: 2. 00; 95 % CI: 1. 25 - 3. 21) and large HIV treatment centres (OR: 1. 80; 95 % CI: 1. 14 - 2. 84) compared with small centres (< 300 HIV-infected patients). Viral suppression was negatively associated with the presence of a social worker in the HIV treatment team (OR: 0. 62; 95 % CI: 0. 43 - 0. 91). Our results confirm that appointing expert HIV treatment <b>centres</b> facilitates <b>retention</b> in care and that a minimum volume requirement may be desirable.

40|$|Abstract Background Retention on lifelong {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ART) {{is essential}} in sustaining treatment success while preventing HIV drug resistance (HIVDR), especially in resource-limited settings (RLS). In an era of rising numbers of patients on ART, mastering patients in care is becoming more strategic for programmatic interventions. Due to lapses and uncertainty with the current WHO sampling approach in Cameroon, we thus aimed to ascertain the national performance of, and determinants in, retention on ART at 12  months. Methods Using a systematic random sampling, a survey was conducted in the ten regions (56 sites) of Cameroon, within the “reporting period” of October 2013 –November 2014, enrolling 5005 eligible adults and children. Performance in retention on ART at 12  months was interpreted following the definition of HIVDR early warning indicator: excellent (> 85 %), fair (85 – 75 %), poor (< 75); and factors with p-value[*]<[*] 0. 01 were considered statistically significant. Results Majority (74. 4 %) of patients were in urban settings, and 50. 9 % were managed in reference treatment <b>centres.</b> Nationwide, <b>retention</b> on ART at 12  months was 60. 4 % (2023 / 3349); only six sites and one region achieved acceptable performances. Retention performance varied in reference treatment centres (54. 2 %) vs. management units (66. 8 %), p[*]<[*] 0. 0001; male (57. 1 %) vs. women (62. 0 %), p[*]=[*] 0. 007; and with WHO clinical stage I (63. 3 %) vs. other stages (55. 6 %), p[*]=[*] 0. 007; but neither for age (adults [60. 3 %] vs. children [58. 8 %], p[*]=[*] 0. 730) nor for immune status (CD 4351 – 500 [65. 9 %] vs. other CD 4 -staging [59. 86 %], p[*]=[*] 0. 077). Conclusions Poor retention in care, within 12  months of ART initiation, urges active search for lost-to-follow-up targeting preferentially male and symptomatic patients, especially within reference ART clinics. Such sampling strategy could be further strengthened for informed ART monitoring and HIVDR prevention perspectives...|$|R
40|$|The study’s {{research}} model {{suggests that}} store design {{and ease of}} shopping are associated with customer retention through a mediated pathway in which store design and ease of shopping influence perceived store satisfaction, which in turn, influences customer retention. This survey was administered to two separate clothing stores offered to either females or males (in total, 533 participants). Using structural equation modelling methodology, data was analysed to explain the interrelations among the variables in the model. The results of an empirical study of a sample of store shoppers revealed that store design and ease of shopping influence customer retention {{in an indirect way}} through customer perception of satisfaction with the store. In building store satisfaction that is <b>centred</b> on customer <b>retention,</b> store design and shopping ease differ in their relative influences. This difference is high for females, but for men as low as to be considered negligible in males. As a result, improving customers’ perceptions of store design and ease of shopping is a way to ensure store satisfaction support customer retention. The results of the study provide a new insight into the relationships by suggesting indirect effects of shopping ease and store design on consumer retention by their impacts on store satisfaction, rather than direct effects. </p...|$|R
5000|$|With {{the onset}} of the First World War in 1914, the number of {{undergraduates}} at Trinity fell dramatically. In May the college had 150 in residence; {{by the end of the}} year the number was closer to 30, and by the end of the war it was in single digits. Blakiston wrote to the bereaved families, of which there were soon many, including the family of Noel Chavasse (died 1917), one of three British soldiers ever to be award with the Victoria Cross with bar. With so few paying students, college finances were weak, and many of the staff, including Blakiston, took sizeable pay cuts. Revenue from rooms requisitioned by the armed forces eased the college's longer term outlook; the construction of a new bathhouse at Trinity was also undertaken by its new residents, apparently at no cost. In addition to the exit of so many students, several fellows also volunteered for army service. Consequently, Blakiston was forced to take on greater administrative duties at both the collegiate and university levels, including the Vice-Chancellorship of the university (1917 - 1920). Nevertheless, he remained firmly [...] "a college man", and most of his later involvement with university politics <b>centred</b> on the <b>retention</b> of Trinity's independence.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} rates of patient {{retention}} and attrition {{in the context}} of scaling-up antiretroviral treatment (ART) within a district hospital and its primary health centres in rural Malawi. 'Retention' was defined as being alive and on ART or transferred out, whereas 'attrition' was defined as died, lost to follow-up or stopped treatment. A total of 4074 patients were followed-up for 1803 person-years: 2904 were at the hospital and 1170 at health centres. Approximately 85 % of patients were retained in care, both at hospital and health <b>centres,</b> with a <b>retention</b> rate per 100 person-years of 185 and 211, respectively [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1. 18, 95 % CI 1. 10 - 1. 28, P= 0. 001). Attrition rates per 100 person-years were similar: 33 and 36, respectively (adjusted HR 1. 17, 95 % CI 0. 97 - 1. 4, P= 0. 1). At health centres the incidence of loss to follow-up was significantly lower than at the hospital (adjusted HR 0. 24, P< 0. 001, risk reduction 77 %), but the rate of reported deaths was higher at health centres (adjusted HR 2. 2, 95 % CI 1. 76 - 2. 72, P< 0. 001). As Malawi continues to extend the coverage (and equity) of ART, including in rural areas, attention is needed to reduce losses to follow-up at hospital level and reduce mortality at primary care level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Telehealth, {{as other}} {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) introduced to support the delivery of health care services, is considered as a means to answer many of the imperatives currently challenging health care systems. In Canada, many telehealth projects are taking place, mostly targeting rural, remote or isolated populations. So far, various telehealth applications have been implemented and have shown promising outcomes. However, telehealth utilisation remains limited in many settings, despite increased availability of technology and telecommunication infrastructure. Methods A qualitative field study was conducted in four remote regions of Quebec (Canada) to explore perceptions of physicians and managers regarding the impact of telehealth on clinical practice and the organisation of health care services, as well as the conditions for improving telehealth implementation. A total of 54 respondents were interviewed either individually or in small groups. Content analysis of interviews was performed and identified several effects of telehealth on remote medical practice as well as key conditions to ensure the success of telehealth implementation. Results According to physicians and managers, telehealth benefits include better access to specialised services in remote regions, improved continuity of care, and increased availability of information. Telehealth also improves physicians' practice by facilitating continuing medical education, contacts with peers, and access to a second opinion. At the hospital and health region levels, telehealth has the potential to support the development of regional reference <b>centres,</b> favour <b>retention</b> of local expertise, and save costs. Conditions for successful implementation of telehealth networks include the participation of clinicians in decision-making, the availability of dedicated human and material resources, and a planned diffusion strategy. Interviews with physicians and managers also highlighted the importance of considering telehealth within the broader organisation of health care services in remote and rural regions. Conclusion This study identified core elements that should be considered when implementing telehealth applications with the purpose of supporting medical practice in rural and remote regions. Decision-makers {{need to be aware of}} the specific conditions that could influence telehealth integration into clinical practices and health care organisations. Thus, strategies addressing the identified conditions for telehealth success would facilitate the optimal implementation of this technology. </p...|$|R
40|$|Research Background : Young {{people with}} {{negative}} experiences of mainstream education often display {{low levels of}} traditional literacy. These young people tend to display considerable cultural and social resources developed through their repeated experiences of adversity. Education research {{has a duty to}} provide these young people with opportunities to showcase, assess and translate their social and cultural resources into symbolic forms of capital. This creative work addresses the following research question. How can educators encourage disengaged youth to showcase their social and cultural capital through non-traditional literacy practices? [...] - Research Contribution : This DVD production of a music video affords the young participants opportunities to display their artistic, technical, social and cultural resources through a popular cultural format. In doing so it requires education institutions to assess alternative student outputs that demonstrate the skills these young people acquire as they re-engage in flexible learning environments. The new knowledge derived from this research <b>centres</b> on the <b>retention</b> and certification benefits for disengaged young people using popular culture and social enterprise as authentic learning activities. [...] - Research Significance : This research is significant because it aims to maximise the number of tangible outcomes related to a school-based arts project.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} identify the place of health in Immigrants <b>Retention</b> <b>Centres</b> (IRC) and analyse {{the role of the}} health professionals regarding border control and immigration policies. The current structures to confine unauthorised migrants seem to address a two-fold issue: the repressive approach to controlling immigration and the increasing set-up of facilities participating in a mode of government centred on national security concern. Method. Ethnographical study was conducted in the Medical Units of a French (capacity: 35 pers.) and a Spanish (150 pers.) ICR for respectively, 9 -months with a regularity of 30 half-days of presence every fortnight and 21 continuous days over a 3 -weeks period. Qualitative data from observational notes and conversional interviews were triangulated and analysed under the Critical Categorical Content Discourse method, with Atlas. ti support. Findings. Illnesses that could halt deportation were infectious diseases involving treatment requiring a specialized infrastructure (tuberculosis); in France, those whose representation is bound to feelings of fear and disgust (mange) and mental illness that poses a threat to the individual and other persons; in Spain, pregnancy is a reason to allow a release from IRC. Squats are raid when expulsion quotas need to be filled; it accounted for the increased number of substance dependent persons in ICR at that time. Health professionals in IRC confront moral dilemmas. In France, they have a recognised micro-power able to overturn a deportation order: the medical certificate. Discussion. In ensuring healthcare access, they are drawn into the vigilance and control logics of the IRC security regime, despite themselves. Standardization of the medical practices is their main fall back and provides for risks management, which relies on the architecture and the neatness of the space, individual strategies of exception and social relationship that are shaped by a moral economy. The retreat into medical grounds allows keeping things “professional”and helps balance the tension resulting from providing medical care in a space that automatically appears to translate any act into one carried out in compliance with the repressive policy against undesired migration. Institutionalisation of European IRC medical units network is recommended to confront inequalities in care (access and quality) ...|$|R
