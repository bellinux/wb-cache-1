5|$|On February 1, 1968, the PRR {{merged with}} New York Central Railroad to become Penn Central. The {{remainder}} of the cars were delivered with Penn Central logos, but retained the PRR-specified livery of gray paint with red pinstripes. On March 2, the first GE-powered Metroliners arrived for testing. The pantographs on the Westinghouse-powered cars would bounce on the aging <b>catenary</b> <b>wires,</b> then draw high currents due to improperly designed transformers. The GE-powered cars proved to have a superior pantograph design, but were still not fit for service. On March 12, entry into revenue service was delayed indefinitely. Testing was suspended entirely between June 24 and mid-July; tests with 6-car trains in July had severe issues with electrical arcing. The first combined test train of GE and Westinghouse cars ran on August 8.|$|E
5|$|The station {{served as}} the third station on the Montclair Branch, which was first {{electrified}} by technology created by Thomas Alva Edison in 1930. The overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wires</b> were installed, making the line the first electrically run line on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western alignment. The station remained in service for the Lackawanna Railroad for three more decades, when the railroad merged with the Erie Railroad on October 17, 1960. Although the now Erie-Lackawanna Railway continued to run the Montclair Branch, it reduced service, reducing the once two-rail alignment to one lone track, and removed most of the tracks at Lackawanna Terminal in Montclair. On April 1, 1976, the station {{was transferred to the}} Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) as the Erie-Lackawanna Railway was dissolved into the Conrail program.|$|E
5|$|Branford is {{the first}} {{previously}} rebuilt station to be further renovated with a second platform. A $60 million bond in February 2011 included $16.5 million for a second platform and pedestrian bridge at Branford, $7.3 million for platform extensions at Guilford, and $11 million to add <b>catenary</b> <b>wires</b> to currently unwired sidings along the line. Construction on the new platform at Branford began in September 2013, and the Guilford work is under way as well. After delays, the enlarged Branford station opened on September 30, 2016, although the north platform was not immediately served by trains. Bidding on a second platform and three-level parking garage at Madison, planned since 2009, was scheduled to begin in 2013 but did not occur. Per the agreement with Amtrak, a second platform is planned {{to be added to}} Clinton station. The project was originally planned to start in early 2012, but has since been indefinitely delayed.|$|E
50|$|Commuter {{trains are}} either powered by {{diesel-electric}} or electric locomotives, or else use self-propelled cars (some systems use both). A few systems, particularly around New York City, use electric power, supplied {{by a third}} rail and/or overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wire,</b> which provides quicker acceleration, lower noise, and fewer air-quality issues. Philadelphia's SEPTA Regional Rail uses exclusively electric power, supplied by overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|R
50|$|Around 1980, the <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> {{was removed}} from tracks 13, 14, 15 and 16, to allow dome train cars to enter the station.|$|R
50|$|The western {{portion of}} the Skokie Swift of the Chicago 'L' changed from <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> to third rail in 2004, making it fully {{compatible}} {{with the rest of}} the system.|$|R
5|$|In 1996, the well-connected {{owners of}} Cross Sound Ferry {{proposed}} a footbridge from the Water Street parking garage to the ferry slips so that ferry passengers {{would not have}} to cross Water Street and the tracks at grade. Amtrak saw the project as an opportunity to build a new elevated station nearby and contributed $1 million to the design of the bridge. However, Amtrak reversed course in 1999 and decided to keep using Union Station; in 2001, the railroad declined to fund the footbridge. Also in 2001, Amtrak built a pair of high-level platforms to serve the new Acela Express high-speed service, thus adapting the 19th-century station for 21st-century usage. <b>Catenary</b> <b>wires</b> were installed over the tracks as part of the introduction of the Acela. Later that year or early in 2002, the 1899-built freight house {{on the east side of}} the tracks was torn down as part of redevelopment sponsored by the New London Development Corporation. The freight house had previously been used by Amtrak maintenance-of-way crews, and before that by the Fishers Island Ferry District.|$|E
25|$|Power supply {{upgrades}} (PSU) between Wood Green and Bawtry (Phase 1 - {{completed in}} September 2017) and Bawtry to Edinburgh (Phase 2), including some overhead lines (OLE) support improvements, rewiring of the contact and <b>catenary</b> <b>wires,</b> and headspan to portal conversions (HS2P).|$|E
25|$|Since 1999, {{the line}} has been modernised and the {{overhead}} line equipment has been refurbished and renewed from Mark 1 / Mark 3A to UK1 range to allow an increase line speeds from 110mph to 125mph (with 140mph capability in areas previously fitted with Automatically Tensioned Mark 1 equipment - subject to upgrading of the balance weight arrangement to provide individually tensioned contact / <b>catenary</b> <b>wires</b> and regrading of the contact wires).|$|E
50|$|Assessment of {{residual}} fatigue life of critical railway components like rail, rail weld, wheels, cylinder head, OHE mast, <b>catenary</b> <b>wire,</b> contact wire, wagon components, low components, etc. to formulate remedial actions.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} Anderson Way, also in Gridley off Larkin Rd, {{stands a}} {{foundation}} to a sub-station used to power the <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> and third rail when the line was electrified.|$|R
2500|$|In 1996, Amtrak began {{installing}} electrification gear {{along the}} [...] of track between New Haven and Boston. The infrastructure included a new overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> made of high-strength silver-bearing copper, specified by Amtrak and later patented by Phelps Dodge Specialty Copper Products of Elizabeth, New Jersey.|$|R
25|$|Blue Line {{cars are}} unique among rapid transit {{vehicles}} in Boston, {{in that they}} use both third rail power and pantograph current pickup from overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wires.</b> Trains switch between the two modes at Airport station, near where the line transitions between running in a tunnel and running above ground. Previously, the switchover was made underground at Maverick station. The overhead pantograph was implemented to avoid third rail icing that frequently occurs in winter. Third rail power {{is used in the}} original Blue Line tunnels, which are smaller than most modern subway tunnels.|$|E
25|$|On November 8, 1973, {{the third}} rail system was {{installed}} on the Evanston Branch between South Boulevard in Evanston and the Wilmette terminal. Prior to this, Evanston shuttle trains had to be equipped with trolley poles and power collected through overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wires</b> (similar to the Yellow Line before its conversion to third rail in 2004). The conversion to third rail allowed the CTA to retire the 4000-Series, which were nearly fifty years old and put newer cars on the line. Since {{parts of the line}} are at grade level, some community members initially resisted the conversion and worried the proximity of the rail would be hazardous.|$|E
25|$|A {{long sought}} {{connection}} of train service between the Lackawanna Railroad's Montclair Branch and the Erie Railroad's New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad, which serviced five other stations in Montclair was first proposed in 1929 by the Regional Plan Association. However, the Great Depression shelved any plans {{to connect the}} lines. The plan continued to wane for several years until in 1963, when the old Boonton Branch was reconfigured at Mountain View in Wayne, New Jersey to the New York and Greenwood Lake, when revival plans returned. However, the connection {{continued to be a}} quiet subject until the late 1980s, when New Jersey Transit revived the proposal. A deal was struck with the township of Montclair in 1998, with a one track connection used for only diesel train sets. However, this proposal was changed into a double track connection with overhead electric <b>catenary</b> <b>wires.</b> Construction on the Montclair Connection began one year later and was completed on September 30, 2002.|$|E
50|$|Dedicated {{traction}} current lines are used when railways are supplied with low-frequency alternating current (AC). The {{traction current}} supply line {{is connected to}} substations {{along the line of}} the railway and is usually run separately from the overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> from which the locomotives are fed.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, Amtrak began {{installing}} electrification gear {{along the}} 157 mi of track between New Haven and Boston. The infrastructure included a new overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> made of high-strength silver-bearing copper, specified by Amtrak and later patented by Phelps Dodge Specialty Copper Products of Elizabeth, New Jersey.|$|R
50|$|The Mariazeller railway in Lower Austria {{operates}} on single phase AC at a 25 Hz utility frequency. The railway {{has its own}} traction current lines with an operating voltage of 27 kV. These lines are mounted on the pylons of the overhead <b>wire</b> over the <b>catenary</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|R
500|$|One final {{proposal}} {{was made in}} 1902. Experiments had been carried out on the Wey and Godalming using electric traction to pull the barges. The scheme was for a [...] canal from Ditton on the River Thames through Guildford, Godalming and Alton to join the Itchen at Winchester. 250-ton barges would be pulled along from the towpath by engines fed from overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wires.</b> However, although such a system was operational in France, nothing came of the proposal.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, New Jersey Transit {{was formed}} to run bus and train service in place of Conrail and the New Jersey Department of Transportation. In 1983, New Jersey Transit took over rail service from Conrail, and just one year later, the line became a {{temporary}} diesel rail line when the overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wires</b> had to be adjusted for conversion to higher electrical voltage. The station itself was still the third on the Montclair Branch, but the line now ran into a new station at Bay Street in Montclair. On March 17, 1984 all stations on the Montclair Branch but the Roseville Avenue station in Newark, Bay Street and Watsessing Avenue {{were added to the}} State Register of Historic Places. The same would occur on June 22, 1984 at the national level with Ampere, [...] Glen Ridge and Bloomfield Stations being added to the National Register of Historic Places. On September 16, 1984, Roseville Avenue station was closed, and just over six years later, on April 7, 1991, Ampere station in East Orange was closed. Since then, Watsessing Avenue has been the first station New Jersey Transit has served on the Montclair Branch, although East Orange has proposed reopening the station at Ampere as part of a redevelopment plan for the Ampere district.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2011, Congress obligated $450 {{million to}} a six-year project to add {{capacity}} {{on one of the}} busiest segments on the NEC in New Jersey. The project is designed to upgrade electrical power, signal systems and <b>catenary</b> <b>wires</b> on a [...] section between New Brunswick and Trenton to improve reliability, increase speeds up to , and support more frequent high-speed service.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{additional}} maintenance {{costs associated with}} the electrical equipment around the track, such as power sub-stations and the <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> itself, but, if there is sufficient traffic, the reduced track and especially the lower engine maintenance and running costs exceed the costs of this maintenance significantly.|$|R
50|$|The Morristown Line east of Dover Station is electrified, using 25 kV, 60 Hz AC {{overhead}} <b>catenary</b> <b>wire.</b> The {{line was}} electrified in 1930 at 3kV DC, but was re-electrified in 1984 at the contemporary standard of 25 kV, 60 Hz. The connecting Gladstone Branch and Montclair-Boonton Line were also re-electrified at this time.|$|R
40|$|A new Lightning Protection System (LPS) was {{designed}} and built at Launch Complex 39 B (LC 39 B), at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Florida, which consists of a <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> system (at a height of about 181 meters above ground level) supported by three insulation installed atop three towers in a triangular configuration. Nine downconductors (each about 250 meters long) {{are connected to the}} <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> system.

2500|$|Electrified service between Philadelphia and Paoli {{was opened}} on September 11, 1915. As {{the first of}} the local {{commuter}} and long-distance line to be electrified, the line was used as an [...] "experiment" [...] for powering trains using AC overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wires.</b> The previous commuter line to be electrified was the Long Island Rail Road in New York City, but this line used the DC third rail similar in nature to the New York City Subway system and most other heavy-rail interurbans. Between 1915 and the 1960s, the former Pennsylvania Railroad used the MP-54 electric multiple-unit (EMU) railcars, which were brick red ("Tuscan Red") in color (green in the Penn Central era) and had characteristic [...] "owl eye" [...] round windows at car ends.|$|E
2500|$|The later {{rolling stock}} {{consisted}} of specially designed [...] "bridge units" [...] {{for use on}} the new bridge, articulated cars sharing a common central truck and including central passenger entries in each car, a forerunner of the design of most light rail vehicles today. Several of these pairs were connected {{to make up a}} train. Power pickup was via pantograph from overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wires,</b> except on the Bay Bridge where a third rail pickup was used. The Key's trains ran on 600 volt direct current, compared to the 1200 volts used by the SP commuter trains. The cars had an enclosed operator's cab in the right front, with passenger seats extending to the very front of the vehicle, a favorite seat for many children, with dramatic views of the tracks ahead.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, $450 {{million was}} {{dedicated}} to increase capacity {{on one of the}} NEC's busiest segments, a [...] section between New Brunswick and Trenton.

50|$|MetroLink {{operates}} {{a fleet of}} 87 light-rail vehicles composed of 31 SD-400 and 56 SD-460 vehicles. Each 90 ft, single articulated vehicle has 4 high platform doors per side and has a capacity of 72 seated and 106 standing passengers. The cars are powered by an electric motor which gets its electricity from a <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> with a 750 volt supply.|$|R
50|$|Power is transmitted, effectively, at 36 kV {{because the}} 24 kV and 12 kV {{components}} are 180° out of phase. This design has several advantages over the PRR's more traditional {{transmission and distribution}} scheme. The highest voltage, with respect to ground, within the system is 24 kV. This is significantly less than the 69 kV seen in the PRR's system, which required much larger 80 ft towers and larger insulators and transformers. On a small system such as the Reading's, transmission infrastructure of this scale was unnecessary. Secondly, the system uses the 12 kV <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> for both transmission and distribution. This dual use of the <b>catenary</b> <b>wire</b> allows performing both functions with only two wires. The PRR's system in contrast required three wires: two for the single phase 138 kV transmission component {{and one for the}} 12 kV catenary feeder. In both systems, the rail is used as a return path for traction current.|$|R

50|$|The twin {{overhead}} power lines are usually copper conductors with a flat surface, which are supported by a steel <b>catenary</b> <b>wire.</b> A pole or pantograph extends from the vehicle and presses 'slippers' or 'skates' against the conductors to complete the circuit. These slipper or skate contacts are frequently coated with graphite, or have a carbon block to reduce friction and ensure a good (low resistance) electrical connection.|$|R
5000|$|A {{pantograph}} (or [...] "pan") is {{an apparatus}} {{mounted on the}} roof of an electric train, tram or electric bus to collect power through contact with an overhead <b>catenary</b> <b>wire.</b> It is a common type of current collector. Typically, a single wire is used, with the return current running through the track. The term stems from the resemblance of some styles to the mechanical pantographs used for copying handwriting and drawings.|$|R
5000|$|Netherlands - The Betuweroute, {{a freight}} rail between Rotterdam to the German border built 2007 is {{prepared}} for double-stacking insofar that tunnels are being built to accommodate double stack trains {{to reduce the cost}} and time of any future upgrade to the network.
