5000|$|<b>Captafol</b> was {{disclosed}} in US patent 3,178,447 (1965). [...] Its synergistic mixture with thiabendazol {{was described in}} US patent 4092422 (1978).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Captafol</b> is a fungicide. [...] It is used {{to control}} almost all fungal {{diseases}} of plants except powdery mildews. It {{is believed to be}} a human carcinogen, and production for use as a fungicide in the United States stopped in 1987. Its continued use from existing stocks was allowed, but in 1999 the Environmental Protection Agency banned its use on all crops except onions, potatoes, and tomatoes. In 2006 even these exceptions were disallowed, so currently its use on all crops is banned in the United States. Several other countries have followed suit since 2000, and as of 2010, no countries are known to allow the use of <b>captafol</b> on food crops. Currently, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health established a recommended exposure limit of 0.1 mg/m3 for dermal exposures.|$|E
50|$|Use of stem {{cuttings}} avoids high {{variability in}} terms of production and quality. Nevertheless, plants grown from cuttings {{are more susceptible to}} drought during the first years after planting. The caper bush is a difficult-to-root woody species, and successful propagation requires careful consideration of biotypes and seasonal and environmental parameters. Rootings up to 55% are possible when using one-year-old wood, depending on cutting harvest time and substrate used. Propagation from stem cuttings is the standard method for growing ‘Mallorquina’ and ‘Italiana’ in Spain, and ‘Nocella’ in the Aolian Islands, esp. Salina. Hardwood cuttings vary in length from 15 to 50 cm and diameter of the cuttings may range from 1.0 to 2.5 cm. Another possibility is to collect stems during February through the beginning of March, treat them with captan or <b>captafol</b> and stratify them outdoors or in a chamber at 3-4 °C, covered with sand or plastic. Moisture content and drainage should be carefully monitored and maintained until planting. Using semihardwood cuttings, collected and planted during August and September, low survival rates (under 30%) have been achieved. Softwood cuttings are prepared in April from 25- to 30-day shoots. Each cutting should contain at least two nodes and be six to 10 cm long. Basal or subterminal cuttings are more successful than terminal ones. Then, cuttings are planted in a greenhouse under a mist system with bottom heat; 150 to 200 cuttings/m2 may be planted.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the gas phase thermal decomposition of <b>captafol,</b> a sulfenimide fungicide which consists of a thiotetrachloroethyl (-SCCl 2 CHCl 2) group bonded to a tetrahydrophthalimide (C 6 H 8 (CO) 2 N-) moiety. The experiments were performed on a bench type apparatus, under conditions representing both under and well-ventilated non-flaming fires. The analyses of gaseous species relied on Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and micro gas chromatography (μGC), resulting in the identification and quantification of 11 gaseous products; among them, phosgene, thiophosgene and hydrogen cyanide. Gas chromatography - quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QMS) was employed to analyse the condensed products and volatile organic compounds (VOC), while a GC equipped with an ion trap mass spectrometer (GC-ITMS) was used to quantify polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F). The GC-QMS analysis determined several VOC toxicants; viz., trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, benzonitrile and chlorinated benzenes. At higher temperature (600 °C), the oxidation of <b>captafol</b> {{led to the formation of}} mono- to hepta- CDD/F congeners including the most toxic 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD. In addition, the experimental results were compared to those of the other two sulfenimide fungicides, captan and folpet, both of which contain the thiotrichloromethyl (-SCCl 3) moiety rather than the thiotetrachloroethyl group of <b>captafol.</b> It appears that the thiotetrachloroethyl group in <b>captafol</b> is responsible for the difference in the toxic pollutants formed, particularly influencing the distribution and yields of PCDD/F congeners. Combined with quantum chemical calculations, the results presented in this article provide an insightful understanding of fire chemistry of the sulfenimide fungicides, especially the pathways to the formation of major toxicants during the oxidative thermal decomposition of <b>captafol...</b>|$|E

C. acutatum also causes Key lime anthracnose and is morphologically identical to PFD, but the strains can be differentiated by molecular means and pathogenicity tests. C. acutatum produces abundant conidia on infected petals that are dispersed {{primarily by}} rain splash. After the bloom season, the fungus persists as appressoria on persistent calyces and other vegetative plant parts.

Benzofuran (BF), consistent with its carcinogenic activity for the kidney of female, but not of male rats, at concentrations from 0. 125 to 0. 5 mM gave positive responses in cells from females but did not induce DNA damage and increased the frequency of micronuclei in cells from males to a lower extent; in contrast, it was active in cells from humans of both genders.

40|$|This study {{involved}} assessments of therapeutant effects on pollination and fruit set; of temperature effects on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in apples, peaches and kiwifruits; of flowerage effects on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in kiwifruit styles; and of hand pollination effects on fruit set, fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit vines. From {{the point of}} view of their in vitro effects on pollen germination therapeutants can be listed in order of decreasing inhibitory effect as follows: (a) for apples - mancozeb plus dinocap, triforine, dichlofluanid, bupirimate, bayleton, citowett R captan and mancozeb; (b) for peaches - triforine, vinclozoline, streptomycin plus triforine, mancozeb, <b>captafol,</b> iprodione, dichlofluanid, streptomycin and benomyl; and (c) for kiwifruits - dichlofluanid, captan and vinclozoline. However, it appeared that while in vitro a therapeutant was very inhibitory, the application of a spray to anthers in an intact flower did not affect the germination of pollen subsequently released by those anthers. Fungicides proven to be toxic to pollen in vitro did not necessarily produce similarly toxic effects in vivo. Reasons for such varying effects of fungicides on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in vitro and in vivo are suggested. At 24 hours after pollination the number of pollen tubes growing more than 1 / 2 the style length of kiwifruit (Hayward) flowers one to two days old were 38 % and 27 % higher than in flowers less than one day old and more than three days old respectively. In apples 5 sprays of either bayleton or captan, 3 sprays of either of the therapeutants mancozeb, mancozeb plus dinocap, and triforine and a wetting agent citowett R applied during bloom period caused no effect in fruit set in Golden Delicious trees; and 3 bupirimate sprays during bloom period had no effect on the fruit set in Splendour trees. In peaches 6 sprays of either <b>captafol,</b> or benomyl or iprodione, 5 sprays of either mancozeb or vinclozoline or streptomycin or triforine during bloom period caused no effect on fruit set in Golden Queen trees. Three sprays of streptomycin or dichlofluanid caused no effect but 3 sprays of triforine, triforine plus streptomycin or of ethephon caused 50 %, 70 % and 90 % reduction in fruit set in Red Haven peach trees. In kiwifruits 3 sprays of either dichlofluanid, captan or vinclozoline reduced seed numbers per fruit by 37 % but did not affect fruit set or fruit weight. Thus in vitro and in vivo studies were useful in determining therapeutant effects on pollen but did not necessarily provide information on their effects on fruit set in apple, peach and kiwifruit and on fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit. The germination of both apple and peach pollen was higher at 24 °C than at 16 °C, 20 °C, 28 °C and at 32 °C. After 18 hours incubation pollen tubes were longer at 28 °C and at 32 °C than at 16 °C, 20 °C and 24 °C. In vivo studies with kiwifruit (Matua) pollen showed that pollen germination at 14 °C, 18 °C, 22 °C and 26 °C did not differ significantly. Temperatures both higher and lower than the temperature range 18 to 22 °C were found to be inhibitory to pollen tube growth in kiwifruit (Hayward) styles. Hand pollination of flowers did not influence percentage fruit set but increased fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit (Hayward) vines. Because fruit weight was positively correlated with seed number per fruit in fruits from both bee pollinated and bee plus hand pollinated flower clusters, supplementary pollination may play an important role in the production of fruit in kiwifruit orchards...|$|E
