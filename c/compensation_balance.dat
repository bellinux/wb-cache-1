Both were friends of Arnold, and both employed the highly skilled workman and escapement maker Thomas Earnshaw. Josiah Emery used, with Arnold's permission, an earlier form of his <b>compensation</b> <b>balance</b> and helical balance spring, {{in conjunction with}} the detached lever escapement of Thomas Mudge. John Brockbank employed Earnshaw to make his pattern of chronometer, but with Brockbank's design of <b>compensation</b> <b>balance.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} period, between 1779 and 1782, Arnold {{finalized}} {{the form of}} his chronometer watches. Through continuous experimentation, he worked {{out a way to}} make an effective but simple form of <b>compensation</b> <b>balance.</b> At the same time, he discovered a simple modification to his helical balance spring that let develop concentrically and, also, confer the property of isochronism on the oscillating balance.

These were the main subjects of the patent, which he took out in 1782.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, a year later, in 1783, Earnshaw—through another watchmaker, Thomas Wright—took out {{a patent}} that {{included}} Earnshaw's pattern of integral <b>compensation</b> <b>balance</b> and spring detent escapement in the multiple specification.

25|$|Even {{though he}} {{produced}} a number of pocket timekeepers, from around 1772-1778, Arnold was still experimenting with different types of <b>compensation</b> <b>balance</b> and methods of balance spring adjustment. The most difficult problem to surmount was the problem of making an effective and continuously adjustable temperature compensation device. For technical reasons, the temperature compensation for the balance spring had to somehow {{be incorporated into the}} balance itself and not act on the balance spring directly as had been done previously by Arnold and others.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{experimentation}} and invention by Arnold {{led to a}} breakthrough in the late 1770s.

She probably attaches small value to the first edition (1875). Although it was a Revelation from on high, it was slim, lank, incomplete, padded with bales of refuse rags, and puffs from lassoed celebrities to fill it out, an uncreditable book, a book easily sparable, a book not to be mentioned {{in the same year}} with the sleek, fat, concise, compact, compressed, and competent Annex of to-day, in its dainty flexible covers, gilt--edges, rounded corners, twin screw, spiral twist, <b>compensation</b> <b>balance,</b> Testament-counterfeit, and all that; a book just born to curl up on the hymn-book-shelf in church and look just too sweet and holy for anything.

Also we have Mrs. Eddy's 'Miscellaneous Writings,' at noble big prices, the divinity-circuit style heading the extortions, shilling discount where you take an edition. Next comes 'Christ and Christmas,' by the fertile Mrs. Eddy--a poem--I would God I could see it--price $3, cash in advance.

I wish it were in refined taste to apply a rudely and ruggedly descriptive epithet to that literary slush-bucket, so as to give one an accurate idea of what it is like. I am moved to do it, but I must not: it is better to be refined than accurate when one is talking about a production like that.|$|E

40|$|Sex {{chromosome}} dosage <b>compensation</b> <b>balances</b> homogametic {{sex chromosome}} expression with autosomal {{expression in the}} heterogametic sex, leading to sex chromosome expression parity between the sexes. If compensation is incomplete, {{this can lead to}} expression imbalance and sex-biased gene expression. Recent work has uncovered an intriguing and variable pattern of dosage compensation across species that includes a lack of complete dosage compensation in ZW species compared with XY species. Thishas led to the hypothesis that ZW species do not require complete compensation or that complete compensation would negatively affect their fitness. To date, only one study, a study of the moth Bombyx mori, has discovered evidence for complete dosage compensationin a ZW species. We examined another moth species, Manduca sexta, using high-throughput sequencing to survey gene expression in the head tissue of males and females. We found dosage compensation to be complete in M. sexta with average expression between the Z chromosomein males and females being equal. When genes expressed at very low levels are removed by filtering, we found that average autosome expression was highly similar to average Z expression, suggesting that the majority of genes in M. sexta are completely dosage compensated. Further, this compensation was accompanied by sex-specific gene expression associated with important sexually dimorphic traits. We suggest that complete dosage compensation in ZW species might be more common than previously appreciated andlinked to additional selective processes, such as sexual selection. More ZW and lepidopteran species should now be examined in a phylogenetic framework, to understand the evolution of dosage compensation. © The Author(s) 2014...|$|R
