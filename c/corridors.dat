5|$|In 2004, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay {{corridor}} was one {{of twelve}} Queens bus <b>corridors</b> studied under the city's bus rapid transit (BRT) study, which was meant to determine the feasibility of having dedicated lanes and rebuilt stops to speed up service on BRT <b>corridors.</b> Beginning on January 4, 2008, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) conducted an 18-month study on Woodhaven Boulevard {{as part of the}} city's Congested <b>Corridors</b> Project to improve congested and dangerous roadways. One of the short-term recommendations {{of the study was to}} implement bus rapid transit along the corridor. In June 2010, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay corridor was added to the list of potential <b>corridors</b> for Phase II of Select Bus Service (SBS), the MTA's brand of BRT service.|$|E

5|$|Art Director Roger Christian used {{scrap metal}} and parts to create set pieces and props to save money, a {{technique}} he employed {{while working on}} Star Wars. For example, some of the Nostromo <b>corridors</b> were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a mirror was used {{to create the illusion}} of longer <b>corridors</b> in the below-deck area. Special effects supervisors Brian Johnson and Nick Allder made many of the set pieces and props function, including moving chairs, computer monitors, motion trackers, and flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1950s, plans for a Tulsa freeway system {{included}} a route along 96th Street South. The 96th Street corridor was accessible to more motorists than other <b>corridors</b> further south (farther away from the urban core), while still having low right-of-way costs, comparable to more southerly <b>corridors.</b> This made it the ideal route for a south Tulsa freeway. In 1986, ODOT had {{plans to build a}} toll-free facility called the Creek Freeway in the corridor as part of SH-117.|$|E

5|$|Before 1952, {{the inner}} German border could be crossed {{at almost any}} point along its length. The {{fortification}} of the border resulted in the severing of 32railway lines, three autobahns, 31main roads, eight primary roads, about 60 secondary roads and thousands of lanes and cart tracks. The number of crossing points was reduced to three air <b>corridors,</b> three road <b>corridors,</b> two railway lines and two river connections giving transit access to Berlin, plus a handful of additional crossing points for freight traffic.|$|E

50|$|The Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport was {{constructed}} near Fort Snelling in 1921. When {{it became a}} major transit hub the <b>corridor</b> was extended to the airport. In the 1989 a county transit plan for Ramsey County was made. The <b>corridor</b> between the airport and Downtown Saint Paul was considered an important <b>corridor.</b> When the Mall of America {{was constructed}} the <b>corridor</b> was extended to the mall. The route was first named the Riverview <b>Corridor</b> in February 1997 after the Ramsey County board unanimously voted the <b>corridor</b> as a higher priority than the Central <b>Corridor.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to these recommendations, the NTSB also recommended that the Department of Defense restrict high-speed, low-altitude aircraft operation in civilian air <b>corridors,</b> consider collision avoidance technologies on military aircraft, and make military pilots aware of the FAA's radar advisory service.|$|E
5|$|The Valley Ho competed {{favorably with}} the Safari Hotel, erected {{about the same}} time east of Scottsdale Fashion Square. Both hotels offered premium hospitality, and helped Scottsdale expand its public image. With the Valley Ho an {{immediate}} financial success, in 1958 Varney designed and built two more wings of guest rooms to the northwest of the original complex. The same materials and style were employed on the expansion buildings, but instead of single exterior <b>corridors</b> with rooms to one side, the added wings loaded central <b>corridors</b> with rooms on both sides. Another Scottsdale landmark hotel, the Mountain Shadows Resort, opened the following year, in 1959. These three tourist havens reflected a desired cosmopolitan and exotic feel on Scottsdale.|$|E

5|$|Transportation in Minnesota is {{overseen by}} the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT for short and used in the local news media). Principal {{transportation}} <b>corridors</b> radiate from the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area and Duluth. The major Interstate highways are Interstate35 (I-35), I-90, and I-94, with I-35 and I-94 passing through the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area, and I-90 traveling east-west along {{the southern edge of}} the state. In 2006, a constitutional amendment was passed that required sales and use taxes on motor vehicles to fund transportation, with at least 40 percent dedicated to public transit. There are nearly two dozen rail <b>corridors</b> in Minnesota, most of which go through Minneapolis–St. Paul or Duluth. There is water transportation along the Mississippi River system and from the ports of Lake Superior.|$|E

5|$|When a {{decision}} was made to build a second hotel next to the Waldorf, truce provisions were developed between the Astors which reserved some proprietary rights. The plan design used <b>corridors</b> to join the two buildings and there was even a bond provision for bricking up the <b>corridors</b> should the need arise. On November 1, 1897, Waldorf's cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, opened the 16 story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site. The Astoria, named after Astoria, Oregon which was founded by John Jacob Astor in 1811, stood on the site of William B. Astor’s house, and was leased to Boldt.|$|E

5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar.

No portion of the route has been improved in Maryland.|$|R
