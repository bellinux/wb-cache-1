The objective {{of the study is}} to design and fabricate vertical farming aquaponic system for home application. The main part {{of this study is to}} rear Red tilapia, grow vegetable and strawberry plants. It is also a way to show a method to plant the vegetable and rear aquatic animal at a safe place without endangering the people but at the same time give benefit to the mother earth. This research involved designing and fabrication of aquaponic. The vegetable was planted inside the basket of the pipe holes while the fish was kept in the fish tank. The type of bed grow is used was a <b>curved</b> <b>tank</b> located above the fish tank. The water from the fish tanks will be pumped to the grow bed. The water filtered by plant then will flow back to the fish tank. The design of the piping system consist of six pipes and each with a diameter of 100 mm and have seven holes drilled at equidistance. The water flow rate is 1. 2408 x 10 - 3 m 3 /s from supply pump. There were also two curved tanks placed inside the aquaphonic house which used the floating polystyrenes planting system. The curved tanks are made of fiber glass that was fabricated and strengthened. A stress and strain analysis was done to the aquaphonic curve tank before and after reinforcement. As a result, the maximum displacement of the curve tank decreased after reinforcement process was done. The system was completed and installed...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of the annual energy yield from wave energy converters {{are essential to the}} development of the wave industry. The current method based on power matrices uses only a small part of the data available from sea state estimations and it is consequently prone to inaccuracies. The research presented in this work investigates the issue of energy yield prediction and questions the power matrix method. This is accomplished by quantifying the influence of several directional sea states parameters on the performances of wave energy converters. The approach taken was to test several wave energy converters in the Edinburgh <b>Curved</b> <b>tank</b> with a large set of sea states. The selected wave energy converters are a fix OWC, a set of two OWCs acting as a weak directional device and the desalination duck model. Uni-modal and bi-modal sea states were used. For the uni-modal sea states, parameters related to the wave system shape were considered. For the bi-modal sea states, the relative position of the wave system peaks was investigated and the uni-modality index was introduced to quantify the degree to which sea states could be considered bi-modal. For all sea states, the significant wave height was kept constant. The experimental work required good spectral estimates. The MLM and MMLM were adapted to deterministic waves to improve their stability and accuracy. A routine to isolate wave systems was also developed in order to estimate parameters with respect to each wave systems. For uni-modal spectra, parametric models of the observed performances of the devices could be devised. The frequency spreading and its interaction with the energy period proved to be as important as the energy period itself, which suggests that the frequency spreading should be used for energy production prediction. For bi-modal spectra, evidence of the duck sensitivity to directionality was found while the OWCs were not affected...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{properties of}} a horizontal cylinder which {{is free to}} pitch about an off-centred axis are studied and used to derive the equations of motion of a wave energy converter which extracts energy from incoming sea waves with a linear power-take-off mechanism. The present work follows from a recent study which compared the performance of an off-centred cylinder {{with those of the}} Edinburgh Duck wave energy converter. The small decrease in performance found is offset by a reduction in the likely costs associated with the manufacturing of the cylindrical cam compared with those of the asymmetric profile. As part of the survivability strategy in very energetic seas-states it had been planned to completely submerge the device so as to reduce the mooring forces. However, experiments with scale models show that a good absorption capacity is retained even when fully-submerged. The hydrodynamic properties of a horizontal cylinder that pierces the free-surface and of one that is fully submerged are therefore of central concern in this study. These properties are well known for the case of very long cylinders but they are now found for cylinders with different widths, drafts, submergence levels and water-depths. The hydrodynamic forces and moments at the off-centred axis are, furthermore, derived through the application of transformation formulae. The equation of motion of the off-centred cylinder is derived for one degree of freedom and its performance as a wave energy converter is analysed. A relationship which relates the resonance of the device with the location of the off-centred axis and its mass distribution is derived and used to optimize the design for average sea conditions attained at a real location. Design cases associated with three diameters of the cylinder are looked into detail for both a fully-submerged and free-surface piercing cylinder. The one degree of freedom model is extended to include a multi-body which has three degrees of freedom in order to describe the dynamics of a proposed wave powered desalination system based on a cylindrical Duck device. This mathematical model is derived through linearised Lagrangian equations of motion in which the hydrodynamic forces are included as generalised external forces. The advantage of such approach is {{to reduce the number of}} equations associated with multi-body systems by removing the reaction forces of holomonic constraints from the system of equations to solve. This model is validated through experiments with a scale model performed in the <b>curved</b> <b>tank</b> of the University of Edinburgh with both regular waves and mixed seas.

This paper describes such experiments involving first year maturing cod (Gadus morhua), in which egg production has been studied in relation to maternal reserves. Ovary biopsy samples were taken from the start until the end of spawning when the fish were killed in order to study the persistence of postovulatory and atretic follicles (the latter are oocytes that are resorbed during the vitellogenic phase) using histological methods. These results were examined to suggest ways to improve the detection of post spawning females (which is essential when making field assessments of maturity).

The differences over 76 years were undeniably a gradual evolution, with increases in boiler pressure and heating surface the more important, enclosed cabs and larger bunkers cosmetic but functional.

At some sites, however, there is an appreciable change in flow direction (‘swing’) away from 180 degrees between the two maxima of flow speed. In order to assess the performance of horizontal axis marine current turbines in non rectilinear currents, measurements of a model rotor have been made in a towing <b>tank.</b> <b>Curve</b> fits have been calculated {{as a function of the}} cosine of the yaw angle squared and the thrust as cosine of the yaw angle.

All three sites are of the type where flow is accelerated around a headland or cape, but their tidal streams vary in deviation from rectilinearity. For two of the sites - Portland Bill (Dorset, UK) and Race of Alderney (Alderney, Channel Islands/Normandy, France) - available data consisted of tidal stream diamonds printed on Admiralty navigational charts.

40|$|Sampling the {{collected}} suspension in a storage tank {{is a common}} procedure to obtain soil loss data. A calibration <b>curve</b> of the <b>tank</b> has {{to be used to}} obtain actual concentration values from those measured by sampling. However, literature suggests that using a <b>tank</b> calibration <b>curve</b> was not a common procedure in the past. For the clay soil of the Sparacia (Italy) experimental station, this investigation aimed to establish a link between the relative performances of the USLE-M and USLE-MM models, usable to predict plot soil loss at the event temporal scale, and soil loss measurement errors. Using all available soil loss data, lower soil loss prediction errors were obtained with the USLE-MM (exponent of the erosivity term, b 1 > 1) than the USLE-M (b 1 = 1). A systematic error of the soil loss data is unexpected for the Sparacia soil because the calibration curve does not depend on the water level in the tank. In any case, this type of error does not have any effect on the b 1 exponent. Instead, this exponent decreases as the level of underestimation increases for increasing soil loss values. This type of error can occur at Sparacia if it is assumed that a soil loss measurement can be obtained by a bottle sampler dipped close {{to the bottom of the}} tank after mixing the suspension and assuming that the measured concentration coincides with the actual one. In this case, the risk is to obtain a lower b 1 value than the actual one. In conclusion, additional investigations on the factors determining errors in soil loss data collected by a sampling procedure are advisable because these errors can have a noticeable effect on the calibrated empirical models for soil loss prediction...|$|R

40|$|Floating wind {{turbines}} (FWTs) {{are considered a}} new lease of opportunity for sustaining growth from offshore wind energy. In recent years, several new concepts have emerged, {{with only a few}} making it to demonstration or pre-commercialisation stages. Amongst these, the spar-buoy based FWT has been extensively researched concept with efforts to optimise the dynamic response and reduce the costs at acceptable levels of performance. Yet, there exist notable lapses in understanding of these systems due to lack of established design standards, operational experience, inaccurate modelling and inconsistent reporting that hamper the design process. Previous studies on spar-buoy FWTs have shown inconsistencies in reporting hydrodynamic response and adopted simplified mooring line models that have failed to capture the coupled hydrodynamic behaviour accurately. At the same time, published information on drive-trains for FWTs is scarce and limited to geared systems that suffer from reliability issues. This research was aimed at filling the knowledge gaps with regard to hydrodynamic modelling and drive-train research for the spar-buoy FWT. The research proceeds in three parts, beginning with numerical modelling and experimental testing of a stepped spar-buoy FWT. A 1 : 100 scale model was constructed and tested in the University of Edinburgh’s <b>curved</b> wave <b>tank</b> for various regular and irregular sea states. The motion responses were recorded at its centre of mass and nacelle locations. The same motions were also simulated numerically using finite element method based software, OrcaFlex for identical wave conditions. The hydrodynamic responses were evaluated as Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) and compared with numerical simulations. The results showed very good agreement and the numerical model was found to better capture the non-linearities from mooring lines. A new design parameter, Nacelle Magnification Factor, was introduced to quantify coupled behaviour of the system. This could potentially encourage a new design approach to optimising floating wind turbine systems for a given hub height. The second part of the research was initiated by identification of special design considerations for drive-trains to be successfully integrated into FWTs. A comparative assessment of current state of the art showed good potential for directdrive permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG). A radial flux topology of the direct-drive PMSG was further examined to verify its suitability to FWT. The generator design was qualified based on its structural integrity and ability to ensure minimal overall impact. The results showed that limiting the generator weight without compromising air-gap tolerances or tower-foundation upgrades was the biggest challenge. Further research was required to verify the dynamic response and component loading to be at an acceptable level. The concluding part of research investigated the dynamic behaviour of the directdrive generator and the various processes that controlled its performance in a FWT. For this purpose, a fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic model of direct-drive FWT was developed. This exercise yet again highlighted the weight challenge imposed by the direct-drive system entailing extra investment on structure. The drive-train dynamics were analysed using a linear combination of multi-body simulation tools namely HAWC 2 and SIMPACK. Shaft misalignment, its effect on unbalanced magnetic pull and the main bearing loads were examined. The responses were found to be within acceptable limits and the FWT system does not appreciably alter the dynamics of a direct-drive generator. Any extra investment on the structure is expected to be outweighed by the superior performance and reliability with the direct-drive generator. In summary, this research proposes new solutions to increase the general understanding of hydrodynamics of FWTs and encourages the implementation of direct-drive generators for FWTs. It is believed that the solutions proposed through this research can potentially help address the design challenges of FWTs...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} titled The {{influence}} of a nonlinear Power Take Off on a Wave Energy Converter. It looks at the effect that having a nonlinear Power Take Off (PTO) has on an inertial referenced, slack moored, point absorber, Wave Energy Converter (WEC). The generic device studied utilizes relative heave motion between an axi-symmetric cylinder and an internal mass, for the PTO to operate between. The PTO {{is the part of}} the WEC that transforms the relative motion into electricity. In this work, three different types of nonlinear PTO and a linear PTO are presented, tested, analysed and compared. The three nonlinear PTO types are: • A PTO that extracts energy in only one direction, either in relative compression or expansion. • A linear PTO and an additional endstop or peripheral PTO, that can only extract energy when the relative position of the internal mass has reached a pre-determined position. • A PTO that has damping forces that are quadratically proportional to the relative velocity. A numerical simulation has been built based upon a Runge-Kutta time series progression. The model uses the summation of the excitation force from the waves, the radiation force from the movement of the cylinder, the buoyancy force and the PTO forces. These combine to cause acceleration of the mass of the external cylinder, with an equal and opposite PTO force acting on the internal mass. The excitation force and added mass values are obtained from the boundary element method software, WAMIT. Prony’s method is used to obtain an approximate radiation force, based upon the radiation time force history. This numerical model operates on both a 1 : 40 scale and a full sized model. The numerical model finds the optimal PTO parameters, for different PTO setups, in irregular sea states. This optimum is based on the power extracted as well as indications of the reliability and lifetime of the system. The numerical simulation presents results showing how the nonlinearity of the PTO influences the motions of the WEC, resulting in dissimilarities between the Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) results, obtained from regular seas, and the Linear Transfer Function (LTF), found from irregular sea testing. The experimental model has been tested in the <b>Curved</b> Wave <b>Tank</b> facility at the University of Edinburgh, with a 1 : 40 scaled model. It used a central rod both as a support structure and to limit the movement of the cylinder and internal mass to heave. Between the cylinder and internal mass a spring and pneumatic damper operate in parallel, in various setups. It was tested in regular and irregular sea states and the position of the internal mass and cylinder was monitored. The experimental model was tested to ascertain the time series motions, RAO, LTF, the relative phase between the bodies and the power extracted for different wave climates. The numerical and experimental work were compared to allow confidence in both models. They showed relatively good agreement for the RAOs, LTFs and predictions of the relative phase but there was discrepancies in the predicted power for both regular and irregular seas. This difference is due to the difficulties in obtaining the relative velocities in the experimental model, resulting in a significant error in power prediction, since the power is proportional to the square of the relative velocities. The conclusions show that having a mono-directional PTO as opposed to a bi-directional PTO results in an approximately equal or greater power extraction in a variety of different sea states. An additional endstop or peripheral damper can increase the total power that a WEC extracts, in some situations, and may be advantageous depending upon the other potential benefits it brings to the WEC.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy's Office of River Protection has an {{extensive}} integrity assessment {{program for the}} Hanford Site Double-Shell Tank System. The DOE Orders and environmental protection regulations provide the guidelines for the activities used to inspect and maintain 28 double-shell tanks (DSTs), the waste evaporator, and ancillary equipment that compose this system. This program has been reviewed by oversight and regulatory bodies and found {{to comply with the}} established guidelines. The basis for the DOE Order 435. 1 - 1 for tank integrity comes from the Tank Structural Integrity Paneled by Brookhaven National Laboratory during the late 1990 s. These guidelines established criteria for performing Non-Destructive Examination (NDE), for acceptance of the NDE results, for waste chemistry control, and for monitoring the tanks. The environmental regulations mirror these requirements and allow for the tank integrity program to provide compliant storage of the tanks. Both sets of requirements provide additional guidance for the protection of ancillary equipment. CH 2 M HILL uses two methods of NDE: visual inspection and Ultrasonic Testing (UT). The visual inspection program examines the primary tank and secondary liner of the DST. The primary tank is examined both on the interior surface above the waste in the tank and on the exterior surface facing the annulus of the DST. The interior surface of the tank liner is examined {{at the same time as}} the outer surface of the primary tank. The UT program examines representative areas of the primary tank and secondary liner by deploying equipment in the annulus of the tank. Both programs have led to the development of new equipment for remote inspection of the tanks. Compact camera and enhanced lighting systems have been designed and deployed through narrow access ports (called risers) into the tanks. The UT program has designed two generations of crawlers and equipment for deployment through risers into the thermally hot and radioactive environment. Also extensions were developed to allow inspection of the <b>tank's</b> <b>curve</b> upper (haunch) and lower (knuckle) surfaces. CH 2 M HILL primarily maintains chemistry control of the DST by ensuring that the concentrations of hydroxide and nitrite ions are favorable with respect to the nitrate ion concentration in the waste. This control program is supported by {{an extensive}} sampling program that obtains samples from the supernatant and solid layers in the tank to ensure compliance with the chemical specification. At DOE direction, CH 2 M HILL has embarked on a waste chemistry optimization program to enhance the protection of the tank surface and the understanding of the parameters that affect general and localized corrosion in the tanks. Over the past decade, DOE has deployed Electrochemical Noise corrosion probes in the DST to monitor localized corrosion. From the information gathered as part of the chemistry control, new information has been identified about the parameters requiring control to ensure tank integrity. CH 2 M HILL is deploying a series of corrosion probes to test and employ these parameters to provide real time corrosion monitoring of the DSTs...|$|R

AquacultureBibliography: leaves 108 - 114 The main {{bottleneck}} to {{the mass}} production of juvenile seed stock for the intensive aquacuiture of many marine finfish species is the high mortality associated with the larval stage. In an attempt to reduce the costs and increase larval survival for two species with aquaculture potential, experiments were performed to investigate ways at reducing the quantity of live food required. [...] The first experiment described in this thesis was performed in Brazil with fat snook (Centrompomus parullclus) a species of commercial interest for which {{little is known about}} the natural history or culture techniques. Previous larviculture with this species has been done at prey densities of 30 000 prey litre. I tested a range from 30 000. to 5000 prey litre, and found no difference in survival and growth at an> of these prey densities. Reducing prey densities to only 5000 prey litre will result in considerable savings in labour and cost for future culture of this species. The behaviour of the larvae is also described here for the first time. Fat snook larvae were observed to be salutatory foragers, and to employ a sigmoid (s-curve) and lunge prior to capture, until the larvae reach lengths of 3. 0 mm. [...] The experiments with larval Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were more in depth since both the optimal prey density and foraging behaviour patterns were already known. The first experiment investigated the possibility of using a 'mismatch’ (low prey density) at one of three stages (endogenous, transition from endogenous to exogenous, and exogenous) in the larval period. It was found that larval survival was maximized when a low prey density (500 prey litre) was offered during the first 5 days post-hatch, and that growth and survival were maximized thereafter by offering a high prey density (4000 prey litre). The behavioural observations in this experiment did not concur with previous reports, which found that orient frequency increases with prey density. Comparisons of the methodologies between this and previous studies found that How rates differed. Flow rates were found to modify the duration of prey availability. A second cod experiment investigated the effect of decreased duration of prey availability (controlled by flow rate) and found that survival and growth decreased with decreasing duration of prey availability. The probable explanation for this decrease was that the larvae had less time to forage. Orient frequency of larvae that had less time to forage (high flow treatments) was 3 times higher immediately after feeding. Hourly behavioural observations demonstrated a sudden spike in orient frequency after feeding for larvae reared at high flow, which explains how larval cod are able to take advantage of prey patches that occur in their spatially and temporally variable environment. [...] Results of the cod experiments can be used to suggest a new larviculture protocol, which schedules low prey density during the endogenous feeding stage and then increases to high prey density thereafter. The results also demonstrate that a relationship between flow rate and duration of prey availability exists and that larval cod are sensitive to the duration of time that is available for foraging. Future larval husbandry practices should include the recording of a prey clearance <b>curve</b> for each <b>tank</b> at set flows, so that the prey dynamics of each tank can be understood. Consideration should be given to both water quality and prey clearance rates in the assignment of flow rates...|$|R

The behavioural observations in this experiment did not concur with previous reports, which found that orient frequency increases with prey density. Comparisons of the methodologies between this and previous studies found that How rates differed. Flow rates were found to modify the duration of prey availability. A second cod experiment investigated the effect of decreased duration of prey availability (controlled by flow rate) and found that survival and growth decreased with decreasing duration of prey availability. The probable explanation for this decrease was that the larvae had less time to forage. Orient frequency of larvae that had less time to forage (high flow treatments) was 3 times higher immediately after feeding. Hourly behavioural observations demonstrated a sudden spike in orient frequency after feeding for larvae reared at high flow, which explains how larval cod are able to take advantage of prey patches that occur in their spatially and temporally variable environment. [...] Results of the cod experiments can be used to suggest a new larviculture protocol, which schedules low prey density during the endogenous feeding stage and then increases to high prey density thereafter. The results also demonstrate that a relationship between flow rate and duration of prey availability exists and that larval cod are sensitive to the duration of time that is available for foraging. Future larval husbandry practices should include the recording of a prey clearance <b>curve</b> for each <b>tank</b> at set flows, so that the prey dynamics of each tank can be understood. Consideration should be given to both water quality and prey clearance rates in the assignment of flow rates...|$|R
