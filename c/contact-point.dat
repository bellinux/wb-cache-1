It was observed that higher average power was generated from T-shaped cantilever generator than from A-shaped cantilever generator even though the latter has wider upper electrode area than the former. Also, maximum power was produced when operation is close to <b>contact-point</b> mode.

EB 1 is an upstream element factor which has partial homology to the AP 1 /ATF family, whereas R is an enhancer factor. In the R-responsive enhancer of the replication origin only active during the EBV lytic cycle (ORIIyt), R-responsive elements are located in a region of about 70 bp (RRE-DR). Here we show that R, produced either by in vitro translation, or present in nuclear extracts from HeLa cells constitutively producing R, binds directly to and protects against DNAase I digestion, two regions in RRE-DR. Using mobility shift assay and DMS interference, we have characterized the <b>contact-points</b> between R and the DNA. Two binding sites, RRE-DR 1 and RRE-DR 2, were characterized and are contiguous in RRE-DR.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} called soil aggregate coalescence {{occurs at}} <b>contact-points</b> between aggregates and causes soil strength to increase to values that can inhibit plant root exploration and thus potential yield. During natural wetting and drying, soil aggregates appear to ‘weld’ together {{with little or}} no increase in dry bulk density. The precise reasons for this phenomenon are not understood, but it has been found to occur even in soils comprised entirely of water stable aggregates. Soil aggregate coalescence has not been widely observed and reported in soil science and yet may pose a significant risk for crops preventing them from achieving their genetic and environmental yield potentials. This project used soil penetrometer resistance and an indirect tensile-strength test to measure the early stages of aggregate coalescence and to evaluate their effects on the early growth of tomato plants. The early stages of aggregate coalescence were thought to be affected by a number of factors including: the matric suction of water during application and subsequent drainage, the overburden pressure on moist soil in the root zone, the initial size of soil aggregates prior to wetting, and the degree of sodicity of the soil aggregates. Seven mainexperiments were conducted to evaluate these factors. The matric suction during wetting of a seedbed affects the degree of aggregate slaking that occurs, and the strength of the wetted aggregates. The matric suction during draining affects the magnitude of ‘effective stresses’ that operate to retain soil structural integrity as the soil drains and dries out. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of matric suction (within a range of suctions experienced in the field) on aggregate coalescence using soils of two different textures. Sieved aggregates (0. 5 to 2 mm diameter) from a coarse-textured and two fine-textured (swelling) soils were packed into cylindrical rings (4. 77 cm i. d., 5 cm high) and subjected to different suctions on wetting (near-saturation, and 1 kPa), and on draining (10 kPa on sintered-glass funnels, and 100 kPa on ceramic pressure plates). After one-week of drainage, penetrometer resistance was measured as a function of depth to approximately 45 mm (penetrometer had a recessedshaft, cone diameter = 2 mm, advanced at a rate of 0. 3 mm/min). Tensile strength of other core-samples was measured after air-drying using an indirect “Brazilian” crushing test. For the coarse-textured soil, penetrometer resistance was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation, despite there being no significant increase in dry bulk density; {{this was not the case}} for the finer-textured soils, and it was difficult to distinguish the effects of variable bulk density upon drying from those of the imposed wetting treatments. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, the tensile strength was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation. Thus wetting- and draining-suctions were both found to influence the degree of soil aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. Aggregate coalescence in irrigated crops is known to develop as the growing season progresses. It was therefore thought to be linked to the repeated occurrence of matric suctions that enhance the phenomenon during cycles of wetting and draining. An experiment was conducted to determine the extent of aggregate coalescence in a coarsetextured and two fine-textured (swelling clay) soils during 8 successive cycles of wetting and draining. Sieved aggregates (0. 5 to 2 mm diameter) from each soil were packed into cylindrical rings (4. 77 cm i. d., 5 cm high) and wetted to near saturation for 24 h. They were then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week, after which penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured as described above. The degree of expression of aggregate coalescence depended on soil type. For the coarse-textured soil, repeated wetting and draining significantly increased bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. For the fine-textured soil, penetrometer resistance and bulk density did not vary significantly with repeated wetting and draining; on the contrary, there was evidence in these swelling clay soils to suggest bulk density and penetrometer resistance decreased. However, there was a progressive increase in tensile strength as cycles of wetting and draining progressed. The expansive nature of the fine-textured soil appears to have masked the development of aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance, but its expression was very clear in measurements of tensile strength despite the reduction in bulk density with successive wetting and draining. Field observations have indicated that aggregate coalescence is first expressed at the bottom of the seedbed and that it develops progressively upward to the soil surface during the growing season. This suggests that overburden pressures may enhance the onset of the phenomenon by increasing the degree of inter-aggregate contact. Soils containing large quantities of particulate organic matter were known to resist the onset of aggregate coalescence to some extent. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of soil organic matter and overburden pressures, by placing brass cylinders of various weights (equivalent to static load pressures of 0, 0. 49, 1. 47 and 2. 47 kPa) on the top of dry soil aggregates (0. 5 – 2 mm diameter) having widely different soil organic carbon contents placed in steel rings 5 cm high and 5 cm i. d. With the weights in place, the aggregates were wetted to near-saturation for 24 h and then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured when the samples were removed from the pressure plates and they all increased significantly with increasing overburden pressure in the soil with low organic matter content, but not in the soil with high organic matter content. The amount of tillage used to prepare seedbeds influences the size distribution of soil aggregates produced – that is, more tillage produces finer seedbeds. The size distribution of soil aggregates affects the number of inter-aggregate contact points and this was thought to influence the degree of aggregate coalescence that develops in a seedbed. Previous work has shown that soil organic matter reduces aggregate coalescence and so an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of aggregate size and organic matter on the phenomenon. For soils with high and low organic matter contents, aggregate size fractions of < 0. 5, 0. 5 – 2, 2 – 4, and < 4 mm were packed into soil cores (as above) and wetted to near-saturation then drained to 100 kPa suction as described above. Penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured and found to increase directly with the amount of fine material present in the soil cores – being greater in the < 0. 5 mm and < 4 mm fractions, and being less in the 0. 5 – 2 mm and 2 – 4 mm fractions. In all cases, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were lower in the samples containing more organic matter. The rate at which soil aggregates are wetted in a seedbed affects the degree of slaking and densification that occurs, and the extent to which aggregates are wetted influences the overall strength of a seedbed. Both wetting rate and the extent of wetting were believed to influence the onset of aggregate coalescence and were thought to be affected by soil organic matter and irrigation technique. An experiment was therefore designed to separate these effects so that improvements to management could be evaluated for their greatest efficacy – that is, to determine whether management should focus on improving irrigation technique or increasing soil organic matter content, or both. The rate of wetting was controlled by spraying (or not spraying) soil aggregates (0. 5 – 2 mm diameter) with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Samples of coarse- and fine-textured soils were packed into steel rings (as above) and subjected to different application rates of water (1, 10 and 100 mm/h) using a dripper system controlled by a peristaltic pump. Samples were brought to either a near-saturated state or to a suction of 10 kPa for 24 h, and then drained on a pressure plate at a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Measurements of penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were then made as described above. As expected, penetrometer resistance was lower in samples treated with PVA before wetting (slower wetting rates) and in samples held at a greater suction (10 kPa) after initial wetting (greater inter-aggregate strength). The effects were more pronounced in the coarse-textured soil. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, tensile strengths increased with increasing wetting rate (greatest for 100 mm/h) and extent of wetting (greater when held at near-saturated conditions). The rate of wetting was found to be somewhat more important for promoting aggregate coalescence than the extent of wetting. Because aggregate coalescence often occurs {{with little or no}} increase in bulk density, an explanation for the increase in penetrometer resistance and tensile strength is unlikely to be explained by a large increase in the number of inter-aggregate contacts. An increase in the strength of existing points of inter-aggregate contact was therefore considered in this work. For inter-aggregate bond strengths to increase, it was hypothesized that small increases in the amount of mechanically (or spontaneously) dispersed clay particles, and subsequent deposition at inter-aggregate contact points could increase aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. An experiment was devised to manipulate the amount of spontaneously dispersed clay in coarse- and fine-textured soils of high and low organic matter content. The degree of|$|R

40|$|When fluid {{droplets}} coalesce, {{the flow}} is initially {{controlled by a}} balance between surface tension and viscosity. For low viscosity fluids such as water, the viscous lengthscale is quickly reached, yielding a new balance between surface tension and inertia. Numerical and asymptotic calculations have shown {{that there is no}} simply connected solution for the coalescence of inviscid fluid drops surrounded by a void, as large amplitude capillary waves cause the free surface to pinch off. We analyse in detail a linearised version of this free boundary problem. For zero density surrounding fluid, we find asymptotic solutions to the leading order linear problem for small and large contact point displacement. In both cases, this requires the solution of a mixed type boundary value problem via complex variable methods. For the large displacement solution, we match this to a WKB analysis for capillary waves away from the contact point. The composite solution shows that the interface position becomes self intersecting for sufficiently large contact point displacement. We identify a distinguished density ratio for which flows in the coalescing drops and surrounding fluid are equally important in determining the interface shape. We find a large displacement solution to the leading order two-fluid problem with a multiple-scales analysis, using a spectral method to solve the leading order periodic oscillator problem for capillary waves. This is matched to a single-parameter inner problem, which we solve numerically to obtain the correct boundary conditions for the secularity equations.

40|$|Background and aims: The aim of part VII was to both {{identify}} international electronically-implemented initiatives, and analyse {{the feasibility}} of an electronic parent-child initiative (EKVI) as an application of the Austrian electronic health record (ELGA). Methods: Identification of international electronic EKVIs by literature search {{and analysis of the}} Austrian mother-child pass (ÖMKP) as a paper-based EKVI and information/communication system, based on the needs and requirements of the end users and administrators involved, as well as on current application scenarios within the frame conditions of the ÖELGA. Results: We identified 30 international projects. Nearly all (paper-based or electronic) EKVIs follow four objectives: health care provision, administration of health care provision, quality through equal access and structured health care provision, processing of benefit payments. Beyond that, electronic EKVIs facilitate the conduct of evaluations, health services research and planning, and provide decision-making support for appropriate levels of care. In practice, the path from local (surgery or hospital) systems to integrated, <b>contact-point</b> spanning health records or ELGA for maternity and infancy still appears not to be fully developed everywhere. Several core aspects could be identified from the first reports as best practice recommendations for a successful planning and implementation of eEKVIs: The definition of expected benefit goals and monitoring the achievement of their targets, the formation of a team responsible for planning and conception -with an early involvement of representatives of both end users and administrators- as well as the consideration of existing work processes and practice patterns. The analysis of actual application scenarios within the current Mother-Child-Pass showed that -under the precondition of a functioning framework structure of ÖELGA, a secured legal basis and a consensus (resp. a legal obligation) between all parties involved to participate- the implementation within ÖELGA is technically feasible. Conclusion: Any substantive reorientation of an ÖMKP should initially be discussed irrespective of the type of personal health record (electronic or paper-based). Once a broad consensus on new objectives (e. g. the provision of universal vs. risk-group specific health care services) is reached, the development of a suitable form of implementation would be negotiated in the next stage. The implementation of an Austrian eMKP should be planned in realistic time frames, field-tested in the form of regional pilot projects involving the users, and developed with sufficient room for subsequent optimisations...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the contact situations, within national-league rugby union, that present the defending player with a desirable or detrimental tackle situation. Specifically, the positions of the tackler and the ball carrier were investigated; prop, hooker, second row, flanker, number 8, scrumhalf, fly half, centre, and fullback. A total of 2, 759 one-on-one tackles, from 20 rugby union matches, in the SSE National 3 London and South East Division, were analysed. When considering the players involved within the tackle situation, the flankers attempted the most tackles (n = 522, 18. 9 % of total tackles), and the fullbacks attempted the least (n = 105, 3. 8 % of total tackles). The centres were the most frequently used ball carriers (n = 377, 13. 7 % of total tackle situations), and the fly halves were the least frequently used (n = 193, 7. 0 % of total tackle situations). The most common outcome from a tackle situation was defined neutral, where neither attack nor defence gained ground from the point of contact (n = 1, 101, 39. 9 % of total tackles). The least common outcome was defined dominant, where the tackler won the contest and gained ground past the <b>contact-point</b> in the process of completing the tackle (n = 295, 10. 7 % of total tackles). When considered as a completion rate, tackles that were dominant, neutral, or negative, were shown 75. 1 % of the time (n = 2, 072). The position seemingly identified as the best tacklers, by producing the highest percentage of dominant tackles from the amount of tackles that they attempted, was the props (n = 50, 15. 2 % of their tackles). The scrumhalves produced the highest percentage of missed tackles (n = 62, 36. 3 % of their tackles), and were deemed the weakest tacklers. Wings seemed the most effective ball carriers, by producing the highest percentage of missed tackles from the amount of tackles they faced (n = 121, 39. 0 % of their tackle situations). The scrumhalves seemed the least effective, by allowing the highest percentage of dominant tackles from the amount of tackles they were involved in (n = 52, 26. 8 % of their tackle situations). Using the results of this study, tactical mismatches can be highlighted for teams to exploit within their game plans. Further analysis into positional differences within the tackle is still required, as well as other factors that could affect a tackle’s outcome, and suggestions have been made for future studies...|$|E

Given this context, the networks of interest within this thesis are the offline interpersonal relationships between community members. Diffusion channels for new innovation are therefore limited to word-of-mouth communication, observation, and personal experience. Chapter 2 of this thesis analyses two policy tools in targeting these information gaps. The first is through social learning {{as part of a}} farmer extension program. The second combines social learning with experiential learning, reducing the cost to personal experimentation with subsidized improved input packages. Our results indicate that farmers who are exposed to both social learning and learning-by-doing more significantly impacts farmer productivity relative to those receiving no intervention and those exposed only to social learning. I interpret this result as an indication of learning-by-doing combined with social learning being a more effective strategy for facilitating adoption of technologies that have more heterogeneous returns to adoption. Chapter 3 of this thesis tests the difference in diffusion patterns that result by varying the network contact- point. Specifically, network contact-points are selected as being either the most central or least central individuals within the network. I find evidence that centrality affects the speed of distribution but does not affect the width of diffusion nor which individuals are participating within the diffusion process. Furthermore, large attenuation is observed throughout the diffusion process, which suggests the importance of selecting a sufficiently large set of lead community members for the spread of new technology. Chapter 4 combines a community-wide polling of network entry-points combined with detailed community network and socio-economic data. First we explore what attributes are prioritized by community members in nominating a resident farmer as an extension <b>contact-point.</b> Second, we use simulations to compare the diffusion spread of top-nominated individuals as network entry-points compared to entry-points that achieve maximal spread within diffusion simulations. We find that community members prioritize network connectedness, pro-social preferences, and socioeconomic indicators of gender, age, formal leadership, and education levels within their nomination decisions. Furthermore, receiving the top three most amount of nominations is found to be significantly correlated with selection as an optimal entry-point within the diffusion simulation. These results suggest that community-wide polling offers a less data-intensive opportunity to realize gains in diffusion warranted through network-based seeding. Chapter 5 explore whether an individual’s observed social preferences is correlated with an individual’s centrality within the network structure. Our results indicate that individuals with high centrality are more trusting and more trustworthy than individuals with lower centrality. Moreover, individuals with low centrality are treated worse in these interactions—people trust them less initially, and return less money to them. Within a group context, little evidence is found of more central individuals displaying more cooperative behavior. Instead, for group cooperation, when a single monitor can observe contribution decisions, the presence of a direct link and more mutual network connections with a monitor correlates to more cooperative behavior by that individual. Our results suggest that network centrality and pro-social preferences are related but more localized network ties are more strongly correlated with pro-sociality than overall network connectedness...|$|E
