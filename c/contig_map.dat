40|$|A {{generalization}} of interval graph is introduced for cosmid <b>contig</b> <b>mapping</b> of DNA. A graph is a tagged probe interval graph if its vertex set can be partitioned into two subsets of probes and nonprobes, and a closed interval {{can be assigned}} to each vertex such that two vertices are adjacent {{if and only if}} {{at least one of them}} is a probe and one end of its corresponding interval is contained in the interval corresponding to the other vertex. We show that tagged probe interval graphs are weakly triangulated graphs, hence are perfect graphs. For a tagged probe interval graph with a given partition, we give a chordal completion that is consistent to any tagged interval completions with respect to the same vertex partition.

40|$|Motivation: <b>Contig</b> <b>maps</b> are {{a type of}} {{physical}} map that show the native order {{of a set of}} overlapping genomic clones. Overlaps between clones can be detected by finding common sequences using a number of experimental protocols including hybridization of probes. All current mapping algorithms of which we are aware require that hybridizations be scored using a fixed number of discrete values (typically 0 / 1 or high/medium/low). When hybridization data is captured automatically using digital equipment, this provides the opportunity for hybridization intensities to be used in map construction. More fine-grained distinctions in the levels of hybridization may be exploited by algorithms to generate more accurate physical maps. Results: We describe an approach to creating <b>contig</b> <b>maps</b> that uses measured hybridization intensities instead of data scored with a fixed number of discrete values. We describe and compare four algorithms for creating physical maps with hybridization intensities. Simulations using measured intensities sampled from actual data on Aspergillus nidulans indicate that using hybridization intensities rather than data that is automatically scored with respect to threshold values may yield more accurate physical maps...|$|R

50|$|Tests {{used for}} this purpose include cross-species hybridization, {{identification}} of unmethylated CpG islands, exon trapping, direct cDNA selection, computer analysis of DNA sequence, mutation screening in affected individuals, and tests of gene expression. For genomes in which the regions of genetic polymorphisms are known, positional cloning involves identifying polymorphisms that flank the mutation. This process requires that DNA fragments from the closest known genetic marker are progressively cloned and sequenced, getting closer to the mutant allele with each new clone. This process produces a <b>contig</b> <b>map</b> of the locus and is known as chromosome walking. With the completion of genome sequencing projects such as the Human Genome Project, modern positional cloning can use ready-made contigs from the genome sequence databases directly.|$|E
5000|$|Contig {{can also}} {{refer to the}} {{overlapping}} clones that form a physical map of a chromosome when the top-down or hierarchical sequencing strategy is used. [...] In this sequencing method, a low-resolution map is made prior to sequencing {{in order to provide}} a framework to guide the later assembly of the sequence reads of the genome. This map identifies the relative positions and overlap of the clones used for sequencing. Sets of overlapping clones that form a contiguous stretch of DNA are called contigs; the minimum number of clones that form a contig that covers the entire chromosome comprise the tiling path that is used for sequencing. Once a tiling path has been selected, its component BACs are sheared into smaller fragments and sequenced. Contigs therefore provide the framework for hierarchical sequencing.The assembly of a <b>contig</b> <b>map</b> involves several steps. First, DNA is sheared into larger (50-200kb) pieces, which are cloned into BACs or PACs to form a BAC library. Since these clones should cover the entire genome/chromosome, it is theoretically possible to assemble a contig of BACs that covers the entire chromosome. [...] Reality, however, is not always ideal. Gaps often remain, and a scaffold—consisting of contigs and gaps—that covers the map region is often the first result. [...] The gaps between contigs can be closed by various methods outlined below.|$|E

40|$|Comparison is a {{fundamental}} tool for analyzing DNA sequence. Interspecies sequence comparison is particularly powerful for inferring genome function {{and is based on}} the simple premise that conserved sequences are likely to be important. Thus, the comparison of a genomic sequence with its orthologous counterpart from another species is increasingly becoming an integral component of genome analysis. In ideal situations, such comparisons are performed with orthologous sequences from multiple species. To facilitate multispecies comparative sequence analysis, a robust and scalable strategy for simultaneously constructing sequence-ready bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) <b>contig</b> <b>maps</b> from targeted genomic regions has been developed. Central to this approach is the generation and utilization of “universal ” oligonucleotide-based hybridization probes (“overgo ” probes), which are designed from sequences that are highly conserved between distantly related species. Large collections of these probes are used en masse to screen BAC libraries from multiple species in parallel, with the isolated clones assembled into physical <b>contig</b> <b>maps.</b> To validate the effectiveness of this strategy, efforts were focused on the construction of BAC-based physical maps from multiple mammalian species (chimpanzee, baboon, cat, dog, cow, and pig).

The most efficient first step is isolating YAC (Yeast Artificial Chromosome) clones. A robust, detailed YAC <b>contig</b> <b>map</b> is thus an important tool.

We constructed a physical map of chromosome 21 p using sequence tagged site (STS) content mapping of yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). To this end, 39 STSs located on the short arm or near the centromere of chromosome 21 were constructed, including four polymorphic simple tandem repeats (STRs) and two expressed sequence tags (ESTs).

Fifty-two of the markers were found to contain DNA sequences conserved in Chinese hamster, {{and some of these}} 52 also cross-hybridized with DNA from other mammals and/or chicken. As the length of chromosome 11 is estimated at nearly 130 cM, the average distance between RFLP markers is roughly 1 cM. The large panel of DNA markers on our map should contribute to investigations of hereditary diseases on this chromosome, and it will also provide reagents for constructing either fine-scale linkage and physical <b>maps</b> or <b>contig</b> <b>maps</b> of cosmids or yeast artificial chromosomes...|$|R

Generally, these DNA segments are sized {{in the range of}} 1 [...] 4 Mb. The problem of assembling clone <b>contig</b> <b>maps</b> is a simpler special case of this contig problem and is handled by our algorithms. The goal is to devise contiging algorithms capable of producing high-quality composite maps rapidly and in a scalable manner. The resulting software is a key component of our physical mapping automation tools and has been used routinely to create composite maps of various microorganisms (E. coli, P. falciparum and D. radioduran). The experimental results appear highly promising. 1 Introduction Single molecule approaches provide a new direction for characterizing structural and functional properties of individual DNA molec [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The common {{marmoset}} is a {{new world}} monkey, {{which has become a}} valuable experimental animal for biomedical research. This study developed cDNA libraries for the common marmoset from five different tissues. A total of 290 426 high-quality EST sequences were obtained, where 251 587 sequences (86. 5 %) had homology (1 E 2100) with the Refseqs of six different primate species, including human and marmoset. In parallel, 270 673 sequences (93. 2 %) were aligned to the human genome. When 247 090 sequences were assembled into 17 232 contigs, most of the sequences (218 857 or 15 089 contigs) were located in exonic regions, indicating that these genes are expressed in human and marmoset. The other 5578 sequences (or 808 <b>contigs)</b> <b>mapping</b> to the human genome were not located in exonic regions, suggesting that they are not expressed in human. Furthermore, a different set of 118 potential coding sequences were not similar to any Refseqs in any species, and, thus, may represent unknown genes. The cDNA librarie...|$|R
