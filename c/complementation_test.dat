40|$|AbstractDevelopmental geneticists’ {{contribution}} {{to the study of}} the evolution of morphological divergence has proceeded along two lines: comparative analysis of gene expression and quantitative genetics. Recent studies highlight how <b>complementation</b> <b>tests</b> between species can bridge the gap between these approaches...|$|R
5000|$|Complementation {{tests can}} also be carried out with haploid eukaryotes such as fungi, with {{bacteria}} and with viruses such as bacteriophage. [...] Research on the fungus Neurospora crassa {{led to the development}} of the one-gene-one enzyme concept that provided the foundation for the subsequent development of molecular genetics. [...] The <b>complementation</b> <b>test</b> was one of the main tools used in the early Neurospora work, because it was easy to do, and allowed the investigator to determine whether any two nutritional mutants were defective in the same, or different genes. The <b>complementation</b> <b>test</b> was also used in the early development of molecular genetics when bacteriophage T4 was one of the main objects of study. [...] In this case the test depends on mixed infections of host bacterial cells with two different bacteriophage mutant types. Its use was key to defining most of the genes of the virus, and provided the foundation for the study of such fundamental processes as DNA replication and repair, and how molecular machines are constructed.|$|E
5000|$|In genetics, {{complementation}} {{occurs when}} two strains of an organism with different homozygous recessive mutations that {{produce the same}} mutant phenotype (for example, a change in wing structure in flies) produce offspring with the wild-type phenotype when mated or crossed. Complementation will occur only if the mutations are in different genes. In this case, each strain's genome supplies the wild-type allele to [...] "complement" [...] the mutated allele of the other strain's genome. Since the mutations are recessive, the offspring will display the wild-type phenotype. A <b>complementation</b> <b>test</b> (sometimes called a [...] "cis-trans" [...] test) {{can be used to}} test whether the mutations in two strains are in different genes. Complementation will not occur if the mutations are in the same gene. The convenience and essence of this test is that the mutations that produce a phenotype can be assigned to different genes without the exact knowledge of what the gene product is doing on a molecular level. The <b>complementation</b> <b>test</b> was developed by American geneticist Edward B. Lewis.|$|E

40|$|Six schemes {{were used}} to {{identify}} 80 independent recessive lethal deficiencies of linkage group (LG) II following X-ray treatment of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. <b>Complementation</b> <b>tests</b> between the deficiencies and ethyl methanesulfonate-induced recessive visible, lethal and sterile mutations and between different deficiencies {{were used to}} characterize the extents of the deficiencies. Deficiency endpoints thus helped to order 36 sites within a region representing {{about half of the}} loci on LG II and extending over about 5 map units. New mutations occurring in this region can be assigned to particular segments of the map by <b>complementation</b> <b>tests</b> against a small number of deficiencies; this facilitates the assignment of single-site mutations to particular genes, as we illustrate. Five sperm-defective and five oocyte-defective LG II sterile mutants were identified and mapped. Certain deficiency-by-deficiency <b>complementation</b> <b>tests</b> allowed us to suggest that the phenotypes of null mutations at two loci represented by visible alleles are wild type and that null mutations at a third locus confer a visible phenotype. A segment of LG II that is about 12 map units long and largely devoid of identified loci seems to be greatly favored for crossing over...|$|R
40|$|In a small {{region of}} the X {{chromosome}} of Drosophila melanogaster, {{we have found that}} a third of the mutations that appear to act as lethals in segmental haploids are viable in homozygous mutant individuals. These viable mutations fall into four complementation groups. The most reasonable explanation of these mutations is that they are a subset of functionally hypomorphic alleles of essential genes: hypomorphic mutations with activity levels above a threshold required for survival, but below twice that level, should behave in this manner. We refer to these mutations as "haplo-specific lethal mutations. " In studies of autosomal lethals, haplo-specific lethal mutations can be included in lethal <b>complementation</b> <b>tests</b> without being identified as such.

50|$|To analyze {{regulatory}} mutants of the lac operon, Jacob {{developed a}} system {{by which a}} second copy of the lac genes (lacI with its promoter, and lacZYA with promoter and operator) could be introduced into a single cell. A culture of such bacteria, which are diploid for the lac genes but otherwise normal, is then tested for the regulatory phenotype. In particular, it is determined whether LacZ and LacY are made {{even in the absence}} of IPTG (due to the lactose repressor produced by the mutant gene being non-functional). This experiment, in which genes or gene clusters are tested pairwise, is called a <b>complementation</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
50|$|Once mutagenized and screened, {{typically}} a <b>complementation</b> <b>test</b> {{is done to}} ensure that mutant phenotypes arise from the same genes if the mutations are recessive. If the progeny after a cross between two recessive mutants have a normal phenotype, then it can be inferred that the phenotype is determined {{by more than one}} gene. Typically, the allele exhibiting the strongest phenotype is further analyzed. A genetic map can then be created using linkage and genetic markers, and then the gene of interest can be cloned and sequenced. If many alleles of the same genes are found, the screen is said to be saturated and it is likely that all of the genes involved producing the phenotype were found.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{vegetative}} {{phase of}} Neurospora is haploid, functional tests of allelism cannot routinely {{be made by}} constructing heterozygous diploids but will usually depend {{on the ability of}} genes to complement one another in heterokaryons. Because Neurospora mycelia grow so rapidly and vigorously, positive <b>complementation</b> <b>tests</b> are usually clear and rapid. Partial diploids could also be used for <b>testing</b> <b>complementation,</b> but constructing them is laborious and depends on the availability of suitable duplication-producing insertional or terminal chromosome rearrangements. (See Perkins 1997. See How to use duplication-generating rearrangements in mapping.) Dodge (1942, Dodge et al. 1945) provided the first example of complementation in N. tetrasperma. Beadle and Coonradt (1944) explored complementation in heterokaryotic strains with multiple components, in hope of determining degrees of dominance. With the advent of efficient methods for selecting auxotrophic mutations, series of mutants with the same requirement were tested for allelism by <b>complementation</b> <b>tests</b> which used heterokaryons to place them in complementation groups that corresponded to different loci (e. g., de Serres 1956, Webber and Case 1960).

50|$|For {{a simple}} {{example of a}} <b>complementation</b> <b>test,</b> suppose a {{geneticist}} is interested in studying two strains of white-eyed flies of the species Drosophila melanogaster, more {{commonly known as the}} common fruit fly. In this species, wild type flies have red eyes and eye color is known to be related to two genes, A and B. Each one of these genes has two alleles, a dominant one that codes for a working protein (A and B respectively) and a recessive one that codes for a malfunctioning protein (a and b respectively). Since both proteins are necessary for the synthesis of red pigmentation in the eyes, if a given fly is homozygous for either a or b, it will have white eyes.|$|E

50|$|This test is {{illustrated}} in the figure (lacA is omitted for simplicity). First, certain haploid states are shown (i.e. the cell carries only a single copy of the lac genes). Panel (a) shows repression, (b) shows induction by IPTG, and (c) and (d) show the effect of a mutation to the lacI gene or to the operator, respectively. In panel (e) the <b>complementation</b> <b>test</b> for repressor is shown. If one copy of the lac genes carries a mutation in lacI, but the second copy is wild type for lacI, the resulting phenotype is normal---but lacZ is expressed when exposed to inducer IPTG. Mutations affecting repressor are said to be recessive to wild type (and that wild type is dominant), and this is {{explained by the fact that}} repressor is a small protein which can diffuse in the cell. The copy of the lac operon adjacent to the defective lacI gene is effectively shut off by protein produced from the second copy of lacI.|$|E

40|$|It is {{standard}} genetic practice {{to determine whether}} or not two independently obtained mutants define the same or different genes by performing the <b>complementation</b> <b>test.</b> While the <b>complementation</b> <b>test</b> is highly effective and accurate in most cases, there are a number of instances in which the <b>complementation</b> <b>test</b> provides misleading answers, either as a result of the failure of two mutations that are located in different genes to complement each other or by exhibiting complementation between two mutations that lie within the same gene. We are primarily concerned here with those cases in which two mutations lie in different genes, but nonetheless fail to complement each other. This phenomenon is often referred to as second-site noncomplementation (SSNC). The discovery of SSNC led to a large number of screens designed to search for genes that encode interacting proteins. However, screens for dominant enhancer mutations of semidominant alleles of a given gene have proved far more effective at identifying interacting genes whose products interact physically or functionally with the initial gene of interest than have SSNC-based screens...|$|E
