50|$|Whereas lately it {{was ordained}} by our lord king {{and by the}} assent of the prelates, earls, barons and others of his council, against the malice of {{servants}} who were idle and not willing to serve after the pestilence without excessive wages, that such manner of servants, men as well as women, should be bound to serve, receiving the customary salary and wages in the places where they are bound {{to serve in the}} twentieth year of the reign 1347 of the king that now is, or five or six years before, and that the same servants refusing to serve in such a manner should be punished by imprisonment of their bodies, as is more plainly contained in the said statute. Whereupon commissions were made to diverse people in every county to enquire and punish all those who offend against the same. And now for {{as much as it is}} given to the king to understand in the present parliament by the petition of the commons that the servants having no regard to the ordinance but to their ease and singular covetousness, do withdraw themselves from serving great men and others, unless they have livery and wages double or treble of what they were wont to take in the twentieth year and earlier, to the great damage of the great men and impoverishment of all the commonality; whereof the commonality prays remedy. Wherefore in the parliament by the assent of the prelates, earls, barons, and those of the commonality assembled there, in order to refrain the malice of the servants, there are ordained and established the underwritten articles.Item that carters, ploughmen, drivers of ploughs, shepherds, swineherds, day men, and all other servants shall take the liveries and wages accustomed in the twentieth year or four years before so that in the countryside where the wheat was wont to be given they shall take for the bushel 10 d, or wheat at the will of the giver until it be otherwise ordained.

Saving that the people of the counties of Stafford, Lancaster, and Derby, and people of Craven and of the marches of Wales and Scotland, and other places may come in time of August and labour in other counties, and safely return as they were wont to do before this time; and that those who refuse to make such oath, or to not perform as they were sworn to do or have taken upon them shall be put in the stocks by the said lords, stewards, bailiffs and constables of the towns for three days or more or sent to the next gaol, there to remain until they satisfy themselves. And that stocks be made in every town for such occasion, between now and the feast of Pentecost.Item that carpenters masons and tilers and other workmen of houses shall not take by the day further work except in the manner as they were wont to do, that is to say, a master carpenter 3 d and other carpenters 2 d; a master mason 4 d and other masons 3 d and their servants 1½ d; tilers 3 d and their boys 1½ d; and other <b>coverers</b> of fern and straw 3 d and their boys 1½ d; plasterers and other worker of mud walls and their boys, in the same manner without meat and drink that is from Easter to Michaelmas and from that time less according to the rate and discretion of the justices who shall be assigned thereunto.

5000|$|Finally {{it remains}} {{to prove that the}} tiling formed by the union of the triangles covers the whole of the upper half plane. Any point z covered by the tiling lies in a polygon Pn and hence a polygon Pn +1 [...] It {{therefore}} lies in a copy of the original triangle Δ as well as a copy of P2 entirely contained in Pn +1 [...] The hyperbolic distance between Δ and the exterior of P2 is equal to r > 0. Thus the hyperbolic distance between z and points not <b>coverered</b> by the tiling is at least r. Since this applies to all points in the tiling, the set covered by the tiling is closed. On the other hand the tiling is open since it coincides with the union of the interiors of the polygons Pn. By connectivity, the tessellation must cover the whole of the upper half plane.|$|R

40|$|This Wildland Fire Management Plan (FMP) for Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) updates the 2003 plan {{incorporating}} changes {{necessary to}} comply with DOE Order 450. 1 and DOE P 450. 4, Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and Program Review; Wildland and Prescribed Fire Management Policy and implementation Procedures Reference Guide. This current plan incorporates changes since the original draft of the FMP that result from new policies on the national level. This update also removes references and dependence on the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service and Department of the Interior, fully transitioning Wildland Fire Management responsibilities to BNL. The Department of Energy policy for managing wildland fires requires that all areas, managed by the DOE and/or its various contractors, that can sustain fire must have a FMP that details fire management guidelines for operational procedures associated with wild fire, operational, and prescribed fires. Fire management plans provide guidance on fire preparedness, fire prevention, wildfire suppression, {{and the use of}} controlled, 'prescribed' fires and mechanical means to control the amount of available combustible material. Values reflected in the BNL Wildland FMP include protecting life and public safety; Lab properties, structures and improvements; cultural and historical sites; neighboring private and public properties; and endangered, threatened, and species of concern. Other values supported by the plan include the enhancement of fire-dependent ecosystems at BNL. This FMP will be reviewed periodically to ensure the fire program advances and evolves with the missions of the DOE and BNL. This Fire Management Plan is presented in a format that <b>coverers</b> all aspects specified by DOE guidance documents which are based on the national template for fire management plans adopted under the National Fire Plan. The DOE is one of the signatory agencies on the National Fire Plan. This FMP is to be used and implemented for the entire BNL site including the Upton Reserve and has been reviewed by, The Nature Conservancy, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Forest Rangers, and DOE, as well as appropriate BNL emergency services personnel.

40|$|Worldwide {{statistics}} show {{an increasing number}} of people infected with HIV. Unfortunately, number of people with HIV is also increasing in the Czech Republic (CR). That's why I was in my thesis entitled Social services for persons with HIV / AIDS deeply devoted to care, which is in the Czech Republic provided to persons affected by this insidious disease. I focused on social services, which device provides them, how users are satisfied and whether they have constant contact with the family. The bachelor thesis is divided in two parts, namely the theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part is thematically divided into nine sub-chapters, which are further divided into sections. The first subsection deals with the current situation, therefore the definition of HIV / AIDS, the second chapter explains the entire history of HIV and in the third chapter I write about the transmission of HIV. In this section there are described different ways of transmission of the virus. In this part I try to describe to the reader what that HIV / AIDS is. In the fourth and fifth subchapter is referred clinical picture of the disease, how the disease manifests itself, which are the stages of the disease and especially epidemiology, when to readers are approximated data and statistics from the Czech Republic and also from abroad. In the following three sub-sections, which are: treatment, testing and prevention, is briefly described treating HIV / AIDS, what are the methods of testing and how you can defend against HIV. The final ninth chapter is devoted to the principal topic of my thesis, and that?s social services (pursuant to Act 108 / 2006 Sb.) that are provided to people with HIV / AIDS, where are they provided, how are they financed, etc. Last but not least is mentioned where can a person who feels threatened by the virus, reverse. The practical part of this work was conducted through qualitative research, secondary data analysis and content analysis data. The first objective was to monitor the overall range of social services in the Czech Republic. The second goal was also monitoring, but in this case it was monitoring the satisfaction of users of social services DS with services provided by that social center. Since DS is the only facility providing the service in the Czech Republic, the research was conducted exclusively in this device. The third aim of my thesis was to compare data and statistics HIV / AIDS in the Czech Republic and other European countries. For comparison, I chose autonomous Switzerland, which seemed the most appropriate for comparison. For the purposes of research, I have identified three research questions: What is the incidence and prevalence of HIV / AIDS in the Czech Republic 31 12 th 2012 ? What is the situation of HIV / AIDS in Switzerland compared to the Czech Republic? Is satisfaction of respondents with social services sufficient or D 9 +-S users have concerns about social services? Even in 2011 didn?t the Czech Republic belong among risk countries with a high incidence and prevalence. In the past year (2012) increased prevalence and incidence and the Czech Republic got on the list of countries at risk. It is paradoxical that while in the Czech Republic, is only one device for people with HIV / AIDS, which provides social services and the number of infected increases every year, {{there is no need to}} expand the provision of social services. DS <b>coverers</b> enough the needs of people who need this service and is always trying to find the best and most optimal solution for both sides. The work could help to raise the profile of this serious health, economic and social problem and at the same time could serve as study material not only for students but also for the general public.

40|$|The Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) {{operate a}} number of Fourier-Transform Spectrometers (FTSs) that measure trace gases in the {{atmosphere}} by observing solar spectra. To guide the sunlight into the FTS, a solar tracker has to be placed outside. This device needs high-quality optical mirrors with good reflectivity in the near and mid infrared. More and more FTS stations are operated in remote locations with harsh environments. Optical mirrors are usually made for laboratory conditions and might not last very long there. At the MPI-BGC's TCCON site on Ascension Island, several mirrors from different optical manufacturers were destroyed within weeks. To continue operation, the MPI-BGC had to develop rugged mirrors that could sustain the harsh conditions for months or even years. While commercially available mirrors are typically made from a substrate <b>coverered</b> with a thin reflective coating, these rugged mirrors were made from stainless steel with no additional coating.

40|$|Soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) {{is a key}} element of agroecosystems {{functioning}} and has a crucial impact on global carbon storage at world scale. SOC spatial variability and temporal dynamics are strongly affected by natural and anthropogenic processes occurring at the landscape scale, such as soil redistribution in the lateral and vertical dimensions by tillage and erosion processes. This study aims at modeling SOC distribution in A-horizons, at high spatial resolution, for an area of 1 000 ha in a complex agricultural landscape (NW France). The study site is characterized by high short distance heterogeneity due to an important diversity of soils (with varying redoximorphic conditions, depth), soil parent material (Aeolian loam cover, granite, hard and soft schist), topography, land use (annual crops, temporary or permanent grasslands) and hedge density. We used learning methods based on soil point data, characterized by soil description, SOC content and bulk density measurements. 200 points were selected using conditioned Latin hypercube sampling in order to cover the whole range of ancillary variables (elevation, Modified Compound Topographic Index, K emissions and land use). This sampling strategy enables to select a limited number of sampling sites <b>coverering</b> the study site heterogeneity. Additive sampling was designed to investigate SOC distribution near hedges (112 points sampled at fixed distances along 14 transects crossing hedges). Predictive environmental data consisted in the data used in the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, at which were added topographic attributes derivated from the DEM and geological variables. We will discuss the ability of our model to capture and predict the SOC, considering the general SOC distribution trend at the landscape scale and the finer SOC distribution in landscape, at hedgerow proximity. The SOC 3 -D map obtained will be used as soil data input in a soil evolution model, coupling SOC dynamics and soil erosion modeling...|$|R
