40|$|Parque Porcino de Ventanilla has an {{extension}} of 840 ha with 2200 farmers dedicated to pig production. There {{is a lack of}} services in the area (i. e., water supply, electricity, or waste collection). Anaerobic treatment of pig manure would replace <b>current</b> <b>dumping</b> and incineration, reducing environmental pollution and hazards to public health, as well as providing an organic fertilizer and biogas. The objective of the present work was to study the viability of ambient temperature anaerobic digestion of pig manure diluted in urine, by means of on-site pilot scale reactors. The final goal was to establish design parameters for anaerobic digesters to be implemented; since {{it was part of a}} project to improve life conditions for the farmers through the incorporation of better management techniques. Experiments were carried out in a low-cost pilot plant, which consists of three anaerobic digesters (225 L total volume), without heating or agitation, placed in a greenhouse.

The availability and quality of water always have played {{an important}} role in determining quality of life. Water quality is closely linked to water use and to the state of economic development. Chennai is among the worst affected in water quality because of its ever-expanding urban population demands for more freshwater. Due to population growth and rising income have resulted in a rapid growth in municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rate of the city. Waste generation per day has been doubled during the last decade. The present study is the area in and around Perungudi dump yard in the Pallikaranai Marsh, south of Chennai is in operation since 1986 and has increased tremendously between year 1990 to 2010. The dump yard is low lying area, closes to the sea level, poorly drained and consists of an extensive area of marshy land permanently wet and seasonally inundated. The <b>current</b> <b>dumping</b> rate is about 2, 000 tons /day. The present work is undertaken to study the seasonal variation of groundwater around the Perungudi dump yard by analyzing the physico chemical characteristics, and heavy metals. The toxic heavy metals entering the ecosystem may lead to geo-accumulation, bio accumulation and bio-magnification. Heavy metals like Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cd and other trace elements are important for proper functioning of biological systems and their deficiency or excess could lead to a number of disorders.

The TFI, {{the last in}} a series of ITER insert coils, was tested in operating conditions relevant for the actual ITER TF coils, inserting it in the borehole of the Central Solenoid Model Coil, which provided the background magnetic field. In this paper, we consider the five quench propagation tests that were performed using one or two inductive heaters (IHs) as drivers; out of these, three used just one IH but increasing delay times, up to 7. 5 s, between the quench detection and the TFI <b>current</b> <b>dump.</b> The results of the 4 C code prediction of the quench propagation up to the <b>current</b> <b>dump</b> are presented first, based on simulations performed before the tests.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mixed siliciclastic-carbonate nd siliciclastic turbidites of the Saraceno Formation (Eocene) in Calabria, {{southern}} Italy, contain diverse trace-fossil associations. The depositional setting {{appears to}} have been a small, tectonicaUy isolated, rapidly subsiding borderland basin into which turbidity <b>currents</b> <b>dumped</b> a variety of sediments. The formation comprises four sedimentary fades, each of which is characterized by a distinctive ichnofacies (from bottom to top) : Facies I (alternatin 8 calcarenite and thick-bedded shale), Chondrites-Muensteria-Rhizocorallium; Facies II (alternating calcarenite and thin-bedded shale), Chondrites-Muensteria-Zoophycos; Facies III (thin-bedded siliciclastic sandstone), Zoophycos-Helminthoida-Palaeophycus; Fades IV (alternating siliciclastic sandstone and shale), Zoophycos-Helminthoida-Phycosiphon. The trace-fossil associations are dominated by fodinichrtia, such as Chondrites in the lower part of the formation (Facies I and II) and Zoophycos in the upper part (Facies III and IV). The agrichnia (graphoglyptids) and pascichnia that usually dominate turbidite ichnofacies are uncommon, perhaps owing to a) a fairly shallow water depth, b) an extremely high frequency of turbidity currents, and/or c) dysaerobic or anaerobic interstitial conditions within the sediment...|$|R

Technology selection is a critical step when implementing a MSW based power plants. This research is suggested to use thermal technologies such as gasification or pyrolysis even though which are associated with high capital costs and sophisticated process technology. Even combination of RDF based incineration/gasification and bio-gas based power plants are feasible for Sri Lankan applications. Two scenarios were analyzed in research and baseline financial analysis shows that both scenarios are feasible. However sensitivity analysis shows that increase of cost and reduce of project benefits by 10 % will cause to negative NPV value with 12 % discount rate and IRR goes below cost of capital. Therefore projects are associated with high risk. The study covered only the Western Province of Sri Lanka and other Provinces are not considered for this research. Generally economic and financial analyses are associated with many limitations. To avoid this two scenarios used mainly to strength the findings of economic and financial analysis. There is a good opportunity to implement two MSW based power plants in Karadiyana and Meethotamulla dump sites.

We present two case studies from Western Australia; the first where closure of above ground landforms such as waste dumps by covers would arguably not be successful over long terms (1, 000 years or more) and another where Potentially Acid Forming waste (PAF) management is limited by <b>current</b> waste rock <b>dump</b> location and suitable cover materials. Pit lake water balance modelling indicates both case study pit lakes will function as hydraulic sinks {{if they are not}} backfilled above their equilibrium water levels. A best closure outcome for these pit lakes may be to be backfilled with PAF encapsulated with alkaline/neutral waste and then filled as rapidly as possible to minimise PAF oxidation and ensure an evaporative sink pit lake is formed...|$|R
40|$|Recycling of {{construction}} material helps save the limited landfill space. Among {{various types of}} materials, concrete waste accounts of about 50 % of the total waste generation. Current off-site practices for ready mixed concrete batching plant generate a significant quantity of fresh concrete waste through over-order from construction sites. The use of concrete reclaimer {{is one of the}} methods to reclaim these concrete waste, which separates coarse aggregate, sand and cement from fresh concrete. Although there are some concrete producers in Hong Kong providing concrete reclaimers in their plants, they are only used to flush and dilute the cement slurry from the concrete, which will still be sltimately send all to dumping areas. The reluctance of most concrete producers in reclaiming aggregate from the concrete waste is due to its high cost of treatment and lack of space around the plant. Therefore, this paper puts forth a scheme of economical considerations in recycling over-ordered concrete by concrete reclaimer. A comparative study on costs and benefits between the current practices and the proposed recycling plan is examined. The study shows that the costs of the <b>current</b> practices in <b>dumping</b> over-ordered fresh concrete waste to landfill areas are double that of the proposed aggregate recycling plan. Therefore, the adoption of concrete reclaimer in recycling the over-ordered fresh concrete can provide a cost-effective method for the construction industry and help saving the environment...|$|R
