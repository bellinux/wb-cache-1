Because {{some of the}} meat the Inuit eat is raw and fresh, or freshly frozen, they can obtain more carbohydrates from their meat, as dietary glycogen, than Westerners can.

While postmortem glycogen levels are often depleted through the onset of rigor mortis, marine mammals have a much delayed onset of rigor mortis, even in warm conditions, presumably due to the high content of oxymyoglobin in the muscle that may permit aerobic metabolism to continue slowly for some time after the death of the animal.

The density of the protein matrix (matrix defined as all disintegrated tissues, without intact pieces of muscle fibres, connective tissue and fat cell clusters) was markedly affected by polyphosphate. Polyphosphate led to a fine dispersion of the fat, as reflected by the formation of a larger proportion of fat droplets smaller than 3. 5 um 2.

40|$|Serious illness {{caused by}} Escherichia coli and {{associated}} with the consumption of foods characterised by low water activity (e. g. uncooked, <b>comminuted</b> fermented <b>meat)</b> has clearly demonstrated the ability of this microbe to survive adverse environments. The consequences of such disease outbreaks have included the loss of life, serious and sometimes long-term illness in other victims, and obviously a detrimental impact on the food industry that is implicated. The prevention of further outbreaks relies upon an improved understanding of the capacity of E. coli to survive inimical conditions. This thesis describes the kinetics of low water activity-induced inactivation of E. coli, including consideration of the combined effects of low pH, and examines the cell death processes involved. In addition, this study attempts to define whether cells that exhibit enhanced survival in conditions of low water activity do so by inducing a specific stress response. Materials and methods commonly used to analyse bacterial viability and injury were initially evaluated to enable a more accurate description of E. coli inactivation in response to osmotic stress. The composition of the medium was observed to strongly influence the inactivation of E. coli. Traditional, culture-based methods were found to overstate the level of injury in low water activity-treated populations of E. coli and a modified procedure was employed subsequently. Methods were also developed to improve the level of reproducibility between experiments. Initial studies using culture-based methods demonstrated that the inactivation of E. coli in response to low water activity consisted of three distinct phases of inactivation. The ability to induce the final, rapid phase of inactivation would be of considerable benefit during food manufacture processes to better reduce pathogenic loads. Because the use of low water activity as a preservation method in food manufacture is often in combination with acid stress, the kinetics of inactivation of E. coli in response to low water activity and low pH were also investigated. Experiments showed that {{the order in which}} these non-thermal stresses were applied influenced the inactivation of E. coli That is, cells were more sensitive to osmotic stress when first exposed to low pH conditions. These findings are of relevance to food manufacturing processes that use multiple stresses to ensure microbiological safety. The level of injury in osmotic or acid treated E. coli populations suggested that the processes responsible for the effect of these stresses were different. The above knowledge was used to develop a broth-based model that mimicked the rates of inactivation of E. coli observed in uncooked, <b>comminuted</b> fermented <b>meat</b> products. This system allowed for the systematic generation of a large amount of data to define the response of E. coli to specific conditions without the limitations of in-product trials. The data generated in this work were incorporated into a predictive model that has since been used by food manufacturers and regulators to assess the ability of uncooked, <b>comminuted</b> fermented <b>meat</b> manufacturing processes to inactivate E. coli. In addition, this study highlighted the need to confirm patterns of microbial responses derived from broth-based systems with that from in-product trials. Although water activity was shown to influence the rate of inactivation of E. coli using the broth-based system, comparisons with in-product trials reported in the literature suggested that {{this was not the case}} in the actual food product. Having characterised the kinetics of low water activity-induced inactivation of E. coli, subsequent work attempted to develop knowledge relating to the processes involved in that system. It was hypothesised that the mechanism of inactivation of E coil in response to low water activity involves specific genetic modules shown to mediate the death of bacterial cells in some situations. Using E. coli mutants deleted for one of these systems (mazEP), the involvement of this component could not be conclusively shown but nor could it be ruled out. The mazEF module might mediate the death of a proportion of E coil cells that are killed immediately following exposure to some low water activity environments. The implications of this self-mediated cell death pathway on the present understanding of bacterial inactivation are discussed. Finally, investigations aimed at identifying a specific stress response that enhances the survival of E coli in lethal water activity environments provided no direct evidence for such a response. Provision of the compatible solute betaine did not alter the survival characteristics of osmotically stressed E coli and proteomic experiments indicated that four stress-related proteins do not form a specific response to lethal osmotic stress in E. coli. The use of proteomic techniques further provided a general overview of the physiology of E coli that are able to survive osmotic challenges, which may be of considerable value when coupled with genomic studies that more comprehensively assess stress physiology in E coli. Overall, the work presented throughout this thesis develops the present understanding of the response of E coil to inimical conditions relevant to the manufacture of uncooked, <b>comminuted</b> fermented <b>meat</b> products...|$|R

40|$|New Zealand?s {{isolation}} {{makes it}} a natural home to many unique species. One {{of them is the}} now cultivated New Zealand green shell mussel (Perna canaliculus) which is sought after by seafood lovers around the world. This mussel is by far the largest seafood export from New Zealand accounting for about 85 % and exported to 78 countries in 2011. This research was conducted to create a variant of an existing value-added product: lactic-fermented <b>comminuted</b> mussel <b>meat.</b> This product has been named Perna. The existing knowledge relates to a spreadable form of Perna, which is currently undergoing commercial evaluation. This work is mainly about developing a gelled form of Perna using hydrocolloids, specifically carrageenans and gelatine. The proposition was that a gelled, sliceable form of Perna would expand its culinary potential. The spreadable form would be used for crackers and breads, while a slice of Perna could be part of an entr?e in domestic cuisine or food service. However, as the project progressed it became clear that unacceptable variations in pH of Perna were affected by the time the mussels were cooked in boiling water prior to comminution and fermentation. Because of the fundamental importance of this variation in terms of odour/flavour, {{the first part of the}} thesis explores the chemistry of how pH could be better controlled. It was found that the buffering capacity of mussel proteins changed with cooking. Although no explanations were obtained at a biochemical level, the empirical outcome was that cooking live mussels between 7 to 10 minutes would predictably result in a desired final pH of around 4. 5 that yields superior organoleptic properties such as pleasant smell, taste and texture. Moving to gelation as a goal, it was found that kappa and iota carrageenans were incapable of forming useful gels in Perna, the former producing excessive syneresis and latter a soft, spongy product. Experiments with gelatine were initially unsuccessful, inadvertently because of the low gelatine concentrations tested. After a more concentrated gelatine colloidal suspension of about 8 % was incorporated into the mussel mince, a useful gel was finally created, although the texture was crumbly. However, this final success is considered an excellent starting point for sliceable product refinement...|$|R

Subsequently, the matrix was dipped in dammar extracts, {{with or without the}} addition of antimicrobial agents such as propyl paraben, zinc chloride, zinc acetate, and silver nitrate. As a result, flesh dammar performed greater antibacterial activity than that of stone dammar. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of silver nitrate in the biopackaging was comparable to that of zinc chloride while combined with dammar, but zinc acetate was less effective. On the other hand, active biopackaging comprised of combination of dammar and propyl paraben was the least effective. Among the eight combinations of two dammar extracts and four antimicrobial agents, flesh dammar extract comprised of 0. 1 % (w/v) zinc chloride and 1. 0 % (w/v) lecithin was found as the most promising formulation for dipping with regard to its production cost and antimicrobial activity.

Value changes of basic parameters characterising the above properties were determined {{with the assistance of the}} DMTA technique. It was found that rheological parameters and, conse-quently, the texture of the examined cuttered sausages were influenced by both the physical condition and the proportion of the continuous phase as well as by the structural parameters of the discontinuous phase of fragments of the meat tissue. This found its reflection in the consistency of the forcemeat, which was the effect of the structuralisation process. The reduction in the meat tissue proportion ac-companied by increased water content in the forcemeat resulted in loosening of its structure. This was evident both in the level of values of basic rheological parameters and in the increase of scalding losses. In comparison with the unmodified products, the final articles modified with the applied pro-tein extract were characterised by increased plastic properties.

The {{effect of}} the {{substitution}} of pork fat with wheat or oat cellulose preparations {{and the application of}} these preparations as a functional additive in finely <b>comminuted</b> <b>meat</b> products was studied. Chemical composition of the preserved meat bloc was examined, water binding and sensory profile of texture was characterized, and sensory desirability of the products was evaluated. As a result of the conducted studies {{it was found that the}} applied wheat and oat cellulose preparations as a substitute for 20 and 30 % of the standard fat content allow the obtaining of products which are not worse than the control product in respect of their quality. Fat substitution on the level of 40 % caused the lowest evaluation of the consistency desirability and of the general desirability. As a result of the application of cellulose preparations as a functional additive, the products with the sensory quality similar to that of the control product were obtained. Ca. 1. 5 % addition of the cellulose preparations to the model product did not deteriorate its sensory characteristics, with the simultaneous introduction of health-promoting dietary fibre to the meat product, as being so desirable in the diet for a correct functioning of human alimentary tract.

40|$|Fillers {{are used}} in <b>comminuted</b> <b>meat</b> {{products}} such as wieners to increase yield, improve stability, and modify textural properties. Light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy show that comminutred meat products are mechanical mixtures in which the microstructural features of starch and insoluble protein ingredients are largely retained. The water absorption and gelation properties of these ingredients contribute to the stability and textural firmness. Soluble proteins may improve stability through emulsion formation but the role of emulsion formation i s clearly secondary to that of gelation. The characteristic springy gel structure of wieners {{is determined by the}} gelation of myofibrlllar meat prote 1 ns. Provided the structure of the meat protein gel is not disrupted, fillers will generally increase both textural firmness and stability. Starch and protein fillers have been shown to increase the stability of wiener homogenates prepared at a higher (26 2 ̆ 7 C) temperature than that which is normally used (16 °C). Light microscopy revealed that the 2 ̆ 2 all-meat., wieners had a higher degree of fat agglomeration than did the more stable wieners containing added starch fillers. Electron microscopy revealed that the starch granules participated in the process of physically entrapping the fat globules. Fat globules varied in size and shape, and were observed in environments ranging from low to high protein densities.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} was to investigate the effect of seed tempering moisture and micronization temperature on the physicochemical properties of chickpea flour and its subsequent performance as a binder in a model low-fat pork bologna product. This work was divided into three studies. In the first study, the effect of seed tempering moisture (untempered (7 % moisture) or tempered to 15 or 22 % moisture) and surface micronization temperature (115, 130, 150 or 165 oC) and on the physical, chemical and functional properties of chickpea flour were investigated. Chickpea flour became darker as seed moisture or micronization temperature increased. Increasing the micronization temperature at 22 % seed moisture increased starch gelatinization from 8. 2 to 34. 0 %. The lipoxygenase activity of chickpea flour also was reduced by micronization of seed. Lipoxygenase activity in flour from non-micronized seed and flour from seed micronized at 115 oC without tempering was determined to be 1. 98 × 105 and 1. 12 × 105 units/g of protein, respectively, with no activity found in any other treatments. There was an increase in the water holding (WHC) and oil absorption capacity (OAC) of flour when chickpea seed was tempered to 22 % moisture before micronization. Flour from untempered seed and from seed tempered to 15 % moisture exhibited small increases in WHC as micronization temperature increased. Micronization had no effect on the OAC of untempered flours, whereas OAC decreased in flour from seed tempered to 15 % moisture at higher micronization temperatures. Rapid visco-analysis (RVA) revealed that peak viscosity and final viscosity of all flours from tempered seed decreased with increasing micronization temperature, whereas the trend for both peak viscosity and final viscosity was in the opposite direction with untempered seed. The effect of seed tempering moisture and micronization temperature on the performance of chickpea flour as a binder in a low-fat, <b>comminuted</b> <b>meat</b> product (i. e., low-fat bologna) was investigated in study 2. Both the textural and sensory properties (trained sensory panel, n= 12) of the bologna (10 % fat) were explored. In study 3, a consumer panel was performed with 101 untrained participants evaluating selected formulations in order to better understand consumer purchasing behaviour as it relates to <b>comminuted</b> <b>meat</b> products containing a pulse-based binder. Bologna containing flour from micronized chickpea was more yellow in colour (CIE system, trained panel and consumer panel evaluation) compared to those with added wheat flour or no binder. There was no effect of tempering or micronization conditions on cook loss or expressible moisture of bologna containing chickpea flour, whereas bologna produced with wheat flour had the greatest WHC among all bologna treatments. Texture profile analysis (TPA) showed that the addition of chickpea flour from seed tempered to 15 % or 22 % seed moisture and micronized to 115, 130 or 150 oC or flour from untempered seed micronized to 130 or 150 oC led to an increase in hardness to a level similar to that of bologna containing wheat flour; sensory evaluation by the trained panel did not produce a similar result. A difference in flavour intensity was not found among all bolognas containing chickpea flour during sensory evaluation. Bologna produced with chickpea flour from seed micronized to 150 oC and from seed tempered to 22 % moisture and micronized to 115 oC was comparable to bologna containing wheat flour with respect to overall texture, overall juiciness and flavour acceptability. These results demonstrated that selection of appropriate seed tempering conditions and micronization temperatures is important with respect to the utilization of chickpea flour as a binder in low-fat bologna...|$|E
