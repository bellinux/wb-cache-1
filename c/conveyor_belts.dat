5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts.</b> Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E

40|$|Today {{much higher}} speed of {{operation}} and highly accurate weighing of packages during crossing a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> has been {{getting more and more}} important in the food and distribution industries etc. Continuous weighing means that masses of discrete packages on a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> are automatically determined in sequence. Making the best use of new weighing scale called a multi-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scale which can be created so as to adjust the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> length to the product length, we propose a simplified and effective mass estimation algorithm under practical vibration modes. <b>Conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 140 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minute and more. The output signals from the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales are always contaminated with noises due to vibrations of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> and the product in motion.

5|$|Investigators {{were unable}} to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too {{hazardous}} after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts.</b> The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as “fat lighter,” because of the fire risk it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.|$|E
5|$|Born in Newport, Delaware, Evans {{received}} little formal education {{and in his}} mid-teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Going into business with his brothers, he worked {{for over a decade}} designing, building and perfecting an automated mill with devices such as bucket chains and <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts.</b> In doing so Evans designed a continuous process of manufacturing that required no human labor. This novel concept would prove critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Later in life Evans turned his attention to steam power, and built the first high-pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801, developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick, who built the first in the world a year earlier. Evans was a driving force in the development and adoption of high-pressure steam engines in the United States. Evans dreamed of building a steam-powered wagon and would eventually construct and run one in 1805. Known as the Oruktor Amphibolos, it was the first automobile in the country and the world's first amphibious vehicle, although it was too primitive to be a success as either.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the conveyor-belt model for portraying the airflow through midlatitude cyclones, questions arise as to the path of the cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> the lower-tropospheric airflow poleward of and underneath the warm front. Some studies, beginning with Carlson’s analysis of the eastern U. S. cyclone of 5 December 1977, depict the cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> moving westward, reaching the northwest quadrant of the storm, turning abruptly anticyclonically, rising to jet level, and departing the cyclone downstream (hereafter, the anticyclonic path). Other studies depict the cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> reaching the northwest quadrant, turning cyclonically around the low center, and remaining in the lower troposphere (the cyclonic path). To clarify the path of the cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> the present study reexamines Carlson’s analysis of the cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> using an observational and mesoscale numerical modeling study of the 5 December 1977 cyclone. This reexamination raises several previously unappreciated and underappreciated issues.
