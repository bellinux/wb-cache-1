50|$|Marco Breuer (born 1966, in Landshut) is a German {{photographer}} {{known for}} his radical approach to the medium. Much of his work is undertaken {{without the aid of}} a <b>camera,</b> <b>aperture,</b> or film, being instead produced through a combination of photogrammic, abrasive, and incisive techniques. Throughout his twenty-year career, Breuer has examined fundamental questions of photographic form and practice. Breuer works in and outside of the darkroom, exposing photographic material to heat, light, and physical abrasion. Drawing implements have included 12-gauge shotguns, the guts of electric frying pans, modified turntables, razor blades, and power sanders.|$|E
50|$|A {{diaphragm}} or leaf shutter (as {{distinct from}} the simple leaf shutter above) consists {{of a number of}} thin blades which briefly uncover the <b>camera</b> <b>aperture</b> to make the exposure. The blades slide over each other in a way which creates a circular aperture which enlarges as quickly as possible to uncover the whole lens, stays open for the required time, then closes in the same way. The larger the number of blades, the more accurately circular is the aperture. Flash synchronization is easily achieved with a pair of contacts that close when the shutter is fully open.|$|E

5000|$|The last {{development}} of M42 lenses was {{the introduction of}} a link between camera and lens to transmit the lens aperture setting, which allowed light metering with the aperture remaining wide open. The means of doing this was not standardised, Praktica's method was to use an electrical connection which transmitted a variable resistance value to the camera's metering circuit. Asahi Pentax developed an additional lever on the lens which operated a variable resistor in the camera mount. These mechanisms spurred the use of electronic shutters linked to the metering circuit, allowing for automated shutter speed selection by the <b>camera</b> (<b>aperture</b> priority).

50|$|The CATS flash {{equipment}} {{was for the}} later electronic Canon F1 New (1981) and it allowed aperture settings from the camera to be communicated to the flash unit. It was also possible for the flash unit to select an appropriate <b>camera</b> <b>aperture</b> based on its own photo cell exposure reading, provided that the motor drive was also present. The motor drive {{is necessary for the}} camera to function in shutter priority. TTL Flash was introduced on the Nikon F3 (1981) which was a direct competitor of the F1 New. For many this was considered as a considerable advantage although the ergonomics of the Nikon F3 with its liquid crystal display lacked the clarity of the Canon F1.|$|E
50|$|The post-Vietnam era saw the {{introduction}} of airborne infra-red sensors. Differences in temperatures between objects and their surroundings {{made it possible to}} detect targets on the ground. These early systems would record data which would be accessed once the aerial platform would land. Later developments in transmission technology would provide periodic data dumps and would further evolve into real-time collection. Synthetic aperture radar would soon be developed in the later part of the Cold War. The concept of an optical <b>camera</b> <b>aperture</b> affecting the image acquisition process would be emulated with radar waves, providing an undisclosed amount of detail. One clue would be the NASA photo released in the late 1980s showing a previously hidden African dry riverbed.|$|E

50|$|Seers' early {{fascination with}} {{photography}} {{led to a}} project of internalising the technology of the camera, in which she used her own body to produce photographs. The cavity of her mouth became the camera body and her lips became the <b>camera</b> <b>aperture</b> and shutter. This procedure entailed covering herself with a black lightproof sack, positioning {{a small piece of}} light-sensitive paper {{in the back of her}} mouth and then placing a gum-shield with a small pin-hole incision in front of it. In the moment of capture she closed her lips or placed a hand over her mouth to make the exposure before returning into the sack to develop the image. The resultant images from this project appear framed by her teeth, stained with saliva and tinged red by the blood within her cheeks.|$|E
50|$|The {{pinhole camera}} model {{describes}} the mathematical {{relationship between the}} coordinates of a point in three-dimensional space and its projection onto the image plane of an ideal pinhole camera, where the <b>camera</b> <b>aperture</b> {{is described as a}} point and no lenses are used to focus light. The model does not include,for example, geometric distortions or blurring of unfocused objects caused by lenses and finite sized apertures. It also {{does not take into account}} that most practical cameras have only discrete image coordinates. This means that the pinhole camera model can only be used as a first order approximation of the mapping from a 3D scene to a 2D image. Its validity depends on the quality of the camera and, in general, decreases from the center of the image to the edges as lens distortion effects increase.|$|E
5000|$|In 1932, in {{refining}} this ratio, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expanded {{upon this}} 1930 standard. The <b>camera</b> <b>aperture</b> became 22 mm by 16 mm (0.866 in by 0.630 in), and the projected image would use an aperture plate size of 0.825 by 0.600 in (21 by 15 mm), yielding an aspect ratio of 1.375:1. This {{became known as}} the [...] "Academy" [...] ratio, named so after them. Since the 1950s the aspect ratio of some theatrically released motion picture films has been 1.85:1 (1.66:1 in Europe) or 2.35:1 (2.40:1 after 1970). The image area for [...] "TV transmission" [...] is slightly smaller than the full [...] "Academy" [...] ratio at 21 mm by 16 mm (0.816 in by 0.612 in), an aspect ratio of 1.33:1.

5000|$|The {{negative}} film had the perforations (of the CS [...] "Fox-hole" [...] type) {{close to the}} edge of the film and the <b>camera</b> <b>aperture</b> was 1.824" [...] by 1.430" [...] (approx. 46 mm x 36 mm), giving an image area of 2.61 sq. inch. This compares to the 0.866" [...] by 0.732" [...] (approx. 22 mm x 18.6 mm) frame of a modern anamorphic 35 mm negative, which provides a frame area of 0.64 sq. inch.

Four of these soundtracks (two each side) were outside the perforations, which were further from the edges of the print film than in the {{negative film}}; the other two soundtracks were between the perforations and the image. The pull-down for the negative was 8 perforations, while for the smaller frame on the print film, it was 6 perforations. In both cases, however, the frame had an aspect ratio of 1.275:1, which when expanded by a 2:1 anamorphic lens resulted in an image of 2.55:1.|$|E
50|$|A {{video camera}} {{can be seen}} as an {{approximation}} of a pinhole camera, which means that each point in the image is illuminated by some (normally one) point in the scene in front of the camera, usually by means of light that the scene point reflects from a light source. Each visible point in the scene is projected along a straight line that passes through the <b>camera</b> <b>aperture</b> and intersects the image plane. This means that at a specific point in time, each point in the image refers to a specific point in the scene. This scene point has a position relative to the camera, and if this relative position changes, it corresponds to a relative motion in 3D. It is a relative motion since it does not matter if it is the scene point, or the camera, or both, that are moving. It is only when there is a change in the relative position that the camera is able to detect that some motion has happened. By projecting the relative 3D motion of all visible points back into the image, the result is the motion field, describing the apparent motion of each image point in terms of a magnitude and direction of velocity of that point in the image plane. A consequence of this observation is that if the relative 3D motion of some scene points are along their projection lines, the corresponding apparent motion is zero.|$|E
40|$|A simple optical {{technique}} for placing {{a record of}} the <b>camera</b> <b>aperture</b> and focus conditions on each photograph is described. A lens system is installed in a NASA/Hasselblad lunar surface camera so that a small image of the camera iris is formed {{in the corner of the}} photographic image field. The <b>camera</b> <b>aperture</b> and focus settings that were used in the taking of the photograph are determined from measurements of -the width and position of the data image. A Fortran IV computer program which uses the system calibration data and iterative techniques to determine the settings from the image measurements is used and described. The relatively simple system employed in this investigation was able to resolve <b>camera</b> <b>aperture</b> settings of half- stop increments in the range of f/ 56 to f/ 16. In addition to detecting the three calibrated focus settings of 5, 15, and 70 feet, the focus values of 3, 3. 5 k, and 8 feet also could be distinguished. Since the camera iris opening is imaged, a measure of the inherent iris variability is obtained during normal system calibration...|$|E
50|$|Light is {{most easily}} {{controlled}} {{through the use}} of the <b>camera's</b> <b>aperture</b> (measure in f-stops), {{but it can also be}} regulated by adjusting the shutter speed. Using faster or slower film is not usually something that can be done quickly, at least using roll film. Large format cameras use individual sheets of film and each sheet could be a different speed. Also, if you're using a larger format camera with a polaroid back, you can switch between backs containing different speed polaroids. Digital cameras can easily adjust the film speed they are simulating by adjusting the exposure index, and many digital cameras can do so automatically in response to exposure measurements.|$|R

5000|$|Emotional {{aperture}} {{has been}} defined as the ability or skill to perceive features of group emotions. Examples of features of group emotions include the level of variability of emotions among members (i.e., affective diversity), the proportion of positive or negative emotions, and the modal (i.e., most common) emotion present in a group. The term [...] "emotional aperture" [...] was first defined by the social psychologist, Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks and organizational theorist, Quy Huy. Analogous to adjusting a <b>camera's</b> <b>aperture</b> setting to increase depth of field, emotional aperture involves adjusting one's depth of field to bring into focus not solely the emotions of one person but also others scattered across a visual landscape. The difference between perceiving individual-level emotions versus group-level emotions is builds upon the distinction between analytic versus holistic perception.|$|R
