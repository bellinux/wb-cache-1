40|$|The {{relationship}} between copyright {{and freedom of}} expression has long been debated. Unlike the legal discourse in other jurisdictions, most notably the United States, where {{it is assumed that}} free speech and copyright do not collide, in Europe both rights have separate legal effect and are considered to be of equal importance. As a result, when an individual refers to the human right of free speech to hold and impart copyright protected material, it triggers the collision between the two rights. This paper highlights and explores these relationships between copyright and freedom of expression in Europe, offering an in-depth analysis of the human rights scope of copyright and free speech, as well as examining the circumstances under which each <b>conflicting</b> <b>right</b> should prevail...|$|E

Then I will describe Luigi Ferrajoli’s thesis about the absence, or at least the very marginal role of <b>conflicts</b> between fundamental <b>rights.</b> Conclusively, I will point to some possible critiques to the strategy elaborated by Ferrajoli {{in order to reduce the}} impact of <b>conflicts</b> between fundamental <b>rights...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is {{to build on the}} current debate on male {{circumcision}} and from the two perspectives, consequentialism and non-consequentialism, describe the <b>conflict</b> of <b>rights</b> that exists on the issue and outline a normative conclusion about whether Sweden should ban male circumcision of boys or not. The idea is to clarify how the two sides' approach to the <b>conflicting</b> <b>rights</b> differ on the issue. The perspectives intends to provide further clarity to the arguments and provide a framework to resolve the <b>rights</b> <b>conflict</b> by, which creates more favorable conditions to understand the moral bearing of the arguments in the debate. The survey is conducted as a debate analytical study, conducted by compiling and organizing the arguments for the various positions in the debate. Based on the two theories I conduct an critical analysis in which I examine {{the extent to which the}} arguments of each side lives up to the perspectives moral standards. The results show that the prohibition advocates is taking a consequentialistic instrumental entrance angle to the <b>rights</b> <b>conflict.</b> The instrumental entry angle is made clear by the fact that the desired outcome of the interpretation of rights seem to justify the use of them rather than the opposite. I judge it based on my inquiry that the ban opponents ascribe the rights, an inviolable value. My assessment of PTS possible bearing on the argument leads me to conclude that the non-consequentialistic entry angle on the <b>rights</b> <b>conflict</b> gives the anti-prohibitionists right in this case...|$|R

40|$|Whilst the {{adoption}} of commercial transgenic plant agriculture continues to spread globally, {{it is not necessarily}} indicative of universal support, and would appear to belie the inherent existential tensions and <b>conflicting</b> <b>rights</b> between transgenic, organic, and conventional plant agricultural systems. These tensions are typically vented via the inevitable adventitious presence of transgenes in non-transgenic crops, and the competing, and often conflicting scientific and acrimonious claims and counter-claims on the merits and proprieties of transgenic plant agriculture for the environment and public health. Nevertheless, the virtual irreversibility of transgenic plant agriculture, the exigencies of feeding the growing world population amidst continuing global food security scares, and the continuing dependency of livestock farming on transgenic plant feedstuff, especially in Europe, underscore the imperatives for mutual co-existence of all three forms of plant agricultural systems. Drawing on the socio-legal theory that risks and responsibility are correlatives, it is argued in the thesis that our “technological society” is also a “risk society”, and as it is for comparable “technologies of risk” in the post-industrial era, the regulatory framework for the co-existence of transgenic and non-transgenic plant agriculture, must of necessity, invoke corresponding responsibility in law for any consequential economic loss and damage to the environment and public health, in order balance and moderate the <b>conflicting</b> <b>rights</b> in the coexistence paradigm for transgenic and non-transgenic plant agriculture. Whilst drawing on relevant and analogous case law and legislations from the United Kingdom, the European Union and North America, the thesis defines the boundaries of inherent risks, responsibility and rights in the current coexistence paradigm for transgenic and non-transgenic plant agriculture, and proposes a modality for an effective sui generis compensation regime, {{as an integral part of}} the broader coexistence policy, on the grounds that such a regime could moderate <b>conflicting</b> <b>rights,</b> increase public acceptance, and build public confidence in transgenic plant technology, rather than hinder its continuing global growth and promise...|$|R

40|$|How {{is to be}} {{policy action}} guided in cases of <b>conflict</b> among basic <b>rights?</b> The clash among rights of equal {{standing}} within a society’s broad conception of justice is often articulated {{in the terms of}} unfairness. By drawing a distinction between justice and fairness, and by exploring the pragmatics of justification in cases of <b>conflicts</b> among <b>rights,</b> this chapter adumbrates a discourse-theoretic model of political judgment – what I name ‘critical deliberative judgment’. The parameters of this model emerge first from a particular reconstitution of Critical Theory (as a tradition of social philosophy) that focuses attention on the emancipation-oriented, rather than on the consensus-generating, dimension of rights: the question “What is justice?” gives precedence to “Who suffers?”. The model is further elaborated by way of a pragmatist political epistemology that accounts for the way specific experiences of injustice affect publics’ identification of what issues count as relevant ones in debates over <b>conflicting</b> <b>rights.</b> Finally, the model is completed with an account of the critical and emancipatory work democratic practices of open dialogue are able to perform, ultimately relating local sensitivities to universal demands of justice by disclosing the socio-structural (rather that agent-specific or culture-specific) sources of injustice...|$|R
