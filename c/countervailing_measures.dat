25|$|While {{popular with}} the electorate, Trudeau's promised minor reforms {{had little effect on}} the growing rate of inflation, and he {{struggled}} with conflicting advice on the crisis. In September 1975 the popular Finance Minister John Turner resigned over a perceived lack of support in <b>countervailing</b> <b>measures.</b> In October 1975, in an embarrassing about-face, Trudeau and new Finance Minister Donald Macdonald introduced wage and price controls by passing the Anti-Inflation Act. The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted a Supreme Court reference that only upheld the legislation as an emergency requiring Federal intervention under the British North America Act. During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with CTV, Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary. However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly neoliberal business leaders.|$|E

40|$|World Trade Organization (WTO) {{members have}} long {{expressed}} a norm concerning the trade remedies of countervailing (anti-subsidy) duties and antidumping duties: that these measures offset the behavior that {{gives rise to}} them, restoring trade to a level playing field. The WTO agreements provide that the duties imposed should be calculated accordingly, that <b>countervailing</b> duties are <b>measured</b> against subsidies and anti-dumping duties are measured against the excess of a benchmark normal value over export price. This paper makes two principle contributions {{in light of this}} norm. First, it develops formal models of antidumping and countervailing duty actions conforming to the offsetting duty norm. Economists have often shown little patience with the rationale for these duties, leading to a dearth of formal analysis that takes into account the social welfare functionthe offsetting duty normincorporated in the WTO agreements; the formal models here provide that analysis. Second, the paper extends this analysis to the simultaneous prosecution of countervailing and antidumping cases. Once rare, simultaneous countervailing and antidumping duty proceedings have become perhaps the most prominent expression of trade protection permitted under WTO rules. The analysis establishes the conditions to identify any overlap in the application of <b>countervailing</b> and antidumping <b>measures</b> and demonstrates that recent practice of WTO members has created excessive application of duties. The analysis also provides the methods for preventing this double-count in simultaneous cases. These results have direct application to current policy debates. ...|$|R

Trade liberalization in the 1980 s and 1990 s has strengthened import competition, but trade policies alone cannot create a competitive economic environment. Trade policy {{as an instrument of}} competition policy (limited as it has been) has been constrained by a disproportionate amount of nontraded goods, vertical integration, and distribution monopolies [...] and sometimes the use of antidumping, <b>countervailing,</b> and safeguard <b>measures.</b> Competition policies [...] such as antitrust laws, merger controls, and other regulatory measures [...] can prevent exclusionary practices, collusion among competitors, and the abuse of market power. Allowing foreign ownership and liberalized investment regimes will further enhance domestic competition by adding market presence. The authors contend that trade and competition policies must complement each other and that when they do, welfare improves. Tensions between the policy areas arise because of globalization, regional policies, technical barriers, certain kinds of industrial policy, and macroeconomic exigencies.

40|$|Latin American {{countries}} {{have not had}} much experience with competition policies in the past. Combined with restrictive trade policies, the absence of competition policies has often led to monopolized domestic markets. The strong trade liberalizations in Latin America during the 1980 s and the 1990 s have introduced a good measure of import competition, but trade policies alone are not sufficient to create a competitive environment in an economy. The presence of non-traded goods, vertical integration, monopolized distribution systems, the limited use of trade policies to foster competition, and sometimes the use of anti-dumping <b>measures,</b> <b>countervailing</b> duties, and safeguards as protective devices have constrained the effectiveness of trade policy {{as an instrument of}} competition policy. Competition policies, such as anti-trust, merger controls, and other regulatory means, can prevent the abuse of market power, dominance, exclusionary practices, and collusion among competitors. Domestic competition is further enhanced by foreign ownership and liberalized investment regimes. These latter provisions provide a market presence that enhances competition. This paper holds that trade and competition policies are essential complements and when they are used together they can lead to higher levels of welfare. There are of course tensions between these two policies that arise from globalization, regional policies, technical barriers, certain forms of industrial policies, and macroeconomic exigencies. Trade policy itself can be used for protection even without high tariffs or quantitative restrictions through anti- dumping <b>measures,</b> <b>countervailing</b> duties, and safeguard measures, that would limit, rather than promote, competition.

TTBs are more likely to be observed when imports are large. But, perhaps more interestingly, in sectors with low MFN tariffs and where MFN tariffs are falling, which suggest that MFN tariffs and TTBs are substitutes.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of powerful, big box retailers such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot has enhanced the interest among both academics and non-academics in {{the effects of}} countervailing power. One of the major concerns expressed by some commentators is that rising countervailing power will lead to poorer product selection for consumers. They believe that manufacturers of some product varieties {{will be forced to}} exit as their profit margins are squeezed by the power retailers. From the perspective of economic theory, however, it is not obvious that a retailer with countervailing power would have incentives to reduce the variety of products available to its customers. Indeed, so far there has been no formal analysis to determine whether such concern over product diversity is warranted. The existing theoretical analyses of countervailing power focus on the price effects, i. e., whether consumer prices will increase or decrease as a result of increased buyer {{power in the hands of}} retailers (von Ungern-Sternberg 1996, Dobson and Waterson 1997, Chen 2003). The objective of this paper is to analyse the effects of countervailing power on product diversity. In the model, product diversity is measured by the number of differentiated products sold by retailers in equilibrium. There are several retailers, but only one is large enough to possess countervailing power against the manufacturer(s). In the upstream market, I consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, there is a monopolist manufacturer who sets the number of product varieties to be produced. In the second scenario, products are supplied by monopolistically competitive firms, with each firm selling one variety. The focus of my analysis will be on how a rise in the large retailer's <b>countervailing</b> power, <b>measured</b> by its ability to capture a larger share of the joint profit, will affect the equilibrium number of varieties produced.

40|$|Trade remedy {{measures}} (TRMs) {{in international}} economic law refer to antidumping <b>measures,</b> <b>countervailing</b> duties and safeguard measures. They are designed to respond to unfair trade practices or to compensate the negative impact on domestic industries resulting from tariff concessions made under the trade liberalization arrangements. Due {{to the importance of}} these instruments, the rules on TRMs are strengthened in the WTO legal framework and established on non-discriminatory basis towards all WTO Members. However, with the proliferation of regional trade agreements (RTA) in recent decades, it was noticed that, most RTAs adopted innovative approaches on TRMs among their regional partners. Such incoherence has brought a series of trade disputes and arguments concerning the conflicts between the WTO and RTA. Current central issues in this area are whether those innovative TRMs are consistent with WTO law and what is the appropriate approach to examine the legality of those measures. Against the canvas of WTO trade remedy rules, this research first investigates the diversified trade remedy approaches in RTAs and their impact on international trade. It then clarifies the ambiguous legal criteria against which TRMs in RTAs should be judged in order to be WTO-consistent. Thereafter, a methodology through which a RTA-specific TRM could be tested against the WTO’s criteria is also developed. It is argued that facilitating TRMs in RTAs must always adhere to the criteria laid down by the WTO, e. g. GATT Article XXIV. In particular, a “necessity test” should be applied when examining the legality of a special TRM in RTAs, in the case where a dispute arises between the RTA members and third countries on the issue. In order to bring the RTA-specific TRMs into compliance with WTO law, this research also looks at the WTO surveillance mechanism on RTAs. Considering a number of difficulties that have arisen in the GATT/WTO’s surveillance of RTAs in the past, the thesis addresses what positive measures can be taken in the future and whether TRMs in RTAs should be scrutinized by WTO political organs or through the dispute settlement mechanism...|$|R
