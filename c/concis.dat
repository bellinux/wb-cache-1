In this article, {{we first}} introduce {{a notion of}} a quadratic residue curve mod $D$, and study quadratic residue <b>concis</b> $C$ mod an irreducible quartic curve $Q$.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a web application for the detailed analysis and visualization of evolutionary sequence conservation in complex vertebrate genes. Given a pair of orthologous genes, the protein-coding sequences are aligned. When these sequences are mapped back onto their encoding exons in the genomes, a scaffold of the conserved gene structure naturally emerges. Sequence similarity between exons and introns is analysed and embedded into the gene structure scaffold. The visualization on the SVC server provides detailed information about evolutionarily conserved features of these genes. It further allows <b>concis...</b>|$|E
40|$|In work by Ausoni, Dundas and Rognes a half {{magnetic}} monopole is discovered and describes an obstruction {{to creating a}} determinant K(ku) → ku*. In fact it is an obstruction to creating a determinant gerbe map from K(ku) to K(Z, 3). We describe this obstruction precisely using monoidal categories and define the notion of oriented 2 -vector bundles, which removes this obstruction {{so that we can}} define a determinant gerbe. We also generalize Brylinskis notion of a connective structure to 2 -vector bundles, in a way compatible with the determinant gerbe.

40|$|Let (M^n,g) be a Riemannian spin manifold. The basic {{equations}} in supergravity {{models of}} type IIa string theory with 4 -form flux involve a 3 -form T, a 4 -form F, a spinorial covariant derivative ∇ depending on ∇^g, T, F, and a ∇-parallel spinor field Ψ. We classify and construct many explicit families of solutions to {{this system of}} spinorial field equations by means of non-integrable special geometries. The latter include α-Sasakian structures in dimensions 5 and 7, almost Hermitian structures in dimension 6 and cocalibrated G_ 2 -structures in dimension 7. We show that there are several examples also satisfying an additional constraint for the energy-momentum tensor. Comment: 28 pages; revised, more <b>concis...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{describe}} a collective coordinate {{approach to the}} study of giant graviton states and their excitations in various field theories. The method simplifies considerably the understanding of emergent gauge symmetry of these configurations, as well as the calculation of the spectrum of strings stretched between the giant gravitons. There is a limit where these results reproduce the one loop dispersion relation for giant magnons. I also show that this method gives rise to a simple geometric interpretation of a Higgs mechanism for the emergent gauge symmetry which parallels the holographic dual realization of these sates: the effective Higgs condensate is the geometric separation of D-branes in the collective coordinate geometry.

40|$|The p-Ge THz laser {{with flat}} {{external}} cavity mirrors exhibits strong intensity modulations at frequencies in the 8 - 80 MHz range, resulting from beating of transverse modes. A theoretical {{description of the}} mode structure of this cavity is given. Results compare well with experimental data on beat frequencies and far field beam profiles. A cavity with a back mirror reduced to about 70 % of the end face surface is found to leads to an effective suppression of the mode beatings. A strongly improved pulse to pulse stability of the output and a much better far field beam shape is observed. Introduction. The p-Ge laser provides THz emission in the of 70 - 200 µm wavelength range [1]. In order to achieve maximum output power and a good beam profile, we use a metal mesh as output coupler [2]. This however is found to cause strong fluctuations in the output power, resulting from the beating of transverse modes in the cavity. We give a <b>concis...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the Thompson-Stein group F(n_ 1, [...] .,n_k) for integers n_ 1, [...] .,n_k and k greater than 1. We highlight several {{differences between the}} cases k= 1 $ and k> 1, {{including the fact that}} minimal tree-pair diagram representatives of elements may not be unique when k> 1. We establish how to find minimal tree-pair diagram representatives of elements of F(n_ 1, [...] .,n_k), and we prove several theorems describing the equivalence of trees and tree-pair diagrams. We introduce a unique normal form for elements of F(n_ 1, [...] .,n_k) (with respect to the standard infinite generating set developed by Melanie Stein) which provides a solution to the word problem, and we give sharp upper and lower bounds on the metric with respect to the standard finite generating set, showing that in the case k> 1, the metric is not quasi-isometric to the number of leaves or caret in the minimal tree-pair diagram, as is the case when k= 1.

40|$|The Foundation for Jewish Camping is {{the central}} address for {{information}} about, and advocacy for, non-profit Jewish overnight camps, providing leadership, expertise and financial resources to camps, campers and their families across North America. Created in 1998 by {{a husband and wife}} team of philanthropists, Robert Bildner and Elisa Spungen Bildner provided seed money to launch the first public foundation dedicated solely to the Jewish overnight camp movement. FJC serves more than 130 Jewish summer camps, 60, 000 campers and 12, 000 counselors in North America and has moved the importance of the Jewish summer camp experience to the forefront of the North American Jewish community’s agenda. It is our mission {{to increase the number of}} Jewish children attending Jewish summer camps. Over the next five years we aim to triple our investment in Jewish camping by fulfilling our compelling vision of systemic change for the field. From bunk counselor to top leadership, camp professionals need to be supported with training and development. The Cornerstone Fellowship the Executive Leadership Institute are signature programs that nurture leadership skills and teach professionals to usher Judaism into camp life in fresh, meaningful ways.

40|$|For {{many years}} architects have been {{designing}} buildings {{by looking at}} other architects’ designs and work. Architectural styles have been present for many millenniums and have developed throughout these years. Architects extract the most elegant features of other people’s design and implement it in theirs. Architects have had many challenging tasks, and still do, as they are demanded to design buildings for {{different areas of the}} world. Say for example a group of architects have been asked to design the same building in two different countries. The tectonics are different if you wish to construct a building in an area where there is a likely chance of an earthquake occurring (e. g. California, USA) than you would if you are constructing that same building in an area where earthquakes do not occur (e. g. Spain). Recent research from many universities suggests that elastomeric materials could be used in the foundations of buildings. This rubbery material can absorb a certain percentage of the vibrations from the earthquake and could stop the buildings from being demolished. As the details of how the building will be constructed in these two different countries are different, the main design details are the same. These details can be captured {{so that they can be}} conveyed to the stakeholders in a clear and <b>concis...</b>|$|E
40|$|On a (pseudo-) Riemannian {{manifold}} (M,g), some {{fields of}} endomorphisms i. e. sections of End(TM) may be parallel for g. They form an associative algebra A, {{which is also}} the commutant of the holonomy group of g. As any associative algebra, A is the sum of its radical and of a semi-simple algebra S. We show in arXiv: 1402. 6642 that S may be of eight different types, including the generic type S=R. Id, and the Kähler and hyperkähler types where S is respectively isomorphic to the complex field C or to the quaternions H. We show here that for any self adjoint nilpotent element N of the commutant of such an S in End(TM), the set of germs of metrics such that A contains S and N is non-empty. We parametrise it. Generically, the holonomy algebra of those metrics is the full commutant of S∪{N} in O(g). Apart from some "degenerate" cases, the algebra A is then S ⊕ (N), where (N) is the ideal spanned by N. To prove it, we introduce an analogy with complex Differential Calculus, the ring R[X]/(X^n) replacing the field C. This describes totally the local situation when the radical of A is principal and consists of self adjoint elements. We add a glimpse on the case where this radical is not principal.
