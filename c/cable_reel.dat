50|$|Initially, {{electric}} locomotives were used only {{where it was}} economical to string overhead line for power. This limited their usage for gathering loads at the mine face, where trackage was temporary and frequently relocated. This motivated the development of battery locomotives, but {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century the first successful electric gathering locomotives used <b>cable</b> <b>reels.</b> To run on tracks away from overhead lines, the power cable was clipped to the overhead line and then automatically unreeled as the locomotive advanced and reeled up as the locomotive returned.|$|R
5000|$|She {{said that}} her art-making {{materials}} [...] "need to have been open to the weather." [...] She thus used mostly found materials: wood, iron, wire, feathers, and yellow and orange retro-reflective road signs, which flash and glow in the light. Some of her other best-known works use faded, once-bright drinks crates; thinly-sliced yellow Schweppes boxes; ragged domestic items such as torn floral lino and patchy enamelware; vernacular building materials such as galvanised tin, corrugated iron and masonite; and fibrous, rosy <b>cable</b> <b>reel</b> ends. These objects represent, rather than accurately depict, elements of her world. [...] "The countryside's discards ... no longer suggest themselves but evoke experiences, particularly of landscape." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{distance}} of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure {{the rotation of the}} spool drum for the retracting <b>cable</b> <b>reel,</b> and calculating how far the cable is extended. Through the ball joint and guide arm, the mechanism functions in a similar fashion as a gamepad analog stick to determine the angular direction from the mechanism to the track element. From the distance and angle data, a three-dimensional position for the element is resolved. The predetermined spacing and orientation of the mechanisms on the base unit allows the coordinate data gathered by the two mechanisms to be converted into positions in a unified space. According to In2Games, the mechanisms can determine position [...] "to an accuracy of 1 millimetre anywhere within a 3m cube around the unit, with no processor overhead or time delay." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of attachment, a {{hydraulic}} function consists of a valve on the forklift with a lever near the operator that provides two passages of pressurized hydraulic oil to power the attachment features. Sometimes an attachment has more features than your forklift has hydraulic functions and one or more need to be added. There are many ways of adding hydraulic functions (also known as adding a valve). The forklift manufacturer makes valves and hose routing accessories, but the parts and labor to install can be prohibitively expensive. Other ways include adding a solenoid valve {{in conjunction with a}} hose or <b>cable</b> <b>reel</b> that diverts oil flow from an existing function. However, hose and cable reels can block the operator's view and are problematic, easily damaged. The Ditto Valve kit uses a solenoid valve and special HydWire hoses, in which the wire reinforcing braid doubles as an electrical conduit. These hoses replace those already on the forklift, nesting in the original reeving, keeping it safe from damage and out of the operators field of vision.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} Type 912 degaussing/deperming ship {{can be traced}} {{all the way back}} to Sea Fish (Hai-Yu or Haiyu, 海鱼) 16 class, which is a class of degaussing/deperming ship {{converted}} from US Landing ship, infantry (Large), or LSIL for short. Molded after Soviet SR barges, these converted degaussing/deperming ships carried sixty KSM-type accumulator batteries providing ten-volt external and a hundred ten-volt or two hundred twenty-volt for internal coils and <b>cable</b> <b>reels</b> for two hundred forty-millimeter diameter cables. Additional equipment needed for degaussing/deperming duties such as magnetometer to measure horizontal and vertical magnetic field is also carried on board.|$|R
5000|$|A run to be {{inspected}} {{will either}} start from an access pipe leading {{at an angle}} down to the sewer and then run downstream to a manhole, or will run between manholes.The service truck is parked above the access point of the pipe. The camera tractor, with a flexible cable attached to the rear, is then lowered into the pipeline. The tractor is moved forward {{so that it is}} barely inside of the pipeline. A [...] "down-hole roller" [...] is set up between the camera tractor and the <b>cable</b> <b>reel</b> in the service truck, preventing cable damage from rubbing the top of the pipeline. The operator then retires {{to the inside of the}} truck and begins the inspection, remotely operating the camera tractor from the truck. When the inspection is complete or the camera cable is fully extended, the camera tractor is put in reverse gear and the cable is wound up simultaneously. When the camera tractor is near the original access point, the downhole roller is pulled up and the camera tractor is moved into the access point and pulled up to the service truck. A tractor may be used to inspect a complete blockage or collapse that would prevent using a fish and rope as described below.|$|E
5000|$|The Mk 6 {{mine was}} a 34 in {{diameter}} steel sphere containing a buoyancy chamber and 300 lb of TNT. [...] Each mine was constructed of two steel hemispheres welded together. A Toxyl bursting charge was cast {{into the lower}} hemisphere. Toxyl {{was a mixture of}} 60% trinitroxylene (TNX) with 40% TNT used because the United States Army controlled United States TNT production and would not release sufficient quantities for the naval mine barrage. [...] For transport, the mine rested atop a box-shaped steel anchor approximately 30 in square. The anchor box had wheels allowing the mine assembly to be moved along a system of rails aboard the minelayer. The mine was connected to its 800 lb anchor box by a wire rope mooring cable stored on a reel. [...] The depth of the mine below the water surface was controlled by allowing the steel mooring cable to unwind from its reel as the mine was dropped from the minelayer until a sensor suspended beneath the anchor reached the bottom. The sensor locked the <b>cable</b> <b>reel</b> so the falling anchor would pull the buoyant mine below the surface; and the float extended the antenna above the mine. [...] Each mine had two hydrostatic safety features intended to render the mine safe if it detached from its mooring cable and floated to the surface. The first was an open switch in the detonation circuit closed by hydrostatic pressure. The second was a spring pushing the detonator away from the explosive charge into the buoyancy chamber unless compressed by hydrostatic pressure. The mines were intended to be safe at depths less than 25 ft.|$|E

40|$|Overheating of {{electric}} cables on shuttle cars {{has long been}} recognized {{as a cause of}} premature insulation failure leading to shock and electrocution. Use of <b>cable</b> <b>reels</b> on shuttle cars can cause excessive heat build up which, in turn, causes the cable insulation to soften and become easily damaged This heat-softened insulation reduces the life of the cable. Repeated cycling of a cable in this manner can cause premature aging of the insulation; it becomes bridle, cracks and allows electrical leakage paths to farm. These leakage paths provide the opportunity for shock and electrocution to occur if miners come in contact with the damaged section of cable. It is imperative that cable operating temperatures be maintained at safe thermal limits. This paper discusses a research project conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Center to determine dynamically the conductor temperature of <b>reeled</b> shuttle car <b>cables</b> using fiber optics technology. The research portrays typical shuttle car loading cycles (both current and time cycles). Root-mean-square current loading is calculated based on the results. The thrust of this effort is to provide the scientific basis for ampacity derating factors specifically for mine machinery using <b>reeled</b> <b>cables</b> This information will reduce the probability {{of electric}}al hazards from <b>reeled</b> <b>cable...</b>|$|R
