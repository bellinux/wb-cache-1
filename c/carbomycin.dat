In an S- 30 extract containing both 70 S chloroplast and 80 S cytoplasmic ribosomes, low concentrations of Mg++ and spermidine favored 80 S ribosome activity, and high concentrations activated 70 S ribosomes and reversibly inactivated the 80 S component. Under conditions favoring chloroplast ribosome activity, <b>carbomycin</b> inhibited incorporation by an S- 30 extract, and by purified 70 S ribosomes from wild-type but not from car cells.

Insects exposed to healthy plants whose roots were immersed in chlortetracycline were able to acquire AY agent from diseased plants the day after removal from the antibiotic-treated plants, but the latent period of the ensuing disease in the insects was prolonged. Chlortetracycline or tylosin tartrate blocked AY infection in nymphs injected with a mixture of antibiotic and the AY agent, but polymyxin, neomycin, vancomycin, penicillin, <b>carbomycin,</b> or chloramphenicol did not. All tetracyclines tested, methacycline, oxytetracycline, and chlortetracycline, produced a dramatic reduction in the ability of infected vectors to transmit AY agent. Tylosin tartrate also reduced transmission when injected into AY-transmitting vectors, but <b>carbomycin,</b> spectinomycin, cycloserine, penicillin, erythromycin, or kanamycin had no such effect.

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} suggesting that 23 S rRNA is {{directly involved in the}} peptide bond formation usually performed on the ribosome. Although several reports have indicated that the eubacterial peptidyltransferase reaction does not necessarily require all the ribosomal proteins, the reconstitution of peptidyltransferase activity by a naked 23 S rRNA without the help of any of the ribosomal proteins has not been reported previously. It is demonstrated that an E. coli 23 S rRNA transcript synthesized by T 7 RNA polymerase in vitro was able to promote peptide bond formation in the presence of 0. 5 % SDS. The reaction was inhibited by the peptidyltransferase-specific antibiotics chloramphenicol and <b>carbomycin,</b> and by digestion with RNases A and T 1. Site-directed mutageneses at two highly conserved regions close to the peptidyltransferase center ring, G 2252 to U 2252 and C 2507 G 2581 to U 2507 A 2581, also suppressed peptide bond formation.

40|$|Studies on {{erythromycin}} {{resistance in}} strains of group A streptococci {{indicated that they}} were comprised of two types: (i) an inducible, resistant type (IR strains) was seen, which manifested immediate logarithmic growth in media containing high concentrations of the drug only after brief previous exposure (induction period) of the organisms to subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin, and (ii) a constitutive, resistant type (CR strains) which demonstrated, without prior drug exposure, continued logarithmic growth in media containing high concentrations of erythromycin. Subinhibitory concentrations of either chloramphenicol or puromycin, when added to IR strains prior to induction, interfered with their induction by erythromycin. Exposure of CR strains to chloramphenicol did not visibly affect the subsequent growth curve of these strains in media containing high concentrations of erythromycin. In IR strains, resistance to other macrolide antibiotics (oleandomycin, spiramycin, <b>carbomycin,</b> magnamycin) and to lincomycin also was inducible in nature. There was cross-inducibility between erythromycin, other macrolide antibiotics, and lincomycin. CR strains were constitutively resistant to these antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Phylogenetic {{differences}} between the mitochondrial protein synthesising systems of yeast and that of higher organisms have been studied using as probes a variety of antibiotics known to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. While most of the experiments were performed on mammalian mitochondria (rat liver, kidney, heart and brain) some characteristics of trout liver, chick brain, potato, sweet potato and corn root mitochondria were also investigated. It was confirmed that intact and sonicated mitochondria from several rat tissues all had a restricted antibiotic sensitivity spectrum in comparison to that of yeast mitochondria, being resistant to the 50 S acting antibiotics erythromycin, oleandomycin, vernamycin B and virideogrisein and to paromomycin, neomycin, spectinomycin and kasugamycin, which are 30 S binding antibiotics. Protein synthesis by rat liver mitochondria {{was found to be}} inhibited by chloramphenicol, <b>carbomycin,</b> spiramycin, mikamycin complex, vernamycin A, thiostrepton and sparsomycin - all of which inhibit reactions of the large subunit of bacterial ribosomes - and also by pactamycin, which affects the smaller subunit. In view of a report which appeared early in the course of these experiments that the phylogenetic difference in sensitivity to erythromycin and lincomycin results from a selective permeability barrier to these antibiotics in rat liver mitochondria, an extensive study was made of the effects of erythromycin, lincomycin and paromomycin under a variety of experimental conditions designed to overcome any permeability barrier. This included an intensive study of the access of antibiotics to the mitochondrial matrix based on the observation that high concentrations of paromomycin inhibited respiration by fragmented mitochondria but not that by intact mitochondria. When the effects of the three antibiotics on mitochondrial protein synthesis were measured under a variety of conditions (several different hypotonic swelling and digitonin treatment procedures, including conditions under which paromomycin at least could be demonstrated to have access to the mitochondrial matrix) none of the antibiotics inhibited 14 C-leucine incorporation when the antibiotic concentration was less than 250 ~g/ml and when incorporation depended on exogenously supplied ATP. Definitive proof of the access of erythromycin and lincomycin to the mitochondrial ribosome under conditions of protein synthesis was achived by showing that these two antibiotics competed with other antibiotics for binding sites on the mitochondrial ribosome. Both erythromycin and lincomycin reduced the level of inhibition of 14 c-leucine incorporation obtained with any given concentration of either <b>carbomycin</b> or vernamycin A without themselves inhibiting protein synthesis, demonstrating that erythromycin and lincomycin can bind to the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome in a manner which excludes simultaneous binding of <b>carbomycin</b> or vernamycin A. The binding of erythromycin and <b>carbomycin</b> was competitive and reversible, depending on the relative concentrations of the two drugs but being independent of the order in which they were added. Extension of the antibiotic sensitivity studies to other than mammalian mitochondria showed that protein synthesis by mitochondria from a variety of higher organisms was inhibited by a similarly restricted range of antibiotics. There is thus a very clear and strong case for the existence of phylogenetic {{differences between}} the mitochondria of higher organisms and the lower eukaryotes (as represented by yeast). Another aspect of mitochondrial function studied was the ability of the membrane to influence the activity of the ribosome. The possibility of ribosome-membrane interactions in mitochondria and the physical association of the mitochondrial ribosome with the membrane was raised by investigators studying mitochondriogenesis in this laboratory. Evidence identifying the majority of mitochondrial ribosomes as being membrane-bound has been obtained by studying the effects of temperature on the kinetics of 14 c-leucine incorporation. Initial studies using cytoplasmic ribosomes as a model system showed that the kinetics of protein synthesis by membrane-bound ribosomes (rough endoplasmic reticulum) gave non-linear Arrhenius plots, with a marked discontinuity at a characteristic temperature (22 °), below which a second and higher Arrhenius activation energy was found. This is not a characteristic of all ribosomes, as free ribosomes obeyed the predictions of the Arrhenius equation and gave a simple linear plot. The importance of the membrane-ribosome association in the genesis of the discontinuity was demonstrated in "reconstitution" experiments. Studies on the effects of temperature on the kinetics of mitochondrial protein synthesis revealed Arrhenius plots similar to those for rough endoplasmic reticulum, with a discontinuity at a characteristic temperature for a poikilotherm (rat liver: 23 °) and for temperature sensitive plants (sweet potato, corn: 10 - 13 °) but not for the temperature insensitive potato. These results correlate with the nature of the membrane lipids, and it is therefore concluded that the mitochondrial ribosome is in association with the inner mitochondrial membrane in a manner analogous to the association of the ribosomes and membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum...|$|E

The inactivation can be detected through the loss of biological activity or by alteration in the chromatographic mobility of the antibiotic.

40|$|The {{macrolide}} antibiotic tylosin {{has been}} used extensively in veterinary medicine and exerts potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Tylosin-synthesizing strains of the Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces fradiae protect themselves from their own product by differential expression of four resistance determinants, tlrA, tlrB, tlrC, and tlrD. The tlrB and tlrD genes encode methyltransferases that add single methyl groups at 23 S rRNA nucleotides G 748 and A 2058, respectively. Here we show that methylation by neither TlrB nor TlrD is sufficient on its own to give tylosin resistance, and resistance is conferred by the G 748 and A 2058 methylations acting together in synergy. This synergistic mechanism of resistance is specific for the macrolides tylosin and mycinamycin that possess sugars extending from the 5 - and 14 -positions of the macrolactone ring and is not observed for macrolides, such as <b>carbomycin,</b> spiramycin, and erythromycin, that have different constellations of sugars.

The three Rh antibodies, anti-C, anti-D, and anti-E, were tested with the same carbohydrates, D- and L-glucose, D- and L-mannose, D-ribose, and L-lyxose. The antibodies were also tested with antibiotics which included streptomycin, stylomycin, <b>carbomycin,</b> and two degradation products of the first two, streptobiosamine and 6 -dimethyl-amino- 9 -(3 'amino- 31 deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl) -purine. Some of the above carbohydrates and streptobiosamine were coupled with aniline and p-aminophenol, and then tested as inhibitors. 5 'adenylic acid and 2 ', 3 'adenylic acid were also tested as inhibitors. Their reactions suggested the use of indol acetic acid and indol butyric acid. Two amino acids, tyrosine and phenylalanine, were tested. In addition, paminophenyl acetic acid and salicin were also used as inhibitors. [TRUNCATED...|$|E
40|$|Production of the {{macrolide}} antibiotic, tylosin, occurs by {{a combination}} of polyketide synthesis and deoxyhexose sugar metabolism in S. fradiae. Polyketide synthesis was stimulated by glycosylated tylosin-precursors, and by tylosin itself, in an S. fradiae strain disrupted in the glycosyltransferase responsible for the addition of mycaminose. The addition of mycaminose is the essential first step in the conversation of the polyketide ring, tylactone, to tylosin. In the absence of glycosylated material, the strain disrupted in mycaminose addition produced no significant amounts of any tylosin precursor. The possibility that this effect might have been the result of downstream effects on a gene, ccr, thought to be involved in polyketide synthesis was refuted by analysis of a strain disrupted in ccr. The behaviour of strains disrupted in orf 1 *, putatively encoding an isomerase and in tylMI, encoding a methyltransferase involved in mycaminose synthesis were also analysed. orf 1 * was revealed to contain an authentic mycaminose-specific gene, designated tylMIII. Both these disrupted strains and the tylB mutant, altered in an aminotransferase gene also required for mycaminose synthesis but located over 45 kb from its functional counterparts, behaved similarly to the mycaminosyltransferase disrupted strain with respect to stimulation of polyketide synthesis. The stimulation of polyketide synthesis was shown to be a catalytic effect which could also be provoked by other glycosylated macrolides, rosaramicin and spiramycin but not by erythromycin, <b>carbomycin</b> or chalcomycin. The possible involvement of recently discovered regulatory genes associated with the tylosin biosynthetic cluster was investigated and interesting preliminary data were obtained...|$|E
40|$|A meiotic {{segregant}} (oliPR 1) {{was isolated}} with a phenotype of multiple cross resistance and collateral sensitivity. Strain oliPR 1 has increased sensitivity to ethidium bromide, dequalinium chloride, acriflavin, paromomycin and neomycin, and increased resistance to oligomycin, rutamycin, venturicidin, triethyltin bromide, antimycin, carbonylcynamide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, tetra-N-butylammonium bromide, dibenzyldimethylammonium chloride, triphenylmethylphosphonium bromide, chloramphenicol, <b>carbomycin,</b> tetracycline, triton-X- 165 and cycloheximide. Single gene inheritance {{of the cross}} resistance and collateral sensitivity was shown by 2 : 2 parental ditype segregation and reversion of the complete phenotype by a spontaneous revertant. The locus conferring the oliPR 1 phenotype was mapped 11. 7 units from an unspecified centromere. Antibiotic resistance showed incomplete dominance, {{with the level of}} hybrid resistance dependent upon the inhibitor tested. Resistant diploids that produced four resistant ascospores were the result of mitotic recombination prior to meiosis. A partial revertant phenotype (sensitive to all inhibitors except oligomycin, antimycin and carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone) was shown to be due to a single nuclear gene causing partial suppression of oliPR 1. Anaerobic pretreatment, 37 ° and 0. 5 M KCl were observed to reduce the growth of oliPR 1 when challenged with seven diverse inhibitors (antimycin, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone,-chloramphenicol, cycloheximide, oligomycin, triethyltin bromide, and triphenylmethylphosphonium bromide). Resistance to cycloheximide was not altered by the [rho—] state. A revertant of oliPR 1 (sensitive to the above inhibitors but resistant to ethidium bromide, paromycin and neomycin) showed anaerobic and temperature sensitization to ethidium bromide, paromomycin and neomycin. Continuous monitoring of oxygen uptake by the revertant after anaerobic pretreatment revealed that anaerobiosis sensitized respiratory adaptation of the revertant to neomycin. It is proposed that oliPR 1 is a mutation resulting in the alteration of plasma membrane premeability to many diverse inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotics {{were used}} as probes of {{ribosome}} topology and function. Studies of [14 C]chloramphenicol and [14 C]erythromycin binding to ribosomes and polyribosomes revealed the following features. The requirement of high K+ concentration (150 mM) for [14 C]chloramphenicol binding to NH 4 Cl-washed ribosomes resulted from the washing procedure. Neither native 70 S ribosomes nor polyribosomes require K+ greater than 30 mM for [14 C]chloramphenicol binding. Whereas [14 C]chloramphenicol binds to both ribosomes and polyribosomes, [14 C]erythromycin binds essentially only to ribosomes. After removal of peptidyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) from polyribosomes, [14 C]erythromycin could then be bound. The effects {{of a number of}} antibiotics on [14 C]chloramphenicol binding to ribosomes and polyribosomes was assessed. It was found that most of the macrolides (erythromycin, <b>carbomycin,</b> spiramycin III, niddamycin, oleandomycin, and tylosin) and streptogramins A and B (vernamycin A, PA 114 A, vernamycin Bα, and PA 114 B) inhibited chloramphenicol binding to NH 4 Cl-washed and native 70 S ribosomes, but not to polyribosomes. After removal of peptidyl-tRNA from polyribosomes, [14 C]chloramphenicol binding was then inhibited. In contrast, sparsomycin and althiomycin inhibited chloram-phenicol binding to polyribosomes, but not to ribosomes. After removal of peptidyl-tRNA from polyribosomes, sparsomycin and althiomycin were then ineffective. The presence of peptidyl-tRNA on polyribosomes apparently is required for binding of sparsomycin and althiomycin, but prevents binding of most macrolides and streptogramins. The lincosaminides (lincomycin and celesticetin) and methymycin (a small macrolide) inhibited [14 C]chloramphenicol binding to NH 4 Cl-washed and native 70 S ribosomes best, but also inhibited the binding to polyribosomes. The amino nucleosides and other antibiotics tested do not seem to interact strongly with the major chloramphenicol-binding site. These results provide knowledge of the interrelationships between antibiotic and substrate ribosome binding sites which should eventually contribute to a map of ribosomal topology...|$|E
