As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and <b>corn</b> <b>on</b> the cob.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Americans had {{inherited}} a hearty drinking tradition. Many types of alcohol were consumed.

25|$|On December 1, 1598, Juan de Zaldívar, Oñate's nephew, reached Acoma with 20–30 men and peacefully traded {{with them}} and had to wait some days for their order of ground <b>corn.</b> <b>On</b> December 4th, Zaldívar went with 16 armored men to Acoma {{to find out about}} the corn. Zutacapan met them and {{directed}} them to the homes with the corn. Zaldívar's people then divided into groups to collect the corn. The traditional oral Acoma narrative tells that a group attacked some Acoma women leading Acoma warriors to retaliate. The Spanish documents do not report an attack on the women and say that the division of the men was a reaction to Zutacapan's plan to kill Zaldívar's party. The Acoma killed 12 of the Spaniards including Zaldívar. Five men escaped although one died from jumping over the citadel leaving four to escape with the remaining camp.|$|E

500|$|The Portuguese {{encouraged}} intermarriage {{with the}} local population, and strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church. They converted nearly 10,000 natives to Christianity in Bassein, Thane, and neighbouring places. They started the Inquisition in India in 1560. These people were referred as [...] "Portuguese Christians". Later, [...] named themselves as the East Indian Catholics (after the British East India Company) during the British regime because Goan and Mangalorean Catholic settlers in Bombay were {{also referred to as}} [...] "Portuguese Christians" [...] by British. After António Pessoa's death in 1571, a patent was issued which granted Mazagaon in perpetuity to the Sousa e Lima family. The St. Andrew Church at Bandra was built in 1575 by the Portuguese Jesuits. The union of the crowns of Portugal and Spain in 1580–1640 opened the way for other European powers to follow the spice routes to India. The Dutch arrived first, closely followed by the British. The Portuguese also built several fortifications around the city. The Madh Fort was one of their most important constructions in Salsette. The first English merchants arrived in Bombay in November 1583, and travelled through Bassein and Thana. A prominent merchant among them was Ralph Fitch from London. They mentioned that Bassein and Thana were trading in rice and <b>corn</b> <b>on</b> a small scale. They arrived in Chaul on 10 November 1583. During this time, Bombay's main trade was coconuts and coir. The Portuguese Franciscans had obtained practical control of Salsette and Mahim by 1585, and built Nossa Senhora do Bom Conselho (Our Lady of Good Advice, affiliated to igreja de São Miguel / St. Michael's Church in 1596) at Sion and Nossa Senhora da Salvação (Our Lady of Salvation, popularly referred as [...] "Portuguese Church") at Dadar in 1596. The immense natural advantages of Bombay aroused the cupidity of the English who recognized its value as a naval base. In November 1612, the British fought the Battle of Swally with the Portuguese at Surat for the possession of Bombay. The British emerged victorious in the battle, and the Portuguese defeat was a significant event in marking {{the beginning of the end}} of their commercial monopoly over western India. Later, the British burnt the manor house built by Garcia de Orta in 1626. Dorabji Nanabhoy, a Gujarati trader, was the first Parsi to settle in Bombay in 1640. The Parsis immensely contributed towards the future development of Bombay during the British period. In 1640, the Portuguese built Castella da Aguada (Fort of the Waterpoint) at Bandra, as a watchtower overlooking the Mahim Bay, the Arabian Sea and the southern island of Mahim. It was armed with seven cannons and other smaller guns as defence.|$|E
