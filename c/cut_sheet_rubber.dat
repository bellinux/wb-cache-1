50|$|Snips, {{also known}} as shears, are hand tools used to <b>cut</b> <b>sheet</b> metal and other tough webs.

40|$|Lipids {{of fresh}} latex from three Hevea brasiliensis clones (RRIM 600, BPM 24, and PB 235), and of <b>sheet</b> <b>rubber</b> {{produced}} from it, were extracted by an optimized method and characterized through various chromatography techniques. Total and free fatty acids, phospholipids, glycolipids, and the unsaponifiable fraction were analyzed for each clone. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of total extractable lipids indicated a smaller amount in <b>sheet</b> <b>rubber</b> (2. 31 - 3. 28 %?w/w dry rubber) than in fresh latex (3. 36 - 3. 67 %). Partial hydrolysis during primary rubber processing, such as polar lipids, {{was found to}} be the main source of this loss. Alongside the effect of primary processing, the clonal origin of the trees {{was found to be}} the main factor for differences in lipid quantity and composition. Practical applications: Lipids are the main non-isoprene components in natural rubber (NR) and play many important roles in NR properties. Detailed knowledge of the lipid composition would contribute towards {{a better understanding of the}} structural and physical properties of NR. The lipid composition also appears to be sufficiently specific to consider its use as a new tool for tracing the clonal origin of NR. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

50|$|Backing {{materials}} {{first arrived}} {{in the form of}} nylon sheeting applied {{to one side of the}} neoprene. This allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the tough nylon took most of the strain of pulling on the suit, but the suit still had the black <b>sheet</b> <b>rubber</b> exposed on the outside and the nylon was very stiff and rigid, limiting flexibility. A small strip reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck, wrists, and ankles.|$|R

40|$|Moisture {{content is}} an {{important}} trait for <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet</b> trading system. Therefore, a calibration equation for predicting moisture content was created by near infrared (NIR) technique {{in order to develop}} a more fair trading system in Thailand. Spectra were recorded in two systems. One was measurement on each <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet</b> and the other was on a pile of sheets. Both were measured by a handheld NIR spectrometer in the short wavelength region (700 – 1100 nm) in the transflectance mode using Teflon as a diffuse reflector. The spectra showed the peak at about 900 nm which belongs to isoprene, the major component of <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet.</b> Pretreatment with second derivative was applied to remove baseline shift effect occurring due to thickness differences on each <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet.</b> From validation results, moisture contents predicted by single sheet system were more accurate than a pile of sheet system with standard error of prediction (SEP) = 0. 39 % and bias of - 0. 07 %, and they were not significantly different from the actual values at 95 % confidence. As a result, determining moisture content in each <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet</b> by a handheld NIR spectrometer provided accurate values, easy and rapid operation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the characteristics of a soft sensor that has the sense of human skin. The sensor is composed of two rectangular <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> and a strain gauge inserted between the interface of the two sheets. The sensor is an application of Poisson's effect, which is a peculiar characteristic of the elastic medium. The normal force applied {{to the surface of the}} sensor contracts the <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> in the normal direction. At the same time, the force expands the medium in the horizontal direction, which results in a horizontal strain proportional to the normal force applied. Thus, the magnitude of the applied force can be determined by measuring the output of the strain gauge that is placed horizontally between the <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets.</b> Characteristics of the sensor are measured for various combination of the two <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> with different hardness and thickness. It is shown that the soft sensor proposed is effective for measurement of both concentrated and distributed applied loads. Further more, it is found that the hysteretic loop of the stress-strain curve is reduced and the linearity of the sensor is improved by placing copper foil between the two <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R
