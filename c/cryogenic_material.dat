40|$|Abstract — Structural {{materials}} like {{stainless steels}} {{are prone to}} serrated yielding at cryogenic temperatures. The serration effect is the unstable yielding resulting in a zigzag shape of the stress-strain curve observed in displacement controlled tensile tests. Moreover, a local temperature rise in the plastic zone is observed. In the current paper, the theories explaining the serration effect are briefly discussed. With a coupled thermal-mechanical FE model of a tensile test set up {{the influence of the}} test conditions is demonstrated on the observed shape of the stress-strain curve. The FE model is extended to quantify the temperature rise and significance of the serration effect in critical support structures of the magnet system of W 7 -X. For W 7 -X loading rates the temperature rise due to yielding is shown to be moderate and yielding does not localize. As a simple and safe approach, plastic collapse of critical components to be operated at 4 K can be judged with a pure mechanical analysis neglecting the thermal-mechanical interaction, using yield curves obtained at 77 K instead.

40|$|The {{ability to}} produce products, suited to a {{particular}} individual is becoming more prevalent in today's society. This requires more efficient and rapid methods for manufacturing of bespoke products. One such method being currently developed is the cryogenic CNC machining of soft materials for producing personalised shoe insoles and outsoles. A major element of cryogenic CNC machining is the freezing of the soft polymers, which subsequently contract. This paper describes a method for predicting and compensating for the effect of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>material</b> contraction for the commonly used shoe midsole foamed polymer, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). using the linear {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} a scaling factor for EVA has been developed to enable it to be accurately cryogenically CNC machined.

The process is tested for a series of EVA cube test pieces and the results provide a scaling factor, which shows that the linear scaled dimension are within 1 % of the measured contracted X, Y and Z dimensions. The scaling factor is subsequently used on an example low density EVA orthotic insole, which is cryogenically machined and then compared dimensionally with the original CAD model. It was found that using the cryogenic contraction factor the cryogenically machined insole had a dimensional X, Y, Z error of less than 1 % when compared and analysed with the original CAD model...|$|E

The tectonically active Baikal rift zone began forming over 50 million years ago and continues today. In the Tunka basin, during the Oligocene and Middle Pliocene, relatively weak tectonic disturbances took place and thick accumulations of organic-rich sands, silts, and clays were deposited in lacustrine–marshy subtropical environments. Tectonism increased between the Miocene and Pliocene and thick units of coarse alluvium and floodplain sediments were deposited. During the Late Pliocene–Quaternary, tectonism formed basins that are now filled with a variety of coarse clastic materials. Early and Middle Pleistocene sediments are poorly exposed, covered by widespread Late Pleistocene deposits. Three Late Pleistocene sedimentary facies dominate: boulder–pebble gravels (proluvial, glacial fluvial, and alluvial sediments), alluvial sand, and loess-like sediments with associated slope deposits altered by post-depositional wind erosion. The relationship between these complexes, including radiocarbon and other chronological data and fauna and flora remains, indicates that they began forming c. 70 000 yr ago. Paleosols, glacial deposits and <b>cryogenic</b> <b>material</b> indicate that at times the climate was cool or cold.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design and {{optimize}} a heat pump process to reliquefy Boil-Off-Gas from Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) cryogenic tanks, and simulataneously vaporize LNG at high pressure. The process is meant for use onboard LNG fuelled ship different from LNG carriers, equipped with LNG fuel tanks at atmospheric pressure and 2 -strokes engines with high pressure gas injection, which is considered the most efficient propulsion arrangement for medium-large vessels. The studyis based on a patented concept from the norwegian companyLNG New Technlogies, within the thesis this concept is evolved to a more complex process layout, its distinctive features are low temperature suction of the heat pump refrigerant compressor, absence of heat discharge {{to the environment and}} condensation of the Boil-Off-Gas via recirculation of subcooled LNG. Four different operating scenarios of the process are simulated with the commercial software HYSYS&# 174;, the results of the simulations are presented in the form of case studies, sensitivity analyses, thermodynamic diagrams and tables, and analized in detail. Anumber of modifications to the selected layout are evaluated, e. g. Boil-Off-Gas feed to the Auxiliaryengine and compressor intercooling. Based on the simulation results a preliminary selection ofthe process equipment is outlined, with focus on the refrigerant compressor. The results prove that the proposed heat pump process can effectively refrigerate the LNG tank if the ship is operating in the normal mode or at half of the main engine load, however at lower engine loads, especially when the main engine is shut down, the system can not produce the required refrigeration effect. In this scenario the excess Boil-Off-Gas would be fed to the Auxiliary engines, or in the worst case burnt in Gas Combustion Units. The heat pump efficiency for the normal operation is 2 - 3 times higher than for commercial on-board Boil-Off-Gas reliquefaction processes, but the maximumreliquefaction capacity is intrinsically lower. The operating parameters of the compressor suggest the use of a reciprocating oil-free compressor with <b>cryogenic</b> <b>material</b> specifications, this is considered the most non-conventional and costly unit of the process. </p...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{water vapor}} plays a {{critical}} role in the climate system because it acts as a medium for heat exchange and transport, and because it is linked to the formation of clouds and precipitation. It is also the most dominant greenhouse gas. Thus, it is important to monitor and understand long-term variability in atmospheric water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Routine radiosonde observations provide the longest record of upper-air conditions. However, it is known that the original radiosonde record contains various errors and inhomogeneity because of changes in instrumentation. In this study, the author investigates the measurement uncertainty of the Meisei RS- 06 G. Comparisons of relative humidity (RH) measurements from the RS- 06 G radiosonde and from a chilled mirror hygrometer revealed that the RS- 06 G RH shows a stepwise change of ~ 3 % RH at 0 °C (drying when air temperature decreasing). This is due to a discontinuous correction factor in the processing software that compensates for the temperature dependence of the RH sensor. Using the results from chamber experiments, the author develops a new temperature-dependence (T-D) correction scheme to resolve the artificial stepwise change at 0 °C. Because the RS- 06 G radiosonde is a successor to the Meisei’s previous radiosonde, RS- 01 G and RS 2 - 91, on which the same RH sensor material had been installed since July 1999, the new T-D correction should be applied to the data obtained by these radiosondes as well. Here, the author applies the new correction into the data at Japan Metrological Agency’s Sapporo and Tateno stations. Because the present (original) T-D correction has only been applied only since February 2003, the time series of RH at both stations show apparent large downward trends between 1999 and 2009. The new T-D correction is found to result in a much smaller (mostly negligible) downward RH trend at Sapporo and almost no trend at Tateno. Because the operational radiosonde observation is designed to obtain the lower tropospheric water vapor for weather forecasting, the RH sensors on operational radiosondes have very poor response in and above the upper troposphere. To measure water vapor precisely in the upper troposphere and stratosphere, special research-quality instruments are required. For example, the Cryogenic Frostpoint Hygrometer (CFH) is regarded as a reference instrument for balloon-borne water vapor observation. However, the CFH needs cryogen material for the observation, and the cryogen material has a strong greenhouse effect. Meanwhile, the Meteolabor Snow White is a Peltier-based chilled mirror hygrometer, which needs no cryogen. Although the operation is simple and environmentally-friendly, it is known that the Snow White cannot measure the stratospheric water vapor even within the cooling capability. In this study, a Peltier-based digitally-controlled chilled-mirror hygrometer has been developed to measure atmospheric water vapor accurately. The developed instrument is environmentally-friendly in nature because this instrument does not use a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>material</b> in addition to a merit of easy-to handle. Also, this instrument has an advanced feedback controller and algorithm to maintain the condensate on the mirror because of the digital circuit. Since January 2011, the author has conducted nine test flights to evaluate the performance. The results showed that the developed instrument can measure water vapor from the surface to the lower stratosphere (~ 25 km). The results of simultaneous measurements with the CFH showed that the frost point temperature from the developed instrument is consistent with that from CFH within ~ 0. 5 K throughout the troposphere. Also, several chamber experiments were conducted to investigate the behavior of chilled-mirror hygrometers. The observation of the condensate by a microscope shows that more and smaller ice crystals are formed on the mirror at lower temperatures. Because the evaporation/condensation rates depend on the particle size as well as water vapor content in the ambient air, the response time and the stability of chilled-mirror hygrometers are considered to depend on the particle size on the mirror, water vapor concentration, and the value of the feedback gain to maintain the constant condensate amount. Based on the experimental results, the author discusses the measurement uncertainty of developed chilled-mirror hygrometers. 水蒸気は、対流圏では日々の天気や大気現象に関わり、上部対流圏や成層圏においては地球の放射エネルギー収支、雲物理、オゾン光化学等に主要な役割を果たす。近年、地球温暖化問題への関心が深まり気候監視が重要視されるようになり、水蒸気の高精度な観測が必要とされている。対流圏下層の水蒸気は、 1940 年代から主に天気予報のためのデータ収集としてラジオゾンデに搭載された相対湿度計により観測されてきた。しかし、多くのラジオゾンデ用相対湿度計は様々な要因によって大きな測定の不確かさを伴うため、気候変動に伴う僅かな変動を検出することは困難とされてきた。本研究では、日本の高層気象観測で広く利用された明星電気製ラジオゾンデの相対湿度計について、恒温槽と風洞装置を用いた室内実験にて測定の不確かさの再評価を実施した。RS- 06 Gラジオゾンデによる湿度測定には、気温 0 ℃で不連続となる温度補正式の適用により、気温 0 ℃高度で相対湿度 3 %程度の不連続な変化が生じていたことが明らかになった。このため、室内実験結果をもとに新たな温度補正式を開発・提案した。さらに、開発した温度補正式を明星電気製ラジオゾンデが使用された 2000 年代の高層気象観測のデータに適用しその影響を調べた。センサの更新時期などが記述されたメタデータを入手できた札幌と館野における時系列を調べた結果、従来の温度補正式が適用され始めた 2003 年 2 月 1 日を境に時系列に不連続な変化が生じており、 2000 年代の相対湿度は見掛けの大きな減少傾向を示すことがわかった。新たな温度補正式を対象のラジオゾンデが使用された全期間に適用することで大きな減少傾向が解消されることが明らかとなった。上部対流圏および成層圏の水蒸気は非常に低濃度でラジオゾンデに搭載された通常の相対湿度計では測定することができないため、特殊な水蒸気計が必要とされる。 1940 年代Brewerらによる航空機用露点湿度計の開発以降、多くの研究機関で気球や航空機に搭載するための成層圏用水蒸気計が開発された。現在、気球搭載用としては冷媒を用いた鏡面冷却式露点計が主流となっているが、冷媒として用いるトリフルオロメタンは強力な温室効果を持ち、観測の度に大気中に放出されてしまうことが問題視されている。一方、冷媒を必要としないペルチェ素子による冷却を用いた鏡面冷却式露点計としてSnow Whiteがあるが、成層圏では測定不能であり、その原因さえ特定できない状況であった。本研究では、環境負荷の少ないペルチェ冷却方式の鏡面冷却式露点計を新たに開発した。Azbil株式会社により開発された工業用途の鏡面冷却式露点計FINEDEWを参考にし、高層気象観測用にするため、放熱効率を向上させ軽量化したセンサおよび電池のみで動作可能な軽量化した制御・通信基板を設計、製作した。鏡面冷却露点計では鏡面の露・霜を平衡状態に維持するための精密な鏡面温度の制御が必要とされる。開発機器はマイコンを用いたデジタル方式のため、Snow Whiteでは成し得なかった詳細な制御の設定や制御アルゴリズムを組み込むことが可能である。高層大気を再現したチャンバー内で様々な室内実験を繰り返し、高層気象観測に適した制御設定やアルゴリズムを作成した。国内外で飛揚試験を実施した結果、開発機は冷媒を用いず下部成層圏まで測定する能力があることが確かめられた。しかし、成層圏内では制御パラメータの調整不足により鏡面上の霜を安定に平衡状態に保つことができず、鏡面温度に振動が生じ安定した測定には至らなかった。冷媒冷却方式の鏡面冷却式露点計との同時測定では、両者の測定は対流圏において非常に良い一致を示した。露点測定方式の水蒸気計は、測定空気に触れた鏡面を冷却し鏡面上に形成された露および霜を平衡状態に保ち鏡面温度を露点に維持することで大気の露点を測定するものである。熱力学原理に基づいているため高精度な測定が可能と考えられているが、様々な測定の不確かさを伴うことが知られている。その主な要因として、鏡面上の霜を平衡状態に保つための制御（PID制御）の安定性や、低温域での水蒸気量減少によって霜が平衡状態に達するまでの要する時間の遅れによる応答性の遅れなどが挙げられる。開発した鏡面冷却式露点計について、光学顕微鏡を用いて鏡面の霜の状態とその変動の様子をマイクロレベルで観察し、霜の成長および蒸発速度による応答性への影響について調べた。気温 0 ℃~- 60 ℃までの環境における観察の結果、各気温で鏡面の状態が異なり低温ほど小さな氷晶が多数形成されることがわかった。霜の成長速度は粒径にも強く依存するため、鏡面冷却式露点計における応答性および安定性は、周囲の環境（主に水蒸気濃度）及び鏡面冷却のためのPID制御パラメータに加え、鏡面上の霜の粒径の影響を強く受けていることが示唆される。これらの結果を踏まえ、鏡面冷却式露点計における測定の不確かさについて議論する...|$|E

To reduce vapor fraction during the final Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion into the superfluid helium cooling bath, counter-flow, plate-fin heat exchangers will be utilized. Due to their compact size and ease of fabrication, plate-fin heat exchangers are an effective option. However, the design of compact and high-effectiveness cryogenic heat exchangers operating at liquid helium temperatures requires consideration of axial heat conduction along the direction of flow, in addition to variable fluid properties. Here we present a numerical model that includes the effects of axial conduction and variable properties for a plate fin heat exchanger. The model is used to guide design decisions on heat exchanger material choice and geometry. In addition, the J-T expansion process is modeled with the heat exchanger to analyze the effect of heat load and cryogenic supply parameters.

40|$|Fiber-reinforced {{composite}} materials {{are widely used}} in the aerospace and automobile industries. Their strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios make them suitable {{to be used in}} spacecraft, especially as <b>cryogenic</b> tank <b>materials.</b> One of the focus of this dissertation is to investigate the application of woven carbon and Kevlar® fiber composites as <b>cryogenic</b> tank <b>materials.</b> Tensile, bending and short beam shear tests are performed on rectangular specimens at room temperature and after cryogenic exposure (- 196 °C). It is found that the mechanical properties of these {{composite materials}} do not degrade significantly due to cryogenic exposure. It is observed that the failure mode took place before and after the cryogenic exposure is identical, which implies that the carbon and Kevlar® fiber composite {{can be used as a}} <b>cryogenic</b> tank <b>materials.</b> Hybridization of this two types of composites (carbon and Kevlar® fiber) is also studied. A computational study is conducted to reduce the number of experiments, and to find the optimum combination of carbon and Kevlar ® fiber reinforcements. Thirty different combinations of hybrid composites are studied computationally and six of these combinations are found suitable based on minimum number of peak stress and minimum peak stress value. This six optimum combinations along with some other combinations are manufactured by using the Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) process to facilitate comparative study. Comparison of mechanical test results performed on full cryogenic exposure, gradient exposure and pristine materials shows that the hybrid composites can be used as <b>cryogenic</b> tank <b>materials.</b> ^ Another important aspect of this dissertation is to study the inter-laminar reinforcement of multi-directional laminates by using additive manufacturing technology. Under thermos-mechanical loading, very high stress can be developed at the interfaces due to property mismatch between different plies leading to premature failure. In order to reinforce those interfaces, it is very important to identify these delamination prone interfaces. A novel semi-analytical model is developed to find the delamination prone interfaces in a multidirectional laminates under thermo-mechanical loading and the results of this model is compared with previously published results. Very thin lines of polylactic acid (PLA) are printed on the critical interfaces in multi-directional laminate by using MakerBot Replicator Desktop 3 D printer and it is found that, inter-laminar shear strength (ILSS) is increased by approximately 28 %. So, the additive manufacturing technology can be used to increase inter-laminar strength of multi-directional laminate. ...|$|R
40|$|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory is {{constructing}} a superconducting 1. 3 GHz cryomodule test facility {{located at the}} New Muon Lab building. The facility {{will be used for}} testing and validating cryomodule designs as well as support systems. For the initial phase of the project, a single Type III plus 1. 3 GHz cryomodule will be cooled and tested using a single Tevatron style standalone refrigerator. Subsequent phases involve testing as many as two full RF units consisting of up to six 1. 3 GHz cryomodules {{with the addition of a}} new cryogenic plant. The cryogenic infrastructure consists of the refrigerator system, cryogenic distribution system as well as an ambient temperature pumping system to achieve 2 K operations with supporting purification systems. A discussion of the available capacity for the various phases versus the proposed heat loads is included as well as commissioning results and testing schedule. This paper describes the plans, status and challenges of this initial phase of the New Muon Lab cryogenic system.
