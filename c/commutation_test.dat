50|$|In semiotics, the <b>commutation</b> <b>test</b> is used {{to analyze}} a {{signifying}} system. The test identifies signifiers {{as well as their}} signifieds, value and significance.|$|E
5000|$|According to Daniel Chandler, the <b>commutation</b> <b>test</b> {{may involve}} any of four basic transformations which, {{to a greater}} or lesser extent, involve {{modification}} of the syntagm: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>commutation</b> <b>test</b> {{can be used}} to {{identify}} which signifiers are significant. The test depends on substitution: a particular signifier is chosen, then the effect of substituting alternatives is considered {{to determine the extent to}} which the value of the sign is changed. This both illuminates the meaning of the original choice and identifies the paradigms and code to which the signifiers used belong.|$|E
50|$|In semiotics, {{syntagmatic}} {{analysis is}} analysis of syntax or surface structure (syntagmatic structure) {{as opposed to}} paradigms (paradigmatic analysis). This is often achieved using <b>commutation</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Syntagmatic {{structure}} is often contrasted with paradigmatic structure. In semiotics, [...] "syntagmatic analysis" [...] is analysis of syntax or surface structure (syntagmatic structure), rather than paradigms as in paradigmatic analysis. Analysis is often achieved through <b>commutation</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R
50|$|Paradigmatic {{analysis}} is {{the analysis of}} paradigms embedded in the text rather than of the surface structure (syntax) of the text which is termed syntagmatic analysis. Paradigmatic analysis often uses <b>commutation</b> <b>tests,</b> i.e. analysis by substituting words of the same type or class to calibrate shifts in connotation.|$|R
50|$|Connotation is {{concerned}} with how the sign system is used in each message. The semantic content is selected by the addresser and represents that individual's values and intentions. Limiting an analysis purely to the sign system comprised by paradigms and syntagms excludes key elements in the interpretive process. Thus, subjective tests such as the <b>commutation</b> <b>test</b> {{have been developed to}} map connotations and so decode more of the addresser's intentions. This is achieved by changing the form of the signifiers, by substituting signifiers to assess what the alternative connotations would be and by considering what signifiers are absent and why their absences might be significant. Changes of form would require substituting different fonts for the same text, or different colours or designs for the same visual content. The use of synonyms and antonyms clarifies connotational choices as between, say, pejorative and euphemistic usages. As to absences, if a modern image of a group of people employed in a major public enterprise only contains individuals of the same gender and ethnicity, the analyst would enquire into the significance of the exclusion of those of the opposite gender and a different ethnicity. The editorial decision may be supporting social values, attitudes and beliefs that are embedded into the culture—for example, that nations ought to conscript only men to serve on the front-lines of a war. Other explanations of different contexts may expose cultural myths and prejudices which are less reasonable.|$|E
40|$|The erosion {{model of}} the surface {{coatings}} of reed switches considering different physicochemical processes occurring on the contact surfaces and inside the inter-electrode gap was proposed. According to that, the discrete electron avalanche (ecton) introduced in the explosive electron emission theory by Mesyats is considered as the main motive force responsible for the surface modification and mass transfer of materials {{in the course of}} breaking/shorting of the contacts. By means of SEM imaging and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis of the contact surfaces after various numbers of switching cycles, the energy threshold of the ecton generation defining the erosion stability of the coatings was found to be proportional to the specific sublimation and ionization energies of coating materials. It has been shown that the total erosion of the coatings on the working surface of the contacts after the <b>commutation</b> <b>test</b> possess the resultant character; i. e., the specificities of erosion occurring after each commutation event are characteristic for the whole of the <b>commutation</b> <b>test.</b> In further development of our model, we suggested that a few monolayers of metals (or alloys) with low ionization potential deposited on the main coatings can improve the erosion stability of contacts...|$|E
40|$|The {{last major}} {{study of the}} low-back merger in Miami, Florida, was Labov, Ash, and Boberg’s (2006) work for the Atlas of North American English (ANAE). In that {{influential}} work, Labov et al. found the low-back merger to be in transition in Miami. However, the ANAE was based on Telsur data, the most recent of which was collected nearly 10 years ago. Presumably, since that time, the low-back merger has progressed in Miami towards a full merger. This study focuses {{on the progress of}} the low back merger in a Miami speech community. Eighteen participants were interviewed. Interviews consisted of a word list with 8 words containing vowels of the /o / word-class, and 8 others containing vowels of the /oh / word-class, as well a short reading passage and a <b>commutation</b> <b>test.</b> Acoustic analysis focused on the words in the word list, and a cursory examination of the passage data was in agreement with the findings from the word list pronunciations. The data from the word lists was analyzed and the F 1 and F 2 of /o / and /oh / vowels were averaged for comparison. Vowels preceding [r] and [+nasal] obstruents were excluded from analysis, due to their significant effect on formants. This exclusion should also serve to make any results suggesting movement towards a merger more compelling, because ANAE data found tha...|$|E
50|$|Many phonologists in {{the middle}} part of the 20th century had a strong {{interest}} in developing techniques for discovering the phonemes of unknown languages, and in some cases, they set up writing systems for the languages. The major work of Kenneth Pike on the subject is Phonemics: a technique for reducing languages to writing. The minimal pair was an essential tool in the discovery process and was found by substitution or <b>commutation</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that there is a “critical period” for language acquisition ending at some point approaching puberty, beyond which language acquisition can occur only imperfectly. Other studies, primarily focusing on adolescents, have also found that this concept applies to second dialect acquisition in situations of dialect contact. Even so, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms underlying the linguistic changes that can occur in dialect contact situations. This is an important question particularly because it is such a common situation—adults are, for example, faced with constant exposure to a second dialect if they move away from where they acquired their native dialect. This study investigates this issue by comparing the linguistic perception and production of two groups of individuals, one made up of individuals who have lived in the same town their entire lives and the other made up of individuals who grew up in that town but moved away as adults. The results of sociolinguistic interviews and <b>commutation</b> <b>tests</b> are used to determine the extent to which the adult emigrants from the community gained or lost features of their native dialect, or accommodated to their new dialect. The investigation finds that adult migrants do make changes in their linguistic production and perception upon constant exposure to a second dialect, though not all features prove susceptible to change. The changes the individuals make involve both accommodations to the new dialects they are surrounded by as well as changes that do not involve such accommodation. The major generalization drawn from the data is that the linguistic features that are most susceptible to change in dialect contact situations are those features that are undergoing change in the individuals 2 ̆ 7 native dialect. This result has direct applications in the field of dialectology and the speech recognition industry, as both of these fields can benefit from a deeper knowledge of the sorts of “hybridized” dialect systems than can result from dialect contact. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{computer}} and the Internet, came a new media to be exploited my marketing and advertising executives all over the globe. In its early years, Web sites were primitive and not used {{as a tool for}} branding. However, branding is everything and everywhere. The cars we drive, the food we eat, even our most mundane purchases like soap and toilet paper are clearly branded. But what comes to mind when we think of the elements of branding? Most immediately, we might think of packaging labels, bags, boxes, and the logos printed, stamped, or otherwise emblazoned upon them (Andres, 2002). However, these elements do no define a brand in today's ever-changing world. The Internet is one of the primary channel for marketing communication, so one must imagine packaging a Web site for presentation as a brand commodity. A Web site can be considered packaging as essential its content represents the product, and the package becomes synonymous with the brand. There are several aspects of a brand that must be considered when establishing a site. Using semiotic as a base for analysis, it was discovered that Web sites do indeed segment target users, and this is mostly done through crude gender based orientation. The key signifiers of colour, typography and content are the main signifiers in the syntagm of the Web site in creating emotional responses in the target user. This discovery has been backed up {{through the use of a}} <b>Commutation</b> <b>Test,</b> in which a website was taken a re-positioned to a different target user by altering the signifiers in the syntagm, effectively changing the message of the Web site. The findings of this study will be interesting to those wishing to construct a Web site that is positioned to a specific market segment, and those wishing to explore the boundaries of Semiotics...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} undertakes to re-centre {{the figure}} of the film star and their film appearances in the field of star study. To this end it uses Charlton Heston as its focus in a re-appraisal of existing methods of accounting for the star phenomenon in cinema. It also concomitantly re-assesses existing accounts of the significance of Charlton Heston as a film star. This thesis posits a robust method for identifying the specificities of the star’s contribution to a film’s meanings and effects across the body of their work by drawing on Andrew Britton’s understanding of the ‘star enactment’. Present approaches through which to engage with the details of a star’s performance are considered in detail and the weaknesses of those that seek to impose external schemas onto such discussions are highlighted. The difficulties with approaches that attempt to account for the star as a signifying phenomenon through the concepts of acting and performance are also considered. Existing methods which may allow for a fruitful investigation into the significance of the star enactment, such as the <b>commutation</b> <b>test,</b> are re- formulated in this study and their benefits are demonstrated through their application to key Heston star enactments. These new understandings are also made possible through the application of an ‘ekphrastic’ method of rendering film moments. Previous readings of Heston’s star figure are also re- appraised, and their conclusions questioned, through closer reference to the evidence of details from films. The fruitfulness of this method for analysing and commenting on film is thus demonstrated and Heston’s relationship to genre and its effect on performance style is also considered {{in order to be able}} to confidently assert the specific features of the Heston aesthetic.

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to arrive at}} a phonematic analysis of Spoken Iraqi Arabic (SIA) based on theories of the functional school of linguistics. It falls into two parts: PART ONE comprises six chapters and it presents an outline of functional linguistic theories with special emphasis on phonology. Chapter One deals with the historical background of functional linguistics with particular reference to F. de Saussure (the founder of modern linguistics), some principal members of the Prague School, and A. Martinet (the leading figure in neo-Praguian functionalism). Chapter Two treats of the notion of 'function' and the functions of language as viewed by F. de Saussure, K. Buhler, J. M Korinek, J. von Laziczius, N. S. Trubbtzkoy, and A. Martinet. Chapter Three and Chapter Four explain some basic functional notions such as the phoneme, the relevant feature, phonemic content, variant, contrast, opposition, the archiphoneme, neutralization, and defective distribution. Chapter Five deals with various methods of 'phonemic diagnosis' (e. g. the <b>commutation</b> <b>test)</b> with particular reference to Trubetzkoy's rules for monophonematic or polyphonematic evaluation. Chapter Six classifies oppositions into 'distinctive oppositions' versus 'nondistinctive oppositions, and further presents 'logical' as well as 'phonological' classifications of 'distinctive oppositions'. PART TWO comprises seven chapters and it presents an application of the functional phonological theory to SIA. Chapter Seven is an introduction giving an account of the Arabic dialect studied in this thesis, the segmental and non-segmental notations used in this Part, the basic sound differences between CA (Classical Arabic) and SIA, and a critical survey of previous non-functional analyses of SIA. Chapter Eight tackles certain phonological problems in SIA, viz. tafxim, teldid', the phonological status, of-[j] and [w],[tj] and [d 3], diphthongs, vowel length, and vocalic lipposture (presenting previous views as well as my own views on them). Chapter Nine deals with the SIA phonemes and their realizations, showing the oppositions whereby each phoneme is phonetipally realized. Chapter Ten defines each phoneme in terms of relevant features and then classifies the SIA phonemes into groups {{on the basis of their}} relevant features. Chapter Eleven, provides tabular and multi-dimensional representations of the SIA consonant as well as vowel systems. Chaptor Twelve presents a method for measuring the 'functional load' of each phoneme; it provides tables showing the number of distinctive oppositions that each phoneme forms with the other phonemes of the SIA phonological system in word-initial, word-medial and word-final positions followed by statistical conclusions as to which phonemes have the highest functional load in the system, and so on, and which of the three word positions is the position of maximum differentiation. Finally, Chapter Thirteen investigates cases of neutralization and cases of free variation. It also accounts for the archiphonemes which are said to occur in the position(s) of neutralization of the respective oppositions in addition to their relevant features and their symbolization...|$|E
