50|$|The PS-3040 Dual Foot Controller is {{basically}} two CV <b>control</b> <b>pedals</b> with variable range, which {{also can be}} connected to any parameter with a CV input, adding greatly to the possibilities for expression. The voltage range is set with knobs on the PSU-3302 panel of the Korg PS-3300 and {{is part of the}} Voltage <b>Control</b> Processors. The <b>pedals</b> are made out of heavy duty cast metal and are designed to have the entire foot placed upon it giving the player the kind of precise control one has for example over an organ volume pedal. (Note! This set of pedals is in addition to the Sustain/Release pedal described earlier).|$|R
5000|$|Cab - is {{the area}} that {{contains}} a seat for the operator along with the <b>control</b> <b>pedals,</b> steering wheel, levers, switches and a dashboard containing operator readouts.

50|$|Also, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} that people preferring to use the right hand prefer to use the left leg, e.g. when using a shovel, kicking a ball, or operating <b>control</b> <b>pedals.</b> In many cases, this may be because they are disposed for left-handedness but have been trained for right-handedness. In the sport of cricket, some players may find that they are more comfortable bowling with their left or right hand, but batting with the other hand.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} {{technology}} {{of the day was}} more than sophisticated enough to avoid them, there were numerous mechanical problems with the disc's motor drive due to its having been engineered to be as affordable as possible. Changes in environment which had a physical effect on the photocells frequently led to crosstalk between tracks. One common example involves the F at {{the upper end of the}} keyboard; press this key, step on the volume <b>control</b> <b>pedal</b> and the C-diminished/A-diminished chord can often be heard in the background.|$|E
50|$|The {{tire changer}} has two foot pedals. The left pedal {{is called the}} clamp <b>control</b> <b>pedal,</b> a three {{position}} pedal that opens and closes the rim clamps. Once pressed, pneumatic pistons move the 4 rim clamps together or apart simultaneously. The right pedal is the table top pedal, which is a three position pedal that controls {{the rotation of the}} table top. When the table top pedal is pressed down, the table top spins clockwise. The table top spins counter clockwise when the pedal is raised.|$|E

5000|$|Frontal lobe epileptic {{seizures}} {{unlike other}} epileptic seizures create symptoms {{that are as}} dangerous as loss of consciousness and {{much more difficult to}} discern from other problems such as drug and alcohol abuse, psychiatric disorders and disobedience. [...] Jerking movements/lack of motor <b>control,</b> <b>pedaling,</b> pelvic thrusting, lapses in cognitive functioning and other hallmark symptoms of frontal lobe epileptic seizures all create dangerous behavior behind the wheel. Studies have not been done to date to determine the differential risk posed by drivers with frontal lobe epilepsy relative to the general epileptic population.|$|R

5000|$|External {{connections}} include 2 unbalanced 1/4-inch [...] "MIX" [...] (left {{and right}} channel) and 2 unbalanced [...] "DIRECT" [...] (left and right channel) TS connector jacks. Sounds are normally routed to the MIX outputs but can instead be routed to the DIRECT outputs when required. There is a 1/4-inch stereo headphone jack, a 1/4-inch jack for the sustain (hold) pedal and a 1/4-inch jack for sequencer click output, {{useful as a}} metronome when playing along with the sequencer. Four 1/4-inch <b>control</b> <b>pedal</b> jacks have configurable functions, including the ability to adjust patch volume, patch cutoff frequency, effects levels, organ speaker rotation simulation, stepping through patches, and so forth. There are three 5-pin MIDI ports (IN, OUT, and THRU).|$|E
5000|$|Air {{brake systems}} are {{typically}} used on heavy trucks and buses. The system consists of service brakes, parking brakes, a <b>control</b> <b>pedal,</b> and an air storage tank. For the parking brake, there's a disc or drum brake arrangement {{which is designed}} to be held in the 'applied' position by spring pressure. Air pressure must be produced to release these [...] "spring brake" [...] parking brakes. For the service brakes (the ones used while driving for slowing or stopping) to be applied, the brake pedal is pushed, routing the air under pressure (approx [...] or 6.89-8.27 bar) to the brake chamber, causing the brake to be engaged. Most types of truck air brakes are drum brakes, though there is an increasing trend towards the use of disc brakes in this application. The air compressor draws filtered air from the atmosphere and forces it into high-pressure reservoirs at around [...] Most heavy vehicles have a gauge within the driver's view, indicating the availability of air pressure for safe vehicle operation, often including warning tones or lights. A mechanical [...] "wig wag" [...] that automatically drops down into the driver's field of vision when the pressure drops below a certain point is also common. Setting of the parking/emergency brake releases the pressurized air in the lines between the compressed air storage tank and the brakes, thus allowing the spring actuated parking brake to engage. A sudden loss of air pressure would result in full spring brake pressure immediately.|$|E

50|$|The race {{commenced}} on time {{in front}} of an unexpected 60,000-strong crowd with the first plane to take off being the Mollisons' Comet named Black Magic and soon after C.W.A. Scott and Tom Campbell Black were in the air heading for Melbourne. Scott and Black touched down at their first control point in Baghdad 12 hours and 2500 mi later just a few minutes behind the Mollisons and were in the air again half an hour later on course for Allahabad. When they arrived in Allahabad, another 12 hours and 2300 mi later they had taken the race lead as the Mollisons' Comet was held up with complications to its undercarriage in Karachi. When they touched down in Singapore observers thought they saw smoke coming from an engine but the fire service found no problem; after shutting down the engines Scott ordered two glasses of beer and jinked about with nervous energy, keen to be on his way. The next part of the journey involved island hopping before the crossing of the Timor Sea Just two days after leaving RAF Mildenhall Scott and Black touched down on Australian soil in Darwin; Scott was found by race officials lying down under the wing of his aeroplane stretching his right leg. He was suffering badly from cramp in his leg because they feared that the port engine was seizing up so had throttled it down, this meant that Scott was forced to compensate for the uneven port/starboard power levels by constantly applying pressure to the Rudder <b>control</b> <b>pedal</b> with his right foot during flight. The following is an excerpt from Time magazine, 29 October 1934, Volume XXIV, Number 18.|$|E
5000|$|Plunkett {{had lifted}} and bread-boarded a {{transistorized}} tone-circuit from the Thomas Organ (an electric solid state transistorized organ) {{to duplicate the}} Jennings 3-position circuit. After adjusting and testing the amplifier with an electronic oscillator and oscilloscope, Plunkett connected the output to the speaker and tested the circuit audibly. At that point, several engineers and technical consultants, including Bill Page and Del Casher, noticed the sound effect caused by the circuit. Page insisted on testing this bread-boarded circuit while he played his saxophone through an amplifier. John Glennon, an assistant junior electronics engineer with the Thomas Organ Company, was summoned to bring a volume <b>control</b> <b>pedal</b> which {{was used in the}} Vox Continental Organ so that the transistorized MRB potentiometer bread-boarded circuit could be installed in the pedal's housing. After the installation, Page began playing his saxophone through the pedal and had asked Joe Banaron, CEO of Warwick Electronics Inc./Thomas Organ Company, to listen to the effect. At this point the first electric guitar was plugged into the prototype wah pedal by guitarist Del Casher who suggested to Joe Banaron that this was a guitar effects pedal rather than a wind instrument effects pedal. Banaron, being a fan of the big band style of music, was interested in marketing the wah pedal for wind instruments as suggested by Page rather than for the electric guitar as suggested by Casher. After a remark by Casher to Banaron regarding the Harmon mute style of trumpet playing in the famous recording of [...] "Sugar Blues" [...] from the 1930s, Banaron decided to market the wah-wah pedal using Clyde McCoy's name for endorsement.|$|E
