5|$|During trials, {{the player}} cross-examines witnesses. They can move {{backwards}} and forwards through {{statements in the}} testimony, and can choose to press the witness {{for more information on}} a particular statement; sometimes, the witness will revise their testimony based on this. If the player spots a lie or a contradiction in the testimony, they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> player will be lowered; if the judge's <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|As {{investor}} <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{global economic}} outlook fell in early August, Bloomberg suggested the currency war had entered a new phase.

5|$|Chad's {{currency}} is the CFA franc. In the 1960s, the Mining industry of Chad produced sodium carbonate, or natron. There {{have also been}} reports of gold-bearing quartz in the Biltine Prefecture. However, years of civil war have scared away foreign investors; those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have only recently begun to regain <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country's future. In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, boosting the country's economic prospects.|$|E

NCMPs enjoy most of the privileges of ordinary Members of Parliament. They are, however, not allowed to vote on several types of bills such as bills to amend the Constitution and motions of no <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Government.

5|$|A {{series of}} {{derailments}} {{in the mid-1970s}} shattered Amtrak's <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> locomotive, and many railroads banned it from their tracks. Multiple investigations pointed to issues with the locomotive's trucks, {{the weight of the}} water and steam generators used for train heating, or the vibration of baggage cars behind the locomotive. In 1977 Amtrak decided to move on from the SDP40F in favor of the EMD F40PH, which was already in use on short-distance routes. Amtrak traded most of its fleet into EMD; the components were incorporated into new F40PHs. The remainder were traded to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) for use in freight service. The Santa Fe rebuilt the locomotives and designated them SDF40-2. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), successor to the Santa Fe, retired them in 2002.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Persano was {{replaced}} by Admiral Giovanni Vacca; {{he was ordered to}} attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out. After the end of the war, the government lost <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fleet and drastically reduced the naval budget. The cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, as part of the wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. Terribile was rapidly surpassed, first by central battery and then turret ships, which made the first generation of ironclads like Terribile and her sister obsolete.|$|E
