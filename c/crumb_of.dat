500|$|Critics lauded the {{development}} of the storyline between Shane and Rick. Writing for Best Week Ever, Dan Hopper stated that it presented a cold and eerie outlook {{on the future of the}} two men. Nate Rawlings of Time evaluated their physical confrontation as [...] "darn good", and Alex <b>Crumb</b> <b>of</b> The Faster Times called it [...] "wholly satisfying". Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich commended the fight scene; [...] "The Shane/Rick fight was great, a brilliantly extended scuffle that started out with an air of boys-will-be-boys pettiness but quickly escalated into something genuinely homicidal." [...] Goldman summated on the scene: [...] "Of course, it was also gratifying to finally see that conflict turn physical, with a fight we've been waiting to see for a long time. Rick vs. Shane was appropriately brutal and did a very good job of representing the two men's different tactics—Rick was no doubt a formidable and dangerous guy in a fight, wailing on Shane with a series of punches. But Shane was going for the kill, using anything he could grab as a weapon, as he shoved a motorcycle onto Rick at one point and then threw a massive wrench at him in an effective, 'Holy S**t!' moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Returning to Hollywood in 1938, he was befriended by Frank Davis, an MGM {{producer}} {{and member of}} the Communist Party USA, who placed Buñuel on the payroll of Cargo of Innocence, a film about Spanish refugee mothers and children fleeing from Bilbao to the USSR. [...] The project was shelved precipitately when another Hollywood film about the Spanish Civil War, Blockade, was met with disfavor by the Catholic League of Decency. [...] In the words of biographer Ruth Brandon, Buñuel and his family [...] "lived from one unsatisfactory <b>crumb</b> <b>of</b> work to another" [...] because he [...] "had none of the arrogance and pushiness essential for survival in Hollywood." [...] He just wasn't flamboyant enough to capture the attention of Hollywood decision makers, in the opinion of film composer George Antheil: [...] "Inasmuch as , his wife and his little boy seemed to be such absolutely normal, solid persons, as totally un-Surrealist in the Dalí tradition as one could possibly imagine." [...] For the most part, he was snubbed by many {{of the people in the}} film community whom he met during his first trip to America, although he was able to sell some gags to Chaplin for his film The Great Dictator.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare textural (firmness) and sensory {{properties}} (surface colour, crumb colour, crumb texture, appearance, appearance and colour preferences) between whole breads made from conventional wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.) and whole breads made from unconventional wheat (Triticum aestivum, L., winter variety Skorpion, grains with blue aleuron). Wholemeal breads (control samples with marks C 1, C 2 and C 3) were prepared of 100, 90 and 80 % amount of conventional wholemeal wheat flour to 0, 10 and 20 % amount of smooth white flour made from conventional wheat using baker's experiment. Wholemeal breads (experimental samples with marks S 1, S 2 and S 3) were prepared of unconventional wholemeal wheat flour to smooth white wheat flour in same ratio as control samples of breads. Our results showed, that negative evaluation of some sensory attributes of breads made from unconventional wheat correlated with increasing addition of wholemeal flour of this wheat. It was found that breads made from conventional wheat (100, 90 and 80 % amount of conventional wholemeal flour) were more acceptable in surface colour, colour and appearance preferences than these sensory attributes of breads made from unconventional wheat (same amount of wholemeal flour). Appearance and <b>crumb</b> colour <b>of</b> breads made from conventional wheat (100 and 90 % amount of wholemeal flour) were evaluated better than these attributes of breads made from blue coloured wheat (same amount of wholemeal flour). Appearance and <b>crumb</b> colour <b>of</b> both groups of whole wheat breads (80 : 20) was similarly evaluated. <b>Crumb</b> texture <b>of</b> breads made from conventional wheat (90 % and 80 % amount of wholemeal flour) was worse than <b>crumb</b> texture <b>of</b> breads produced of same ratio of flour, but made from unconventional wheat. Breads with addition of 80 % of wholemeal flour milled of blue coloured wheat were most acceptable in all of sensory attributes for evaluators. Significant difference (p < 0. 05) <b>of</b> <b>crumb</b> fimness <b>of</b> breads were demonstrated between samples of breads (80 : 20) made from conventional or unconventional wheat. <b>Crumbs</b> <b>of</b> breads (100 : 0 and 80 : 20) made from blue coloured wheat had higher firmness than <b>crumbs</b> <b>of</b> breads (100 : 0 and 80 : 20) made from conventional wheat. But <b>crumbs</b> <b>of</b> breads (90 : 10) made from conventional wheat were firmer than <b>crumbs</b> <b>of</b> breads (90 : 10) made from unconventional wheat. Breads produced of blue coloured wheat were also more friable than breads made from conventional wheat. Although evaluation of wholemeal breads made from unconventional wheat had not better scores than evaluation of wholemeal breads made from conventioval wheat, but evalution of breads produced of unconventional wheat wholemeal flour were not below average and its market position could be very high in the future, due to the content of health benefit substances, which will be the subject of further research. <!
