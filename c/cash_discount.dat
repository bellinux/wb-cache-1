40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{summarized}} compendium {{of all the}} methods and theories on company valuation using <b>cash</b> flow <b>discounting.</b> The paper shows the ten most commonly used methods for valuing companies by cash flow discounting: 1) free <b>cash</b> flow <b>discounted</b> at the WACC; 2) equity <b>cash</b> flows <b>discounted</b> at the required return to equity; 3) capital <b>cash</b> flows <b>discounted</b> at the WACC before tax; 4) APV (Adjusted Present Value); 5) the business's risk-adjusted free <b>cash</b> flows <b>discounted</b> at the required return to assets; 6) the business's risk-adjusted equity <b>cash</b> flows <b>discounted</b> at the required return to assets; 7) economic profit discounted at the required return to equity; 8) EVA discounted at the WACC; 9) the risk-free rate-adjusted free <b>cash</b> flows <b>discounted</b> at the risk-free rate, and 10) the risk-free rate-adjusted equity <b>cash</b> flows <b>discounted</b> at the required return to assets. All ten methods always give the same value. This result is logical, since all the methods analyze the same reality under the same hypotheses; they only differ in the cash flows taken as {{starting point for the}} valuation. The disagreements in the various theories on the valuation of the firm arise from the calculation {{of the value of the}} tax shields (VTS). The paper shows and analyses 9 different theories on the calculation of the VTS: No-cost-of-leverage, Modigliani and Miller (1963), Myers (1974), Miller (1977), Miles and Ezzell (1980), Harris and Pringle (1985), Damodaran (1994), With-cost-of-leverage and Practitioners method.

This paper analyzes {{the origins of}} <b>cash</b> <b>discounting</b> {{in order to determine}} why oil companies introduced explicit pricing of the credit service in 1982 only to begin discouraging it {{by the end of the}} decade. Sharp increases in nominal interest rates and in the real price of gasoline between 1978 - 1982 spurred a rapid rise in the cost of financing accounts receivable. This increasing cost in part drove the initial decision to discount. By 1990 the discounting trend reversed as the costs of processing credit transactions and of the float associated with non-revolving accounts receivable fell.

50|$|Another {{shortcoming}} is {{the fact}} that the <b>Discounted</b> <b>Cash</b> Flow Valuation should only be used as a method of intrinsic valuation for companies with predictable, though not necessarily stable, <b>cash</b> flows.

At the same time, this method is often applied to valuation of high growth technology companies.

50|$|Many {{supermarkets}} {{encourage the}} use of reusable shopping bags to increase sales and profit margins. Most non woven polypropylene bags cost $0.10-0.25 to produce but are sold for $0.99-$3.00. As stores receive diminishing returns due to saturated markets, there are concerns that prices will drop and they will become the new single use bag. Some major supermarket chains have string or calico bags available for sale. They are sold with announcement of environmental issues in many cases. The ones sold in supermarkets often have designs related to nature, such as prints of trees or that of the earth, in order to emphasize environmental issues. One startup company out of Duluth, Minnesota embroiders their bags with their local Aerial Lift Bridge on it. Some supermarkets have rewards programs for customers who bring own shopping bags. When the customers collect a certain amount of points, they can usually get discount coupons or gifts, which motivate customers to reduce plastic bag use.

50|$|An {{accounts}} payable is {{recorded in the}} Account Payable sub-ledger at the time an invoice is vouched for payment. Vouchered, or vouched, means that an invoice is approved for payment and has been recorded in the General Ledger or AP subledger as an outstanding, or open, liability because {{it has not been}} paid. Payables are often categorized as Trade Payables, payables for the purchase of physical goods that are recorded in Inventory, and Expense Payables, payables for the purchase of goods or services that are expensed. Common examples of Expense Payables are advertising, travel, entertainment, office supplies and utilities. A/P is a form of credit that suppliers offer to their customers by allowing them to pay for a product or service after it has already been received. Suppliers offer various payment terms for an invoice. Payment terms may include the offer of a <b>cash</b> <b>discount</b> for paying an invoice within a defined number of days. For example, 2%, Net 30 terms mean that the payer will deduct 2% from the invoice if payment is madewithin 30 days. If the payment is made on Day 31 then the full amount is paid.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic Discounting {{describes}} {{a collection of}} methods in which payment terms can be established between a buyer and supplier to accelerate payment for goods or services {{in return for a}} reduced price or discount. Dynamic Discounting methods are used for business-to-business transactions when contractual or pre-established early payment terms may not exist or the payment date does not conform to agreed upon discount terms. Dynamic Discounting includes the ability to agree upon terms that vary the discount according to the date of early payment. The earlier the payment, the greater the discount. In addition, it includes an ability for either buyer or supplier to propose an early payment date and discount for a one-time payment using electronic mail or specialized software. Through the use of dynamic discounting methods, buying organizations can increase the number and size of early payment discounts they receive and suppliers can get paid sooner at a lower cost of capital than alternative options. A range of concepts is available to implement dynamic discounting into supply chain finance (SCF): dynamic discounting {{can be seen as a}} comparatively simple form, whereby the supplier grants a <b>cash</b> <b>discount</b> for early payment of its invoices - the amount of the reduction and the time of payment are quickly and freely negotiable.|$|E
