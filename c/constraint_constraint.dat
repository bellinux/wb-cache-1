40|$|Opinion pollsters, {{political}} scientists and democratic theorists {{have long been}} concerned with the normative and methodological implications of nonattitudes (Converse, 1964). Of the proposed remedies to the weak and labile attitudinal responses proffered by an uninformed and disinterested public, perhaps the most ambitious to date has been Fishkin’s concept of the deliberative poll (Fishkin, 1991; 1995; 1997). Combining probability sampling with information intervention and increased deliberation affords a unique insight into what might be considered the true ‘voice of the people’. Yet while deliberative polling draws heavily on the general notion of political sophistication (Luskin, 1987), empirical analyses have tended to focus almost entirely on how the process of deliberation impacts on marginal totals of attitude items at both the individual and aggregate level (Fishkin, 1997; Luskin, Fishkin and Jowell, 2002; Sturgis 2003).

40|$|Abstract- Stable and {{effective}} enforcement of hard constraints {{is one of}} the crucial components in controlling physics-based dynamic simulation systems. The conventional explicit Baumgarte constraint stabilization confines the time step to be within a stability limit and requires users to pick problem-dependent coefficients to achieve fast convergence or to prevent oscillations. The recently proposed post-stabilization method has shown a successful constraint drift reduction but it does not guarantee the physically correct behavior of motion and requires additional computational cost to decrease the constraint errors. This paper presents our new implicit constraint enforcement technique that is stable over large time steps and does not require problem dependent stabilization parameters. This new implicit constraint enforcement method uses the future time step to estimate the correct magnitude of the constraint forces, resulting in better stability over bigger time steps. More importantly, the proposed method generates physically conforming constraint forces while minimizing the constraint drifts, resulting in physically correct motion. Its asymptotic computational complexity is same as the explicit Baumgarte method. It can be easily integrated into various constrained dynamic systems including rigid body or deformable structure applications. This paper describes a formulation of implicit constraint enforcement and an accumulated constraint error and dynamic behavior analysis for comparison with existing methods.

Rules converted from defaults with priorities min + n are represented as exceptions for equivalent rules of defaults with priorities min + n - 1. The resultant tree T reflects relationships between defaults with differing priorities (Fig.  3). In determining these subsumption relationships, the following must be observed: For two defaults d_ 1 =α _ 1 :β _ 1 /β _ 1 [...] and d_ 2 =α _ 2 :β _ 2 /β _ 2, where priority(d_ 1) < priority(d_ 2): The rule converted from d_ 2 {{is an exception}} of the rule converted from d_ 1 if α _ 1 subsumes α _ 2, that is, if w ∪ [...] α _ 2 - α _ 1.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the experience of}} people with chronic pain. Using the method of grounded theory, 29 chronic pain sufferers were interviewed at an outpatient pain clinic. A model depicting the basic social psychological process of maintaining a normal life through constraint was developed. This process revolved around people's perception of the constraints imposed by pain: bodily <b>constraint</b> (<b>constraint</b> on the body {{and its relationship to}} the environment); activity constraint (the constraint on what people could do); and identity constraint (the constraint on what people could be). The degree to which pain had challenged what people had previously accepted as 'normal' was illustrated through their evaluation of the impact of pain. The conclusion of this process of evaluation reflected how people coped with the constraints of pain-whether they were assimilated, accommodated, confronted or subverted. In assimilation, the constraints were absorbed and normal life maintained. In accommodation, the constraints were accepted and normal life re-defined. In confrontation, the constraints were rejected and pre-pain identities and activities pursued despite leading to increased pain levels. In subversion, attempts were made to retain pre-pain identities, and although pain levels were minimized, activities were altered to a significant degree. The limitations imposed by pain often form the focus of people's coping efforts, rather than the pain per se. The desire to retain pre-pain 'normal' lifestyles may underlie people's use of coping strategies that exacerbate pain intensity and pain-related disability. Future research needs to explore both the relationship between adjustment to pain and adjustment to the restrictions associated with ageing, and the role of body techniques and identity management in adjustment to pain in order to understand factors which may promote pain acceptance.

These perceptions of the source of reinforcement received in a particular situation are called internal or external attributions of control over reinforcement. Situational variables, as well as characteristics of the person, influence the location of the attribution on the internal-external continuum. In this paper, two aspects of experience which determine the attribution of control over reinforcement in specific situations are suggested: reinforcement contingency, and <b>constraint.</b> (<b>Constraint</b> is defined as the lack of resources to engage all the behavior-reinforcement sequences which a person associates with the situation.) An experiment designed to examine the effect of varying contingency and constraint, on attribution of reinforcement control to internal or external sources, is described, and the results reported. Julian Rotter proposed in 1954 that situational attributions of control are partly determined by an individual's generalized expectancy for internal or external control of reinforcements; and that individuals may be characterized by their position on a dimension of internal to external generalized expectancy. Such a generalized expectancy, hereinafter referred to as locus of control (Rotter's term), would operate to determine attribution of control in a given situation {{to the extent that the}} cause of the reinforcement was ambiguous. Rotter's model of the ontology of locus of control considers locus of control the product of a series of experiences in which control is predominantly attributed either to internal, or external, causes. The design of the experiment referred to above permitted an examination of the relationship between model of the ontology of locus of control considers locus of control the product of a series of experiences in which control is predominantly attributed either to internal, or external, causes.

40|$|Introduction: In {{the present}} study, dealing with water deficit {{challenges}} for Gorgan River Basin has been considered. Golestan province's economy {{is dependent on}} agriculture but the occurrence of drought periods reduced the agricultural production and consequently the region's economy is in crisis. Therefore, performing studies for programming {{and management of the}} water resources of the province and the water allocation in the margin of Voshmgir dam in Gorganrood basin {{has a great deal of}} importance. The issue of the allocation of water resources is proposed in order to maximize the expected profit of the water system. According to the regional water organization policy, one of the main goals of Voshmgir dam water management is the allocation of water between the competing consumers. If the amount of promised water is released in the future, the expected net profit of the system will be realized and if it is not released, the system will experience losses. Materials and Methods: In this studyWater supply is considered stochasticand objective function of the model is to maximize the system (Agriculture, Aquaculture and Environment) profit and optimal allocation of water during the programming period using a two-stage stochastic model as follows: Constraint of the available land: Constraint of the available water in each of the main canals: Constraint of the available water: Constraint of the amount of inflow water Reservoir capacity <b>constraint</b> <b>Constraint</b> on the maximum and minimum water demand for environmental sector Constraint on the maximum and minimum water demand for crops Constraint on the maximum and minimum water demand for warm-water fish Constraint on non-negativity of the decision variables in the model Results and Discussion: The length of the right main canal of this network is about 17. 76 km and the length of the left main canal is about 21. 338 km. In this study, is considered for the right main canal and is considered for left main canal. Lands under irrigation network are considered in three regions. Right bank regions and sample farm are covered by the network in the right part of the network and the left bank regions are covered by the network on the left. Thus, there is one region in the left side of the network and there are two regions on the right. The major crops cultivated in the agricultural lands of the network include wheat, barley, canola, cotton, alfalfa, sunflower, rice, cotton-melon, and maize. Due to the random nature of the river flow to the dam, fixed and determined data cannot be used to calculate the volume of water entering the irrigation system, for this reason, using simulation techniques, we can predict the future behavior of the system for each reservoir. The results of the study showed that only agriculturalsector suffers from water deficit and target water demand of the other sectors is supplied and there is no deficit of water for these sectors and target water demand, lack of water and the final allocation of water in the agricultural sector are declined under different efficiencies of irrigation. If other sectors are remained unchanged and irrigation efficiency did not affect them, it is because irrigation efficiency has a direct impact on the water use in agriculture and decreases by increasing the efficiency of the allocated water to this sector and the amount of water stored in the reservoir for the coming year is added. By increasing the efficiency of irrigation which has a direct impact on water use in agriculture sector, the amount of water deficit reduced as a result of the increased system profit. Conclusion: The results showed that there is no water deficit for aquaculture and environmental sectors in the scenarios of dry, wet and normal years and the target water demand of these sectors is supplied. However, the amount of water deficit in agricultural sector in dry year with the probability of 18...|$|E
