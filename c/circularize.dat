5|$|The moons {{discovered}} by Galileo—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are {{among the largest}} satellites in the Solar System. The orbits of three of them (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors {{at the same point}} in every orbit it makes. The tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to <b>circularize</b> their orbits.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} before the Voyager 1 encounter, Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds {{published}} a paper in the journal Science predicting a volcanically modified surface and a differentiated interior, with distinct rock types rather than a homogeneous blend. They based this prediction on models of Io's interior that took into account the massive amount of heat produced by the varying tidal pull of Jupiter on Io resulting from Io's Laplace resonance with Europa and Ganymede not allowing its orbit to <b>circularize.</b> Their calculations suggested that the amount of heat generated for an Io with a homogeneous interior would be three times greater than the amount of heat generated by radioactive isotope decay alone. This effect would be even greater with a differentiated Io.|$|E

500|$|Io orbits Jupiter at a {{distance}} of [...] from Jupiter's center and [...] from its cloudtops. It is the innermost of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, its orbit lying between those of Thebe and Europa. Including Jupiter's inner satellites, Io is the fifth moon out from Jupiter. It takes Io about 42.5 hours to complete one orbit around Jupiter (fast enough for its motion to be observed over a single night of observation). Io is in a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Europa and a 4:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Ganymede, completing two orbits of Jupiter for every one orbit completed by Europa, and four orbits for every one completed by Ganymede. This resonance helps maintain Io's orbital eccentricity (0.0041), which in turn provides the primary heating source for its geologic activity. Without this forced eccentricity, Io's orbit would <b>circularize</b> through tidal dissipation, leading to a geologically less active world.|$|E
2500|$|Endeavour {{lifted off}} from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39 at 08:56 EDT on 16 May 2011. The launch of Endeavour came after an on-time tanking process which filled the shuttle's {{external}} tank {{with more than}} [...] of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen; the tanking started at 23:36 EDT on 15 May 2011. Once the shuttle and crew were on-orbit, they set about preparing the shuttle for the mission ahead. The first tasks they completed were opening the payload bay doors, activating the Ku-band antenna, and activating the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), {{also known as the}} Canadarm. Prior to this, commander Mark Kelly and pilot Greg Johnson completed an engine firing, known as the OMS-2 burn, to <b>circularize</b> the orbit of the shuttle. They also completed another engine firing, the NC-1 burn, to help the shuttle catch up to the International Space Station (ISS). After completing these initial tasks, the crew activated the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, allowing it to be monitored by teams on the ground. Later in the crew's work day, they downlinked video recordings that had been shot of the external tank by mission specialist Mike Fincke.|$|E

50|$|DNA {{circularization}} {{depends on}} both the axial (bending) stiffness and torsional (rotational) stiffness of the molecule. For a DNA molecule to successfully <b>circularize</b> it must be long enough to easily bend into the full circle and must have the correct number of bases so the ends are in the correct rotation to allow bonding to occur. The optimum length for circularization of DNA is around 400 base pairs (136 nm), with an integral number of turns of the DNA helix, i.e., multiples of 10.4 base pairs. Having a non integral number of turns presents a significant energy barrier for circularization, for example a 10.4 x 30 = 312 base pair molecule will <b>circularize</b> hundreds of times faster than 10.4 x 30.5 ≈ 317 base pair molecule.|$|E
50|$|The {{second type}} of orbit {{insertion}} is used for newly launched satellites and other spacecraft. The majority of space launch vehicles used today can only launch a payload into a very narrow range of orbits. The angle relative to the equator and maximum altitude of these orbits are constrained by the rocket and launch site used. Given this limitation, most payloads are first launched into a transfer orbit, where an additional thrust maneuver is required to <b>circularize</b> the elliptical orbit which results from the initial space launch. The key difference between this kind of maneuver and powered trans-planetary orbit insertion is the significantly lesser change in velocity required to raise or <b>circularize</b> an existing planetary orbit, versus canceling out the considerable velocity of interplanetary cruise.|$|E

Both types of non-colinear RNAs are also abundant in RNA-seq of different tissue from both the African and the Indonesian coelacanth.

These gene products are believed to be transcription activators [...] and may be regulated by the expression of viral micro RNAs. Subsequent expression of [...] "early genes" [...] then occurs and activates, for instance, viral DNA polymerases. Early genes are also involved in the rolling circle replication that follows.|$|R
40|$|Bulge-helix-bulge (BHB) {{elements}} {{guide the}} enzymatic splicing machinery that in Archaea excises introns from tRNAs, rRNAs from their primary precursor, and {{accounts for the}} assembly of piece-wise encoded tRNAs. This processing pathway renders the intronic sequences as <b>circularized</b> RNA species. Although archaeal transcriptomes harbor {{a large number of}} circular small RNAs, it remains unknown whether most or all of them are produced through BHB-dependent splicing. We therefore conduct a genome-wide survey of BHB elements of a phylogenetically diverse set of archaeal species and complement this approach by searching for BHB-like structures in the vicinity of <b>circularized</b> transcripts. We find that besides tRNA introns, the majority of box C/D snoRNAs is associated with BHB elements. Not all <b>circularized</b> sRNAs, however, can be explained by BHB elements, suggesting that {{there is at least one}} other mechanism of RNA circularization at work in Archaea. Pattern search methods were unable, however, to identify common sequence and/or secondary structure features that could be characteristic for such a mechanism...|$|R

40|$|High-capacity “gutless” {{adenovirus}} vectors (HC-AdV) mediate long-term transgene {{expression in}} resting cells in vitro and in vivo {{because of low}} toxicity and immunogenicity. However, in proliferating cells, expression is transient since HC-AdV genomes do not possess elements that allow for replication and segregation of the replicated genomes to daughter cells. We developed a binary HC-AdV system that, under certain conditions, allows for significantly prolonged episomal maintenance of HC-AdV genomes in proliferating tissue culture cells, resulting in sustained transgene expression. After transduction of target cells the linear HC-AdV genomes were <b>circularized</b> by the DNA recombinase FLPe, which was expressed from the second HC-AdV.
