5|$|Most fungi {{have both}} a haploid and a diploid stage {{in their life}} cycles. In sexually {{reproducing}} fungi, compatible individuals may combine by fusing their hyphae together into an interconnected network; this process, anastomosis, {{is required for the}} initiation of the sexual cycle. Many ascomycetes and basidiomycetes go through a dikaryotic stage, in which the nuclei inherited from the two parents do not combine immediately after <b>cell</b> <b>fusion,</b> but remain separate in the hyphal cells (see heterokaryosis).|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of A.gallica {{includes}} two diploidization–haploidization events. The first {{of these is the}} usual process of <b>cell</b> <b>fusion</b> (forming a diploid) followed by meiosis during the formation of haploid basidiospores. The second event is more cryptic, and occurs before fruit body formation. In most basidiomycetous fungi, the hyphae of compatible mating types will fuse to form a two-nucleate, or dikaryotic stage; this stage is not observed in Armillaria species, which have cells that are mostly monokaryotic and diploid. Genetic analyses suggest that the dikaryotic mycelia undergo an extra haploidization event prior to fruit body formation to create a genetic mosaic. These regular and repeating haploidization events result in increased genetic diversity, which helps the fungus to adapt to unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, like drought.|$|E
25|$|One common {{means to}} produce very large cells is by <b>cell</b> <b>fusion</b> to form syncytia. For example, very long (several inches) {{skeletal}} muscle cells are formed by fusion {{of thousands of}} myocytes. Genetic studies of the fruit fly Drosophila have revealed several genes that are required {{for the formation of}} multinucleated muscle cells by fusion of myoblasts. Some of the key proteins are important for cell adhesion between myocytes and some are involved in adhesion-dependent cell-to-cell signal transduction that allows for a cascade of <b>cell</b> <b>fusion</b> events.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{physiological}} role of calpains is still poorly understood, {{they have been}} shown to be active participants in processes such as cell mobility and cell cycle progression, as well as cell-type specific functions such as long-term potentiation in neurons and <b>cell</b> <b>fusion</b> in myoblasts. Under these physiological conditions, a transient and localized influx of calcium into the cell activates a small local population of calpains (for example, those close to Ca2+ channels), which then advance the signal transduction pathway by catalyzing the controlled proteolysis of its target proteins. Other reported roles of calpains are in cell function, helping to regulate clotting and the diameter of blood vessels, and playing a role in memory. Calpains have been implicated in apoptotic cell death, and appear to be an essential component of necrosis. Detergent fractionation revealed the cytosolic localization of calpain.|$|E

25|$|Adult {{stem cells}} {{are not able to}} proliferate and {{differentiate}} as effectively in vitro as they are able to in vivo. Adult stem cells can come from many different tissue locations, {{but it is difficult to}} isolate them because they are defined by behavior and not surface markers. A method has yet to be developed for clearly distinguishing between stem cells and the differentiated cells surrounding them. However, surface markers can still be used to a certain extent to remove most of the unwanted differentiated cells. Stem cell plasticity is the ability to differentiate across embryonic germ line boundaries. Though, the presence of plasticity has been hotly contested. Some claim that plasticity is caused by heterogeneity among the cells or <b>cell</b> <b>fusion</b> events. Currently, cells can be differentiated across cell lines with yields ranging from 10% to 90% depending on techniques used. More studies need to be done in order to standardize the yield with transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiation of multipotent stem cells is a potential means for obtaining stem cells that are not available or not easily obtained in the adult.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} theory, {{proposed by}} Thomas Cavalier-Smith, was labeled the Neomuran revolution. The designation [...] "Neomuran revolution" [...] {{refers to the}} appearances of the common ancestors of eukaryotes and archaea. Cavalier-Smith proposes that the first neomurans emerged 850 million years ago. Other molecular biologists assume that this group appeared much earlier, but Cavalier-Smith dismisses these claims because {{they are based on}} the [...] "theoretically and empirically" [...] unsound model of molecular clocks. Cavalier-Smith's theory of the Neomuran revolution has implications for the evolutionary history of the cellular machinery for recombination and sex. It suggests that this machinery evolved in two distinct bouts separated by a long period of stasis; first the appearance of recombination machinery in a bacterial ancestor which was maintained for 3 Gy, until the neomuran revolution when the mechanics were adapted to the presence of nucleosomes. The archaeal products of the revolution maintained recombination machinery that was essentially bacterial, whereas the eukaryotic products broke with this bacterial continuity. They introduced <b>cell</b> <b>fusion</b> and ploidy cycles into cell life histories. Cavalier-Smith argues that both bouts of mechanical evolution were motivated by similar selective forces: the need for accurate DNA replication without loss of viability.|$|E
2500|$|Hybridomas are cells {{obtained}} by fusing tumor cells (which can divide infinitely) and immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes (plasma cells). Hybridomas can {{be expanded to}} produce large quantities of immunoglobulins with a given unique specificity (monoclonal antibodies). One problem is to single out the hybridomas from the large excess of unfused cells after the <b>cell</b> <b>fusion.</b> One common way to solve this is to use thymidine kinase negative (TK−) tumor cell lines for the fusion. The thymidine kinase negative cells are {{obtained by}} growing the tumor cell line {{in the presence of}} thymidine analogs, that kill the thymidine kinase positive (TK+) cells. The negative cells can then be expanded and used for the fusion with TK+ plasma cells. After fusion, the cells are grown in a medium with methotrexate or aminopterin that inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase thus blocking the de novo synthesis of thymidine monophosphate. One such medium that is commonly used is HAT medium, which contains hypoxanthine, aminopterinand thymidine. The unfused cells from the thymidine kinase-deficient cell line die because they have no source of thymidine monophosphate. The lymphocytes eventually die because they are not [...] "immortal." [...] Only the hybridomas that have [...] "immortality" [...] from their cell line ancestor and thymidine kinase from the plasma cell survive. Those that produce the desired antibody are then selected and cultured to produce the monoclonal antibody. Hybridoma cells can also be isolated using the same principle as described with respect to another gene the HGPRT, which synthesizes IMP necessary for GMP nucleotide synthesis in the salvage pathway.|$|E
50|$|Polyethylene glycol <b>cell</b> <b>fusion</b> is the simplest, {{but most}} toxic, way to fuse cells.

Following immunizations with the membrane fraction of human spermatozoa and <b>cell</b> <b>fusions,</b> hybrid <b>cells</b> were cultured in a semi-solid HAT-selection medium to maximize the number of monoclones recovered. Subcultures were made in liquid phase 7 to 10 days after <b>cell</b> <b>fusions</b> by removing colonies from the initial medium.

40|$|Apparatus {{and methods}} were {{developed}} to enable mechanically facilitated cell-cell electrofusion to be performed. The apparatus and methods mechanically place cells in contact before fusion. The key component of this fusion system was a newly developed fusion chamber. The chamber was composed of two functionally identical electrodes that were housed in a multi-layer structure. The layers functioned as support for the electrodes. They also allowed adjustment of the distance between opposing electrode faces. The electrodes were constructed {{in a manner that}} allowed cells to be deposited, by vacuum, onto each face.
