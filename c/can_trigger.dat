5|$|Although the edibility of M.frustrata was not {{mentioned}} in the original description, Kuo has elsewhere written of the edibility of North American Morchella. In general, morels should not be eaten raw, as they <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. Their flavor is enhanced after they are fried, stuffed, or dried.|$|E
5|$|Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is RNA {{with two}} {{complementary}} strands, {{similar to the}} DNA found in all cells. dsRNA forms the genetic material of some viruses (double-stranded RNA viruses). Double-stranded RNA such as viral RNA or siRNA <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> RNA interference in eukaryotes, as well as interferon response in vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> earthquakes {{as part of}} hydraulic fracturing. The {{project in}} Basel, Switzerland was suspended because more than 10,000 seismic events measuring up to 3.4 on the Richter Scale occurred over the first 6 days of water injection.|$|E
50|$|Triggers {{are fully}} {{supported}} {{and can be}} attached to tables. <b>Triggers</b> <b>can</b> be per-column and conditional, in that UPDATE <b>triggers</b> <b>can</b> target specific columns of a table, and <b>triggers</b> <b>can</b> be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the trigger's WHERE clause. <b>Triggers</b> <b>can</b> be attached to views by using the INSTEAD OF condition. Multiple triggers are fired in alphabetical order. In addition to calling functions written in the native PL/pgSQL, <b>triggers</b> <b>can</b> also invoke functions written in other languages like PL/Python or PL/Perl.|$|R

5|$|Psoriasis is a {{long-lasting}} {{autoimmune disease}} characterized by patches of abnormal skin. These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and scaly. Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage. Injury {{to the skin}} <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which {{is known as the}} Koebner phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of an {{expanding}} supernova remnant <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> star formation by compressing nearby, dense molecular clouds in space. The increase in turbulent pressure can also prevent star formation if the cloud {{is unable to}} lose the excess energy.|$|E
5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the time}} SUNCT occurs spontaneously; however, attacks <b>can</b> be <b>triggered</b> by simple daily stimuli such as {{touching}} the face or scalp, washing, chewing, eating, talking, coughing, blowing nose, or showering. They also <b>can</b> be <b>triggered</b> by light (including sunlight and fluorescent lights) and injuries. Stimuli capable of triggering a cluster headache, including alcohol, smoke, strong smells and a warm environment, <b>can</b> also <b>trigger</b> SUNCT in a few patients.In some cases, patients of episodic SUNCT only exhibit symptoms biannually in spring and fall. This periodicity suggests that the hypothalamus, which is responsive to day length and photoperiod for regulating circadian and seasonal rhythms, has a role in its triggering.|$|R

5|$|Each {{character}} can summon a specific Eidolon into battle. These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is summoned, the player <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> a feature called Gestalt Mode, {{in which the}} Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.|$|E
5|$|Stealth is a {{significant}} element of the gameplay; frequent gunfire can alert distant guards, and activated alarms <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> infinitely-respawning enemies. Therefore, to avoid gunfights with numerous opponents, it is advantageous to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot or hear the player. Certain weapons incorporate suppressor or telescopic sight attachments to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly. There are no health-recovery items in the game, although armour vests can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar.|$|E
5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.|$|E

50|$|SCRs are {{unidirectional}} devices (i.e. {{can conduct}} current only in one direction) {{as opposed to}} TRIACs, which are bidirectional (i.e. current can flow through them in either direction). SCRs <b>can</b> be <b>triggered</b> normally only by currents going into the gate as opposed to TRIACs, which <b>can</b> be <b>triggered</b> normally by either a positive or a negative current applied to its gate electrode.|$|R
5|$|At the 2014 Wales summit, {{the leaders}} of NATO's member states reaffirmed their pledge to spend the {{equivalent}} of at least 2% of their gross domestic products on defense. In 2015, five of its 28 members met that goal. On 15 June 2016, NATO officially recognized cyberwarfare as an operational domain of war, just like land, sea and aerial warfare. This means that any cyber attack on NATO members <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Montenegro became the 29th and newest member of NATO on 5 June 2017, amid strong objections from Russia.|$|E
5|$|Despite their rarity, hurricanes {{are among}} Arizona's most {{significant}} weather makers. In years when Arizona {{is affected by}} a tropical cyclone, these can be responsible for up to 25% of the rainfall in areas along the Colorado River. Arizona hurricanes are also responsible for torrential rains in localized areas, with the state's 24-hour rainfall record— of precipitation—occurring during Hurricane Nora's landfall in 1997. The heavy rainfall <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> extensive flash floods, {{such as the ones}} produced by the remnants of Tropical Storm Octave in 1983, or the lingering moisture from Tropical Storm Emilia in 2006.|$|E
5|$|This mode was {{introduced}} in WWE 2K15, social media followers were counted for the WWE Universe liking the player (the number of followers can decrease if bad performances occur during matches); pre-set cutscenes {{that used to be}} created for Story Mode in WWE '12 to WWE 2K14 appear at random times. In WWE 2K16, the player has to fight for ranks to earn championships (the main goal is to reach the WWE Hall of Fame by fulfilling certain requirements). WWE 2K17 brings in a promo engine and every action <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> a backstage brawl depending on what answer the created superstar gives. WWE 2K18 continues with the promo engine from 2k17 with free roaming now a central focus.|$|E

5|$|Virtually all {{microbes}} <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> an antibody response. Successful {{recognition and}} eradication {{of many different}} types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens. It has been estimated that humans generate about 10billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen. Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of genes available to make these proteins is limited {{by the size of the}} human genome. Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E
5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.|$|E
50|$|Relapse is {{the biggest}} problem for {{recovering}} addicts; an addict can be forced to abstain from using drugs while they are admitted in a treatment clinic, but once they leave the clinic they {{are at risk of}} relapse. Relapse <b>can</b> be <b>triggered</b> by stress, cues associated with past drug use, or re-exposure to the substance. Animal models of relapse <b>can</b> be <b>triggered</b> in the same way.|$|R

5|$|There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, {{both teams}} must send out three Pokémon {{in a row}} at once; Pokémon on {{the left or right}} side can only attack the opponent's Pokémon on the same side or in the center. Changing {{position}} takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pokémon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pokémon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> Double Battles against wild Pokémon rather than only Single Battles as usual.|$|E
5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Vesperia is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{set in a}} fantasy world featuring three-dimensional environments and characters. The game's environments are split into two types. On the field map, the main characters navigate reduced-scale environments. A compass and mini-map are displayed, along with towns, other named locations, and enemy icons. Striking an enemy icon triggers a battle, while interacting with a town causes the party to enter it. In battle and towns or similar locations, characters move around environments built on a lifelike scale relative to the human characters. In these areas, the party may interact with non-player characters (NPCs). Within these environments, items such as crates came be moved by the currently-assigned character. After {{a certain point in}} the game, an item called the Sorcerer's Ring is given to the party, enabling them to shoot bolts of energy. These bolts can be used to activate switches, move objects, and attack enemies from a distance. Save points can be found in dungeons and towns. Items such as equipment and weapons are purchased with Gald, the in-game currency. While in environments, players <b>can</b> <b>trigger</b> optional character conversations called Skits. In Skits, characters are represented by head-and-shoulder portraits, and the conversations can range from dramatic to comedic.|$|E
