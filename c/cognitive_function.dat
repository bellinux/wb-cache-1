40|$|Deteriorations in <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> {{and sleep}} are the {{inevitable}} {{parts of the}} ageing process, and they are two very common complaints among the elderly population. Given their high relevance and great impact on daily functioning, many studies have attempted to address the associations of sleep problems and <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> with ageing, yet the direction of associations remained unclear. Several recent studies suggested that caffeine, a common psychostimulant present in coffee and tea, might have a beneficial effect on agerelated decline in <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning.</b> Nonetheless, the dose-dependent effect of caffeine intake on specific domains of <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> and the potential cost of compromised nocturnal sleep at high dose of caffeine remained to be investigated. In view {{of the lack of}} study on identifying the correlation and interaction between sleep, <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> caffeine consumption habit, and age, this thesis reported two studies that clarified these relationships in the elderly population. Furthermore, the studies explored the possibility to utilize sleep and caffeine as a regimen to improve daytime <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> in the older population. Study 1 was a retrospective study that aimed {{to examine the relationship between}} sleep, habitual caffeine consumption, <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> and mood in the two different age groups, the young adult and the elderly. Eighty-nine healthy elderly and forty-three healthy young adults participated in this study and completed a battery of neuropsychological assessment and a set of questionnaires. Findings revealed changes in multiple domains of sleep and <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> upon ageing. The age-related differences in sleep and <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> were correlated. Moreover, result suggested that regular caffeine consumption has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> but the effect was only observed in female. Study 2 was built on the relationship between sleep, <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> and caffeine as found in Study 1. It aimed to investigate the effect of caffeine and daytime nap on the <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> in the healthy elderly adopting a repeated measure, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Twenty-four healthy elderly were recruited for this study, and each of them were required to attend four experimental sessions with a one-week intersession interval. In each session, participants were required to take a rest or take a nap with or without a certain dosage of caffeine in the afternoon. Comparisons on their cognitive performance before and after the rest/ nap revealed an effect of nap and caffeine on improving subjective feeling of sleepiness and fatigue. Behavioural measurements revealed no effect on daytime nap on <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> yet specific sleep stage and certain sleep oscillations were associated with post-nap changes in <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning.</b> In summary, the present studies demonstrated the associations of sleep and caffeine consumption with <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> in the elderly. Habitual caffeine consumption was associated with a female-specific beneficial effect on <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning.</b> Furthermore, daytime nap combined with the use of acute dose of caffeine might not enhance <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> but could improve mood and well-being in the elderly. Findings from present studies suggested that further research could explore ways to maximise the benefit of napping in the elderly. published_or_final_versionPsychologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

5|$|One {{proposed}} {{explanation for}} the existence of count-classifiers is that they serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one: in other words, they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects. An alternative account is that they serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function (a communicative function when people interact) rather than an abstract function within the mind. Specifically, it has been proposed that count-classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse, to introduce major characters or items in a story or conversation, or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and more salient. In this way, count-classifiers might not serve an abstract grammatical or <b>cognitive</b> <b>function,</b> but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it.|$|E

Peripheral vascular disease and diabetes are the most prevalent precipitating causes of lower limb amputation in economically developed countries.

The first aim of the present research was to establish a comprehensive profile of <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> in people engaged in lower limb amputation rehabilitation. The second aim was to examine relationships between selected <b>cognitive</b> <b>functions,</b> rehabilitation engagement, and prosthetic, mobility, and psychosocial rehabilitation outcomes. Comprehensive neuropsychological data was collected from 87 participants with lower limb amputations on admission to comprehensive rehabilitation. Prosthetic (use, satisfaction), mobility, and psychosocial (activation, adjustment, distress, social support, community participation) outcomes were examined at discharge, six months, and 12 months post-discharge. Clinician-rated rehabilitation engagement was examined at discharge. Impairments in overall <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> estimated premorbid <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> reasoning, psychomotor function, information processing, attention, memory, visuospatial functions, language, and executive functions were evident. Aetiology was not related to <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning.</b> Outcomes were generally longitudinally stable.

5|$|An {{elevated}} core temperature, {{leading to}} increased symptom presentation {{has been noted}} during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS {{during the course of}} exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and <b>cognitive</b> <b>function.</b> These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies.

5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E

A primary goal of our analyses {{was to determine whether}} social participation predicted <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> over-and-above physical health, depression, and physical activity in a sample with adequate power to detect unique effects. Method: The sample included aging adults (N = 19, 832) who participated in a large, multi-national study and provided data across six years; split into two random subsamples. Unique associations between the predictors of interest and <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> over time and within occasion were assessed in a latent curve growth model.
