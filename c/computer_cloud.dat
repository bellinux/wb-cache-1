In order to build software to fit {{into one of these}} models, a scalable, easy to deploy storage tier is required. Distributed, non-SQL databases use multiple techniques to distribute information, guarantee data consistency and grow, but unfortunately most developments were designed with a single class of applications in mind, which means that they bring many constraints for developers. Existent solutions range from simple key-value databases to more complex approaches usually developed for data indexing. Our approach is a multi-purpose, distributed database engine that features an abstract query interface and plug-in-able internal data structures. The database, called ZATARA, is tested on an Amazon EC 2 infrastructure with 196 nodes. In this environment it is able to deliver more than 20 million transactions per second, scaling almost linearly with the number of nodes. From the performance point of view, these results demonstrate our initial assumptions that {{it is not necessary to}} expose a particular data structure in order for the database to scale. Although Zatara cannot replace SQL databases in all deployments, it provides sufficient flexibility to make it a viable choice for most applications that have to scale indefinitely. Also, it can be used as a caching system in order to reduce load on the SQL tier, in these scenario being trivial to add it to an existing application...|$|E

Experts predict 25 % growth in 2013. Therefore, the question arises: are Latvian IT industry entrepreneurs ready to follow the new trend in software development. The objective of this paper is to analyze the existing cloud computing services that are based on the SaaS principle both in Latvia and abroad. The aim is to investigate whether there is any difference between the strategies adopted by the Latvian and European/American counterparts. Each portal was evaluated according to three parameters - price, functionality and appearance. Acquainted with the beta versions of portals study participants had to write a reflection and answer the questionnaire developed for the purpose of smoothing qualitative assessment inaccuracies. The research results provide an insight into cloud services in Latvia and define gaps that hinder their development. The results indicate that the Latvian SaaS providers have not fully realize the benefits of cloud technologies and the services they provide are insufficient or, in some cases, unnecessary.

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The processing of magnetotelluric (MT) data is typically {{carried out on}} a desktop computer {{and as a result}} suffers from a number of drawbacks. The time taken to process the data on the desktop computer is unacceptably long and can take approximately a month. The limited amount of random-access memory (RAM) in the desktop computer limits the length of the time series {{that can be used in}} the bounded influence remote referencing processing (BIRRP) program. Cloud computing is a new high performance computing (HPC) technology that can be accessed over the internet and has the potential to address the drawbacks presented by the desktop <b>computer.</b> <b>Cloud</b> computing reduces the cost of HPC by pooling computing resources on a large scale. Cloud computing offers on-demand resources allowing the user to use only what they need and to change the type of resources they require to suit an evolving need. To utilise the HPC capabilities of the cloud, a problem must exhibit a high degree of parallelisation. MT processing is particularly well suited to cloud computing because of its inherent ability to parallelise by the number of stations. To enable automatic utilisation of the cloud resources, workflow technology can be used in conjunction with the existing MT processing codes. This new approach to MT processing presents the opportunity to addresses other inefficiencies in the processing. As the cloud is accessible over the internet, this presents the opportunity to perform some processing in the field. The ability to process data in the field is advantageous because it allows for near instant feedback about the quality of the obtained data. This feedback can then be used by the survey team to change the survey to optimise the quality of the obtained data if required. However, to achieve this, a number of new processing techniques need to be introduced into the workflow. Thesis (B. Sc. (Hons)) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Physical Sciences, 201...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{optimization}} framework for solving multi-agent nonlinear programs subject to inequality constraints {{while keeping the}} agents' state trajectories private. Each agent has an objective function depending only upon its own state and the agents are collectively subject to global constraints. The agents do not directly {{communicate with each other}} but instead route messages through a trusted <b>cloud</b> <b>computer.</b> The <b>cloud</b> <b>computer</b> adds noise to data being sent to the agents in accordance with the framework of differential privacy in order to keep each agent's state trajectory private from all other agents and any eavesdroppers. This private problem {{can be viewed as a}} stochastic variational inequality and is solved using a projection-based method for solving variational inequalities that resembles a noisy primal-dual gradient algorithm. Convergence of the optimization algorithm in the presence of noise is proven and a quantifiable trade-off between privacy and convergence is extracted from this proof. Simulation results are provided that demonstrate numerical convergence for both ϵ-differential privacy and (ϵ, δ) -differential privacy. Comment: 38 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{distributed}} computing systems, including Grids and Compute Utilities, and now Clouds, becomes a consideration for businesses hoping to manage start-up costs and times, {{as well as}} reduce the physical and environmental footprint of infrastructures. Instead of purchasing and maintaining hardware and software, organisations and individuals {{can take advantage of}} pay-per- use (utility) models that relate directly to their requirements of infrastructures, platforms and software. However, such metered services are not widely adopted yet {{due to the lack of}} assurance of Quality of Service (QoS). It is suggested that such systems will only attain greater acceptance by a larger audience of commercial consumers if binding Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are provided that encompass service descriptions, costs of provision and, importantly, assurances on availability, performance, and liability. Prediction, quantification of risk, and consideration of liability in case of underperformance are considered essential for the future provision of <b>Computer</b> (<b>Cloud)</b> Economics - in particular, for the provision of SLAs through resource brokers, and generally to be more comparable to financial markets. The principal focus of this thesis is on building brokerage and related services for supporting growth of Cloud and contributing to future computational economics. A brokerage should provide negotiation mechanisms between consumers and providers, and perhaps manage available computer resources, to realise the goals of both parties. SLAs are key to this, where each SLA details price, risk, performance and QoS parameters, amongst others. This thesis presents a novel approach that supports the creation and management of Service Level Agreements, aimed towards improved uptake of cornmoditised computational infrastructures, platforms and software services. By analysing issues within current SLAs, it summarises necessary characteristics to be addressed in Cloud SLAs. Inspired by financial portfolio analysis and in particular by credit derivatives, this work demonstrates how the proposed Cloud Collateralised SLA Obligations (CSO), analogous to synthetic collateralised debt obligations (CDO), can be used to mitigate risk of failure or underperformance through diversification of compute resource portfolios. The CSO prices risk integrates into service insurance, and builds in penalties, and in contrast to well-known Cloud price models, relates variable performance to variable price. This performance-price relationship would also be necessary for the appropriate use of other financial models. Through Value-at-Risk (VaR) style analysis, the probability of failure (risk of underperformance) can be related to a confidence level for each SLA offer - the confidence of meeting the SLA. The thesis further identifies how performance tranches support an autonomic aspect in attempting to ensure satisfaction of higher-value SLAs as a trade off against higher-risk, lower-value SLAs. The approach can readily integrate with any SLA framework that supports real- time dynamic characteristics. Outcomes are broadly relevant to Cloud Computing, and more specifically to Infrastructure as a Service Clouds. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
