The Center for Advanced Manufacturing at the Potchefstroom {{campus of}} the North West University aims to develop a twin screw {{extruder}} that is able to process powder coating resin. The facility has thus far produced various components and sub systems for local and international manufacturers of extrusion products. The research presented in this thesis aims to both develop a twin screw extruder with an integrated <b>cooling</b> <b>roller</b> system and to investigate {{of the performance of}} a twin screw extruder. The development of a twin screw extruder consists of the selection of the drive section of the extruder, the complete design of a twin screw extruder gearbox, the investigation and design of a suitable barrel for the manufacturing of powder coatings as well as the development of a unique <b>cooling</b> <b>roller</b> unit for the forming of the processed product when exiting the extruder. The extruder was manufactured from the designed components and systems. It was found on further testing that it was capable of producing a powder coating resin of good quality. In order to evaluate the performance of an extruder, the transfer of energy through the extruder needs to be understood. Furthermore it is necessary to understand the theory behind each type of energy being consumed by the extruder, as well as the factors influencing the usage of that energy. The theories investigated were verified in practice by measuring the energy consumption of a twin screw extruder operated under various conditions. These tests provided a correlation between the consumption of mechanical and electrical energy. The results gave an indication of the effectiveness of the screw configuration of the processing section of the extruder, making it possible to determine how the configuration should be amended in order to improve the performance of the extruder. The two aims of the thesis were satisfactory completed. The developed twin screw extruder is able to manufacture powder coatings of good quality and the performance evaluation of a twin screw extruder was also successfully completed. It enables the manufacturer to measure and evaluate the energy consumption of the process in order to improve the performance of the extruder. Master...|$|E

40|$|It {{remains unknown}} whether {{continuous}} or scheduled intermittent bolus local anesthetic administration is preferable for transversus abdominis plane (TAP) catheters. We therefore tested {{the hypothesis that}} when using TAP catheters, providing local anesthetic in repeated bolus doses increases the cephalad-caudad cutaneous effects compared with a basal-only infusion. Bilateral TAP catheters (posterior approach) were inserted in 24 healthy volunteers followed by ropivacaine 2 mg/mL administration {{for a total of}} 6 hours. The right side was randomly assigned to either a basal infusion (8 mL/h) or bolus doses (24 mL administered every 3 hours for a total of 2 bolus doses) in a double-masked manner. The left side received the alternate treatment. The primary end point was the extent of sensory deficit as measured by <b>cool</b> <b>roller</b> along the axillary line at hour 6 (6 hours after the local anesthetic administration was initiated). Secondary end points included the extent of sensory deficit as measured by <b>cool</b> <b>roller</b> and Von Frey filaments along the axillary line and along a transverse line {{at the level of the}} anterior superior iliac spine at hours 0 to 6. Although there were statistically significant differences between treatments within the earlier part of the administration period, by hour 6 the difference in extent of sensory deficit to cold failed to reach statistical significance along the axillary line (mean = 0. 9 cm; SD = 6. 8; 95 % confidence interval - 2. 0 to 3. 8; P =. 515) and transverse line (mean = 2. 5 cm; SD = 10. 1; 95 % confidence interval - 1. 8 to 6. 8; P =. 244). Although the difference between treatments was statistically significant at various early time points for the horizontal, vertical, and estimated area measurements of both cold and mechanical pressure sensory deficits, no comparison remained statistically significant by hour 6. No evidence was found in this study involving healthy volunteers to support the hypothesis that changing the local anesthetic administration technique (continuous basal versus hourly bolus) when using ropivacaine 0. 2 % and TAP catheters at 8 mL/h and 24 mL every 3 hours significantly influences the cutaneous effects after 6 hours of administration. Additional research is required to determine whether changing variables (eg, local anesthetic concentration, basal infusion rate, bolus dose volume, and/or interval) would provide different results...|$|R

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{continuation}} of the RAIL - Rapid Automated Induction Lamination - process developed by S. Yarlagadda et al. at the Center for Composite Materials, University of Delaware, USA. The RAIL process was developed and optimized for laminating prepregs, i. e. preimpregnated carbon fibers that are oriented parallel to each other and then formed as a sheet 12 ” x 36 ”. These sheets are stacked so that there is always an angle between the fibers of two sheets that are in contact with each other. If the angle is zero degrees there will be no heat generated in the induction heating zone {{due to the fact that}} conductive loops are required for heating to occur. This project’s primary goal was to test an alternative combination of carbon fiber and thermoplastic polymer and run it in the existing RAIL machine. Carbon fiber weave would be stacked with thermoplastic film and the result would be a flexible and strong composite. Both raw materials could be delivered to the machine separately, on rolls, and the need for pre- impregnation would be eliminated. This would reduce the raw material cost compared to prepregs. A requirement was that the quality of the final composite had to be at least as good as the same composite manufactured in a hot press. The secondary goal was {{a continuation}} of the primary: it consisted of modifications of the RAIL process stages, allowing manufacture of non-flat laminates. For this purpose, aluminum molding dies were designed and manufactured and the process would then be a combination of lamination and a variant of pultrusion. The experiments that were carried out showed that it would be possible to replace prepregs with stacks of carbon fiber weave and thermoplastic film in the RAIL process. All experiments were done with Nylon™ as resin. Optical microscopy revealed that the process can heat the fiber weave enough to melt the resin and then evacuate the air in the stack at the consolidation stage. The cooling seemed sufficient as no voids were created. The preheat zone in the RAIL process was developed because impregnated carbon fibers were used at the time and it was necessary to melt the resin so that contact between the fibers could be achieved. Tests with carbon fiber weave and Nylon™ film indicated that the preheat station was not needed in order to reach the processing temperature because the majority of the heating occurs by induction heating inside each layer of the carbon fiber weave. However, preheating was still used for the evaluated laminates because the temperature distribution across the laminate turned out to be much easier to control with the preheating station active. The resulting laminate is very flexible and can easily be cut if desired. Molding dies were designed and manufactured. The purpose was to give the laminate a profile-type shape directly after the lamination stage. The <b>cooling</b> <b>rollers</b> would then have been replaced by the stationary molding dies.

40|$|Shading systems, if {{efficiently}} operated, {{can improve}} the internal environmental quality, namely both thermal and visual comfort, and reduce the energy consumption due to <b>cooling</b> needs. <b>Roller</b> shades represent {{one of the most}} commonly used types of shading systems, in particular in the tertiary sector. Not only they can be easily installed and maintained, but also they often represent the only design choice when existing buildings are considered. Although roller shades are characterized by a beam-beam and by a beam-diffuse transmittance, both changing according to the incidence angle, as the transmitted solar radiation decreases with the increase of it, they are typically modelled assuming equal reflectance and emissivity for both sides and perfect diffuser behavior, with transmittance and reflectance independent from the solar radiation incidence angle. Neglecting the daily variability of these properties can lead to underestimate their impact on the occupants comfort conditions. In this paper, different models for representing the roller shades behavior, embedded in two widely diffuse simulation codes have been compared with a set of measured data, recorded at the Bowen laboratories of the Purdue University (Indiana USA), combining thermal (Energy Plus) and lighting simulation (Energy Plus or DIVA for Rhino). The thermal properties of the building materials and the internal gains have been calibrated for the thermal simulation, in order to evaluate better the models capability of predicting the roller shades behavior. Then, starting from the simplest daylighting model, which assumes the roller shades as perfect diffusers, more complex characterizations have been considered and validated through the comparison with the measured data. ...|$|R
