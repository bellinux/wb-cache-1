5|$|Limited edition {{collectable}} <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> {{included in}} the first 500,000 US CDs that allowed fans to unlock exclusive content, such as photos and video, from the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Previously, <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> {{also sold}} in Tournament Packs {{typically}} containing three rares, ten uncommons, thirty-two commons, and thirty basic lands. Tournament Packs were discontinued after Shards of Alara.|$|E
5|$|SmarTrip was {{the first}} contact-less smart card for transit in the United States when WMATA began selling SmarTrip cards on May 18, 1999. By 2004, 650,000 SmarTrip <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> in circulation. On November 12, 2002, the first SmarTrip readers were used on Metrobuses. In May 2004, SmarTrip readers were {{introduced}} at parking garage gates. In December 2010, 1,800,000 SmarTrip <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> in use. In February 2011, WMATA replaced the antennas on all Metrorail faregates to improve the speed and range of its faregates' SmarTrip processing.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} round, 10 <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> dealt to each player. In each {{subsequent}} round one fewer <b>card</b> <b>is</b> dealt, until by the tenth and final round, each player receives only one <b>card.</b> <b>Cards</b> <b>are</b> dealt clockwise. The pile of remaining <b>cards</b> <b>is</b> placed face-down {{in the middle}} of the table, and its top <b>card</b> <b>is</b> turned over. The color of this <b>card</b> <b>is</b> the trump suit; a card of this color played to a trick will beat any other card played except a higher trump. If this top <b>card</b> <b>is</b> a Rage <b>card,</b> it <b>is</b> discarded and another <b>card</b> <b>is</b> turned over, until a color <b>card</b> <b>is</b> shown.|$|R
50|$|During play, <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} to be in one of 4 zones - Draw Pile (from which <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> drawn), Discard Pile (where discarded or cancelled <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> placed), Hand (where <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> placed when drawn and where <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> played from) and Field of View (where <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> played into). Each player has their own Field of View and Hand, whilst the Draw Pile and Discard Pile are shared.|$|R
50|$|Bee Playing <b>Cards</b> <b>are</b> {{comparable}} to Bicycle Playing Cards, though the stock {{used to produce}} Bee Playing <b>Cards</b> <b>is</b> different. Bee Playing <b>Cards</b> <b>are</b> often found in Hong Kong movies.|$|R
5|$|Ricardo Flores {{said that}} police found date rape drugs in his daughter's car, parked about 50 {{blocks from the}} hotel where she died. Her jewelry, money, {{identification}} and credit <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> missing, including about $1,000 her father had given her to purchase a laptop, and over $10,000 she had won earlier at the casino. Stephany reportedly kept this money in her car, but a police search found no money in it.|$|E
5|$|The Mutoscope {{worked on}} the same {{principle}} as a flip book, with individual image frames printed onto flexible cards attached to a circular core which revolved with the turn of a user-operated hand crank. The <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> lit by electric light bulbs inside the machine, a system devised by Arthur Marvin's brother, Henry, {{one of the founders}} of the Biograph company. Earlier machines had relied on reflected natural light.|$|E
5|$|The Octopus {{system was}} quickly adopted by other Creative Star joint venture partners, and KMB {{reported}} that by 2000, most bus journeys were completed using an Octopus card, with few coins used. Boarding a bus in Hong Kong without using the Octopus card requires giving exact change, making it cumbersome compared {{to using the}} Octopus card. By November 1998, 4.6 million <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> issued, and this rose to 9 million by January 2002.|$|E
50|$|A typical dip {{reader is}} used for reading credit cards where the data are either encoded on a {{magnetic}} stripe or an internal computer chip. The magnetic stripe on a <b>card</b> <b>is</b> typically read as the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> extracted. If the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> a smart <b>card,</b> then the data transfer typically takes place when the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> fully inserted. In this case, the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> held while data transfer is taking place.|$|R
50|$|After the <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> dealt, {{the next}} <b>card</b> <b>is</b> put face up; the suit of this <b>card</b> <b>is</b> the trump suit. In the games with 8 <b>cards</b> there <b>is</b> no <b>card</b> left to turn, and these games are played with no trump.|$|R
50|$|Action <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> {{another type}} of <b>card</b> that <b>is</b> held in their hand. Action <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> {{immediately}} resolved when played. Action <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> divided into three categories: attack, neutral, and defense. Defense action <b>cards</b> may <b>be</b> played at any time, while attack and neutral action <b>cards</b> may not <b>be</b> played unless the combined victory point total of both players is at least seven points.|$|R
5|$|A {{couple weeks}} later {{and during the}} full moon of September 19, 2013 an update was {{released}} which revealed limited edition railcards featuring promotional images of the film. The <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> scheduled to go on sale at the Shimbashi and Toyosu train stations between October 1 and 31, 2013. They granted a bearer access to the New Transit Yurikamome train which connects to the artificial island of Odaiba in Tokyo Bay between Minato and Kōtō in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} collaborations with Bryan Singer on The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if {{the film was}} working well without music, it was becoming a strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> removed due to complaints that {{there were too many}} characters to follow.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new cultural forms. Baseball <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E
50|$|An insert <b>card</b> <b>is</b> a <b>card</b> that <b>is</b> {{randomly}} {{inserted into}} packs of a sports card offering. These insert <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> {{not part of}} the regular numbering system of a set of sports cards and they tend to have a unique design. Another term for insert <b>cards</b> <b>is</b> chase <b>cards.</b> Insert cards either have their own numbering system (although some insert cards may have no number). Insert <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> found less frequently than base cards. Autographed cards, memorabilia cards and parallel <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> also classified as insert <b>cards.</b> Insert <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> randomly inserted into packs at a specific ratio. A 1:24 ratio specifies that on average one of every 24 packs will contain a card from that insert set.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>are</b> only 44 <b>cards</b> in {{the card}} deck. Kings and Queens <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> usually thrown out. 4 <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> usually dealt to each player {{although}} there is a variation where 5 <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> dealt ...|$|R
50|$|If the two <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> {{of equal}} value, a third <b>card</b> <b>is</b> dealt. If the third <b>card</b> <b>is</b> {{of the same}} value, then the payout for the player is 11:1, {{otherwise}} the hand is a push.|$|R
5|$|Events {{included}} horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, {{fighting with}} swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Booths and tents were erected in which games such as chess and <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> played for small stakes, and abundant food was supplied {{for everyone who}} attended. A temporary wooden structure called Dover Castle was erected in a natural amphitheatre on what {{is now known as}} Dover's Hill, complete with small cannons that were fired to begin the events.|$|E
5|$|Hiddleston {{lives in}} the Belsize Park area of north-west London. He {{was one of the}} celebrities (alongside Benedict Cumberbatch, E. L. James and Rachel Riley, among others) to design and sign his own card for the UK-based charity the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children. The {{campaign}} was launched by crafting company Stampin' Up! UK and the <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> auctioned off on eBay during May 2014. He is also a UK ambassador of the humanitarian and developmental assistance fund group UNICEF. He travelled to Guinea in early 2013 to help women and children and raise awareness about hunger and malnutrition. Hiddleston is a self-described feminist.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, {{bookseller}} Waterstones asked Rowling and 12 {{other writers}} (Sebastian Faulks, Doris Lessing, Lisa Appignanesi, Margaret Atwood, Lauren Child, Richard Ford, Neil Gaiman, Nick Hornby, Michael Rosen, Axel Scheffler, Tom Stoppard and Irvine Welsh) {{to compose a}} short piece of their own choosing on a single A5 card, which would then be sold at auction in aid of the charities Dyslexia Action and English PEN. Rowling's contribution was an 800-word Harry Potter prequel that concerns Harry's father, James Potter, and godfather, Sirius Black, and takes place three years before Harry was born. The <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> collated and sold for charity in book form in August 2008.|$|E
50|$|Moonga <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> {{divided into}} two categories: attack spells and support spells. Attack spell <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> used to damage the {{opponent}} or to protect against damage. Support spell <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> used to cause various other effects.|$|R

5|$|A {{total of}} 28 games {{distributed}} on 11 different game <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were {{included with the}} console—a set of 12 in America and {{a different set of}} 10 in other countries—with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or in a pack for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions.

A final four games were released for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Don Emry. The games do not enforce game rules or keep track of score; that is left up to the players.|$|E
5|$|After Christmas {{leave the}} company {{concentrated}} at Balcombe in Victoria {{where it was}} officially disbanded on 20 April 1945, {{although many of the}} men continued to serve in other signals units {{until the end of the}} war. Although complete records were unable to be maintained, a nominal roll of the unit lists the names of approximately 792 men that served in the NGAWW. During its service, the unit lost eight men killed in action, while another three died of other causes while on active service. The company had the distinction of being Australia's most highly decorated signals unit of World War II, with its members receiving one Member of the Order of the British Empire, ten Military Medals, and ten Mentions in Despatches. Numerous Commendation <b>Cards</b> <b>were</b> also awarded by the Commander-In-Chief. Flight Lieutenant Leigh Vial (then an RAAF pilot officer working as a Coastwatcher) was also awarded the US Distinguished Service Cross for service behind the lines around Salamaua during a joint mission with NGAWW personnel.|$|E
5|$|As Manchester United and Arsenal won the Premier League and FA Cup respectively, {{both teams}} met in another heated match at the Millennium Stadium {{a month earlier}} for the 2003 Community Shield. Phil Neville was booked in the first minute for a {{challenge}} on Patrick Vieira, and a minute later Ashley Cole received a booking for fouling Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Yellow <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> also given to Quinton Fortune and Paul Scholes for United and Patrick Vieira for Arsenal, Arsenal substitute Francis Jeffers was shown a straight red for a kick on Phil Neville and, despite originally going unpunished, Sol Campbell was later given a three-match ban by the FA for kicking out at Eric Djemba-Djemba. The game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes and United eventually won the Shield 4–3 on penalties. Ruud van Nistelrooy had his spot kick saved by debutant Jens Lehmann {{but it was his}} opposite number and fellow debutant Tim Howard who was the hero, saving penalties from Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Robert Pirès.|$|E

5|$|At {{the request}} of Lothian Buses, {{installation}} of 30 ticket machines at key bus stops began in 2007. Passengers had to purchase tickets before boarding the bus, reducing dwell times, but the machines were not popular with users and were scrapped in 2011. Consideration was given to installing similar on-street ticket machines, and new, advanced machines (capable of reading smartcards and accepting credit/debit <b>cards)</b> <b>were</b> installed in early 2014 at each tram stop. The new ticket machines are the Galexio-Plus type supplied by the French-based company Parkeon. however the option to accept banknotes or give change is not available. The minimum spend for a card transaction is £3 {{which is more than}} the cost for a single ticket.|$|E
5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase in which they would have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, you would be disappointed, as all <b>cards</b> <b>were</b> winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E
