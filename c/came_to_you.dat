500|$|After Alberta's {{two most}} {{prominent}} Liberals, Peter Talbot and Frank Oliver, {{made it clear}} that they were not interested, DeVeber considered himself as a possible candidate. [...] Less than two months before Alberta's formal creation, he wrote to his colleague in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories, Alexander Cameron Rutherford, that the possibilities [...] "practically <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and I, both of us weak enough God knows but we have the sense to see it." [...] DeVeber's belief that he may be appointed premier does not appear to have been well-founded: his opposition to the introduction of party lines earned him the enmity of some Liberals, not least because it aligned him with Haultain, a Conservative. [...] In the estimation of historian L. G. Thomas, DeVeber's fellow Liberals [...] "were not inclined to take him too seriously" [...] as a potential premier.|$|E

2500|$|By summer 913, Zhou had put Yan's capital You Prefecture (幽州) under siege. [...] Liu, desperate, {{claimed that}} if Li Cunxu himself <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> he would surrender. [...] When Li Cunxu arrived, however, {{he did not}} do so, despite Li Cunxu's {{assurance}} that his life would be spared if he surrendered. [...] Li Cunxu subsequently intensified the siege, and You fell. [...] Liu fled with his wives and children, but was subsequently captured. [...] Li Cunxu took him and his family, including his father Liu Rengong (whom he had put under house arrest) back to Taiyuan, and then executed them there. [...] He commissioned Zhou as the military governor of Lulong and added Yan territory to his own. [...] In light of his victory, Wang Rong and Wang Chuzhi offered the title Shangshu Ling (尚書令) to him—a title that no Tang subject had dared to accept because it had been at one point held by Tang's second emperor Emperor Taizong. [...] After initially declining, Li Cunxu accepted the title, and also established a provisional central government, exercising imperial powers in the manner that Emperor Taizong did (while he was still the Prince of Qin under his father, Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu).|$|E
