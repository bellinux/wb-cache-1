40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effects of {{pre-existing}} malnutrition on the treatment outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Methods: One hundred and sixty three patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) below the age of 14 years with L 1 and L 2 FAB morphology were included in this study. Treatment protocol used was FBM. Patients were classified according to Waterlow classifications of malnutrition (1976). Group-I, as Under-Nourished children (UNC) and Group-II as Well-nourished children (WNC). Percentages in both groups were calculated with respect to total expired, relapses and <b>completed</b> <b>treatment.</b> Results: In Group-I (UNC) 46 % <b>completed</b> <b>treatment</b> and were alive, 9. 8 % relapsed and 45 % expired. In Group-II (WNC) 59 % <b>completed</b> <b>treatment</b> and were alive, 21. 3 % relapsed and 19 % expired. Overall, in WNC group 13. 5 % <b>completed</b> <b>treatment</b> and were alive, 8 % relapsed and 7. 3 % expired. In UNC group 28. 8 % <b>completed</b> <b>treatment</b> and were alive, 6 % relapsed and 27 % expired.

25|$|In China, for instance, the {{collapse}} of the Cooperative Medical System left many of the rural poor uninsured and unable to access the resources necessary to maintain good health.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study was initiated in Burkina Faso's National Tuberculosis Programme to confirm successful treatment results within 3 months of <b>completing</b> <b>treatment</b> and to characterise longer-term outcomes 12 - 24 months after completion. The sample (n = 278) included 91 {{patients who had}} <b>completed</b> <b>treatment</b> 0 - 3 months earlier ('short-term' sample) and 187 patients who had <b>completed</b> <b>treatment</b> 12 - 24 months earlier ('long-term' sample). All sputum specimens from the short-term sample were confirmed as negative. In the long-term sample, among 154 patients with available information, 13 (8 %) had died, 24 were not traced, and 117 (76 %) were interviewed and had sputum examinations, of which 2 (2 %) were smear-positive.

25|$|A {{component}} of stimulus control therapy is sleep restriction, {{a technique that}} aims to match the time spent in bed with actual time spent asleep. This technique involves maintaining a strict sleep-wake schedule, sleeping only at certain {{times of the day}} and for specific amounts of time to induce mild sleep deprivation. <b>Complete</b> <b>treatment</b> usually lasts up to 3 weeks and involves making oneself sleep for only a minimum amount of time that they are actually capable of on average, and then, if capable (i.e. when sleep efficiency improves), slowly increasing this amount (~15 min) by going to bed earlier as the body attempts to reset its internal sleep clock. Bright light therapy, which is often used to help early morning wakers reset their natural sleep cycle, can also be used with sleep restriction therapy to reinforce a new wake schedule.

These include minimally invasive surgeries to treat cancer and obesity; microsurgeries to restore voice, hearing, and facial function; MRI-guided gene therapy for brain cancer; heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy for abdominal cancer; spine and joint reconstruction; and robotic surgery for several cancers. The technologies at work include the region's only four intraoperative MRI machines, which allow real-time imaging of tumors and gene therapies during surgery to ensure <b>complete</b> <b>treatment,</b> as well as the nation's only Restriction Spectrum Imaging technology, which color code brain fibers to better plan for complex surgeries in advance.
