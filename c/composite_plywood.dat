It appears that the noise produced at the ball impact on a racket has a great influence on the opinion that a player can give about a racket. Moreover, the sound emitted at the stroke can be appreciated differently among several players. Hence a good sound may give a positive a priori to the player racket appreciation. The work presented first demonstrates {{the correlation between the}} acoustic frequency spectrum and the vibration frequency spectrum of a racket following the ball impact. The analysis is first performed on the racket blades without rubbers glued on. The vibration modes that produce the sound at the ball impact were identified experimentally. It is shown that there are two essential modes responsible of the sound emitted. In second, comparisons were made between several rackets composed of different <b>composite</b> <b>plywoods.</b> Their influence on the sound emitted is shown experimentally. Indeed, depending on the wood essences of the different plies, their thickness and their fibers relative orientation the sound produced will be different. Then the influence of the rubbers glued on both blade sides is studied. The vibration modes are the same but the frequencies are lower. The sound can be qualified as sharp, long, clear, deep, hollow, and plain. Some correlations with the player appreciations are made...|$|R

Worldwide, work is under way on obtaining new materials and upgrading {{the properties of the}} already existing ones. New material compounds are created; as a result, composite materials with higher physico-mechanical and service properties have been developed. One of such promising <b>composite</b> materials is <b>plywood,</b> which makes it possible, due to its constructive structure, to reach an enhanced mechanical strength. With increasing application of plywood in the national economy, it becomes necessary to enhance its physico-mechanical properties and to decrease the production costs. Plywood with different coats, varying their surface physical properties, is developed and introduced in production. In industry, plywood coating with different non-wood materials is widely used. An alternative for the so far used methods is the enhancement of the plywood strength with fibre materials of natural origin. The objective of the study was, using a bicomponent binder, to mutually compare the effect of the long fibres of dried hemp and hemp yarn woven technical fabrics on the changes in the physico-mechanical properties of the <b>plywood</b> <b>composite</b> material.

Five wood-attacking fungi (three mold fungi, one brown rot fungus, one white rot fungus) were inoculated into four types of commercial wood <b>composite</b> panels (<b>plywood,</b> oriented strand board, particleboard, and medium-density fiberboard). One solid wood sample was included as a control. The attacking patterns of the fungi in each panel was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The weight losses due to the exposure were compared. All wood composites were more or less susceptible to all fungi inoculated. The attacking mode of the fungi was highly dependent on the types of wood composite, which had inherently different shapes of voids owing to different shapes and characteristics of the raw furnish materials used. Plywood and medium-density fiberboard showed a large weight loss after an 8 -week exposure to decay fungi. Plywood is the most susceptible to white and brown rot fungi. This study indicates that all wood composite panels should undergo careful consideration to prevent fungal deterioration when they are used for exterior and humid interior applications.|$|R
40|$|Optimization of structure`s {{topology}} {{that provides}} minimal material consumption, weight and good heat-moisture performance {{is one of}} the most challenging task in today’s engineering science. Plywood structures provide a rational usage of wood (Sliseris and Rocens 2010) and one of the reasons is less sawdust in manufacturing. The typical hot-pressed plywood sheet’s maximal thickness is limited and in many cases there is insufficient bending stiffness. The object of research is <b>plywood</b> <b>composite</b> material that consists of top and bottom plywood flange and middle core that is formed from plywood ribs and foam-type material. As a result of structure complexity (many variable parameters) and highly material nonlinearity it’s topology optimization is very challenging problem. Therefore classical optimization methods, like response surface method may fail or find local optimum (Rao 2009). The optimization of plywood macro-structure`s topology is done by non-traditional optimization methods- Neural network (Yao 1999), Genetic algorithm (Goldberg 1989, Sliseris and Rocens 2011) and Simulated annealing method (Laarhoven and Aarts 1987).

Furthermore, reconstruction helps to serve a range of social demands, such as the provision of comfortable and safe living conditions for people. The review of research publications shows that wooden structures are the first to lose their load-bearing capacity during the long-term use of buildings and structures.

Joints between existing rafters and wooden inserts are reinforced with two layers of the furniture duct tape and fine composite mesh pressed in between, with the plywood top finishing of the duct tape. The experimental studies that were in progress for two years showed that the technology suggested meeting all the reliability requirements applicable for timber trusses. As compared to traditional technologies, the suggested solution is less labor-intensive and more sparing in terms of the truss weight, as it only adds the weight of furniture duct tape, <b>composite</b> mesh and <b>plywood</b> at the joints.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction SciencesKimberly Waggle KramerBill ZhangCold-formed steel members quickly are {{becoming}} a popular material for both commercial and residential construction around the world. Their high strength to weight ratio makes them {{a viable alternative to}} timber framing. In most cases cold-formed steel is used as a repetitive member in floor, wall, or roof assemblies. Structural sheathing is used in conjunction with the framing members in order to transfer loads between individual members. This sheathing is connected mechanically to the cold-formed steel through a variety of methods. The most common method uses screws spaced at close intervals, usually between 6 to 12 inches on center. When such assemblies are constructed, load is transferred from the sheathing through the connectors into the cold-formed steel, forming a composite assembly in which load is transferred and shared between two materials, providing a higher strength and stiffness over individual members themselves. The amount of load that can be transferred is dependent on the amount of slip that occurs when the assembly is loaded. This slip value describes the amount of composite action that takes place in the assembly. The amount of slip can be described by a value called the slip modulus. The composite, or effective, bending stiffness can be calculated using the slip modulus. In current design of cold-formed steel composite assemblies this composite action is not being taken into account {{due to a lack of}} research and understanding of the composite stiffness present in these assemblies. Taking composite action into account can lead to decreased member sizes or increased spacing of members, thereby economizing design. Furthermore, improved understanding of the effective stiffness can lead to more accurate design for vibrations in floor systems.

In order to decide on a rehabilitation and retrofit plan, information on thermal degradation of building materials and connections are vital. A critical knowledge gap exists in terms of thermal degradation of materials and connections with respect to light-frame wood construction. Along with solid sawn lumber (SSL), various wood-based <b>composites</b> such as <b>plywood,</b> oriented strand board (OSB) and laminated veneer lumber (LVL) are also used in wood-frame construction. Characterization of the thermal degradation of strength of these structural materials will help assess the service life and strength of the damaged structure. This study addressed the thermal degradation of material strength and connection strength by conducting tests on wood, wood-based composites and connections after subjecting them to elevated temperatures, hence studying the post-fire residual strength in wood and wood composite construction. The properties evaluated in this study were bending strength (MOR), bending stiffness (MOE), lateral nail capacity, dowel bearing strength, fracture toughness and bond strength (IB) after exposing the materials to elevated temperature for various exposure times. In addition, the bending strength of OSB and plywood was studied in great detail as a function of additional temperatures and exposure times. A general trend of degrading bending properties, fracture toughness, dowel bearing strength of materials and yield strength of the connections of various configurations with high temperature and duration of exposure was observed and confirmed by statistical analysis. A statistical regression based model incorporating the effects of temperature, time of exposure and thier interaction and a model based on first-order kinetics were developed and evaluated for predicting the strength loss. The kinetics-based model was better than the regression-based approach. Using the kinetics analysis along with time-temperature superposition for OSB and plywood, a master curve was generated at a reference temperature of 150 °C {{that can be used for}} residual strength estimates and failure time predictions. A reasonable prediction of connection design values was made using National Design Specifications (NDS) yield models for thermally degraded materials. Conventional tests for bond strength provided excessive scatter which renders any statistical comparison highly difficult. An alternative to IB and bond classification could be fracture testing using energy methods for wood bond strength evaluation. The various analytical models developed will help for characterizing the thermal degradation of material properties.

30|$|The {{water uptake}} of wood can be mainly {{ascribed}} to hydrogen bonding of water molecules {{to the free}} hydroxyl groups presented in cellulose and hemicelluloses [60, 61]. Additionally, large numbers of porous tubular structures present in wood accelerate the penetration of water by the capillary action [22, 42]. OSB compared to other wood-based <b>composites</b> like <b>plywood</b> has poor water resistance in contact with water that is direct result of higher pressure needed to consolidate the OSB mat [1]. Within this framework, the consolidation strain induced during the pressing process {{was defined as a}} function of the targeted thickness for the panel product, the flake thickness, and, finally, the number of deposited strands [62]. Wood-based panels such as fiberboard, plywood, or OSB are also subjected to reversible and/or irreversible swelling under wet and dry conditions. The amount of the reversible swelling is directly related to hygroscopicity of wood [63]. It is known that the springback in the wood-based composites occurs usually after manufacture of the panels. The springback is an irreversible thickness swelling, which occurs after wetting the composites, is attributed to the release of applied stresses accompanied by some loss of the glue bonds [64]. The springback indicates debonding of the adhesion between the wood elements and the adhesives. Upon gluing, it was apparent that the strands due to bulk volume of the material did not glue well, resulting in interrupted glue line between the particles. Urea formaldehyde is not a waterproof binder and absorbs moisture when exposed to humid conditions. When the panels were immersed in water, high swelling took place because of high porosity of the strands and their hygroscopicity, spring back (the release of built in compressive forces brought about during panel manufacturing) and water absorption affinity of urea formaldehyde [65]. Thickness swelling is also affected by bond quality and adhesive property [14]. The wood porosity affects also the type and form of the adhesive as it affects the ability of the substrate to absorb water and other solvents from the adhesive, as well as allowing some of the adhesive to be absorbed over larger surface areas [10]. All the treated specimens strongly resisted water absorption and as a result, thickness swelling decreased. Nanoclay increases the tortuous path for water transport and as a result water diffusivity decreases [22, 52]. Decreasing available space for water absorption due to occupation of voice spaces in the wood by the nanoclay can be another mechanism for the lower water uptake of nanocomposites [66]. The presence of nanoclay in the composite hinders the permeation of water through the composite [22]. Another reason can be obstruction of capillaries in wood by the modifier so that water lost its main channel [22, 50]. Under the combined influence of pressure and heat, cell lumens in hardwoods collapse, and a certain amount of fractures in cell walls develops and such densification also is responsible for its dimensional instability in the form of the hygroscopic swelling and wood with the highest degree of densification had the highest thickness swelling [53]. Values of thickness swelling of the panels decreased with increasing press time. Similar results were observed by several researchers [2, 67, 68]. Thickness of wood samples decreases with increasing densification period this phenomenon can be explained as a consequence of softening of solid wood with better distribution of temperature as a result of longer press time [2, 53, 69]. Nevertheless, none of the boards did satisfy the TS and WA requirement of EN Standard for general-purpose usage. Thickness swelling is also affected by bond quality and adhesive property [14]. There are many other methods to improve the water absorption as well as thickness swelling of wood based panels; adding wax (0.5 – 1  %) to the mixture of adhesive and particles during manufacturing process, decreasing the “springback” affect by reducing the density of panels and chemical modification of particles/strands [2, 14, 69]. Besides, using nano-emulsion of paraffin can lead to better water resistance [70]. Similarly, lower physical properties have been reported for particleboards made using biomaterials [41, 44, 59, 69, 70].|$|R
40|$|Today, {{thermosetting}} polymer resins containing formaldehyde {{are mainly}} {{used in the}} production of <b>plywood</b> <b>composites.</b> These glues are toxic due to the generation of gaseous products, chiefly formaldehyde, during the production and exploitation of laminated materials, which pollute the environment. In order to decrease the emission of toxic products from these resins, natural product additives (lignins, tannins etc.) or fully biodegradable polymers such as starch, polylactides etc., are used. These glues are not toxic, but they have poor adhesion to wood, low water resistance and are more expensive. Our previous investigations have shown the possibility of using non-toxic virgin polyolefins as hot melts for plywood production. The aim of this work was to investigate the use of cheaper waste products, such as recycled thermoplastic polymers (polyolefins, polyamides), as glue hot melts for wood veneer bonding instead of traditional thermosetting resins, which are based on formaldehyde. Different recycled thermoplastic polymers produced from tetra package waste, domestic film waste, recycled polypropylene and recycled polyamide- 6 were used as hot melts for birch wood veneer bonding. The content of the recycled adhesives was determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the tetra package waste content of different types of polyethylenes, with additives of polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), was fixed. Virgin high-density polyethylene and polypropylene were used as references. The fluidity of all the recycled materials, using melt flow index (MFI) measurements, was 1. 96 g/ 10 min for polyethylenes and 1. 94 g/ 10 min for polypropylene; this adhesive fluidity is sufficient to form full contact with the surface of the wood veneer sheets. Adhesive activity of the recycled hot melts was evaluated by preparing single overlap joints and specimens were tested for shear strength. The optimal technological parameters for producing samples were noted: pressure 2 MPa, contact time 1 - 2 min and a temperature for polyethylenes of 130 °C, for polypropylene of 180 °C, for PA- 6 at 220 °C. The highest values of shear strength were observed for specimens glued with recycled polypropylene (10 MPa), in the case of polyethylenes, the maximum was 5 - 6 MPa. The mixed fracture mechanism of adhesive joints was fixed after visually examining the surface of the broken samples. It was shown that to reach high adhesive strength it is also necessary to improve the cohesive strength of the adhesive layer. Polyethylene terephthalate fabric waste was used as reinforcement for strengthening the adhesive layer, which improved the bending strength and modulus of the two layers laminate bonded with recycled polypropylene. Direct correlation between high adhesive properties and high bending strength was not observed on all occasions. Water exposure experiments (23 °C, 72 h) showed a decrease of adhesive strength to constant values of 2 - 2. 2 MPa, for all investigated adhesives, which are similar to observations using 4 mm thick industrial plywood, corresponding to the 3 rd class of water resistance. These investigations highlight the excellent prospects for the use of recycled polyolefins as hot melts for wood bonding...|$|R
