25|$|Surface ocean acidity has {{increased}} thirty {{percent since the}} industrial revolution. About {{one quarter of the}} additional carbon dioxide generated by humans is dissolved in the oceans, where it forms carbonic acid. This acidity inhibits the ability of corals, shellfish and plankton to build shells and skeletons. Knock-on effects could have serious consequences for fish stocks. This boundary is clearly interconnected with the climate change boundaries, since the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is also the underlying <b>control</b> <b>variable</b> for the ocean acidification boundary.|$|E

30|$|Theorem A {{shows that}} {{feedback}} <b>control</b> <b>variables</b> play {{important roles in}} the persistent property of system (1.4).

Many papers (see [11 – 13] and the references cited therein) have showed that feedback <b>control</b> <b>variables</b> have no influence on the permanent property of continuous system with feedback control. Thus, in this paper, we will apply the analysis technique of Chen et al.

The wings mounted flush with the aircraft, but had a mechanism which allowed them to rotate in angle of incidence, as well as fold rearward from ten degrees of sweep to forty five degrees for braking and storage. These features were incorporated on future carrier aircraft such as the Fairey Firefly for storage rather than braking and flight <b>control.</b> <b>Variable</b> incidence mechanisms are used commonly to trim tail surfaces, however some aircraft such as the Vought F-8 Crusader have deployed the concept in practical use. The variable sweep mechanism {{can be seen on}} some high-speed aircraft such as the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark to expand their flight envelope.

In addition to econometric issues, the explicit consideration of endogenous <b>control</b> <b>variables</b> affects the theoretical interpretation of the conditional convergence results. Accordingly, the variation of some of the <b>control</b> <b>variables</b> with the level and the growth rate of per capita income contains important information about the transition to the balanced-growth equilibrium rather than information about the balanced-growth equilibrium itself. ...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{competition}} in the process industries requires optimal operation and better utilization of raw materials and energy. One strategy for achieving improved production is to use real-time optimization (RTO), based on measured disturbances and process measurements. The optimal solution is usually implemented by updating setpoints to the control system which task {{is to keep the}} <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> at the setpoint. Thus, the selection of <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> integrates the optimization and the control layer. Selecting the right <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> can be of paramount importance. Many chemical processes are influenced by disturbances that are often not measured and where installing new measurements are not economically viable. Thus, finding <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> where the optimal value is insensitive to disturbances could eliminate the need of estimating these disturbances online and would reduce the need of frequent setpoint updates. The use of feedback control introduces implementation errors. It is important to select <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> that are insensitive to implementation errors. The "optimal" implementation would be to use a dynamic optimizer which, based on full information of the disturbances and the plant outputs, calculates the optimal inputs. In practice, control systems have a hierarchical structure, where different layers operate on different time scales. Thus, the selection of <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> (which links these layers together) is important. The ideal situation is to have self-optimizing <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> where operation remains near-optimal in presence of disturbances and implementation errors using constant setpoints. This work puts emphasis on methods for selecting such self-optimizing <b>controlled</b> <b>variables.</b> We base the selection of <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> on an economic measure of the operation. We assume that the setpoints are nominally optimal, and we propose the null space method for selecting <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> as a combination of measurements. The selection of the <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> is based on the optimal sensitivity matrix from the disturbances to the measurements. This information can easily be provided by using experiments or a model of the plant. The main focus, is to find <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> that yield good self-optimizing properties with respect to disturbances. The method uses local information, however, several case {{studies have shown that the}} operation is near-optimal in a wider region of the disturbance space. To generalize the null space method, we propose a method for selecting measurements that minimizes the effect of implementation errors on the economic performance for the resulting control structure. Based on the derivation of the null space method, we propose a simple procedure for finding <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> using the null space method. The procedure is split in two: First, we select measurements that are insensitive to measurement error. Second, we combine these measurements to form the self-optimizing control structure. Further, we discuss how non-optimal nominal points affect the selection of <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> for self-optimizing <b>control.</b> We find that the selection of <b>controlled</b> <b>variables</b> is unaffected by non-optimal nominal points, and that the average increase in loss is independent of what we select to control. Another contribution is to provide several case studies where the null space method is compared with previously proposed methods for selecting <b>controlled</b> <b>variables.</b> The null space method is illustrated on a Petlyuk distillation column for separation of ternary mixtures. We find that the null space method yields a control structure with acceptable steady-state and dynamic performance. Other cases studied are an evaporator process and oil and gas production networks. Finally, we show that for the Petlyuk distillation column it is energetically optimal to over-fractionate one of the products. This surprising result is discussed and expressions for the possible savings are derived. </p...|$|R

2500|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} PID controller {{is the ability to}} use the three control terms of proportional, integral and derivative influence on the controller output to apply accurate and optimal control.

The controller attempts to minimize the error over time by adjustment of a <b>control</b> <b>variable</b> , such as the opening of a control valve, to a new value determined by a weighted sum of the control terms.|$|E
30|$|Narver and Slater (1990) {{show that}} the {{marketing}} strategy literature places considerable emphasis on eight situational variables that may affect business performance. The <b>control</b> <b>variables</b> are potential variables {{that are capable of}} influencing firm performance, rather than the identified variables. For instance, technology and organisational size are potential factors that can influence firm performance, other than MO and CSR. As with other studies in the strategic marketing literature, these situational <b>variables</b> are <b>controlled</b> in analyzing the effects of the interaction of market orientation and corporate social responsibility on business performance in this conceptualisation. The study posits that apart from the interactive effects of MO and CSR, there are other variables that can impact on an organisation’s performance. The <b>control</b> <b>variables</b> considered in this study are broken into two main groups: market-related <b>control</b> <b>variables</b> and firm-level <b>control</b> <b>variables</b> (Narver and Slater 1990). Some of the market-related <b>control</b> <b>variables</b> considered in this study, as shown in the conceptual framework, are technology, the general economy, competitive intensity, and market turbulence and buyer power.
