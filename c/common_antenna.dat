50|$|During 1940, the LEPI {{took control}} of Redut development, {{perfecting}} the critical capability of range measurements.

A transmit-receive device (a duplexer) to allow operating with a <b>common</b> <b>antenna</b> was developed in February 1941. These breakthroughs were achieved at an experimental station at Toksovo (near Leningrad), and an order was placed with the Svetlana Factory for 15 systems.|$|E

5000|$|A mobile radio {{must have}} an {{associated}} <b>antenna.</b> The most <b>common</b> <b>antennas</b> are stainless steel wire or rod whips which protrude vertically from the vehicle. Physics defines the antenna length: length relates to frequency and cannot be arbitrarily lengthened or shortened (more likely) by the end user. The standard [...] "quarter wave" [...] antenna in the 25-50 MHz range can be over nine feet long. A 900 MHz antenna may be three inches long for a quarter wavelength. A transit bus may have a ruggedized antenna, {{which looks like a}} white plastic blade or fin, on its roof. Some vehicles with concealed radio installations have antennas designed to look like the original AM/FM antenna, a rearview mirror, or may be installed inside windows, or hidden on the floor pan or underside of a vehicle. Aircraft antennas look like blades or fins, the size and shape being determined by frequencies used. Microwave antennas may look like flat panels on the aircraft's skin. Temporary installations may have antennas which clip on to vehicle parts or are attached to steel body parts by a strong magnet.|$|R

50|$|The Ionosphere's D-layer {{also affects}} 80 meters {{significantly}} by absorbing signals. During the daylight hours, a station in middle or high latitudes using 100 watts {{and a simple}} dipole antenna can expect a maximum communication range of 200 miles/300 km, extending to a few thousand miles or more at night. Global coverage can be routinely achieved during the late fall and winter by a station using modest power and <b>common</b> <b>antennas.</b> The higher background noise on 80 meters, especially when combined with higher ionospheric absorption, causes stations with higher effective radiated power to have a decided advantage in long distance communications. With very high antennas or large vertically polarized arrays and full legal power, reliable worldwide communications occurs over darkness paths. Mobile operation is possible, although the relative shortness of a practical mobile antenna (usually less than 10 feet/3 meters) compared to a quarter wavelength results in the need for significant inductive loading to achieve resonance. Since short antennas have very low radiation resistance, overall antenna efficiency is often limited to less than 10%. Additionally, the large inductance of the loading coil creates a very high Q antenna system, with an extremely narrow bandwidth.|$|R
