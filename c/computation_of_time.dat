[...] The presumption that the world was only 6,000 years old was scientifically abandoned as a result of Hutton's work.|$|E

5000|$|First {{played in}} the second series, this often {{took the form of}} a memory test (though other {{versions}} would require mental <b>computation</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and date differences, or to add up a sequence of numbers and return the number which, when added to that sum, gave a pre-determined answer). The contestants frequently had to memorise a sequence and then answer a series of progressively more complicated questions. For instance, if the sequence to be memorised was a series of coloured blocks, the questions might start as [...] "What is the colour of the third block from the left?" [...] and progress to [...] "What is the colour of the block two {{to the left of the}} block to the right of the green block?". Other forms of memory test might require contestants to remember a phrase or proverb and answer a series of questions about it (e.g. [...] "What was the fifth letter of the fourth word?" [...] or [...] "Spell the last word backwards"). Originally the round consisted of a [...] "knock-out" [...] format, where contestants were asked increasingly difficult questions in turn and eliminated for wrong answers. If two or more players were eliminated on the same turn, ties were broken based on who had answered the most parts of their question correctly. Later, the contestants were shown 9 images along with a statement read to them by Charles Foster and the contestants had to pick which 4 images were correct and they scored 2 points for each correctly identified image, with a maximum ten points for all four. In the semi-finals and final, this would change to showing two sequences in turn and asking each player a 3-point question about each sequence. A third sequence was then shown to all players at once and one toss-up question, worth four points, was open to all players on the buzzer. If a player jumped in with the incorrect answer, that player was not penalized and any other player could jump in. Then, until 1987, the Mental Agility round alternated between the knock-out format (without tiebreaks) and a 45 or 50-second [...] "speed test" [...] where each player had to come up with as many correct answers as possible before time expired, and could pass on any of them. Only if they answered incorrectly would they be informed of it, possibly as to discourage guesswork.|$|E
