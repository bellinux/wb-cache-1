The government combined Banco di Roma, Banco di Napoli, and National and Grindlays Bank to form the Somali Commercial Bank. The government also established the Somali Savings and Credit Bank {{to take over the}} commercial branches of Banca Nazionale Somala and Banque de Port Said, leaving the Banca Nazionale Somala with only central banking functions. The Somali Savings and Credit Bank had branches in Baidoa, Beledweyne, Berbera, Bosaso, Burco, Galkacyo, Qardho, Hargeisa and Kismayo, and for a while in Djibouti. The Somali Savings and Credit Bank had been established with the technical assistance and aid provided by the Associazione Bancaria Italiana {{in the context of an}} overall <b>cooperation</b> <b>policy</b> of the European savings banks.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 Pronk {{was elected}} to the House of Representatives for the Labour Party. He was shadow {{minister}} for development cooperation in the leftwing shadow cabinet of PvdA, D66 and PPR. He served secretary of the committee Mansholt, a committee of these three parties on the implications of the Limits to Growth-report for the Netherlands. He was re-elected in 1972. In 1973 he became Minister of Development Cooperation in the cabinet Den Uyl. He changed the development cooperation-policy of the Netherlands, giving it a political goal: the equal distribution of power and wealth in the world. The development <b>cooperation</b> <b>policy</b> became oriented towards the New International Economic Order, in which developing countries would become self-reliant. In 1975 1,5% of the domestic product was spent on development aid. His proposal to include communist states as Cuba and North Yemen as recipient countries of Dutch development aid, led to some controversy, but he put his proposal through. His policy supported liberation movement in Southern Africa. His leftwing policy put him at odds with the more moderate PvdA Minister of Foreign Affairs Max van der Stoel. As Minister for Development Cooperation, Pronk held several prominent positions in international organizations: between 1973 and 1977 he was Deputy Governor of the World Bank. Because of his many international travels, he often fell asleep at Cabinet meetings, which lasted until very late in the night.|$|E
2500|$|The {{policy of}} the government, called samarbejdspolitikken (<b>cooperation</b> <b>policy)</b> {{is one of the}} most {{controversial}} issues in Danish history. Some historians argue that the relatively accommodating policy which did not actively resist the occupation was the only realistic way of safeguarding Danish democracy and people. However, others argue that accommodation was taken too far, was uniquely compliant when compared to other democratic governments in Europe, and can not be seen as part of a coherent long-term strategy to protect democracy in Denmark or Europe. In 2003 Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen characterised the cooperation as [...] "morally unjustifiable," [...] the only time a Danish leader had condemned the war-era leadership, even though Anders Fogh Rasmussen is seen using it as a justification for his own ambitions, in connection with the invasion of Iraq in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1943 the Germans {{allowed a}} general {{election}} to be held.

The election, discontent, and a growing feeling of optimism that Germany would be defeated led to widespread strikes and civil disturbances in the summer of 1943. The Danish government refused to deal with the situation {{in a way that would}} satisfy the Germans, who presented an ultimatum to the government, including the following demands, on 28 August 1943: A ban on people assembling in public, outlawing strikes, the introduction of a curfew, censorship should be conducted with German assistance, special (German military) courts should be introduced, and the death penalty should be introduced in cases of sabotage. In addition, the city of Odense was ordered to pay a fine of 1 million kroner for the death of a German soldier killed in that city and hostages were to be held as security.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe great {{potential}} of the Mediterranean area, as yet not fully tapped {{due to the lack}} of the integrated management of its ports, calls for innovative management policies for achieving competitiveness within the Mediterranean port system. To this end, the current regime of intra-port competition has proven highly unproductive and needs to be rethought, implementing new <b>cooperation</b> <b>policies.</b> The aim of this study is to identify, by means of traditional clustering techniques, homogeneous groups of ports within the Mediterranean region. In so doing, it would be possible to propose new <b>cooperation</b> <b>policies</b> between ports of the same cluster, but also between different clusters, on the basis of their specific features. A data set has been created for 34 major Mediterranean container ports. Relations between ports have been evaluated from a quantitative perspective through traditional statistical techniques: hierarchical cluster analysis based on the Ward method. Different sets of homogeneous ports have been obtained alternating different combinations of input variables and varying these over suitable ranges, in line with the assumed <b>cooperation</b> <b>policies.</b> The findings provide the basis for exploring the strategic functional relationships among ports, in order to promote collective integrated actions that could prove essential for the competitiveness of the Mediterranean port system...|$|R
