40|$|Formation of {{cracks in}} a {{material}} {{as a result}} of the damage accumulation may change (weaken) material effective properties. The present letter suggests an approach to estimate such changes when cracks form at interfaces of dissimilar materials (for example, at matrix/inclusion boundaries or film/substrate interfaces). Generally, solution of an interface problem is required to predict <b>compliances</b> of interfacial cracks, with the exception of planar cracks. We show that planar cracks possess a special property in the sense that their normal <b>compliances</b> may be approximated from solutions in a homogeneous medium. The method is then applied to analyze elastic <b>compliances</b> of the rectilinear, penny-shaped, elliptical, and annular interfacial cracks.

40|$|With {{regard to}} {{substrate}} deformation, this work analyzed the microcantilever beam-bending test {{and provided a}} closed formula of deflection versus load. The substrate deformation was formulated using two coupled springs; the spring <b>compliances</b> {{were related to the}} elastic <b>compliances</b> of the substrate, the support angle between the substrate and the microcantilever beam, and the beam thickness. Finite element analysis was conducted to calculate the spring <b>compliances</b> and verify the analytic formula. The results showed that the proportionality factor of the load to the deflection was a third-order polynomial of the length from the loading point to the fixed beam end. Examples are also given to indicate the relative error of Young's modulus when evaluated with the beam-bending theory without considering the substrate deformation...|$|R

The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between <b>compliance</b> and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E
