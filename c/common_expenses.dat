40|$|Objectives of this {{research}} were (1) to describe fee hunting as it is currently practiced in Utah and (2) to assess the adequacy of fee hunting efforts in addressing the problems of wildlife habitat and hunter access on private land. To collect information, Utah landowners who charged for deer (Odocoileus hemionus) or elk (Cervus elaphus) hunting in 1986 were surveyed by telephone and mail. Compared to the average Utah livestock rancher, those involved in fee hunting have larger livestock operations and have owned their property longer. They are Utah natives. Fee hunting is concentrated in northern Utah where foothill and mountain rangelands are privately owned. There is great diversity in the way fee hunting is organized and managed. Hunting opportunities sold by lease usually include few services and require hunters to post and patrol the property. Hunts sold by permit may include more services and be personally managed by the rancher. In general, fee hunting in Utah is differentiated from public land hunting by the availability of more acres per hunter rather than by special services or trophy animals. Fee hunting serves mostly resident hunters. Average net annual cash income is $ 6587, or $ 0. 66 per acre. The most <b>common</b> <b>expenses</b> incurred are for road and facility (fence, campsite) maintenance and vehicle costs. Highest expenses are those associated with providing services. Landowners initiated fee hunting {{in order to gain}} control over trespassing and cover the costs of having hunters on their property. Most do not buy liability insurance. Fee hunting is expanding the number and types of hunting opportunities and is meeting the needs of landowners to minimize costs of trespassing and hunters. However, fee hunting is not stimulating investments in wildlife habitat improvement. Because of intermingling landownerships and the migratory nature of deer and elk in Utah, investments in wildlife habitat or management have an uncertain return. It is unlikely that fee hunting can provide adequate incentives for improving wildlife habitat without substantial policy changes to enhance the ability of landowners to capture a return on such investments...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyse divergences of local {{government}} budgets and medium-term budgetary outlooks from results of the budgetary management of selected municipalities in the Czech Republic. At {{the beginning of the}} work, there are introduced problems of budgetary rules, medium-term budgetary outlooks and local government budgets. The analysis is focused on the municipalities which make a delegate force as municipalities with authorized municipal office from 2010 to 2013. The analysis is focused on the evaluation of the use of the medium-term budgetary outlook in the budgetary planning by municipalities. This work compares planning by municipalities updating their budgetary outlooks with the municipalities that are not updated. It is also focused on including the modification of tax-incomes in medium-term and annual budgetary planning. The analysis evaluates divergences of budgetary management in the municipalities during the analysed years. In the conclusion of work, there is made the analysis of debts of surveyed municipalities. Based on the analysis, following results were reached. The municipalities keep the rules of the verity and safety in the majority of revenues and <b>common</b> <b>expenses.</b> In 2013 where the amendment to the law of budget determination of taxes came into force, municipalities did not involve the modification of tax revenue in the medium-term budgetary outlooks and local government budgets. Based on the analysis of management, the budget of most municipalities is balanced or even surplus from 2010 to 2013. The average debt of the analysed municipalities did not change too much and 8 of 100 analysed municipalities had no debts during the analysed period. The recommendations following from the economic analysis of the surveyed municipalities are: to publish medium-term budgetary outlooks on the website of municipalities in conformity with the rule of publicity of public budgets and by reason of the addition of information for residents of the municipality, to monitor changes in the legislation and to integrate these changes into budgetary planning in time...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of future smart electricity grids {{is driven by}} efficiency and climate targets and economic benefit for producers, retailers and customers on the deregulated electricity market. Since most investments {{will be made by}} grid owners acting as regulated monopolies, it is unclear how they will get return on their investments. Can demand response programs create cost reductions for the grid owner that help motivate the investment in smart grids? Two cases of cost reduction opportunities are evaluated assuming that peak loads are reduced by a demand response program: optimization of cable dimensions for lower peak loads when building new grids, and avoided investments in reinforced capacity in the existing grid. Potential cost reductions are estimated for the two example cases, using financial and technical data for Fortum's local distribution grid in Stockholm. The result shows that reducing the capacity in the cables by 70 - 80 % only brings down investment costs by 3 - 4 %, since the <b>common</b> <b>expense</b> for excavation outweighs the incremental cost of cables. Over-capacity means increased redundancy and flexibility to increase load in the future, which are valuable features for a grid owner. Regarding investments in the existing grid, a substation that needs replacement because of overload is analyzed. Assuming a continued trend of steadily increasing load, a 34 % peak load reduction would delay the investment 20 years, which is in turn worth 900, 000 SEK in 2010 prices...|$|R
