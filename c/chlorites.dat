30|$|Authigenic <b>chlorite</b> in Xujiahe Formation {{sandstones}} has {{the following}} characteristics: (1) Because <b>chlorite</b> had already developed between grain contacts, {{it can be}} concluded authigenic <b>chlorite</b> formed on grain surfaces before mechanical compaction; (2) authigenic <b>chlorite</b> growths were found on the surface of quartz overgrowths and silica cement which filled in intergranular pores, indicating that authigenic <b>chlorite</b> may have formed after silica cementation; (3) <b>chlorite</b> was not found in intergranular dissolved pores or mouldpores, while <b>chlorite</b> has been found on the surface of feldspar grains with dissolved pores, suggesting authigenic <b>chlorite</b> formed before dissolution. These characteristics indicate authigenic <b>chlorite</b> growth in the Xujiahe Formation occurred in multiple phases. The first stage took place during syngenesis–early diagenesis A stage. Authigenic <b>chlorite</b> had already coated the grains before clastic grain contacts developed. This is also the formation stage of most authigenic <b>chlorite</b> in the study area. The second stage took place after silica cementation but before dissolution. Authigenic <b>chlorite</b> growths could be seen on the surface of silica cement, but <b>chlorite</b> was not found in intragranular dissolved pores. This suggests authigenic <b>chlorite</b> at this stage formed before aluminosilicate minerals were dissolved by organic acids. According to “China’s Dividing Standard for Diagenetic Stage of Clastic Rocks (SY/T 5477 - 2003),” the second stage of <b>chlorite</b> growth occurred around the end of early diagenesis A stage to the beginning of middle diagenesis A stage.|$|R
30|$|The {{formation}} {{process of}} authigenic <b>chlorite</b> in clastic rocks is still widely debated. Some researchers believe authigenic <b>chlorite</b> transformed from Fe-rich grain coating (Grigsby 2001; Lanson et al. 2002). Billault et al. (2003) thought authigenic <b>chlorite</b> precipitated from pore water. Clay minerals which transform into <b>chlorite</b> leave honeycomb-like structures {{which were not}} found in Xujiahe Formation sandstones. Most authigenic <b>chlorite</b> rims have nearly equal thicknesses, and most grain-coating <b>chlorite</b> formed during syngenesis–early diagenesis A stage.

In the process of <b>chlorite</b> flotation using oleic acid as anionic collector, pH value increases. The concentration increase of Na 2 S and NaF can activate the <b>chlorite</b> flotation. However, Ca 2 +, Na 2 SiF 6 and (NaPO 3) 6 can depress the <b>chlorite</b> flotation. In the process of <b>chlorite</b> flotation using lauryl amine as cationic collector, the maximum recovery of <b>chlorite</b> flotation happened in neutral pH condition, and the concentration increase of Ca 2 + can activate the <b>chlorite</b> flotation; however, NaF and Na 2 SiF 6 can depress the <b>chlorite</b> flotation...|$|R

30|$|Many studies {{performed}} on grain-coating <b>chlorite</b> mainly {{focus on the}} genetic mechanism of <b>chlorite</b> {{and its effects on}} reservoir porosity preservation. Bloch et al. (2002), Huang et al. (2004), and Zhu et al. (2004) thought grain-coating <b>chlorite</b> was beneficial to reservoir porosity preservation. Grain-coating <b>chlorite</b> which formed during the early diagenetic stage could enhance compaction resistance and inhibit quartz overgrowth cementation. Quartz overgrowths are considered one of the key factors responsible for reservoir densification (Zhu et al. 2009; Gu et al. 2014). However, Liu et al. (1998) believed primary porosity was reduced because of grain-coating <b>chlorite</b> which would block pore throats and reduce permeability. As for the study of <b>chlorite</b> (mainly referring to <b>chlorite</b> which precipitates from pore waters and forms early in diagenesis), study of the genetic mechanism got relatively consistent results. Grain-coating <b>chlorite</b> formation was thought to be mainly controlled by sedimentary facies and formed in high hydrodynamic conditions and weak alkaline environments with abundant Fe and Al sources (Huang et al. 2004). Sandstone sequences with well-developed <b>chlorite</b> were found in sedimentary facies conditions described above, including underwater distributary channels and distributary channels (Ehrenberg 1993; Pen et al. 2009; Okwese et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2014). However, there is no clear answer to why authigenic grain-coating <b>chlorite</b> tends to form in such conditions. Is there any connection between <b>chlorite</b> and the sedimentary environment conditions? What factors control the distribution and development of <b>chlorite</b> besides the sedimentary facies? Solving these problems would not only enhance the scientific understanding of authigenic grain-coating <b>chlorite,</b> but also provide data to search for sandstone sequences containing authigenic grain-coating <b>chlorite.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{kinetics}} and {{mechanism of}} the oxidation of methimazole (1 -methyl- 3 H-imidazole), MMI, by <b>chlorite</b> in mildly acidic environments were studied. It is a complex reaction that gives oligo-oscillations in chlorine dioxide concentrations in excess <b>chlorite</b> conditions. The stoichiometry is strictly 2 : 1, with the sulfur center being oxidized to sulfate and the organic moiety being hydrolyzed to several indeterminate species. In excess MMI conditions over <b>chlorite,</b> the sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid were observed as major intermediates. The sulfenic acid, which was observed in the electrochemical oxidation of MMI, was not observed with <b>chlorite</b> oxidations. Initial reduction of <b>chlorite</b> produced HOCl, an autocatalytic species in <b>chlorite</b> oxidations. HOCl rapidly reacts with <b>chlorite</b> to produce chlorine dioxide, which, in turn, reacts rapidly with MMI to produce more <b>chlorite.</b> The reaction of chlorine dioxide with MMI is competitive, in rate, with the chlorite–MMI and HOCl–ClO 2 – reactions.

The study also examines the characteristics of paragenetic minerals (glauconite, pyrite) and the vertical distribution patterns of authigenic <b>chlorite</b> in various sandstone bodies to study the formation environment, genetic mechanism, and other factors which affected the distribution of authigenic grain-coating <b>chlorite.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} this study {{indicate}} authigenic grain-coating <b>chlorite</b> has a good positive correlation with primary intergranular porosity, a conclusion shared with the studies by Sun et al. (2012, 2014) and Xiang et al. (2016). Many researchers thought grain-coating <b>chlorite</b> was beneficial to reservoir porosity preservation, especially for primary intergranular pores. However, some researchers believed good-quality reservoirs develop as a result of good primary intergranular porosity, and the existence of grain-coating <b>chlorite</b> is only indicative of primary intergranular porosity (Xiang et al. 2016). Based on the correlation of <b>chlorite</b> content with surface porosity and sample porosity in this study, it was concluded that the development of <b>chlorite</b> did not play a positive role in the reservoir porosity preservation and it may have influenced dissolution, to a certain extent. This may be attributed to two reasons: (1) As primary intergranular porosity increased with <b>chlorite</b> content, acidic fluids flowed into the reservoir, and the increased pore space diluted the acidic fluids, reducing the effects of dissolution; (2) it is rare to find authigenic <b>chlorite</b> grains in areas which have not undergone dissolution; therefore, the increased <b>chlorite</b> content may cause a reduction in solution porosity. Further study is needed to discover the effects of authigenic grain-coating <b>chlorite</b> on reservoir porosity preservation.

40|$|Chlorite-mica stacks (grains of intergrown <b>chlorite</b> {{and white}} mica) in {{a matrix of}} {{fine-grained}} white mica and <b>chlorite</b> have been studied using XRD, SEM, EMPA, TEM and AEM methods. The stacks occur in a weakly cleaved Llandoverian mudstone, central Wales, which has a white mica (illite) crystallinity index of 0. 35 [deg] [Delta] 2 [phi] corresponding to the lower anchizone. White mica occurs as packets (100 A to 8 [mu]m thick) interleaved with dominant <b>chlorite</b> packets in stacks, with both apparent coherent interfaces or cross-cutting small angle boundaries with <b>chlorite</b> layers. It is well-crystallized 2 M 1 polytype with phengitic composition and low paragonite component [Na/(Na + K) 2 crystals surround stacks and occur within <b>chlorite,</b> and white mica is Ti-rich compared to matrix white mica. Fine-grained white mica and <b>chlorite</b> in the matrix have two different orientations: one parallel to hedding and one parallel to cleavage, which is approximately 30 - 50 [deg] to bedding. Matrix white mica is predominantly a 2 M 1 polytype, but some cleavage-parallel white mica is 3 T and some bedding-parallel white mica is 1 Ma. It is Na-rich [(Na/(Na + K) ~ 0. 14 - 0. 42] and relatively heterogeneous; some discrete paragonite and phengitic muscovite are observed to coexist in the cleavage orientation. Matrix white mica and <b>chlorite</b> each contain less Fe than corresponding white mica and <b>chlorite</b> in stacks. Both matrix and stack <b>chlorite</b> are one-layer polytypes. The data imply that <b>chlorite</b> in the stacks is largely derived from the replacement of volcanogenic biotite and other ferromagnesian minerals (probably via intermediate expandable trioctahedral phyllosilicates).
