The total costs of road accidents were {{estimated to be}} $ 17 billion in 2003, equivalent to 2. 3 per cent of that year’s GDP, averaging around 8. 4 <b>cents</b> per <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometre.</b> The Productivity Commission has recommended replacing tort law with a compulsory, government run first party insurance scheme, where all victims receive compensation from the state, regardless of fault. The proposal is being implemented across Australia, NSW has adopted it this year. Contrary to the PC’s assertions, the evidence is that no fault insurance would increase traffic fatalities by 10 - 30 per cent and accidents by even more. This has implications for the safety design of road infrastructure. An inter-disciplinary approach is taken, in this paper, combining, law, economics and transportation engineering to examine the interaction of legal rules, insurance arrangements, economic incentives and physical infrastructure...|$|R

30|$|Fatality rates (fatalities per motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometre)</b> {{on public}} {{highways}} and on streets were 0.44 and 0.17 in Sweden and higher in Finland, at 0.56 and 0.27, respectively [6, 14, 15, 18]. The fatality rates in Finland are 28.1 % higher on public highways and 57.3 % higher on streets. Another main factor behind the higher fatality figure in Finland is the {{higher number of}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> per population. Specifically, the number of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> per person was 8480  km/year in Sweden and 23.3 % higher in Finland, at 10460  km/year [16, 18]. Both differences are remarkable.|$|R
30|$|The results {{based on}} {{comparison}} of numbers of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> {{suggest that the}} number of fatalities per <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometre</b> is 30 % higher in Finland than in Sweden. In addition, the number of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> per person was 23 % higher in Finland than in Sweden (10, 460  km/year vs. 8480  km/year). We can conclude that Finland has a safety potential in reducing the number of <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres,</b> as well as reducing their fatality risk. In Finland, more effective safety measures are therefore recommended to reduce the fatality risk. Good Swedish urban planning has probably led to a more limited need to use cars, contributing to a lower exposure to road accidents. However, advanced urban planning is a structural factor that is hard to achieve quickly [11]. Nonetheless, long-term development is recommended, and other related means are available as well, such as developing public transport and encouraging people to use it, alongside telecommuting, etc.|$|R
30|$|For Finland, {{having the}} same {{population}} risk as Sweden would mean 74 fewer car and goods vehicle fatalities per year. This figure derives from two sources: (1) having the Swedish fatality risk per <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometre</b> would prevent 50 fatalities (Table 3), and (2) having the Swedish number of <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> per person (8371 instead of 10, 347) would prevent an additional 24 fatalities per year.|$|R

The developed methodology facilitates the calculation of greatly improved estimates for <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> under a range of constraint variables and thereby enables the disaggregated analysis of specific vehicle fleet groups and their associated activity patterns to support evidence-based policy development.

40|$|This study {{determines the}} index numbers for lorries on {{three types of}} Dutch (state) roads: motorways, trunk roads and roads marked as {{forbidden}} to slow traffic. The following index numbers are provided for road stretches and road sections: (1) The total number of accidents (injury, and material damage only) for each <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometre</b> travelled; and (2) the number of injury accidents for each <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometre</b> travelled. The index numbers were determined by dividing the number of accidents in the numerator by the <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> in the denominator. In the study, only {{the distribution of the}} numbers of accidents in the numerator was determined. On motorways with two traffic lanes in each direction, the risk levels for lorries and light vehicles (passenger cars and vans) are not substantially different. On motorways with three and four traffic lanes in each direction, however, the risk level for lorries is higher than that for light vehicles. The risk level for both vehicle types and for injury accidents and accidents involving material damage only is higher on motorways with three and four traffic lanes in each direction than on motorways with two traffic lanes in each direction.

40|$|In {{order to}} detect changes in daily average <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> {{travelled}} (VKT) induced by a large-scale TravelSmart intervention in Melbourne, {{a panel of}} households was asked to complete before and after surveys, which included week-long odometer readings. In contrast to results reported from previous TravelSmart applications, the Melbourne program did not induce a statistically {{significant change in the}} average daily VKT when measured 1 year after the intervention. Multiple regressions revealed that the variability in change in VKT was better explained by socio-demographic variables than by the TravelSmart treatment. The change in VKT was also found to be strongly negatively correlated with the average daily <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> recorded in the before survey [...] indicating the possibility of the 'regression-to-the-mean' effect well known in the road safety literature. The conditions under which the regression-to-the-mean effect may create the illusion of a positive TravelSmart program impact on the reduction in daily average VKT are examined. It is concluded that, in the context of voluntary travel behaviour change evaluations, greater attention should be paid to instrument reactivity arising from the impact of the before travel survey on TravelSmart uptake and/or on change in VKT, and to regression-to-the-mean effects.

30|$|Comparison of {{the number}} of {{fatalities}} per population in 2009 – 2013 between Finland and Sweden showed that for Finland there is a safety potential of 99 yearly fatalities out of 248. The number of fatalities per <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometre</b> in Finland is 30 % higher than in Sweden and the number of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> per person 23 % higher. The highest potential for fatality reduction is for cars, related mainly to head-on fatalities. Age groups 15 – 17 and 18 – 20  years were identified as having the greatest relative population risk in Finland: the safety potential among 15 – 17 -year-olds is seven moped and motorcycle fatalities and among 18 – 20 -year-olds 12 car fatalities annually. Finland having the Swedish fatality risk per person kilometre would prevent six bicycle and six pedestrian fatalities per year.|$|R

40|$|Literature {{studies show}} {{that it is a}} very complex task to {{estimate}} how traffic safety is affectedby the introduction of longer truck combinations. Some studies indicate a slightly increased risk of crashes per <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometre</b> and that the change in risk depends on the vehicle combination. Other {{studies show that}} the difference in crash risk in comparison to conventional heavy goods vehicles is small, at least for trucks travelling on larger roads. In the current study, the effect of increased vehicle combination length on the rates of fatal or severe injury crashes by <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> travelled is investigated. The method uses Swedish national crash data fr om the period 2003 to 2012. Unlike most other countries in the European Union where an upper limit of 18. 75 metr es is in force, vehicle combinations up to 25. 25 m are permitted in Sweden. The aim is therefore to determine whether “long” truck combinations (with a combination length of 18. 76 – 25. 25 m) have a higher associated rate of severe or fatal crashes by <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> travelled than “medium” (12. 01 – 18. 75 m) or “short” combinations (less than 12 m). Different approaches for comparing the number of fatal or severe crashes in the three length groups with the kilometres driven are discussed. The crash type distributions in the three length groups are compared and it is considered to what extent the observed differences can be explained by differences in the exposure data...|$|R

40|$|In this, and {{previous}} related papers, developments of traffic volumes and traffic safety are studied from a system-theoretic point of view. It was proved already {{that such an}} approach is effective andleads to new and interesting theoretical facts. Models for the description of long-term developments of traffic volumes and safety wereestablished, and particular relations between both developments were found. One of these findings was, {{that the number of}} fatalities {{turned out to be a}} function of the derivative of the logistic functiondescribing the development of the number of <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> overthe years. It was noted that the model deviations for the number offatalities and the <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> were not merely random, but also had systematic components. In the present paper these deviationswere further investigated. For the Netherlands, it is clearly shownthat the number of fatalities is a function of the derivative of the number of <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres,</b> but with a shift in time. The short-term deviations from this long-term development are also related to the derivative of the number of <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres,</b> but without a shift in time. Similar relations were found for five other countries, (United States, Great Britain, Germany, Japan and Israel), although the description of the short-term fluctuations seems to be a bit more complicated. In general, it can be concluded that the system-theoretic approach turned out to be highly effective for the description of long-term and short-term developments in traffic volumes and safety. For the Netherlands up to 95 % of the variance in fatalities can be 'explained' by developments in traffic volumes alone. It is clearly demonstrated that, although it will be very difficult to single out effects of specific safety measures, the combined safety actions taken by a society are very effective in getting the safety factor under control. The most valuable fact that can be learned from this analysis is that, if increased developments in traffic volume occur or are predicted, the immediate safety effects can also be estimated. Therefore, anticipatory safety measures can be taken to cope with these effects before (or immediately after) the moment they appear, improving safety management at a more rational and preventive basis.

40|$|This is a report. This {{report is}} based on the replies to the {{questionnaire}} on Risk Exposure Data (RED) that was sent to the national experts of all EU member states plus Norway. The present report {{can be seen as a}} first classification of the EU member states on RED availability, compatibility and usability. On the basis of these results, a clear distinction can be made between indicators that are at least generally available in Europe and indicators that are not generally available. There is a relation between availability and the level of complexity of the indicators. Basic indicators are more generally available than more complex ones. The most widely available indicators are population, vehicle fleet, road length, fuel consumption, driver <b>kilometres</b> and <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres.</b> The less available indicators are: person kilometres, number of trips and time in traffic. Based on examination of compatibility with CARE, five of the six generally available indicators are regarded as compatible with CARE. The only indicator that is not regarded as compatible with CARE is "fuel consumption". The main reason is that transport use can not be distinguished in the data collected in many countries. The other five indicators: population, driver population, vehicle fleet, road length and <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> are regarded as compatible with CARE, or at least partially compatible. These five indicators are thus regarded as usable. The other indicators are less than partially available or not compatible with the CARE data. However, this does not mean that these indicators are useless. They can still provide valuable information on national or small-scale international level. For European wide comparison these indicators are not (yet) suitable for usage in the common framework.

A distinction is made, according to the road maintenance authority: national roads; provincial roads; the remaining roads outside built-up areas; and roads inside built-up areas. In addition, the traffic risk development is given for the various road types: motorways; secondary roads; roads closed to slow traffic; roads for all traffic outside built-up areas; and road types inside built-up areas, namely: arterial roads, residential streets, and the `woonerf' streets.
