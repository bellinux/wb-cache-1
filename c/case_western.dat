5|$|Cleveland is {{also noted}} {{in the fields of}} {{biotechnology}} and fuel cell research, led by <b>Case</b> <b>Western</b> Reserve University, the Cleveland Clinic, and University Hospitals of Cleveland. Cleveland is among the top recipients of investment for biotech start-ups and research. <b>Case</b> <b>Western</b> Reserve, the Clinic, and University Hospitals have recently announced plans to build a large biotechnology research center and incubator {{on the site of the}} former Mount Sinai Hospital, creating a research campus to stimulate biotech startup companies that can be spun off from research conducted in the city.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, the Astronomy Department of <b>Case</b> <b>Western</b> Reserve University made a {{deal with}} the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) to build a new {{observatory}} at Kitt Peak National Observatory to house the Burrell Schmidt. The telescope was moved from Ohio to Arizona in May 1979, and in 1980 the 36-inch reflector on Taylor Road was moved to the Nassau Station. This meant no further astronomical work was done at the Taylor Road facility, and as a result the faculty and resources of the original observatory were moved to the main campus of <b>Case</b> <b>Western</b> Reserve University in 1982. The Taylor Road facility was sold in 1983, was abandoned, and remained neglected until 2005 when it was sold to a couple who planned to convert the building into a residence. The plans stalled when its new owner was convicted of mortgage fraud and sent to prison in 2007.|$|E

W. Smith building on the main campus. In 1986 the telescope was reinstalled in a new dome {{on the roof of}} the A. W. Smith building.|$|E

A diminutive memorial park is dedicated to Crane along the left bank of the Cuyahoga in Cleveland. In University Circle, a historical marker sits at the location of his Cleveland childhood house on E. 115 near the Euclid Ave intersection. On <b>Case</b> <b>Western</b> Reserve University campus, a statue of him stands behind the Kelvin Smith Library.|$|E
