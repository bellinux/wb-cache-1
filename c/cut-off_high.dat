40|$|Abstract: Five typical north Adriatic bora storms are {{presented}} {{from the period}} 1957 - 1986. lt is shown that severe bora {{is caused by a}} very cold air outbreak in a deep upper tropospheric trough which usually develops into a cut-off low in the Mediterranean. This process is often accompanied by a <b>cut-off</b> <b>high</b> in the norheastern Atlantic. Such a blocking type circulation prevents the warmer air from the Atlantic to invade the European continent which is occupied by a broad cold surface anticyclone. The latter builds up a large pressure gradient toward the Mediterranean cyclone which is particularly strong at the northern Adriatic coast. This pressure difference is calculated from the mountain drag according to Smith 2 ̆ 7 s (1985) hydraulic model and the results are mainly in good agreement with the observations. Fast upper level development causes changes in the wind direction above the bora layer. Strongest bora occurs with the reversed upper air flow regardless of the wind intensity, whereas bora ceases under strong unidirectional (NE) current, unless there is a strong temperature inversion in the lower troposphere...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Given the {{increasing}} number of antifungal drugs and the emergence of resistant Aspergillus isolates, objective, automated and high-throughput antifungal susceptibility testing is important. The EUCAST E. Def 9. 3 reference method for MIC determination of Aspergillus species relies on visual reading. Spectrophotometric reading was not adopted because of concern that non-uniform filamentous growth might lead to unreliable and non-reproducible results. We therefore evaluated spectrophotometric reading for the determination of MICs of antifungal azoles against Aspergillus fumigatus. METHODS: Eighty-eight clinical isolates of A. fumigatus were tested against four medical azoles (posaconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole) and one agricultural azole (tebuconazole) with EUCAST E. Def 9. 3. The visually determined MICs (complete inhibition of growth) were compared with spectrophotometrically determined MICs and essential (+/- 1 twofold dilution) and categorical (susceptible/intermediate/resistant or wild-type/non-wild-type) agreement was calculated. Spectrophotometric data were analysed with regression analysis using the Emax model, and the effective concentration corresponding to 5 % (EC 5) was estimated. RESULTS: Using the 5 % <b>cut-off,</b> <b>high</b> essential (92 %- 97 %) and categorical (93 %- 99 %) agreement (< 6 % errors) was found between spectrophotometric and visual MICs. The EC 5 also correlated with the visually determined MICs with an essential agreement of 83 %- 96 % and a categorical agreement of 90 %- 100 % (< 5 % errors). CONCLUSIONS: Spectrophotometric determination of MICs of antifungal drugs may increase objectivity, and allow automation and high-throughput of EUCAST E.
