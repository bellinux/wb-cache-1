5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholism</b> should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E

25|$|In industrialized nations, {{thiamine}} deficiency is a {{clinically significant}} problem in individuals with <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholism</b> or other disorders {{that interfere with}} normal ingestion of food. Thiamine deficiency within developed nations tends to manifest as Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. <b>Chronic</b> <b>alcoholism</b> can disrupt thiamin absorption and thiamin deficiency contributes to neurodegeneration and memory loss in alcoholics known as Wernicke's encephalopathy. Individuals with <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholism</b> may fall short on minimum daily requirements of thiamine {{in part due to}} anorexia, erratic eating habits, lack of available food, or a combination of any of these factors. Thiamine deficiency has been reported in up to 80% of alcoholic patients due to inadequate nutritional intake, reduced absorption, and impaired utilization of thiamine. Alcohol, in combination with its metabolite acetaldehyde, interacts with thiamine utilization at the molecular level during transport, diphosphorylation, and modification processes. For this reason, chronic alcoholics may have insufficient thiamine for maintenance of normal brain function, even with seemingly adequate dietary intake.|$|E

40|$|Background: Liver {{diseases}} in HIV infected persons can occur due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections, <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholisms,</b> and hepatic tuberculosis or due to hepatitis caused by antiretroviral drugs. Co infection of HIV and HBV is frequently encountered with HIV having {{negative impact on}} HBV progression. Objectives: The objectives {{of this study was}} to detect the prevalence of hepatitis B virus in HIV positive individuals and impact of HBV- HIV on liver function tests. Materials & Methods:- Serum of 200 patients positive for HIV were screened for HBsAg by ELISA test and LFTs were performed in first, second and third week in serum of patients co infected with HIV- HBV and HBV alone. Results:- Prevalence of HBV was found in 15 out of 200 HIV positives with maximum in age group 21 - 40 yrs 60 % of the cases. In HIV-HBV co-infected patients the amount of total Bilirubin, ALP and ALT was found to be considerably lower as compared to HBV infected persons only and the difference was statistically significant. Conclusions:- From the present study it is fairly clear that the co-infection of HIV and HBV is an emerging problem that should be addressed immediately. Hepatic damage in case of co-infected patients should not be assessed only on the basis of serum liver enzyme estimation as their rise is not significant enough in these cases...|$|R

25|$|Binge {{drinking}} has {{the propensity}} {{to result in}} brain damage faster {{as well as more}} severely than <b>chronic</b> drinking (<b>alcoholism),</b> due to the neurotoxic effects of the repeated rebound withdrawal effects. During the repeated alcohol free stages associated with binge drinking, a larger amount of glutamate is released than occurs during withdrawal from chronic alcohol abuse; additionally this extreme release of glutamate happens on a repeated basis in binge drinkers leading to excitotoxicity. The tolerance that occurs during chronic ('non-stop') drinking delays alcohol-related brain damage compared to binge drinking, which induced immediate and repeated insults to the brain.|$|R

25|$|Extreme binge {{drinking}} {{can lead to}} brain damage faster and more severely than <b>chronic</b> drinking (<b>alcoholism).</b> The neurotoxic insults are due to very large amounts of glutamate which are released and over-stimulate the brain as a binge finishes. This results in excitotoxicity, a process which damages or kills neurons (brain cells). Each {{binge drinking}} episode immediately insults the brain; repeat episodes result in accumulating harm. The developing adolescent brain {{is thought to be}} particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of binge drinking, with some evidence of brain damage occurring from drinking more than 10 or 11 drinks once or twice per month. With prolonged abstinence neurogenesis occurs which can potentially reverse the damage from alcohol abuse.|$|R

These tests may also help to identify contributing causes, such as drug interaction, <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholism,</b> or another condition or disease.

25|$|Secondary vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{is associated}} with chronic malabsorption of lipids, impaired bile production and release, and chronic exposure to oxidants, such as cigarette smoke, and <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholism.</b> Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin and depends on micellar solubilization for dispersion into the small intestine, which results in poor use of vitamin A from low-fat diets. Zinc deficiency can also impair absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin A because {{it is essential for}} the synthesis of the vitamin A transport proteins and as the cofactor in conversion of retinol to retinal. In malnourished populations, common low intakes of vitamin A and zinc increase the severity of vitamin A deficiency and lead physiological signs and symptoms of deficiency. A study in Burkina Faso showed major reduction of malaria morbidity with combined vitamin A and zinc supplementation in young children.|$|E
25|$|In February 1910, Madetoja—while {{composing}} the incidental {{music for}} Eino Leino's play, Shakkipeli (Chess)—made the acquaintance of the Finnish poet Hilja Onerva Lehtinen (a.k.a., L.

Although Madetoja was five years Onerva's junior, their relationship gradually deepened into love, and in 1913, they (thrice) announced their engagement, telling everyone that they were married (in fact, they were not formally married until 1918). Due to their precarious financial situation, an orchestral rehearsal in Turku doubled as honeymoon. Their marriage was childless (even though they wished to have children) and tempestuous, plagued by quarrels and <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholism,</b> from which both suffered.

With James Williamson signed on as guitarist, the search began for a rhythm section. However, since neither Pop nor Williamson were satisfied with any players in England, they decided to re-unite the Stooges. Ron Asheton grudgingly moved from guitar to bass. The recording sessions produced the rock landmark Raw Power.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the last}} century, {{advances}} in {{medical care and}} longevity have resulting {{in an increase in}} the elderly population, and the world and Turkey populations have become older. In parallel with the aging population, problems seen in old people have been increasing. Burn, one of these problems, causes more serious injuries and high level of mortality in people aged 65 years and over compared to the general population. Reduction in sensory/cognitive functions, slowing reflexes, limited movements and accompanying situations (<b>chronic</b> diseases, <b>alcoholism,</b> used medication, neurological and psychiatric disorders) which are due to physiology of elderly people increase the burn incidence and the severity of burn. In addition, these factors could also raise the ventilation requirement, complications and hospitalization period in burnt patients. Despite the recent developmetns in burn treatment and care, burn is still a serious health problem for elderly people. As the majority of the burn injuries are preventable, the essential point of burn administration in elderly people should be related to the prevention of burn incidence.
