40|$|Increasingly, {{industry}} practitioners now pursue {{corporate identity}} as a broad phenomenon spanning various business disciplines. However, very few works within corporate identity literature recognize this belief. As such it appears that literature on corporate identity, for the most part, has been narrowly conceived. The pursuit of corporate identity along the multidisciplinary perspective, especially among industry practitioners, encourages the author to develop what he terms an extended <b>corporate</b> identity <b>mix</b> that recognizes the broad nature of corporate identity. Specifically, the author suggests what he terms the extended <b>corporate</b> identity <b>mix,</b> which broadens the theory of <b>corporate</b> identity <b>mix</b> beyond the enclave of symbolism, behaviour communication, strategy, structure, and culture. Indeed, a major finding {{in this study is}} five new channels that contribute significantly to the expression of a firm’s personality, comprising organization storytelling, core competence, visual style, and buyer value. The paper calls on academics to pursue corporate identity studies {{in such a way that}} the extended <b>corporate</b> identity <b>mix</b> that emerges from this paper is accommodated...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{aim of this}} {{conceptual}} {{paper is}} to review Bernstein’s communication wheel {{in order to make}} it a tool that can be used in the selection of a <b>corporate</b> communication <b>mix.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A critical analysis of Bernstein’s communication wheel shows it to be a checklist, a starting point in the examination of <b>corporate</b> communication <b>mix,</b> but it is not as such of great help to the decision-maker. Findings – The findings of reviewing literature highlight that the principle of a clear distinction between strategic decisions and operational decisions is applicable also in the field of corporate communication. For each stakeholder relationship, our framework suggests typical combinations of activities and means to be employed. These combinations are useful to experiment with expert systems which are functional to the choices of <b>corporate</b> communication <b>mix.</b> Research limitations/implications – The analysis of communication gaps gives directions for formulating strategic decisions. In our framework tactical decisions concern the components of the communication mix architecture (or communication chain) : activities, means and vehicles of communication. On the contrary, Bernstein’s communication wheel includes only generic channels (or media) and gives no indications as to the architecture of the communication mix. Originality/value – This study illustrates the hierarchy of decisions relating to <b>corporate</b> communication <b>mix,</b> the communication wheel could also be useful in communication planning. If this assumption is held to be true it then becomes possible to lay out a framework for a progressive decision-making path that means making sequential choices (first strategic, then tactical). In the stakeholder approach, the aim of strategic decisions is to choose the stakeholder groups on which a firm has to focus its corporate communication activities...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the response}} of aggregate and sectoral stock returns to monetary policy announcements and inflation in the United Kingdom. Given the unique monetary policy framework, the monetary policymaking process and inflation target of the United Kingdom are different from other countries in many aspects, investigating the UK case could add international evidence to the current literature. This thesis contains three main parts: (i) monetary policy and stock returns, examining the impact of monetary policy announcements on stock returns and stock market volatility under different monetary policy regimes, especially {{before and after the}} independence of the Bank of England in 1997; (ii) inflation and stock returns, investigating the issues whether common stocks are a hedge against inflation in short, medium and long-term and under different inflationary economies and regimes; (iii) <b>corporate</b> financing <b>mix</b> and inflation exposure, testing how <b>corporate</b> financing <b>mix</b> affects the exposure of common stocks to inflation. The results suggest that monetary policy announcements negatively affect stock returns and significantly impact stock market volatility. The responses of stock returns and stock market volatility vary before and after May 1997, when the Bank of England gained independence, which suggests that a change in the monetary policymaking process tends to affect the responses of stock markets. The research also uncovers the fact that the UK stock market fails to hedge against inflation in short and medium-term, but provides a good hedge against inflation in long-term. Different inflationary economies or regimes also affect the relationship between inflation and stock returns. In addition, this thesis finds support for the nominal contracting effect suggesting that firms with higher debtors gain while firms with higher creditors lose from higher-than-expected inflation. The empirical mixture of the results found in the relationship between inflation and stock returns is likely to be explained by the nominal contracting hypothesis.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to extend}} the current {{knowledge}} about corporate image formation process by developing a comprehensive model which incorporates <b>corporate</b> identity <b>mix</b> elements (i. e. symbolism, communication, and behaviour) and unplanned communication factors (i. e. interpersonal, intermediary and intrapersonal communication). By examining the proposed conceptual model, this study challenges the claims of anything a company does communicate its identity (Balmer, 1997, 2001; Van Riel and Balmer, 1997) by testing the impact of company-driven communication efforts on corporate image formation in the consumer context. It also adopts the understanding of corporate image as a composite product of multiple communication factors (Bhattacharya and Sen, 2003; Cornelissen, 2000) {{and in addition to}} formal communication efforts it specifically tests the role of interpersonal communication, intermediary communication and intrapersonal communication factors in corporate image formation (Cornelissen, 2000). This research adopts a predominantly quantitative approach which is supported by insights from an exploratory phase that encompasses in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The main survey data is derived from a cross-sectional survey which is conducted in Turkey. The data drawn from 439 questionnaires is analysed by multivariate data analysis technique including exploratory factor analysis (EFA), Cronbach alpha, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings show that not every aspect of <b>corporate</b> identity <b>mix</b> elements (e. g. corporate aesthetics, staff apparel) is considered to be salient communicators of corporate identity by consumers. They also indicate that when consumers attribute positive feelings to a company’s corporate visual identity systems, when they think that marketing communication activities reflect corporate values, and when they perceive a company as socially responsible, they tend to form a favourable image of that organisation. Moreover, the results highlight that interpersonal communication (word-of-mouth information exchange among close friends and relatives) and intrapersonal factors (i. e. corporate associations gap, consumer-company identification, emotional appeal, consumer-company value congruence) are determinants of corporate image formation. However, it is found that employee behaviour and intermediary communication may not activate immediate associations about corporate image.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to compare the verbal (marketing, communications, strategic management schools) and visual (design schools) models of corporate identity management. This is done with a view to understand where the area can add leverage to the competitive capability of the multidisciplinary nature of the area.

Finally, the paper examines the variables and analyses of the models of the corporate identity management process to which design management discipline may be able to add some value. It concludes that the model of corporate identity management with a particular emphasis on the process of strategic management within design management field, should have to be undertaken if we are to realize some of the potential that corporate identity could add to the discipline in other areas.

Two distinct periods were identified. In the initial period, prior to March 1998 the market viewed NED appointments favourably. After March 1998 NED appointments were no longer significant economic events.

It is now {{a significant part of}} the <b>corporate</b> communication <b>mix</b> and is viewed as a highly cost-effective method of marketing. Sport sponsorship is beginning to compete against other elements of the communication mix for funding; especially where cost savings can be shown. Sponsorships are used to achieve a wide range of objectives. ^ The purpose of this study was threefold. The first part was to determine the reasons companies engage in the sponsorship exchange process. The second part was to describe the decision-making procedures followed by companies in the sponsorship exchange process. The third part was to determine if certain company characteristics are related to the way companies approach the sponsorship exchange process. ^ The sample consisted of 303 companies that have participated in the sponsorship exchange process. Respondents completed a survey instrument that establishes corporate demographics, sponsorship budget, selection criteria, and the decision-making structure of the company. In-depth interviews were conducted with twenty of the corporations surveyed. ^ In general, results revealed that companies engage in the sponsorship exchange process to increase brand awareness, position a product, fortify an image, reach specific demographics, and increase sales. Results also indicated even though the decision makers can be neatly classified, each corporation has a unique decision-making procedure. Results further indicated that there is a significant difference between the decision-making process of small and large companies.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the financing}} decisions of listed non-financial corporations in France, Germany and the UK {{over the period}} 1969 to 2000. These countries represent satisfactorily different financial structures of their classes, Le., Latinic, Germanic and Anglo-Saxon traditions, respectively. Thus, this thesis attempts {{to shed light on}} the impact of institutional differences (accounting and taxation systems, bankruptcy laws, corporate governance structure) on <b>corporate</b> financing <b>mix</b> policies. The empirical investigation comprises three main themes; capital structure (debt versus equity), debt maturity structure (short-term versus long-term debt), and debt ownership structure public versus private debt). It is obvious that factors influencing financial strategies of firms change overtime and firms are expected to adjust themselves to their target financing structure according to random events. For these reasons we use dynamic panel data and choose Generalised Methods of Moments (GMM) as an appropriate estimation procedure for our autoregressive-distributed lag model GMM methodology overcomes the problems of endogeneity, heteroscedasticity, normality, simultaneity and measurement errors, which are common for studies using firm-level data. The empirical evidence shows that corporate financing decisions are determined by both firm-specific (profitability, tangibility and maturity of assets, growth, quality, size, liquidity, payout policy, corporate tax rates, and earnings volatility), and market-related factors (term structure of interest rates, market equity premium, interest rate volatility, stock return volatility, stock price performance). However, the strength and nature of the effect of these factors are dependent on the financial environment and tradition of the countries of interest. Therefore, our research argues that financing mix decisions of firms are not only the product of their own characteristics, but also the outcome of environment and traditions in which they operate...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{corporate}} governance in different institutional and national contexts {{is important because}} of the peculiarity of differing institutional environments, {{and the extent to}} which governance models are transferred or copied from one environment to another. Thus, research in each area enriches our understanding of corporate governance in general. Despite the fact that governments globally have placed privatisation at the top of the policy agenda in recent years, there are some sectors that have experienced very little or limited privatisation, for example education. The purpose of this thesis is to give a critical account of the introduction and development of the privatised education system in Qatar following consultancy advice from RAND 1 in 2001 and to explore the model of corporate governance used for that delivery. In presenting and reviewing, these developments in Qatar, this thesis will serve three purposes: 1) To challenge some findings of prior research; 2) To suggest a <b>corporate</b> governance <b>mix</b> for this case that encompasses a broader view of governance than has been considered in prior research; and 3) To identify gaps in past research that represent promising opportunities for future study. The guiding question raised in this thesis is, ―what are the roles and challenges of corporate governance structures (mechanisms, approaches), in contributing to the development and establishment of Qatar‘s unique privatised education system?‖ The researcher chose this question because of the relative neglect of corporate governance aspects in this instance.

40|$|Most of the {{existing}} evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} large shareholders in corporate governance has been restricted to a handful of developed countries, notably the UK, US, Germany and Japan. This paper provides evidence on the role of large shareholders in monitoring company value from a developing and emerging economy, India, whose corporate governance system is a hybrid of the outsider-dominated market-based systems of the UK and the US, and the insider-dominated bankbased systems of Germany and Japan. The picture of large-shareholder monitoring that emerges from our case study of Indian <b>corporates</b> is a <b>mixed</b> one. Like many of {{the existing}} studies, while we find blockholdings by directors to increase company value after a certain level of holdings, we find no evidence that institutional investors, typically mutual funds, are active in governance.

40|$|Increasing the {{integration}} of marketing and R&D is widely recognized as an approach to improve the new product performance (NPP) of companies. However, empirical evidence for {{the positive effect of}} integration on NPP, especially at the <b>corporate</b> level, is <b>mixed.</b> This study provides a comprehensive theoretical underpinning of the conditions that influence the benefits that can be obtained from more integration. A model of the effect of integration on NPP, in conjunction with a company?s resources and strategic scope, is developed and tested with data from a worldwide sample of companies in the pharmaceutical industry (n = 148). Our results show that the effect of integration is indeed dependent on the situation. In particular it depends on the company?s underlying resources (i. e., specialized knowledge and assets) : integration multiplies the positive effect of resources on NPP. The strength of the multiplication effect is in turn dependent on strategic scope. It is strong if the strategic scope is narrow, i. e., for companies with selective products in a few market segments. Our results imply that, when trying to improve NPP, management should not invariably think of increasing integration. Instead, they should evaluate the company?s resource (dis) advantages, its strategic scope, and the level of integration. If the company scores low on resources, increasing integration should not be a high priority. Additionally, integration is most important for companies with a narrow strategic scope where the interdependency between marketing and R&D is relatively strong. resources;marketing-R&D interface;new product performance;strategic scope...|$|R

Cause-related marketing uses ideas from various specialized areas such as the communication <b>mix,</b> <b>corporate</b> social responsibility, marketing for non-profit organizations and can provide benefits for all parties involved in the process, including the cause and consumers, and as such it can be a powerful tool. The purpose of this research is to determine how cause-related marketing will influence consumers in an online environment. To study this, a quantitative and cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of 150 respondents. The study was conducted through an experiment, aimed at determining the effects of cause-brand fit and consumer-cause identification on consumers’ evaluations of online stores and online purchase intention. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the results of the experiment. The results show that consumer-cause identification has a positive impact on perceived value, and that this relationship is moderated by brand-cause fit, while revealing that it doesn’t influence online purchase intention. Brand-cause fit was shown to also have a positive influence on trust and online purchase intention, which is also impacted by perceived value. Trust on the other hand was shown to be a predictor of perceived value but not online purchase intention. Further discussion on the results and their managerial implications was conducted...|$|R

5000|$|Commandant Sylvestre, M. Sylvestre and Cardinal Sylvestre are fictional {{characters}} {{based on the}} American actor Sylvester Stallone (although when Sylvester Stallone himself is represented, or represented as Rambo, he has a different appearance and a different voice). They are a parody of [...] "an ugly American" [...] and of greedy multinationals and the military-industrial complex. They always say [...] "beuuarhh" [...] (...) instead of [...] "" [...] ( [...] , good evening) as a salute. During the first Gulf War, the Guignols had a character called Commandant Sylvestre. Cmdt Sylvestre would explain the war in broad terms ("Here's the good guys, that's us, and here are the ragheads, so we'll kill everybody there...") After the war, Cmdt Sylvestre was reintroduced as Mr Sylvestre, a ubiquitous executive from the military-industrial complex, the <b>corporate</b> world (all <b>mixed</b> into the fictional corporation World Company), and the CIA. Sylvestre is dressed in suit and tie and wears a security badge. He is assisted by clones of himself. His appearance {{is a blend of}} Sylvester Stallone and Al Pacino (mainly the lower part of his face). Cardinal Sylvestre, joined with Reverend Sylvestre, Imam Sylvestre, Rabbi Sylvestre and other religious leaders, form the Church Company, twin sister of the World Company specialized in [...] "religious business". Since the beginning of the European economic crisis, Mr. Sylvestre is often an Moody's analyst. Mr. Sylvestre is a caricature of globalization and is very cynical.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades of the Chinese {{economic}} reform with a focus on the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) restructuring, one striking phenomenon is the rise of the mixed ownership enterprises (MOEs) in China. The objective of this thesis is to analyse the factors that can explain the emergence {{and the rise of the}} MOEs, to explore the corporate governance of the MOEs, and to assess the performance of the MOEs. The research finds that the unique experiments and practices of China’s SOEs reform in the past 30 years have formed the China Model of SOEs reform, China’s mixed ownership has its roots in the China Model. One major explanation to the rise of the MOEs is the synergy effect gained from the combination of the different advantages of both the private enterprises and the state enterprises. The private enterprises have better operational mechanisms and the state enterprises have better access to business resources and political support. The thesis has looked at 5 issues of the institutional arrangements of MOE’s corporate governance, named as the SCORE. It is found that the largest shareholder in most of the MOEs is still the state, but the control structure is not always corresponding to the shareholding structure, and the governmental intervention in the business of the MOEs has been reduced although the reduction is limited. The thesis shows that there is no noted relationship between <b>corporate</b> performance and <b>mixed</b> ownership, but the transfer of corporate controlling powers is very important for the ownership-transformed companies from whole ownership to mixed ownership to improve the performance. On this basis, the thesis argues that China needs to push forward the further commercialization of the corporate governance of the MOEs in the futureEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
