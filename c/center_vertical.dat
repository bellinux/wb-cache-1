Initially designated the S-37-2 and registered X3698 or NX3698 this aircraft had slightly better performance than the first version and {{was designed as a}} bomber for the United States Army Air Corps. Later called the VS-37B Guardian, it was equipped with Pratt & Whitney Hornet engines and a redesigned tail that eliminated the adjustable <b>center</b> <b>vertical</b> stabilizer and increased the size of the rudders. The Army Air Corps performed flight testing at Wilbur Wright Field under the designation XP-496 but the aircraft failed to meet Army requirements and was rejected. In 1929 it was converted into a passenger commercial ship with Jupiter engines installed then sold to New York, Rio and Buenos Aries Airlines. In 1934 this aircraft, now registered as NR942M, was rebuilt and fitted with pontoons for a [...] "Round-the-World" [...] flight eastbound from Chicago to Chicago. As the flight approached Cleveland one of the engines caught fire and the crew made an emergency landing on Lake Erie. After repairs the flight continued but later crashed in the north Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

40|$|Right {{hemisphere}} damage often provokes {{signs of}} visual neglect, {{characterized by a}} prominent left-right imbalance in information processing. Neglect patients are biased towards right-sided objects and ignore left-sided events. Left-right imbalance may not only result from left neglect but also from right attraction, which have been considered as, respectively, defective and productive phenomena in neglect patients. However, the relative contributions of these two mechanisms to the final left-right imbalance remain uncertain. Using a novel experimental paradigm, {{we were able to}} separately test the contribution of left neglect and right attraction to neglect behavior. We used horizontal and vertical lines implemented in L shapes in a line extension task. The use of L shapes oriented either to the left or to the right made it possible to measure the left bias by comparing the length of a left-sided horizontal line to that of a <b>centered</b> <b>vertical</b> line, and to measure the right bias by comparing a <b>centered</b> <b>vertical</b> to a rightwards horizontal line. Our results showed that, in this experimental set, the left-right discrepancy is supported more by left neglect than by right attraction, with important implications about the role of left-right competition on the deployment of left neglect and right attraction...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} superstructure {{consisted of}} the two wrought-iron arched girders with lattice webbing and a timber floor system. The arch girders {{are made up of}} a pair of [...] "Z"-shaped bars riveted to a central plate diaphragm. Diagonal lattice members fill the web between the upper and lower portions of the plate. Each arch has seven vertical members that support the floor system, along with the lattice and bottom tie plate. Bowstring-type tie rods extend diagonally {{from the bottom of the}} <b>center</b> <b>vertical</b> on both sides of each arch.|$|E
50|$|It is {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} multiple diagonal members projecting down {{from the top of the}} end posts at a variety of angles. These diagonal members extend to the bottom of each of the vertical members of the truss with the longest diagonal extending to the <b>center</b> <b>vertical</b> member. Many Fink trusses do not include a lower chord (the lowest horizontal member). This gives the bridge an unfinished saw-toothed appearance when viewed from the side or below, and makes the design very easy to identify. If the bridge deck is carried along the bottom of the truss (called a through truss) or if a lightweight lower chord is present, identification is made solely by the multiple diagonal members emanating from the end post tops.|$|E

The results indicate a need for tailoring the motion without dynamics to suit the task, with reduced washouts for precision maneuvering as compared to aggressive maneuvering. Visual delay data are inconclusive, but suggest that it may be better to allow some time delay in the visual path to minimize the mismatch between vision and motion, rather than eliminate the visual delay entirely through lead compensation.
