50|$|Whenever {{the winds}} would summon their {{forces on the}} Baltic Sea and rush into the hinterland, they would first rush {{unimpeded}} across the hills of Södermanland into Närke. At Närke they would then <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> the ridge of Kilsbergen, which would turn the winds southwards, where they would then <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> Tiveden, which would direct them eastwards to <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> Tylöskog. They would then rush northwards to <b>collide</b> <b>collides</b> <b>with</b> Käglan, turning the winds westwards again towards Kilsbergen, and so on. The winds would be circulate in this manner in smaller and smaller circles until {{there was nothing left}} but a whirlwind on the plain.|$|R

30|$|In a {{conventional}} DCF, acknowledge (ACK) frames never <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> other frames because the ACK frames are transmitted after the short interframe space (SIFS) period.

50|$|Electric glow {{discharge}} {{is common in}} gas lasers. For example, in the helium-neon laser the electrons from the discharge <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> the helium atoms, exciting them. The excited helium atoms then <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> neon atoms, transferring energy. This allows an inverse population of neon atoms to build up.|$|R
50|$|PaX {{leaves a}} portion of the addresses, the MSBs, out of the {{randomization}} calculations. This helps assure that the stack and heap are placed so that they do not <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> each other, and that libraries are placed so that the stack and heap do not <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> them.|$|R
