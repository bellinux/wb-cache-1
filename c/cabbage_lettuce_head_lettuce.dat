40|$|This project {{encompasses}} the design, construction, {{and evaluation of}} a vertical hydropoinc tower. The tower was designed to cycle nutrient rich water through two hydropoinc systems, drip and nutrient film technique then return the water back to the reservoir. The tower will grow 5 different plant varieties. Evaluations have been done on the elevation, system type, and crop type to determine the most productive. The tower contained four troughs where plants were grown. Due {{to the structure of}} the tower two of the troughs were elevated 20 ” higher than the other two troughs. The elevation of the plants did not cause a noticeable difference in growth. The two systems used were Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) and Drip. The NFT system contained a set water level in the troughs to allow the plants to receive water through the roots. The Drip system ran a hose to each of the plants allowing the plants to receive water as it passes by their roots. The two systems grew plants at the same rate and growth was not noticeably different between the two systems. The leafy plants used were romaine <b>lettuce,</b> <b>head</b> <b>lettuce,</b> winterbor kale, swiss chard, and bonnie spinach. The crops that exhibited the largest growth in the 18 days were the romaine <b>lettuce,</b> <b>head</b> <b>lettuce,</b> and winterbor kale. The idea of growing with a vertical hydropoinc tower is to increase the productivity per acre of land. Keeping this in mind a recommendation for future growing cycles is to use the same wood frame but to modify the troughs by adding an additional hole between the existing holes {{to increase the amount of}} plants grown. Another recommendation is to only use the NFT irrigation system because you will not need to purchase emitters and additional hose to run to each plant. Lastly growing a variety of romaine <b>lettuce,</b> <b>head</b> <b>lettuce,</b> and winterbor kale together in the system is recommended because they displayed the largest and quickest growth in the 18 days of growing...|$|R

40|$|Organic lettuce {{growers in}} California {{typically}} use insectary strips of alyssum (Lobularia maritima (L.) Desv.) to attract hoverflies (Syrphidae) that provide biological control of aphids. A two year study with transplanted organic romaine lettuce in Salinas, California investigated agronomic aspects of lettuce monoculture and lettuce-alyssum strip intercropping on beds in replacement intercropping treatments where alyssum transplants replaced 2 to 8 % of the lettuce transplants, and in additive intercropping treatments where alyssum transplants {{were added to}} the standard lettuce density without displacing lettuce transplants. Alyssum and lettuce dry matter (DM) were determined at lettuce maturity. Alyssum transplants produced less shoot DM in the additive than in the replacement intercropping treatments. The number of open inflorescences of alyssum increased with alyssum DM, and among treatments ranged from 2 to 15 inflorescences per <b>lettuce</b> <b>head.</b> Compared with monoculture <b>lettuce,</b> <b>lettuce</b> <b>heads</b> on intercropped beds were slightly smaller and had lower nitrogen concentrations in the both additive treatments and in some replacement treatments. This research provides the first information on a novel additive intercropping approach to provide alyssum floral resources for biological control of lettuce aphids, and suggests that this approach may be a more land-efficient particularly for producing smaller <b>lettuce</b> <b>heads</b> for romaine hearts or for markets with less strict size requirements.

40|$|International audienceOrganic {{products}} were analysed {{for the presence}} of contaminants, micro-organisms and antibiotic resistance and compared with those from conventional products. No differences were observed in the Fusarium toxins deoxynivalenol and zearalenone in organic and conventional wheat, both during a dry period and a very wet period promoting the production of these toxins. Nitrate levels in <b>head</b> <b>lettuce</b> produced organically in the open field were much lower than those in conventional products. In iceberg <b>lettuce</b> and <b>head</b> <b>lettuce</b> from the green house no differences were detected. Organically produced carrots contained higher nitrate levels than conventional products. Both organic and conventional products contained no residues of non-polar pesticides above the legal limits, although some were detected in conventional lettuce. Organic products contained no elevated levels of heavy metals. Salmonella was detected in 30 % of pig faeces samples obtained from 30 organic farms, similar to the incidence at conventional farms. At farms that switched to organic production more then 6 years ago, no Salmonella was detected, {{with the exception of one}} stable with young pigs recently purchased from another farm. No Salmonella was detected in faeces at the nine farms with organic broilers, and at one out of 10 farms with laying hens. This is comparable to conventional farms where the incidence for Salmonella lies around 10 %. Campylobacter was detected in faeces at all organic broiler farms, being much higher than at conventional farms. One of the most remarkable results was the fact that faeces from organic pigs and broilers showed a much lower incidence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, except for Campylobacter in broilers. It is concluded that the organic products investigated scored equally good as conventional products with regard to food safety and at the same time show some promising features with respect to antibiotic resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{survival}} of Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson and Escherichia coli O 157 was investigated on growing butterhead lettuce {{plants in the}} plant-growth chamber and greenhouse. All inoculation tests were made under conditions that approximate the greenhouse conditions for butterhead lettuce cultivation in Flanders (Belgium). The survival and proliferation of the pathogens on the leaves was determined at days 0, 4, and 8 after inoculation using standard plating techniques on selective medium. In the growth chamber, {{the extent to which}} both pathogens were able to multiply on the lettuce leaves was influenced by crop stage and leaf age. On young plants, the older leaves supported pathogen survival better. On nearly mature plants, pathogen population sizes were significantly higher on the old and young leaves compared with middle-aged leaves (p < 0. 001). In the greenhouse, the environmental regimen with high fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity was less conducive to the {{survival of}} E. coli O 157, though its survival on nearly mature lettuce was enhanced by overhead irrigation.

The last irrigation was scheduled 24, 16 and 6 {{days prior to}} harvest resulting in soil’s water content of 15. 9 %, 17. 0 % and 17. 2 %, respectively, at harvest. Lettuce receiving the last irrigation 6 days before harvest had 10 % more weight, higher total aerobic bacteria and shorter shelf life than plants irrigated 24 days before harvest. The plants with the last irrigation scheduled 16 days before harvest showed similar weight at harvest, lower total aerobic count and longer shelf life than plants with irrigation termination scheduled 6 days prior to harvest. The effect of field’s moisture prior to harvest on quality was further evaluated with lettuce harvested 1 and 7 days after a rainfall event.

40|$|In the 2001 - 2002 {{production}} season, Fusarium wilt {{was observed}} {{for the first}} time in six different lettuce fields in the Gila and Dome Valley production areas of Yuma County, Arizona. The disease was found in 11 additional sites during 2002 - 2003. Fusarium wilt presents a serious threat to the health of the lettuce industry in Arizona. The only effective means of controlling Fusarium wilt of lettuce at this time is to avoid infested fields. On the other hand, Fusarium wilt in other crops, such as tomatoes and melons, is controlled effectively by planting cultivars resistant to the pathogen. The relative resistance of lettuce cultivars grown in the Arizona desert production region is unknown; therefore, a cultivar evaluation trial was established in a field known to contain the wilt pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lactucae. Tested cultivars were grouped into three different planting dates: Sep 7, Oct 17 and Dec 6, 2002. A majority of the cultivars within each planting date were those that would be planted in the desert at that time. Fusarium wilt was severe in the early planting of lettuce (Sep 7), moderate in the second planting (Oct 17) and very mild in the third planting (Dec 6). Disease severity was low in some lettuce cultivars in the second planting and most cultivars in the third planting.

40|$|Lettuce is a cool-seasoned vegetable, {{which is}} very fragile and should {{therefore}} be handled with great care. Processed lettuce (loose leaves and shredded lettuce), is more prone to handling damage than intact <b>lettuce</b> crisp <b>heads.</b> <b>Lettuce</b> produces very little ethylene (less than 0, 1 ul/kg- 1 /h- 1), but is extremely sensitive to damage from ethylene. In lettuce, ethylene induces a postharvest physiological disorder known as russet spotting. Due to its climacteric nature, lettuce is very sensitive to ethylene. Ethylene sets in motion a programmed {{series of events that}} accelerates senescence in lettuce. Besides causing russet spotting, ethylene also stimulates cell membrane and cell wall damage. In wounded (lightly processed) tissue ethylene production increases, resulting in increased russet spotting and accelerated senescence. Reactive oxygen species are likely role-players involved in membrane damage. Hydrogen peroxide is the primary mediator in membrane degradation; hydrogen peroxide levels remained constantly high during storage. Plant free radical scavengers, such as ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase protect membranes from damage by free oxygen radicals. The activities of ascorbate peroxidase and catalase was determined during storage and was found not to increase during senescence. Applying different postharvest treatments such as controlled atmospheric storage, 1 -MCP, and short heat-shocks to iceberg lettuce significantly suppressed the negative effects of ethylene. These treatments were effective in suppressing russet spotting and senescence as indicated by reduction in moisture loss and ion leakage. Treatment with electro-activated water, did not affect ethylene sensitivity, but did limit moisture loss by lowering the rate of transpiration by increasing stomatal resistance, thus contributing to the retention of crispness and improved longevity.
