5|$|Many {{surviving}} funerary busts reached Western museums {{during the}} 19th century. Palmyra provided {{the most convenient}} Eastern examples bolstering an art-history controversy {{at the turn of}} the 20th century: to what extent Eastern influence on Roman art replaced idealized classicism with frontal, hieratic and simplified figures (as believed by Josef Strzygowski and others). This transition is seen as a response to <b>cultural</b> <b>changes</b> in the Western Roman Empire, rather than artistic influence from the East. Palmyrene bust reliefs, unlike Roman sculptures, are rudimentary portraits; although many reflect high quality individuality, the majority vary little across figures of similar age and gender.|$|E
5|$|From around 2000 to 800BC, {{the people}} of the Bronze Age built the 1,400 Bronze Age round barrows that are known to exist on the Yorkshire Wolds. These are found both in {{isolation}} and grouped together to form cemeteries. Many of these sites can still be seen as prominent features in the present-day landscape. By the later Bronze Age, an open, cleared, landscape predominated on the Wolds. It was used for grazing and also for arable cultivation. The wetlands {{on either side of the}} Wolds in the River Hull valley, Holderness and the Vale of York were also being used for animal rearing at this time. In the Iron Age there were further <b>cultural</b> <b>changes</b> in the area. There emerged a distinctive local tradition known as the Arras Culture, named after a site at Arras, near Market Weighton. There are similarities between the chariot burials of the Arras Culture and groups of La Tene burials in northern Europe, where the burial of carts was also practised. The area became the kingdom of the tribe known as the Parisi.|$|E
5|$|Scotland in the High Middle Ages is a {{relatively}} well-studied topic and Scottish medievalists have produced {{a wide variety of}} publications. Some, such as David Dumville, Thomas Owen Clancy and Dauvit Broun, are primarily interested in the native cultures of the country, and often have linguistic training in the Celtic languages. Normanists, such as G.W.S. Barrow, are concerned with the Norman and Scoto-Norman cultures introduced to Scotland after the eleventh century. For much of the twentieth century, historians tended to stress the cultural change that took place in Scotland during this time. However, scholars such as Cynthia Neville and Richard Oram, while not ignoring <b>cultural</b> <b>changes,</b> argue that continuity with the Gaelic past was just as, if not more, important.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{post-acquisition}} <b>cultural</b> <b>change</b> following international acquisitions. Despite the acknowledged {{complexity of}} the cultural encounter in acquisitions, less is known about <b>cultural</b> <b>change</b> following acquisitions by global organizations where a tension between espoused vs. practiced cultures co-exists. Our study leads us to identify the drivers, outcomes and directions of post-acquisition <b>cultural</b> <b>change</b> amid such contexts. In contrast to a seemingly singular, monolithical perspective, we present post-acquisition <b>cultural</b> <b>change</b> as a dyadic, bipolar process, whereby acquired firms cohabit the space between espoused and practiced values. Reflecting the acquirer’s cultural regime, targets align with either the acquirer’s espoused or practiced culture. Further, whereas previous research parallels <b>cultural</b> <b>change</b> with explicit initiatives, we find that <b>cultural</b> <b>change</b> results from all post-acquisition integration activity. Given the power of practiced over espoused culture, the findings call for recognition that in global organizations leveraging culture goes beyond leveraging values only. The findings {{are based on a}} large-scale qualitative research program, wherein eight international acquisitions conducted by four Finnish, globally-operating industrial acquirers were studied, totalling 166 interviews.

So what steps can leaders take in order to tackle <b>cultural</b> <b>change</b> successfully and what are meaningful change strategies...|$|R
5|$|Since the 1990s, the {{official}} State Flag of Georgia {{had been a}} center of controversy as it incorporated the historic Confederate flag dating to the American Civil War, which among some people is thought to symbolize resistance to <b>cultural</b> <b>changes</b> in the state. After 2001 changes to the flag which removed this, Governor of Georgia Roy Barnes, who had led the flag-redesign effort, was defeated for re-election; many {{thought it was the}} result of the political backlash. The 1956 version with the Confederate States of America battle emblem, known as a St.Andrew's cross, was a continuing topic of debate for southern heritage proponents. Reed served as one of Governor Sonny Perdue's floor leaders in debates that led to the ratification of the current (2003) version of the state flag.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} music of South India {{is known as}} Carnatic music, which includes rhythmic and structured music by composers like Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa, Tyagayya, Annamacharya, Bhakta Ramadasu, Muthuswami Dikshitar, Shyama Shastri, Kshetrayya, Mysore Vasudevachar and Swathi Thirunal. The main instrument that is used in South Indian Hindu temples is the nadaswaram, a reed instrument played along with thavil, a type of drum instrument to create an ensemble. The motion picture industry has emerged as an important platform in South India over the years, portraying the <b>cultural</b> <b>changes,</b> trends, aspirations and developments experienced by its people. South India is home to several distinct dance forms such as Bharatanatyam, Kathakali, Kerala Natanam, Koodiyattam, Kuchipudi, Margamkali, Mohiniaattam, Oppana, Ottamthullal, Theyyam, Vilasini Natyam and Yakshagana.

40|$|Organisational {{culture is}} a complex and heavily contested concept. Not only is it {{difficult}} to define what organisational culture is, {{but it is also}} very difficult to analyse how it guides and constrains behaviour, and whether and how organisational cultures change. The central argument of this article is that organisational networks can effect <b>cultural</b> <b>change</b> and that the terms ‘structural’ and ‘relational’, which are commonly used to conceptualise the properties of networks, may also provide a useful conceptual framework for understanding <b>cultural</b> <b>change.</b> While there has been some attention directed to the effects of organisational culture for networks, there has been very little attention placed on the potential for networks to shape organisational culture. Based on a detailed qualitative study of networks in the field of ‘high’ policing in Australia, the article draws on interviews with senior members of police and security agencies to explore organisational culture and <b>cultural</b> <b>change.</b> The article puts forward a network perspective on <b>cultural</b> <b>change</b> and aims to advance our knowledge of how security nodes can experience <b>cultural</b> <b>change</b> as they work together in and through networks...|$|R
40|$|This {{ground-breaking}} book {{offers a}} new approach to the understanding of everyday life, the media and <b>cultural</b> <b>change.</b> It explores the social pattern of ordinary life in the context of recent theories and accounts of social and <b>cultural</b> <b>change.</b> Brian Longhurst argues that our social and cultural lives are becoming increasingly audienced and performed and that activities in everyday life are changing due to the ever-growing importance and salience of the media. These changes involve people forging new ways of belonging, where among other things they seek to distinguish themselves from others. In <b>Cultural</b> <b>Change</b> and Ordinary Life, Longhurst evaluates changes in the media and ordinary life in the context of large-scale <b>cultural</b> <b>change,</b> especially with respect to globalization and hybridisation, fragmentation, spectacle and performance, and enthusing or fan-like activities. He makes the case that analysis of the media has to be brought into a more thorough dialogue with other forms of research that have looked at social processes. <b>Cultural</b> <b>Change</b> and Ordinary Life is key reading for students and researchers of sociology, media studies, cultural studies and mass communication...|$|R
