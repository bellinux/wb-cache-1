500|$|Jackman also {{watched a}} woman undergo brain tumor surgery and was shaken {{to see the}} woman have similar blond hair to his wife: [...] "All I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> my wife on that table. As much as I'd read the script and theorized and practiced philosophy, I knew in that moment that I was so not ready for death." [...] For his various characters, the actor assumed a {{different}} posture for each persona. As the conquistador, Jackman was upright and forward-leaning to evoke an unstoppable nature. As the scientist, the actor hunched over with a dedicated focus on his character's work, being weighed down by the [...] "world on his shoulders." [...] As the space traveler, Jackman practiced the state of zen but also exhibited a continued persistence in his endeavor.|$|E
2500|$|Goody {{initially}} {{denied that}} her comments were racist: [...] "She is Indian, thinking of an Indian name and only thing I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> Indian food. Wasn't racial at all. It {{was not to}} offend any Indian out there." [...] On a later trip to India she apologised for her behaviour, admitting that her remarks to Shetty {{could be seen as}} racist. In a video on the BBC News website, Goody said: ...|$|E
5000|$|In November 2011, {{conservative}} commentator Glenn Beck said, [...] "If {{there is}} one guy out there that is the next George Washington, the only guy that I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> Rick Santorum. I would ask that you would {{take a look at}} him." ...|$|R

5000|$|Gonz is {{the most}} {{influential}} skater of all times, no question. Mark Gonzales created how to street skate, for doing handrails and things {{that no one has}} ever done. When people were doing a boardslide on the rail and people thought that was super crazy, he was doing 180 nosegrinds and 180 fakie 50-50s. The best and most technical skater today doing the hardest tricks beyond what anyone <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> not doing what Gonz was doing then. It’s just not the same. He was an alien or something.|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, Mark Walport, the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser {{and head}} of the Government Office for Science, had this to say: [...] "My view scientifically is {{absolutely}} clear: homoeopathy is nonsense, it is non-science. My advice to ministers is clear: that there is no science in homoeopathy. The most it can have is a placebo effect – it is then a political decision whether they spend money on it or not." [...] His predecessor, John Beddington, referring to his views on homeopathy being [...] "fundamentally ignored" [...] by the Government, said: [...] "The only one [...] I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> homoeopathy, which is mad. It has no underpinning of scientific basis. In fact, all the science points {{to the fact that it}} is not at all sensible. The clear evidence is saying this is wrong, but homoeopathy is still used on the NHS." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading about Grandin renewed Gerson Saines' [...] "energy, {{motivation}} and spirit" [...] {{in coping with}} her son's condition. [...] "Temple's story brought me hope and (her mother)'s story gave me direction and purpose," [...] Gerson Saines said in a later interview. [...] "Parents {{of a child with}} autism everywhere need to hear it, functionally and spiritually. I knew this story had to be told and given my access as a talent representative in the entertainment industry, I felt it was my responsibility to make that happen." [...] Through Grandin's agent, Gerson Saines asked to meet Grandin for lunch. [...] "She came in wearing her cowgirl shirt—-in her very Temple way, in her very Temple walk. I realized that there were people staring at her, and in a different lifetime I might have been one of them, but all I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was,</b> 'I can't believe how lucky I am to be here. This woman's my hero.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|Maisie {{remembered how}} little {{she had done}} so; but she desired to protect Mrs. Beale too. The only {{protection}} she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> however, <b>was</b> the plea: [...] "Oh at papa's, you know, they don't mind!" ...|$|R
60|$|The man flushed to {{the roots}} of his hair. All that he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>were</b> the ugly words he had spoken a short time before--and now Theriere was dying! Byrne would have laughed had anyone {{suggested}} that he entertained any other sentiment than hatred toward the second officer <b>of</b> the Halfmoon--that <b>is</b> he would have twenty-four hours before; but now, quite unexpectedly, he realized that he didn't want Theriere to die, and then it dawned upon him that a new sentiment had been born within him--a sentiment to which he had been a stranger all his hard life--friendship.|$|R
60|$|They <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{nothing to}} <b>be</b> done except {{to shoot the}} man, and to that I objected.|$|R

6000|$|Dear Agnes! So {{much too}} loving and {{too good for}} anyone that I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> <b>was</b> it {{possible}} that she was reserved to be the wife of such a wretch as this! ...|$|E
60|$|Catherine {{could think}} of nothing of the kind, and Morris's {{luminosity}} seemed almost pitiless. The only thing she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> that her father might, after all, come round, and she articulated, with an awkward sense of her helplessness in doing so, a wish that this miracle might happen.|$|E
60|$|That, apparently, was {{the best}} that Giovio <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of.</b> It <b>is</b> hardly intelligible--which is perhaps inevitable, for {{it is not easy}} to be intelligible when you don't quite know, yourself, what you mean, which must have been Giovio's case.|$|R
60|$|And {{while she}} was pouring out all the {{comfortable}} words she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> Rose <b>was</b> softly bathing the eyes and dabbing the hot forehead with lavender-water, as her patient lay quiet with a {{look on his face}} that grieved her sadly.|$|R
5000|$|..... It's a {{pleasure}} to be here tonight. And speaking of RCA Victor, we're mighty proud of that Chattanooga Choo Choo, and the man that made the record, Glenn Miller. You see it's been a long time - 15 years in fact - since any record has sold a million copies. And Chattanooga Choo Choo certainly put on steam and breezed right through that million mark by over 200,000 pressings. And we decided that Glenn should get a trophy. The best one we <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> a gold record of Chattanooga. And now Glenn, it's yours - with the best wishes of RCA Victor Bluebird records.|$|R
6000|$|But all Mrs. Conroy <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> {{two and a}} half millions! It {{stared at}} her, {{stretching}} its gigantic ciphers across the room.

60|$|Peter Rabbit {{was used}} to running for his life. He {{had to do it}} at least once every day. But usually he was near a safe hiding place and he rather enjoyed the excitement. This time, however, the only place of safety he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> the {{friendly}} old brier patch, and that was a long way off.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{she called}} on me?" [...] Mrs. Wix WAS red now: his good humour wouldn't keep down her colour, which {{for a minute}} glowed there like her ugly honesty. [...] "No--there was some one in the cab." [...] The only {{attenuation}} she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> after a minute to add: [...] "But they didn't come up." ...|$|E
60|$|So Mr. George {{rang the}} bell, {{and when the}} waiter came, he ordered a sumptuous breakfast, {{consisting}} of beefsteaks, hot rolls, coffee, omelet, and every thing else that he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that <b>was</b> good, and directed the waiter to have it ready at half past nine.|$|R
60|$|In {{making this}} hasty toilet nine-tenths <b>of</b> her care <b>were</b> {{given to her}} hands. The summer had left them {{slightly}} brown, and she held them {{up and looked at}} them with some misgiving, the fourth finger of her left hand more especially. Hot washings and cold washings, certain products from bee and flower known only to country girls, everything she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> <b>were</b> used upon those little sunburnt hands, till she persuaded herself that they were really as white as could be wished by a husband with a hundred titles. Her dressing completed, she left word with Edy that she was going for a long walk, and set out in the direction of Mount Lodge.|$|R

60|$|Guy, in the meantime, was {{enduring}} {{the storm}} in loneliness, {{for he was}} unwilling to explain {{the cause of his}} trouble to his companions. The only occasion of the suspicions, which he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> <b>was</b> his request for the sum of money; and this he could not mention to Mr. Wellwood, nor was he inclined to make confidants of his other companions, though pleasant, right-minded youths.|$|E
60|$|Duane {{returned}} to Fairdale and camped in the mesquite till the twenty-third of the month. The few days seemed endless. All he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> that the hour {{in which he}} must disgrace Ray Longstreth was slowly but inexorably coming. In that waiting time he learned what love was and also duty. When the day at last dawned he rode like one possessed down the rough slope, hurdling the stones and crashing through the brush, with a sound in his ears that was not all the rush of the wind. Something dragged at him.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the young}} woman rattled on she grew more and more glib; she was what they call whopper-jawed, and spoke a {{language}} almost purely consonantal, cutting and clipping her words with a rapid play of her whopper-jaw till {{there was nothing but}} the bare bones left of them. Statira was crying, and Lemuel could not bear to see her cry. He tried to say something to comfort her, but all he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "I hope you'll get your book back," [...] and 'Manda Grier answered for her---- ...|$|E
6000|$|Maisie was now {{busy with}} her breakfast, and her {{companion}} attacked his own; {{so that it}} was all, in form at least, even more than their old sociability. [...] "Everything she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of.</b> She <b>was</b> as nice to her as you are," [...] the child said. [...] "She talked to her all day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've come,' was {{the best}} speech he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of.</b> It <b>was</b> not a good speech. It was too sinister. He felt that even as he said it. It <b>was</b> the sort <b>of</b> thing Mephistopheles would have said to Faust by way of opening conversation. And he was not sure, either, whether he ought not to have added, 'Sir.' ...|$|R
60|$|But she felt, at least, {{that she}} was quits {{with him in the}} matter of his {{repudiation}} of her own thanks, and the feeling bridged the unfriendly gap that she had felt was opening out between them; and for no reason in the world that she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> she <b>was</b> glad that this was so.|$|R
60|$|Anxious to {{pack the}} ship off as soon as possible, we answered, by all means. Some {{went so far as}} to laud the Julia to the skies as the best and fastest of ships. Jermin too, as a good fellow, and a sailor every inch, came in for his share of praise; and as for the captain--quiet man, he would never trouble anyone. In short, every {{inducement}} we <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> presented; and Plash Jack ended by assuring the beachcombers solemnly that, now we were all well and hearty, nothing but a regard to principle prevented us from returning on board ourselves.|$|E
60|$|But Wraxton did not appear. Suddenly {{the captain}} thought {{of one man}} who might be of service to him in this emergency. There {{was no time for}} delay. Some one must come, and come quickly, who could {{identify}} him, and the only man he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> Professor Barré, Ralph's tutor. He had met that gentleman the evening before. He could vouch for him, and he could certainly be trusted not to alarm Edna unnecessarily. He believed the professor could be found at the hotel, and he instantly sent a messenger to him with a note.|$|E
60|$|Once upon a time, {{before he}} had grown to think himself so very, very smart, Reddy Fox would never, never have thought of running without {{watching}} out in every direction. He would have seen that thing that looked like {{the barrel of a}} gun sticking out from behind the old tree toward which he was running, and he would have been very suspicious, very suspicious indeed. But now all Reddy <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> what a splendid chance he had to show all the little meadow and forest people what a bold, smart fellow he was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely it's selfish; but I don't in {{the least}} mind your saying so. I don't mind {{anything}} you can say now--I don't feel it. The cruellest things you <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> would <b>be</b> mere pin-pricks. After what you've done I shall never feel anything--I mean anything but that. That I shall feel all my life." ...|$|R
5000|$|At 17 he <b>was</b> part <b>of</b> Bologna's {{first team}} but only made {{the bench in}} Serie A and Coppa Italia. In 2002, he was {{transferred}} to Chievo Verona and after that to Florentia Viola. His stay in Florence was not what he had dreamed of and when rumours spread in late 2003 that Fiorentina wanted to trade him for the Swedish international Kim Källström of Djurgårdens IF (one of former club Hammarby's biggest rivals) he was outraged and declared {{that it was a}} transfer he would never accept. [...] "Me playing for Djurgården would be like Di Canio going back to Italy to play for A. S. Roma, it won't happen, if I go back to Sweden the only club that I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> my old club Hammarby".|$|R
5000|$|During the 1952 season, Ostendarp played halfback for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. In an {{interview}} with The Montreal Gazette, Ostendarp discussed the process of adjusting to Canadian rules: [...] "When I first came up here and learned that you only had three downs in which to make 10 yards. I wondered if a team ever moved the sticks. All I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> {{how difficult it is}} in American football where there are four downs. But I soon saw that it could be done. In fact, I think three downs makes it a better game for the crowd." [...] Ostendarp made the adjustment to Canadian rules, led the Big Four in rushing yards, and received the Lord Calvert Trophy as the Most Valuable Player on the 1952 Alouettes team.|$|R
