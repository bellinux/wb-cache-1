40|$|Abstract. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) {{is a key}} {{metabolite}} regulating growth, differentiation {{and death}} of hepatocytes. Experimentally, exogenous SAMe has been documented to attenuate hepatocar-cinogenesis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect <b>of</b> <b>SAMe</b> on proliferation <b>of</b> hepatocytes that are not cancerously transformed. Partial 2 / 3 hepatectomy (PH) was performed in rats, control animals underwent laparotomy. SAMe was injected immediately after the surgery and then at 24 h intervals for two days at 10 or 40 mg/kg. The animals were sacrificed 24, 48 and 72 h after operation {{and the intensity of}} liver regeneration was evaluated. SAMe treatment at 10 mg/kg was associated with decrease in the synthesis of liver DNA 48 h after PH, however, it was not reflected in DNA content. SAMe treatment at 40 mg/kg led to the reduction of DNA synthesis 72 h after PH followed by the diminution <b>of</b> DNA <b>content.</b> The results have documented the inhibition of the liver regeneration by SAMe that may be mediated by the suppression of liver fat accumulation. Cell GSH level correlating with the growth rate was not affected by SAMe. Prevention from the decrease in the intracellular <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>SAMe,</b> as a factor attenuating regeneration remains to be verified.

40|$|Heterotrophic {{bacteria}} transform {{organic matter}} by respiration {{and production of}} new biomass. Because {{there are only a}} limited number of studies on the respiration of bacteria attached to particulate organic matter, their role in the carbon cycle of aquatic systems is not well known. In this study, we combine radiotracer with microsensor techniques to measure bacterial production and respiration rates on the same aggregate and to directly determine the growth efficiency of the microbial community attached to aggregates. Aggregates of defined age were formed after incubation of water samples of the river Weser, Northern Germany, in roller tanks and their bacterial community was analyzed by in situ hybridization. The growth efficiency was 0. 45 6 0. 04 (SE) on 1 – 3 -d-old aggregates, and it was independent of the growth rate (m). There was no correlation between respiration and the particulate organic carbon (POC) or particulate organic nitrogen (PON) <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>same</b> aggregate. Bacterial growth efficiencies on aggregates decreased after 5 d of incubation, as bacterial production decreased and respiration increased. On 7 -and 14 -d-old aggregates, the growth efficiency was 0. 23 6 0. 06 and 0. 04 6 0. 01, respectively, and proportional to m. The bacterial production was thus apparently substrate limited.

30|$|The {{material}} data {{embodied in the}} GLIO are obtained by multiplying the trade volumes of each commodity by its percentage metal content as described in Nansai et al. (2014). Given the large number (231) of targeted countries, however, the metal <b>content</b> <b>of</b> some of the commodities exported from certain foreign countries was unavailable. In these cases, the relative metal <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>same</b> Japanese export commodity was used instead. As a result, the metal flows associated with export commodities from developing countries may have been overestimated in some cases. This is because Japanese exports of high-tech commodities might be of higher quality (e.g., low energy consumption, low noise, high durability, multi-functional) and might require more critical metals than the same commodities produced in developing countries. Since these data were then linked to the GLIO model, the material footprints via exports from developing countries {{are also likely to}} have been overestimated.|$|R
