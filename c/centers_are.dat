5|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that B center (sometimes called B1) consists of a carbon vacancy surrounded by four nitrogen atoms substituting for carbon atoms.

5|$|Due to {{its size}} and {{geologic}} features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions. Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts, less than 10% of Texas' land area is desert. Most of the population <b>centers</b> <b>are</b> located in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University {{has four}} campuses in Washington, D.C.: the {{undergraduate}} campus, the Medical Center, the School of Continuing Studies (in Chinatown) and the Law Center. The undergraduate campus and Medical Center are {{together in the}} Georgetown neighborhood in the Northwest Quadrant of Washington and form the main campus. Other <b>centers</b> <b>are</b> located around Washington, D.C., including the Center for Continuing and Professional Education at Clarendon in Arlington, Virginia. Transit between these locations and the Washington Metro is supplied by a system of shuttles, known as GUTS buses. Georgetown also operates a facility in Doha, Qatar, and villas in Alanya, Turkey and Fiesole, Italy. In their campus layout, Georgetown's administrators consistently used the traditional quadrangle design.|$|E

5|$|In many organisms {{the capture}} of solar energy is similar in {{principle}} to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction <b>centers</b> <b>are</b> classed into two types {{depending on the type}} of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.|$|E
5|$|Since {{receiving}} its startup funding, Florida Atlantic has secured {{additional funds}} from other sources, including federal and private research grants. As a result, both centers {{have engaged in}} academic and industry partnerships, combining expertise in ocean engineering, marine biotechnology, functional genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Researchers, scientists, and students at the <b>centers</b> <b>are</b> designing technologies to explore the sea, harvest renewable energy, discover new medicines, and develop new therapeutics to combat agents of bioterrorism. As {{a result of this}} research, in 2007 the university and Lockheed Martin announced an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and produce a rapidly deployable and autonomous mooring buoy system for military and scientific uses.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{a rhetorical}} {{question}} – Is NATO losing and the Taliban winning? – Amrullah Saleh discusses the uncertainty among the Afghans about 2014 – when NATO ends its combat mission in Afghanistan. He then mentions Afghans’ {{perception that the}} US is funding {{both sides of the}} conflict because Pakistan remains the key country supporting the insurgency. Amrullah Saleh also discusses why the NATO and the US remain unwilling to confront Pakistan because of their own security concerns. He advocates for a surge in the capacity of the Afghan National Security Forces. Amrullah Saleh highlights the importance of both training and equipment to ensure that cleared areas of Afghanistan are held, communication lines are kept open, and major population <b>centers</b> <b>are</b> defended.|$|E

5|$|The 1952 {{classification}} by French zoologist J. Alloiteau {{was built}} on these earlier systems but included more microstructural observations and did not involve the anatomical characters of the polyp. Alloiteau recognized eight suborders. In 1942, W.H. Bryan and D. Hill {{stressed the importance of}} microstructural observations by proposing that stony corals begin skeletal growth by configuring calcification centers, which are genetically derived. Therefore, diverse patterns of calcification <b>centers</b> <b>are</b> vital to classification. Alloiteau later showed that established morphological classifications were unbalanced and that there were many examples of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa.|$|E
5|$|The N3 center {{consists}} of three nitrogen atoms surrounding a vacancy. Its concentration is always {{just a fraction of}} the A and B centers. The N3 center is paramagnetic, so its structure is well justified from the analysis of the EPR spectrum P2. This defect produces a characteristic absorption and luminescence line at 415nm and thus does not induce color on its own. However, the N3 center is always accompanied by the N2 center, having an absorption line at 478nm (and no luminescence). As a result, diamonds rich in N3/N2 <b>centers</b> <b>are</b> yellow in color.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiation}} {{amplified by}} hydroxyl masers is the radio continuum of its host. This continuum is primarily composed of synchrotron radiation produced by Type II supernovae. Amplification of this background is low, with amplification factors, or gains, {{ranging from a}} few percent to a few hundred percent, and sources with larger hyperfine ratios typically exhibiting larger gains. Sources with higher gains typically have narrower emission lines. This is expected if the pre-gain linewidths are all roughly the same, as line <b>centers</b> <b>are</b> amplified more than the wings, leading to line narrowing.|$|E
