500|$|Reports of plague around Europe {{began to}} reach England in the 1660s, causing the Privy Council to [...] {{consider}} what steps {{might be taken}} to prevent it crossing to England. Quarantining of ships had been used during previous outbreaks and was again introduced for ships coming to London in November 1663, following outbreaks in Amsterdam and Hamburg. [...] Two naval ships were assigned to intercept any vessels entering the Thames estuary. Ships from infected ports were [...] required to moor at Hole Haven on Canvey Island {{for a period of}} 30 days before being allowed to travel upriver. Ships from ports free of plague or completing their quarantine were given a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> and allowed to travel on. [...] A second inspection line was established [...] between the forts on opposite banks of the Thames at Tilbury and Gravesend with instructions only to pass ships with a certificate.|$|E

60|$|This hurry of {{the people}} was such for some weeks {{that there was no}} getting at the Lord Mayor's door without {{exceeding}} difficulty; there were such pressing and crowding there to get passes and <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> for such as travelled abroad, for without these there was no being admitted to pass through the towns upon the road, or to lodge in any inn. Now, as there had none died in the city for all this time, my Lord Mayor gave <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> without any difficulty to all those who lived in the ninety-seven parishes, and to those within the liberties too for a while.|$|R
60|$|The good, {{charitable}} gentleman {{encouraged them}} to quit the Place for fear they should be cut off from any retreat at all by {{the violence of the}} distemper; but whither they should go, that he found very hard to direct them to. At last John asked of him whether he, being a justice of the peace, would give them <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> to other justices whom they might come before; that so whatever might be their lot, they might not be repulsed now they had been also so long from London. This his worship immediately granted, and gave them proper letters <b>of</b> <b>health,</b> and from thence they were at liberty to travel whither they pleased.|$|R

60|$|This {{certificate}} {{directed to}} the next constable that was at Homerton, one of the hamlets of the parish of Hackney, was so serviceable to them that it procured them, not a free passage there only, but a full <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> from a justice of the peace, who upon the constable's application granted it without much difficulty; and thus they passed through the long divided town of Hackney (for it lay then in several separated hamlets), and travelled on till they came into the great north road {{on the top of}} Stamford Hill.|$|E

Young solicitor Peter Corbett, wife Joan, and their three young children leave Southampton after their house and Corbett's offices are damaged, friends are killed, and a cholera epidemic begins. They move aboard their small yacht, kept on the river Hamble, but as disease spreads and supplies diminish, flee the area. They sail to the Isle of Wight, but because of the fear of disease, other ports require them to provide a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> or wait in quarantine; the Corbetts do not want to risk being bombed during the three weeks of quarantine.|$|E

50|$|Pinard was {{a founder}} {{member of the}} French Eugenics Society in 1913 and served as its president. Eugenic ideas were {{incorporated}} into his idea of 'puériculture'. He {{also served as a}} parliamentary deputy for the Radical party between 1919 and 1928. As a deputy he argued for pro-natalist policies, but he was also sympathetic to and an influence on French feminism. In 1926 he introduced a law requiring future spouses to provide a pre-nuptial <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> good <b>health</b> (attesting the absence of contagious diseases) before the marriage could be officially registered.|$|R
50|$|After {{re-election}} with {{an increased}} majority at the 1959 general election, Pannell became more involved {{on the issue of}} restricting immigration. In July 1960 he led a delegation to see Home Secretary R.A. Butler, calling for all immigrants to produce a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> good <b>health</b> and an assurance that they had a job to go to. In April 1961 he was a key mover in an amendment which unsuccessfully urged the reintroduction of corporal punishment for young offenders. His concern about the Commonwealth led him to oppose British entry to the Common Market when it was proposed in 1962.|$|R

40|$|For 13 {{years in}} the early 1900 s, Cora Anderson, a Potawatomie-Cherokee and African-American female from Kendallville, Indiana, intermittently, yet effectively, passed as Ralph Kerwinieo, a South American man ten years her junior. While {{residing}} in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Anderson obtained a male's <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>health,</b> as required by a 1913 Wisconsin law, in order to marry her second wife, Dorothy Kleinowski. The 1913 Marriage Law, ostensibly designed {{to prevent the spread}} of sexually transmitted diseases, was inspired by the eugenics movement and later became a model for similar laws throughout the U. S. Although Anderson's case has been examined in sexuality and gender studies, this aspect of her case [...] as well as her intermittent "passing" [...] has remained largely unexplored. This thesis fills in apparent gaps in literature on Anderson's complex case, exploring the timeline and the complex motivations for Anderson's intermittent passing as well as the intersections of Anderson's case with the 1913 Wisconsin "eugenic" marriage law...|$|E

5|$|The poorer {{people were}} also {{alarmed by the}} {{contagion}} and some left the city, {{but it was not}} easy for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required to possess a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> good <b>health</b> signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and thirst in the hot summer that was to follow.|$|R
40|$|During the {{compilation}} of a manual for {{the testing of}} water and wastewater treatment chemicals, {{it became apparent that}} the national standards for many of these chemicals are out-dated and describe analytical procedures which are in some cases obsolete and extremely time consuming. Further investigation revealed that since 1994, the Department <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> no longer produces <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> for these chemicals and that the most recent version of the Water Act does not impose any legislation at all on chemicals used for water treatment. In this paper a brief overview is given of the commonly used water and wastewater treatment chemicals as well as pipes and other materials that come into contact with water. The current status of standards and certification for these products is discussed. The history of certification, both locally and Internationally is described, explaining how the South African standards came to be in the present situation. It is important that chemicals and materials used in the water and wastewater industry are regulated {{in order to protect the}} <b>health</b> and welfare <b>of</b> communities and to protect the environment from chemical pollutants and from the possibility of toxic effects due to accumulation of these products in the environment. National standards for these chemicals should therefore be a priority. The South African water and wastewater industry generally follows international standards in terms of the treatment processes and chemicals used, but no regulation/certification system exists in this country for the control of these products. Funding was recently obtained from the Water Research Commission of South Africa to investigate the present South African standards for water and wastewater treatment chemicals and produce recommendations to serve as a basis for the up-dating and re-issuing of current standards and the creation of new standards, where these do not currently exist. This paper highlights the present crisis in this country in terms of water treatment chemical standards and provides suitable strategies for addressing this problem...|$|R

5000|$|Volunteers {{have to be}} well trained, {{brave and}} balanced. To become a City Angel a {{candidate}} has to undergo a training course lasting two months, {{for a total of}} 16 lessons, twice a week. After passing an aptitude test, the candidate has to compile the application for admission, pay an annual insurance fee and handle the following documents: <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> good <b>health,</b> passport photos, photocopy of identity card. Twelve classes are held in twelve lessons in gym (compulsory attendance). In class, concepts like first aid, alcohol and drug addiction are explained; also, rules of procedure and legal, psychology and communication concepts are taught. In the gym, lessons on teamwork and self-defense techniques are given. The self-defense used by City Angels is called Wilding, has been created by the founder Mario Furlan and is based on psychology and instinct.Those who finish the course may take the final exam: before passing the final exam a candidate is not yet a City Angel, but an [...] "auxiliary", and circulates with a bib instead of the red shirt. In an average of ten aspiring volunteers, six pass an aptitude test, three come to the final exam and two pass it.
