25|$|Characters were {{proportionally}} spaced, {{being from}} 3 to 9 units wide, {{with the size}} of a unit being selectable as either 1/72", 1/84", or 1/96", to allow for different sizes of type (10, 12, or 15 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> Tab stops could only be positioned at intervals of one-sixth of an inch, or one pica. To support backspacing over previously typed characters, the spacing code for the last 40 or so characters typed was mechanically stored by small sliding plates in a carrier wheel.|$|E
25|$|The Correcting Selectric II used a new ribbon {{cartridge}} mechanism. The cartridge contained both supply and take-up spools, permitting both easy ribbon {{changes and the}} use of several types of ribbon on one machine. The ribbons were wider than had been used previously, giving more typed <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> of ribbon. Successive characters were staggered vertically on the ribbon, which incremented less than a full character position each time. Different types of ribbons had different-depth holes {{in the bottom of the}} cartridge, which set the mechanism to advance the ribbon by the amount appropriate for the type of ribbon.|$|E
500|$|On {{a further}} {{visit to the}} set, Gerrold was called into Coon's office. He was {{informed}} {{that he needed to}} change the name of the fuzzies, as the legal department was concerned about similarities in the name with H. Beam Piper's 1962 novel Little Fuzzy. He subsequently came up with a variety of alternative names. Through a process of elimination, he ended up with the name [...] "tribble". He took the name to Coon, who hated it. But after seeing the alternatives, he agreed to it. Gerrold turned in the script on July 17, entitled [...] "You Think You've Got Tribbles...?". While Coon disliked the name of the small furry creatures, he bought the script. Gerrold's submitted script was within the standard page count for an episode, but, when it was retyped for distribution by the production's mimeo department, it ballooned from 60 to 80 pages due to Gerrold's not having used a typewriter with the 10 point pitch (10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> Pica standard of the TV and film industry. This meant that some twenty pages needed to be cut from the script.|$|E
2500|$|In English-speaking countries, {{the commonplace}} {{typewriters}} printing fixed-width characters were standardized to print six horizontal lines <b>per</b> vertical <b>inch,</b> and had either of two variants of character width, called [...] "pica" [...] for ten <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> horizontal <b>inch</b> and [...] "elite" [...] for twelve. This {{differed from the}} use of these terms in printing, where they refer to the height of the characters on the page ("pica" [...] designating ten horizontal lines <b>per</b> vertical <b>inch).</b>|$|R
50|$|HCCB uses a grid {{of colored}} triangles to encode data. Depending on the target use, the grid size (total number of symbols), symbol density (the printed size of the triangles), and symbol count (number of colors used) can be varied. HCCB can use an eight-, four-, or two-color (black-and-white) palette. Microsoft claims that {{laboratory}} tests using standard off-the-shelf printers and scanners have yielded readable eight-color HCCBs equivalent to approximately 3,500 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> square <b>inch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The IBM 3102 {{dot-matrix printer}} used thermal-paper print technology, {{and could be}} {{attached}} to the IBM 3101's auxiliary port. It supported 80 5x7 dot-matrix <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> line, 6 lines <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and output 40 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> second.|$|R
2500|$|The Selectric II was {{available}} with a Dual Pitch option {{to allow it}} to be switched (with a lever at the top left of the [...] "carriage") between 10 and 12 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> whereas the Selectric I was ordered with one [...] "pitch" [...] or the other. Separate typeballs were available for each pitch.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variation}} {{known as}} [...] "Correcting Selectrics" [...] introduced a correction feature, where a sticky tape {{in front of}} the carbon film ribbon could remove the black-powdered image of a typed character, eliminating the need for little bottles of white dab-on correction fluid and for hard erasers that could tear the paper. These machines also introduced selectable [...] "pitch" [...] so that the typewriter could be switched between pica type (10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> and elite type (12 per inch), even within one document. Even so, all Selectrics were monospaced—each character and letterspace was allotted the same width on the page, from a capital [...] "W" [...] to a period. Although IBM had produced a successful typebar-based machine with five levels of proportional spacing, called the IBM Executive, proportional spacing was not provided with the Selectric typewriter or its successors the Selectric II and Selectric III.|$|E
5000|$|Density : Initial {{recording}} density was 100 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> Later models supported 200, 556 and 800 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic {{tape was}} {{available}} {{in a variety of}} models, all using open-reel ½ inch magnetic tape. Various models could read and write seven-track or nine-track tape with densities from 200 bits <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (bpi) to 1600 bpi at rates of 37.5 <b>inches</b> <b>per</b> second (ips) to 150 ips. The maximum transfer rate was 266 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> second (cps). All models connected to the system through the IOM.|$|R
50|$|The UNISERVO used metal tape: a 1/2 in {{thin strip}} of {{nickel-plated}} phosphor bronze (called Vicalloy) 1200 feet long. These metal tape reels were very heavy. Data {{was recorded in}} eight channels on the tape (six for the data value, one parity channel for error checking, and one timing channel) at a density of 128 bits <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> The tape could be moved at 100 <b>inches</b> <b>per</b> second, giving a nominal transfer rate of 12,800 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> second. Data were recorded in fixed size blocks of 60 words of 12 characters each. Making allowance for the empty space between tape blocks, the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> second.|$|R
50|$|Ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is very {{commonly}} used by weavers who must use {{the number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> in order to pick the right reed to weave with. The number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> varies on the pattern to be woven and {{the thickness of the}} thread. Plain weaves generally use half the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> for the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> whereas denser weaves like a twill weave will use a higher ratio like two thirds of the number of warps <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> Finer threads require more threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than thick ones, and thus result in a higher number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R

50|$|Code 11 is a barcode {{symbology}} {{developed by}} Allais while at Intermec in 1977.In 1977 Intermec’s printing and reading technology limited {{the density of}} Code 39 to 9.4 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> For numeric applications, Codabar provided somewhat higher density (12 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> However, at the time, Intermec was contractually obligated to sell Codabar printers only to Monarch Marking Systems. Interleaved 2 of 5 was not a discrete symbology and thus could not be printed at a high enough density by our drum printers. It is used primarily in telecommunications. The symbol can encode any length string consisting of the digits 0-9 and the dash character (-).|$|E
50|$|Pitch is {{the number}} of {{characters}} and spaces in one inch of running text, that is <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (abbreviated cpi). The pitch is most often used as a measurement of font size of typewriters as well as printers.|$|E
5000|$|A Western {{red cedar}} log has an R value of 1.25 <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> In comparison, {{concrete}} is [...]13 <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> stone masonry [...]08 <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> common brick [...]20 <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and fiberglass insulation 3.16 <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> The longer the logs (and thicker the wall), {{the better the}} insulation qualities. A common 16” cordwood wall for moderate climates comprises 6 in of perlite or vermiculite insulation between mortar joints.|$|R
5000|$|Points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (25 mm): The {{most common}} {{measurement}} of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade. It is taken by setting the tip (or point) of one tooth at the zero point on a ruler, and then {{counting the number of}} points between the zero mark and the one-inch mark, inclusive (that is, including both the point at the zero mark and any point that lines up precisely with the one-inch mark). There is always one more point <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> than there are teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (e.g., a saw with 14 points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will have 13 teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and a saw with 10 points <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will have 9 teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> Some saws {{do not have the same}} number of teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> throughout their entire length, but the vast majority do. Those with more teeth <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> at the toe are described as having incremental teeth, in order to make starting the saw cut easier.|$|R
5000|$|Ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (EPI or e.p.i.) is {{the number}} of warp threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> of woven fabric. In general, the higher the ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> the finer the fabric is. The current fashion is to wear T-shirts with a higher thread count, such as soft and {{comfortable}} [...] "30 single" [...] tee shirt that has 30 threads <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> as contrasted to the standard T-shirt with an 18 thread count <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{tape was}} first used to record {{computer}} data in 1951 on the Eckert-Mauchly UNIVAC I. The recording medium was a thin strip of one half inch (12.65 mm) wide metal, consisting of nickel-plated bronze (called Vicalloy). Recording density was 128 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (198 micrometre/character) on eight tracks.|$|E
50|$|Around late 1969, IBM at Research Triangle Park (RTP) in North Carolina {{assigned}} George Laurer {{to determine}} how to make a supermarket scanner and label.

50|$|Suppose a {{magnetic}} tape can contain up to 3,200 flux reversals <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> A Modified Frequency Modulation or (1,3) RLL encoding stores each data bit as two bits on tape, but {{since there is}} guaranteed to be one 0 (non flux reversal) bit between any 1 (flux reversal) bits then {{it is possible to}} store 6,400 encoded bits <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the tape, or 3,200 data bits <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> A (1,7) RLL encoding can also store 6,400 encoded bits <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the tape, but since it only takes 3 encoded bits to store 2 data bits this is 4,267 data bits <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> A (2,7) RLL encoding takes 2 encoded bits to store each data bit, but since there is guaranteed to be two 0 bits between any 1 bits then it is possible to store 9,600 encoded bits <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the tape, or 4,800 data bits <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> often. Because the amount of twist defines {{a lot about a}} yarn, {{the number of}} twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> such as medium twist or hard twist yarns. Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.|$|R
50|$|The tape {{had seven}} {{parallel}} tracks, six for data {{and one to}} maintain parity. Tapes with character data (BCD) were recorded in even parity. Binary tapes used odd parity. (709 manual p. 20) Aluminum strips were glued several feet from {{the ends of the}} tape to serve as physical beginning and end of tape markers. Write protection was provided by a removable plastic ring {{in the back of the}} tape reel. A 3/4 inch gap between records allowed the mechanism enough time to stop the tape. Initial tape speed was 75 inches per second (2.95 m/s) and recording density was 200 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> giving a transfer speed of 120 kbit/s. Later 729 models supported 556 and 800 characters/inch (transfer speed 480 kbit/s). At 200 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> a single 2400 foot tape could store the equivalent of some 50,000 punched cards (about 4,000,000 six-bit bytes, or 3 MByte).|$|E
50|$|The columns on {{the paper}} were spaced at the {{standard}} typewriter pitch of 10 <b>characters</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> 0.1″ per column. The characters on the chain were spaced 0.1505″ apart, so that for each 0.001″ movement of the chain, a new character aligned with a print column. Moving at 7.5 feet per second, one hammer might fire each , but they were never exactly simultaneous.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> {{in a piece}} of woven cloth varies {{depending}} on the stage of manufacture. Before the cloth is woven, the warp has a certain number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> which {{is directly related to the}} size reed being used. After weaving the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will increase, and it will increase again after being washed. This increase in the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (and picks <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up. The take-up is dependent on many factors, including the material and how tightly the cloth is woven. Tightly woven fabric shrinks more (and thus the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> increases more) than loosely woven fabric, as do more elastic yarns and fibers.|$|R
5000|$|Closed-cell foams are {{superior}} insulators. While open-cell foams typically have R-values of 3 to 4 <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (RSI-0.53 to RSI-0.70 <b>per</b> <b>inch),</b> closed-cell foams can attain R-values of 5 to 8 <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (RSI-0.88 to RSI-1.41 <b>per</b> <b>inch).</b> This is important if space is limited, {{because it allows}} a thinner layer of insulation to be used.
