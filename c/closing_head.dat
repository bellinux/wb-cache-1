The question as to the best edge distance, i. e. that distance from the rivet center to the plate edge below which it is unadvisable to go and, at the same time useless to go beyond, was examined. The slippage of plates which occurs under the effect of a certain stress, does not completely disappear on unloading. The elastic form change is essentially a function of the elasticity modulus, the slip modulus, the supporting moment, the rivet spacing, etc...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To examine {{self-perceived health}} status {{during the first}} year {{following}} mild <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury. Methods: At 1 week, and at 3, 6 and 12 months post-injury, 37 patients with mild <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury completed written versions of the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPSQ), the Rivermead Head-Injury Follow-up Questionnaire (RHIFQ) and the SF- 36 Health Survey. Thirty-seven controls provided baselines for the SF- 36 and the RPSQ. Results: The 3 questionnaires conveyed differing impressions of recovery. On the RPSQ, the patients exhibited ongoing symptomatic complaints and higher scores compared with controls. The RHIFQ conveyed a better recovery in terms of everyday function. The SF- 36 showed the best recovery, with the mild <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury group achieving normal scores at 3, 6 and 12 months. Regression analyses indicated an influence of IQ, but not of age, education, or clinical measures of injury severity, on long-term health status. Conclusion: Recovery after mild <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury can involve a dichotomy of persistent post-concussional symptoms but relatively normal functionality and quality of life. In addition to indicating an influence of IQ on perception of recovery in mild <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury, our findings demonstrate that the nature of self-report questionnaires considerably influences the picture of recovery. This emphasizes the importance of methods unaffected by IQ and self-evaluative accuracy in the assessment of mild <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{lightweight}} materials, such as {{high strength}} aluminium and magnesium alloys, are used in an expanding range of engineering applications, {{such as in the}} transport sector, machine and equipment construction or the general construction industry. Thermal welding of these materials is, in contrast to steel, problematic since it severely affects both the static and fatigue resistance of the joint and the base material. This has strengthened the demand for more suitable joining techniques without heat input. The focus of the present research is on the application of two of the most important conventional cold joining techniques (clinching and self-pierce riveting) for these new emerging lightweight materials. The challenge in this regard is that these materials have a limited ductility, while the joining processes locally induce large plastic deformations. Consequently, joining these materials can be accompanied by cracks which develop during the forming operation. This situation has limited the use of these materials and of the joining processes in the past. The aim of the project was to develop rules and guidelines based on scientific results determining either how cracks induced by clinching or self-pierce riveting can be avoided or which cracks are acceptable. Therefore, the damage behaviour of lightweight materials, such as aluminium and magnesium, during the clinching and self-pierce riveting process was investigated both experimentally and numerically. The results from the project can be summarized as follows:Depending on the joining parameters and location in the component, different damages can occur during clinching or self-pierce riveting of materials with limited ductility. The relationships between joining parameters and the risk for damages in the <b>closing</b> <b>head</b> or part edge are demonstrated in this report and the risk for joining process-induced damages can be minimized by choosing the suitable joining tools. For all material combinations considered within this project it could not be observed that the joining process-induced damages {{have a negative effect on}} the resulting joint strength. This was determined for quasi-static and cyclic loads for both clinching as well as self-pierce riveting. In the numerical investigations regarding the damage modelling it was determined that the damage location as well as the level can be calculated by simple as well as complex fracture models. However, calculation of crack propagation in the die-sided part for clinching or self-pierce riveting using FEM is only possible to a limited extent...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the inter-rater {{reliability and validity}} of the Neurobehavioural Rating Scale at various stages of recovery after hospitalisation for <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury, we studied 101 head trauma patients who had no antecedent neuropsychiatric disorder.

A principal components analysis revealed four factors which were differentially related to severity of head injury and the presence of a frontal lobe mass lesion.

In this study, we investigated the effect of Pycnogenol® on spatial learning and memory (SLM) function in rats subjected to <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury. Methods: The study was a randomized, experimental study of four groups, each containing six rats. Pycnogenol® was administered to rats in two groups (group three and four) daily for five days starting on day one. A Barnes maze was used to test SLM in the rats in all four groups. Group 1 : These rats did not have a <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury and were not administered Pycnogenol®. Group 2 : On the day three, <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> trauma was inflicted.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Neurological speech {{disorders}} (dysarthria and dysprosody) {{are known}} to be frequent sequelae after severe <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury. These disorders may dramatically alter communicative intent and accentuate social isolation. The aim was to provide an instrumental evaluation for prosodic production in a group of patients with severe <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury and to determine the correlations between prosodic production and neurobehavioural status.  METHODS—Fifteen patients, at the subacute stage after severe <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury, were studied and compared with 11 controls, matched for age, sex, and duration of education. Each subject was required to read aloud a French sentence "Je m'en vais samedi matin" (I am leaving saturday morning) under six different prosodic intonations (neutral, affirmation, interrogation, happiness, sadness, anger). The recorded sentences were analysed using a sound signal analysis software (Signalyse) allowing the measurement of signal intensity and fundamental frequency. Statistical analyses were carried out using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).  RESULTS—Patients with <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury were significantly less able than controls to modulate speech output (pitch and intensity) according to prosodic context. This deficit was particularly pronounced for the intonation feature of anger, question, and statement. No consistent correlations could be found between prosodic production and cognitive or behavioural data.  CONCLUSIONS—Acoustic analysis of pitch and intensity may show impairments of prosodic production after severe <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury, which may be useful in rehabilitation planning. This impairment does not seem to reflect the eventual cognitive and behavioural deficits of the patients, but rather a specific disorder of modulation of speech output. ...|$|R
2500|$|Head {{trauma is}} {{classified}} as either open or <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury. In open head injury [...] the skull is penetrated and brain tissue is destroy in a localized area. <b>Closed</b> <b>head</b> injury is more common, the skull is not penetrated {{but there is an}} impact of the brain against the skull which can create permanent structural damage (e.g. subdural hematoma).

[...] It has been found that typically the longer the length of time spent unconscious and the length of post-traumatic amnesia the worse the prognosis for the individual. [...] The cognitive residual symptoms of head trauma are associated with the type of injury (either open <b>head</b> injury or <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury)and the amount of tissue destroyed. Symptoms of <b>closed</b> injury <b>head</b> trauma tend to be the experience of intellectual deficits in abstract reasoning ability, judgement, and memory, and also marked personality changes.

50|$|Though it is {{more likely}} to cause infection, {{penetrating}} trauma is similar to <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury such as cerebral contusion or intracranial hemorrhage. As in <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury, intracranial pressure is likely to increase due to swelling or bleeding, potentially crushing delicate brain tissue. Most deaths from penetrating trauma are caused by damage to blood vessels, which can lead to intracranial hematomas and ischemia, which can in turn lead to a biochemical cascade called the ischemic cascade. The injury in penetrating brain trauma is mostly focal (that is, it affects a specific area of tissue).|$|R

Both the headinjured subjects and their matched controls demonstrated an additional impairment in immediate free recall, which was attributed to a reduced working-memory capacity. Any serious accident appears to impair human cognitive function in a generalised manner by acting as a source of situational stress. This has important implications for the choice of an appropriate control group in research into <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> injury.

We enrolled 3, 806 children under 16 years consecutively referred for acute <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> trauma to the paediatric emergency room of five Italian children's hospitals. Relevant outcomes were death and diagnosis of ICI. Clinical symptoms and signs were evaluated as possible outcome predictors. Children were also classified into five groups according to their clinical presentation. The association of ICI with signs and symptoms and the appropriateness of the five-group classification in predicting the likelihood of ICI were evaluated by logistic regression analyses. ICI was diagnosed in 22 children; 2 of them died. The risk of fatal and nonfatal ICI was 0. 5 and 5. 2 per 1, 000 children with <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> trauma respectively. Significant associations were found between ICI and loss of consciousness, prolonged headache, persistent drowsiness, abnormal mental status, focal neurological signs, signs of skull fracture in non-frontal areas and signs of basal skull fracture. The five-group classification of children allowed an excellent prediction in terms of likelihood of ICI (ROC area 0. 972). Conclusions: Selection of children with <b>closed</b> <b>head</b> trauma based on different combinations of signs and symptoms allows for early identification of subjects at different risk for ICI.
