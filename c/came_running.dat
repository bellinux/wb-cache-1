5|$|In the Gotham Stakes on April 7, Laurin {{decided to}} {{experiment}} with Secretariat's running style. With no speed horses entered in the race, Secretariat {{would be allowed to}} set his own pace. Accordingly, Turcotte hustled Secretariat from the starting gate and they led easily. Down the stretch though, Champagne Charlie <b>came</b> <b>running</b> and at the eighth pole was almost even. Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each side with the whip and Secretariat drew away to win by three lengths. He ran the first 3/4 mile in 1:08 and finished the one-mile race in 1:33, matching the track record.|$|E
5|$|The {{house of}} one of the farmworkers was at the crash site. He first ran to his house, where he found that his wife had survived and was safe. Richards rescued one man from the {{wreckage}} and put him by an apple tree. Another survivor was on fire. In a contemporary inverview one of the rescuers says the survivor <b>came</b> <b>running</b> across the farmyard. 60 years later Richards said he rescued the survivor from the aircraft. Accounts agree that rescuers put the survivor in a horse trough to extinguish the flames and cool his burns.|$|E

25|$|Walker {{went south}} across Church Street toward the {{adjacent}} Roman Catholic church in Sydney Road. Prison officer Bennett had his rifle aimed at Walker and ordered Walker to halt {{or he would}} shoot. Walker took cover behind a small wall that bordered the church. The prison alarm was raised by Warder Lange, and it began to blow loudly, indicating a prison escape. Unarmed warders, Wallis, Mitchinson and Paterson, <b>came</b> <b>running</b> out of the prison's main gate and onto the street.|$|E
25|$|Two {{shopping}} centres {{adjacent to}} Dawson, Place Alexis Nihon and Westmount Square, {{directly linked to}} the Atwater metro station, were evacuated and the green line of the Montreal Metro was shut down for several hours between Lionel-Groulx and McGill. The Pepsi Forum entertainment centre, opposite the eastern corner of Dawson, was open when {{many of the students}} <b>came</b> <b>running</b> into the premises to seek refuge moments after the shooting began. Shortly afterward, the Pepsi Forum went into lockdown under the directives of the Montreal Police. Eventually, one of the Forum's entrances onto St. Catherine Street re-opened under police/security guard to allow monitored access and egress.|$|E
25|$|The ball {{came very}} close to hitting the ground before Harris scooped it up. In the {{sideline}} views of both film and video, Harris had caught the ball out of frame, and <b>came</b> <b>running</b> into frame from the right side on his path to the end zone. The only other known NBC video was an end zone shot from above and behind the goalposts depicting Harris scooping the ball before it touched the ground. The best NFL Films shot of the play, from ground level, is a tight shot from the end zone of Harris snaring the ball, with his feet and the ground just out of frame below.|$|E

25|$|At 7:30 pm on Monday evening, October 28, 1907, {{a band of}} Seattle Socialists braved the {{pouring rain}} {{and headed for the}} city's new Pike Street Market, bustling with 1500 shoppers. SPW State Chairman John Downie went first, {{ascending}} a wooden box in an unused part of the marketplace. A cheer erupted from the crowd which encircled the speaker, and more <b>came</b> <b>running,</b> expecting fireworks. Downie told the crowd of a planned march to the City Council Chamber later that evening — and was promptly arrested. Next came James Lund of Redondo, Washington, who got no further before he, too, was arrested and taken away. Elmer Allison of Local Bangor, A.G. Ball of Portland, Oregon, and Harry Ault and Hulet Wells of Seattle each ascended the box in turn, said a few choice words, and were escorted away by police.|$|E
25|$|Shirley MacLaine {{appeared}} in the 1958 film Some <b>Came</b> <b>Running</b> along with Sinatra and Martin. She had a major role (and Sinatra a cameo) in the 1956 Oscar-winning film Around the World in 80 Days. MacLaine played a Hindu princess who is rescued by, and falls in love with, original Rat Pack associate David Niven, and Sinatra had a non-speaking, non-singing role as a piano player in a saloon, whose identity is concealed from the viewer until he turns his face toward the camera during a scene featuring Marlene Dietrich and George Raft. MacLaine appeared alongside Sinatra in the 1960 film Can-Can. She also had an appearance in the 1960 film Ocean's 11 as a drunken woman. The 1984 film Cannonball Run II, with MacLaine, marked the final time members of the Rat Pack shared theatrical screen-time together.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{developed}} {{hand signals}} to communicate {{things they did}} not want the guards or other prisoners to hear. When a prisoner wanted to pass a note down to a girlfriend, he would attach a little bundle {{to the end of a}} long rope woven from mattress fibers and throw the bundle down into the street. The girlfriend down below would run to catch the bundle and take out the note. This would also give her an opportunity to stuff a note, cigarettes, drugs, a photograph of their child, a weapon, into the bundle, which the inmate could then hoist back up through the hole in the wall, before the guards <b>came</b> <b>running</b> to intercept the line. They called these rope and bundle setups palomas ("pigeons") and apparently, at any given time, seven or eight palomas could be flying down into the street, or back up to the prison, attached to their makeshift ropes.|$|E

25|$|Some of the Frenchmen {{living in}} the {{outbuildings}} set up a shout on seeing two of their number killed, at which a man within the fort opened the wicket of the main entrance to admit the fugitives. The camp master closed with him and killed him, and the Spaniards poured into the enclosure. Laudonnière's trumpeter had just mounted the rampart, and seeing the Spaniards coming towards him sounded the alarm. The French—most of whom were still asleep in their beds—taken entirely by surprise, <b>came</b> <b>running</b> out of their quarters into the driving rain, some half-dressed, and others quite naked. Among the first was Laudonnière, who rushed out of his quarters in his shirt, his sword and shield in his hands, and began to call his soldiers together. But the enemy had been too quick for them, and the wet and muddy courtyard was soon covered {{with the blood of}} the French cut down by the Spanish soldiers, who now filled it. At Laudonnière's call, some of his men had hastened to the breach on the south side, where lay the ammunition and the artillery. But they were met by a party of Spaniards who repulsed and killed them, and who finally raised their standards in triumph upon the walls. Another party of Spaniards entered by a similar breach on the west, overwhelming the soldiers who attempted to resist them there, and also planted their ensigns on the rampart.|$|E
25|$|The wind shifted, and Ranger recrossed the Irish Sea to {{make another}} attempt at raiding Whitehaven. Jones led the assault with two boats of fifteen men just after midnight on April 23, 1778, hoping to set fire to and sink all Whitehaven's ships {{anchored}} in harbor, which numbered between 200 and 400 wooden vessels and consisted of a full merchant fleet and many coal transporters. They also hoped to terrorize the townspeople by lighting further fires. As it happened, the journey to shore was slowed by the still-shifting wind, {{as well as a}} strong ebb tide. They successfully spiked the town's big defensive guns to prevent them being fired, but lighting fires proved difficult, as the lanterns in both boats had run out of fuel. To remedy this, some of the party were sent to raid a public house on the quayside, but the temptation to stop for a quick drink led to a further delay. Dawn was breaking by the time they returned and began the arson attacks, so efforts were concentrated on the coal ship Thompson {{in the hope that the}} flames would spread to adjacent vessels, all grounded by the low tide. However, in the twilight, one of the crew slipped away and alerted residents on a harbourside street. A fire alert was sounded, and large numbers of people <b>came</b> <b>running</b> to the quay, forcing the Americans to retreat, and extinguishing the flames with the town's two fire-engines. However, their hopes of sinking Jones's boats with cannon fire were dashed because of the prudent spiking.|$|E
25|$|Martin's {{first solo}} film, Ten Thousand Bedrooms (1957), was a box-office failure. He was still popular as a singer, but with {{rock and roll}} to the fore, {{the era of the}} pop crooner was waning. Martin wanted to become a {{dramatic}} actor, known for more than slapstick comedy films. Though offered a fraction of his former salary to co-star in a war drama, The Young Lions (1958), his part would be with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift. Tony Randall already had the part, but talent agency MCA realized that with this film, Martin would become a triple threat: they could make money from his work in night clubs, films, and records. Martin replaced Randall and the film {{turned out to be the}} beginning of Martin's comeback. Martin starred alongside Frank Sinatra for the first time in the Vincente Minnelli drama, Some <b>Came</b> <b>Running</b> (1958). By the mid-1960s, Martin was a movie, recording, television, and nightclub star. Martin was acclaimed as Dude in Rio Bravo (1959), directed by Howard Hawks and also starring John Wayne and singer Ricky Nelson. He teamed again with Wayne in The Sons of Katie Elder (1965), cast as brothers. In 1960, Martin was cast in the film version of the Judy Holliday stage musical comedy Bells Are Ringing. He won a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the 1960 film comedy Who Was That Lady? but continued to seek dramatic roles, portraying a Southern politician in 1961's Ada, and starring in 1963's screen adaptation of an intense stage drama, Toys in the Attic, opposite Geraldine Page, as well as in 1970's drama Airport, a huge box-office success.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} war, the {{popularity}} of Randall knives increased among non-military users, and Randall developed additional models specifically for expanding markets.
