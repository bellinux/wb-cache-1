A <b>chest</b> <b>X-ray,</b> computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence.

40|$|Background: The {{effects of}} low-dose medical {{radiation}} on {{breast cancer risk}} are uncertain, and few studies have includedgenetically susceptiblewomen, such as thosewho carry germlineBRCA 1 andBRCA 2 mutations. Methods:We studied 454 BRCA 1 and 273 BRCA 2 mutation carriers ages younger than 50 years from three breast cancer family registries in the United States, Canada, andAustralia/NewZealand. We estimated breast cancer risk associated with diagnostic <b>chest</b> <b>X-rays</b> by comparing mutation carriers with breast cancer (cases) with those without breast cancer (controls). Exposure to <b>chest</b> <b>X-rays</b> was self-reported. Mammograms were not considered in the analysis. Results:After adjusting for known risk factors for breast cancer, the ORs for a history of diagnostic <b>chest</b> <b>X-rays,</b> excluding those for tuberculosis or pneumonia, were 1. 16 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 64 – 2. 11] for BRCA 1 mutations carriers and 1. 22 (95 % CI, 0. 62 – 2. 42) for BRCA 2 mutations carriers. The ORwas statistically elevated forBRCA 2 mutation carrierswith three to five diagnostic <b>chest</b> <b>X-rays</b> (P 0. 01) but not for thosewith six or more <b>chest</b> <b>X-rays.</b> Few women reported chest fluoroscopy for tuberculosis or <b>chest</b> <b>X-rays</b> for pneumonia; the OR estimates were elevated, but not statistically significant, for BRCA 1 mutation carriers.

5|$|To {{distinguish}} between OHS {{and various other}} lung diseases that can cause similar symptoms, medical imaging of the lungs (such as a <b>chest</b> <b>X-ray</b> or CT/CAT scan), spirometry, electrocardiography and echocardiography may be performed.

5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed.

5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a <b>chest</b> <b>X-ray,</b> and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chest</b> <b>x-ray</b> is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on <b>chest</b> <b>X-ray.</b> CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia {{is usually}} caused by {{infection}} with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and {{conditions such as}} autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. <b>Chest</b> <b>X-ray,</b> blood tests, {{and culture of the}} sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{strains of}} influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60years; {{this was an}} unusual and {{characteristic}} feature of the H1N1 pandemic. Even {{in the case of}} previously very healthy people, a small percentage will develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms. The pneumonia caused by flu can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia. In fact, a November 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article recommends that flu patients whose <b>chest</b> <b>X-ray</b> indicates pneumonia receive both antivirals and antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on <b>chest</b> <b>X-ray.</b>|$|E
