Its size limited the possible crew to three, a {{driver in the}} hull and a gunner and <b>commander</b> <b>in</b> the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or <b>commander,</b> <b>in</b> addition to his own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.|$|E
