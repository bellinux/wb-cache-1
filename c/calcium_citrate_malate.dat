5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate,</b> <b>malate,</b> and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E

40|$|Background: When usual calcium {{consumption}} patterns were analysed {{most people in}} the U. S. and Europe consume less than the recommended daily allowance. Supplements and fortified foods offer alternative and additional sources of calcium to traditional food. Calcium carbonate is the most common supplement but it is less soluble in water and, therefore, not suitable for enrichment of beverages. New organic calcium salts have a better solubility but less is known about their bioavailability. In the present study, we assessed the solubility and bioavailability of the new organic calcium salts, <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>citrate</b> and <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>malate,</b> in comparison to the traditional supplements, calcium carbonate and calcium gluconate. Design: Randomized, single-blind, four way cross-over study comparing single doses of 500 mg calcium in the form of four different calcium-salts. Subjects were advised to consume 25 Âµg vitamin D 3 daily two weeks {{prior to the start of}} the study and during the whole study period. Subjects: 20 healthy young men, Methods: Blood samples were drawn immediately before and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after ingestion of the calcium preparation. Concentration of total calcium and intact parathyroid hormone were measured in the serum. Urine was collected at baseline and during the intervals 0 - 3, 3 - 6, 9 - 15 and 15 - 24 h and excretion of calcium, sodium and creatinine was examined. Results: The tested new salts were easily water soluble, significantly better than calcium gluconate. Calcium carbonate is almost insoluble. The bioavailability of the four different calcium salts was found to be almost identical. The maximum total serum calcium increased by 7. 6 % two hours after ingestion <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>citrate,</b> by 7. 4 % after calcium lactate malate, by 5. 5 % after calcium carbonate, and by 5. 8 % after calcium gluconate. Intact parathyroid hormone concentration showed the expected depression for <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>citrate,</b> <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>malate</b> and calcium carbonate, whereas the serum level was significantly higher after ingestion of calcium gluconate. Conclusion: Given an almost equivalent bioavailability of the four tested calcium salts, we conclude that the new salts <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>citrate</b> and <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>malate</b> are well suited for fortification of beverages and thus to increase the average daily calcium intake...|$|R

Seven patients with moderate renal failure (endogenous creatinine clearance of 43 ml/min) took 50 mmol (2 g) calcium/day as effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> with meals for 17 days.

40|$|Background Lactose {{intolerance}} is {{a common}} condition which individuals {{are not able to}} completely digest lactose. Each individual has varying degree of lactose intolerance varying level of symptoms experienced. Due to the symptoms of lactose intolerance, lactose intolerant individuals are likely to eliminate milk and dairy products from their diet. Actually, milk and other dairy products are the preferred food sources of calcium for most people. It is essential to maintain adequate calcium intake everyday for the proper growth and development of bones. Individuals who avoid milk and dairy products from diet may not meet the daily requirements for calcium. Therefore, the lactose intolerant individuals are at a higher risk of osteoporosis. Calcium supplementations are an alternative source of calcium for lactose intolerant individuals who have low calcium intake to meet their daily needs. Objectives This review is to assess the impacts and effect of calcium supplements on bone density and bone fracture risk in lactose intolerant individuals. Methodology HKU library database, PubMed, and reference screening for trials published in English from 1990 to May 2014. Randomized, controlled trials of individuals using calcium supplements (calcium carbonate and <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> <b>malate)</b> and placebo group with bone fractures and bone mass density as outcome measure. Finding Adding calcium supplements into a low calcium diet reduces the rate of bone loss and prevents bone fractures. Evidence for calcium supplements in significant reduction of bone mass density; however, the impact of calcium supplements on bone fracture risk remains unclear. Conclusion Based on my review, it shows that there is an association between the use of calcium supplementations and retardation of the rate of bone loss as well as reduction in bone fracture risk in individuals with low dietary calcium and are generally compliance with the treatment. To get enough calcium through diet is encouraged over calcium supplements. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E

Girls {{were randomly assigned}} to placebo or treatment with 1000 mg Ca/d as <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> <b>malate.</b> Anthropometric characteristics, bone mass, and nutritional status were measured biannually; ferritin was measured annually; and red blood cell indexes were determined at 4 y. The simultaneous effects of iron intake and menstrual status on serum ferritin, after change in lean body mass (LBM) was controlled for, were evaluated in subjects in the upper and lower quartiles of cumulative iron intake. The average maximal accumulation of LBM (386 g/mo; 95 % CI: 372, 399) occurred 0. 5 y before the onset of menarche. Change in LBM {{was a significant predictor of}} serum ferritin (P < 0. 0001), with a negative influence on iron status (t ratio = 24. 12). The 2 fitted mathematical models representing ferritin concentrations of subjects in the upper and lower quartiles of cumulative iron intake were significantly different (P < 0. 018). The regression line of the ferritin concentration in menstruating girls with high iron intakes had a less negative slope than the line fit to serum ferritin concentrations in girls with low iron intakes (NS). Serum ferritin concentrations at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 y were not significantly different between groups. In addition, there was no significant difference between groups in any of the red blood cell indexes. In summary, growth spurt and menstrual status had adverse effects on iron stores in adolescent girls with low iron intakes (< 9 mg/d), whereas long-term supplementation with calcium (total intake: < 1500 mg/d) did not affect iron status.

40|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} mineral for the organism. Numerous calcium sources are available to enrich food products, but only calcium carbonate has been well studied. Calcium bioaccessibility depends mainly on solubility. Furthermore in vitro digestion allows to determine bioaccessibility and to identify the key parameters affecting it. The {{purpose of this study}} was to focus on the influence of gastro-intestinal pH variation, the effect of the food matrix structure and the calcium sources on calcium bioaccessibility. Four calcium sources (calcium carbonate, <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> <b>malate,</b> dairy calcium phosphate and calcium bisglycinate) were added at 0. 5 % (w/w) in water (control), and in whey protein matrices liquid or heat-induced gel. These matrices were digested under static conditions in duplicate, with the harmonized INFOGEST protocol (Minekus et al. 2014). Soluble and ionic calcium, and pH kinetics were followed during in vitro digestion. The kinetics were analyzed by nonparametric tests with repeated measurements. Results showed that all calcium sources were soluble in the matrices, mainly as ionic form (Ca 2 +), during the gastric phase at pH 3, but that calcium insolubilisation occurred in the intestinal compartment at pH 7. Dairy calcium phosphate insolubilisation was quicker and more intense than for other calcium sources; its concentration of soluble calcium is 17 +/- 3 %, instead of more than 60 % for the three other calcium sources (p 0. 1). These results provide new insights to better understand bioavailability differences between calcium sources and matrices. Further in vivo digestion experiments on a pig model will be achieved in order to confirm bioaccessibility and to measure the bioavailability of those different sources of calcium.

The Mixolab device was used to analyse the behaviour of gluten-free dough subjected to a dual mechanical shear stress and temperature constraint. Calcium salts significantly modified the dough behaviour during heating and cooling. The addition of calcium car-bonate and <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> provoked an increase in dough consistency during heating and cooling compared with the other salt-enriched samples. The specific volume and tex-ture parameters of gluten-free breads varied with the cal-cium salt used, but calcium carbonate and <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> showed improved values. The higher calcium content of the enriched breads, compared with the control, confirmed the fortification. Sensory evaluation of the calcium-fortified breads confirmed that calcium carbonate followed by cal-cium citrate was the most recommended salt for obtaining calcium fortification of gluten-free breads...|$|R
40|$|Abstractã Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a new biomaterial combining <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) on bone regeneration in a bone defect rabbit model. Methods: Totally 30 male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly and equally divided into calcium citrate-rhBMP- 2 (CC-rhBMP- 2) group and rhBMP- 2 only group. Two 10 mm-long and 5 mm-deep bone defects were respec-tively created in the left and right femoral condyles of the rabbits. Subsequently 5 pellets of <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> (10 mg) combined with rhBMP- 2 (2 mg) or rhBMP- 2 alone were im-planted into the bone defects and compressed with cotton swab. Bone granules were obtained at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after procedure and received histological analysis. LSD t-test and a subsequent t-test were adopted for statistical analysis. Results: Histomorphometric analysis revealed newly formed bones, and <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> has been absorbed in the treatment group. The percent of newly formed bone area in femoral condyle in control group and CC-rhBMP- 2 group was respectively 31. 73...|$|R
40|$|Various calcium {{supplements}} {{are available}} for patients who have an indication for calcium suppletion. American guidelines and UpToDate recommend prescribing <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> to patients who use antacids The rationale for this advice is that water-insoluble calcium carbonate needs acid for adequate absorption. No convincing scientific evidence supporting the advice to prescribe <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> instead of <b>calcium</b> carbonate to patients who also take antacids is available, and therefore deserves further investigation. On the contrary, the fact that calcium carbonate does not need acid {{in order to be}} absorbed, has also not been proven. In clinical practise, it appears important that calcium is taken with meals in order to improve its absorption...|$|R
40|$|Background:Bariatric surgery, {{especially}} Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, {{can cause}} serious nutritional complications arising from poor absorption of essential nutrients. Secondary hyperparathyroidism {{is one such}} complications that leads to increased parathyroid hormone levels due to a decrease in calcium and vitamin D, which may compromise bone health. Aim: To compare calcium carbonate and <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> {{in the treatment of}} secondary hyperparathyroidism. Method: Patients were {{selected on the basis of}} their abnormal biochemical test and treatment was randomly done with <b>citrate</b> or <b>calcium</b> carbonate. Results: After 60 days of supplementation, biochemical tests were repeated, showing improvement in both groups. Conclusion: Supplementation with <b>calcium</b> (<b>citrate</b> or carbonate) and vitamin D is recommended after surgery for prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism...|$|R
50|$|Calcium lactate is {{also used}} to treat {{hypocalcaemia}} (calcium deficiencies). It can be absorbed at various pHs, thus it {{does not need to be}} taken with food. However, in this use it has been found to be less convenient than <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate.</b>|$|R
50|$|Caltrate is a {{brand name}} calcium {{supplement}} sold by Pfizer Consumer Healthcare and in Japan by Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical. The Caltrate brand is supplied in many different formulas; calcium carbonate (NOT <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate)</b> is the common ingredient serving as the calcium supplement source.|$|R
