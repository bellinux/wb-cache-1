The focus is on the early French contacts of the founder of the institutional Finnish musicology, University of Helsinki Professor Ilmari Krohn (1867 – 1960) and his pupils. The analysis of Krohn’s mobility, networking and interaction is based on his <b>correspondence</b> <b>and</b> <b>documentation</b> concerning his early congress journeys to London (1891) and to Paris (1900). Two French correspondents stand out for this early phase of his career as a musicologist: Julien Tiersot in the area of comparative research on traditional music, and Georges Houdard concerning Gregorian chant and neume notation. By World War I Krohn was quite well-read in French-language musicology. But Paris was for him also a stronghold for international networking more generally. Accomplished musicians, Krohn and his musicology students Armas Launis, Leevi Madetoja and Toivo Haapanen even had an artistic bond with French repertoires. My results contradict the claim that early Finnish musicology was an exclusive domain of German influences...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{inquires}} narratively {{into the}} practice of scholarship {{of teaching and learning}} (SoTL) and teachers’ personal practical knowing process in a self-initiated community of university teachers in China. Following a conception by Boyer (1990) that research should be incorporated into teaching as the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL), Huber & Hutchings (2005) theorize SoTL in a four-core-practice framework of a linear process of individual expression for research and publication. However, not much attention has been given to the important dynamics of collaborative learning. Adopting a social theory of learning and Wenger’s “communities of practice” (1998, 2002), this thesis extends the framework by Huber & Hutchings to investigate the integrated form of individual and collaborative SoTL practice. “Personal practical knowledge” by Connelly, Clandinin & He (1997) is considered in the light of Palmer’s “community of truth” (1998), which is aimed at developing an integrated perspective for understanding teachers’ evolving personal practical knowledge in the SoTL community. This study involves four university academics who are ready to cultivate a SoTL community. They become learning associates for one another, as they went beyond merely sharing concerns and practices about teaching to reach collaborative inquiry into their perceived problems. In response to new circumstances, the SoTL community evolves from an initial grouping of four to increased membership in the formal structure of the system. Narrative inquiry is adopted as the basis for research methodology. Data are collected via ethnographic observation of community meetings, writing <b>correspondence</b> <b>and</b> <b>documentation.</b> The study is naturalistic, collaborative and developmental by nature, enacted within Clandinin & Connelly’s narrative inquiry space along three dimensions (2000). The richness of the narrative experiences and the salient details of the community learning are organized into four narrative profiles, and each carries consistently three progressive steps, followed by the summary of narrative analysis, and concluded with an overview. From teachers’ lived experience in the SoTL community, the adapted framework by Huber & Hutchings is validated, showing that (1) inquiry evidence is multiplied through sharing dynamics; (2) teaching problems are re-defined from diverse resources through collaborative inquiry; (3) changes in teaching as a SoTL initiative are experimented; and (4) learning relationship is woven for further development in the community of inquiry. The study extends understanding of “personal practical knowledge” (Connelly, Clandinin, & He 1997) from moral and intellectual dimensions to shed light on the development of teachers’ personal practical knowledge in the SoTL community. Morally engaged, teachers not only fasten their commitment to teaching improvement, but also become aware of ethical dilemmas with readiness to tackle them. On a moral ground, teachers are empowered to make intellectual progress. They are capable of cultivating an authentic, critical, moral self to withstand the external pressure. They acquire growing competence to address the complexities of teaching and learning, from which to harvest context-specific knowledge. In conclusion, the study presents an alternative paradigm of SoTL for teachers to strengthen their capacity and learn together for professional development. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Daily meetings with the ship management were performed to consolidate the observations made. The companies’ head offices were visited in order to obtain a holistic view of the interaction between shipboard management and central management functions ashore and to follow up findings from the study. The analytical work was composed of an iterative process of alternating collecting of data writing down field notes and listening to interviews. The final synthesis was the integration of the data in an explanatory framework. The conceptual or explanatory framework reflects the cultural psychological view that culture is composed of artifacts, espoused values and basic assumptions, which together are governing the actions of the involved parties. The analysis of the cases has also included elements of the cultural historical activity theory as well as the cultural web model. Special attention has been given to the onboard conditions of the language to serve as the tool for distribution of knowledge. The study also reflects over the contrast between the traditional perspective on human error and that of a sociocultural view. Furthermore is discussed the relations between viewing the safety management as a ”system” or as an expression of ”culture”. In addition, the results from the study are in brief the following. Safety manuals have a discourse which presents the safety management systems as a break down of a complex whole. That means that the real world is not reflected in a holistic view which leads to a critical reduction of facts. A remedy is to apply culture, especially safety culture, as an interlinking component. Another result is that shipboard work as a ”context” presents a mediating artifact to create co-operation and understanding between individuals when different cultures come together. Human error appears to be explainable in terms of cultural dimensions. An important aspect of cultural management appears to be the avoiding of feelings of ”we and them”, originating from socio-economic conditions. Misunderstandings across cultures occur when people make different attributions to explain specific behaviour. Finally a model for cultural management is presented using the observations and results from the study. Godkänd; 2003; 20061106 (haneit...|$|E

She had two sisters, Lotte (who married Arthur Perl) and Käthe (who married Alfred Hanff). Her father, Naumann Rosenbaum, owned the Naumann Rosenbaum Department Store in Stettin until his death in 1911. After his death his widow ran the store until it was “aryanized” by the Nazis. She later married Guido Rieß. In 1920, Else Rosenbaum married the physician James Cohn from Berlin, where the family later resided. They had a son, Werner, born in 1926.

Austrian Heritage CollectionEdith Neumann was born Editha Spitzer in Vienna on May 26, 1902, the youngest child of the lawyer and art collector Alfred Spitzer and his wife Hermine. She had an elder sister named Hanna (Hansi). Her father invested in the work of artists such as Egon Schiele and Oskar Kokoschka. Edith Spitzer studied chemistry and physics at the University of Vienna and received her doctorate in 1927; at that time she was the only woman studying such subjects there. Alfred Spitzer died in the spring of 1923. In 1924 she converted to Christianity, and in May 1925 became engaged to Friedrich (often referred to by Austrian friends and family as Fritz) Neumann, who was also a Christian convert. They met {{at a meeting of the}} Swedish Society for the Conversion of Jews to Christianity. Two years later, upon completing her doctorate, the couple was married on October 3, 1927. Frederick Neumann was a student of the philosopher Martin Heidegger. Edith supported them while Friedrich Neumann continued his studies, eventually gaining a reputation as a biblical scholar. In 1934 Friedrich went to Zagreb, Yugoslavia, where he worked as a missionary, and was later joined by Edith. Two years later they returned to Vienna. In 1938 the couple, fearing the arrest of Friedrich Neumann, fled Vienna via the Danube, travelling for a month through Zagreb, northern Italy, and Paris before finally arriving in London with the help of the British Society. While there they studied English until the Society offered Friedrich Neumann missionary work in Haifa, Israel. In 1948 the Neumanns immigrated to the United States, where they settled in New York. Edith Neumann had lost thirty-four family members due to Nazi persecution, and was able to bring a portion of her father's art collection with her when she came to the U. S. Friedrich, now Frederick (often referred to by American friends as Fred) Neumann became the pastor of the Bushwick Congregational Church in Brooklyn, a position he remained at until his death. Edith Neumann worked as a bacteriologist at the Jewish Hospital in Brooklyn, then received a position as microbiologist at Maimonides Hospital, remaining there for the next 20 years. After the death of Frederick Neumann in 1967, Edith Neumann moved to Manhattan and took a job as medical director of the Jetti Katz Clinical Laboratory. In 1982 she retired at the age of eighty. Among the work she was involved in following her retirement was the publication and translation into German of her husband's sermons. In 1983 she established the Frederick Neumann Memorial Lecture at Princeton Theological Seminary. Edith Neumann donated several paintings from her father's collection to the Oesterreichische Galerie in Vienna and further two more paintings by Kokoschka and Schiele to the Graphische Sammlung Albertina. In honor of her donations and work as a scientist, she was given the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art First Class in 1998. The rest of the artwork that Edith Neumann inherited from her father was donated to Bard College. Edith Neumann died on June 29, 2002 at the age of one hundred years old. digitize...|$|E
40|$|Inter-organizational {{networks}} {{are important to}} deal with the high risks of developing innovative products. However, managing the communication between the participants involved is complex. The traditional models of new product development are not sufficient to gain insight in effective management practices in this respect. Our study explored the inter-organizational communication in an R&D project aimed at developing a medical blood pump conducted by industry, universities and a university hospital. Based on <b>correspondence,</b> <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> interviews, we analysed the inter-organizational communication in the different stages of new product development. Our results confirm Gersick's model that looks upon new product development as being punctuated by rapid changes. In these periods, inter-organizational communication on design objectives and project planning is paramount. In addition, communication needs to focus on contextual factors and the required resources, skills and knowledge. Consequently, facilitation of comprehensive inter-organizational communication appears to be particularly essential during the start-up, explorative prototype stage, and completion of the project...|$|R
