5000|$|Many wild banana {{species as}} well as cultivars exist in {{extraordinary}} diversity in India, China, and Southeast Asia. There are fuzzy bananas whose skins are bubblegum pink; green-and-white striped bananas with pulp the color of orange sherbet; bananas that, when <b>cooked,</b> <b>taste</b> like strawberries. The Double Mahoi plant can produce two bunches at once. The Chinese name of the aromatic Go San Heong banana means 'You can smell it from the next mountain.' The fingers on one banana plant grow fused; another produces bunches of a thousand fingers, each only an inch long. Mike Peed, The New Yorker ...|$|E
5000|$|Canned {{tomatoes}} {{are available in}} several different forms. The traditional forms are whole peeled tomatoes, packed in juice or purée, and ground tomatoes, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "kitchen-ready." [...] Ground {{tomatoes are}} {{not to be confused with}} purée, which is similar but more <b>cooked.</b> <b>Taste</b> tests indicate that whole tomatoes packed in juice tend to be perceived as fresher-tasting than those packed in purée. Crushed tomatoes, commonly used for pasta sauces, are made by adding ground tomatoes to a heavy medium made from tomato paste. Diced tomatoes have become increasingly common for applications where a chunkier or more substantial product is needed. In recent years, the Petite Diced form (3/8" [...] cut pieces) has become the fastest growing segment of canned tomatoes.|$|E
50|$|Harold's {{fried chicken}} is {{different}} from that served at other fast food chicken restaurants (Kentucky Fried Chicken, Brown's Chicken, Popeyes, etc.) in two ways. The first is the cooking medium: Harold's chicken is cooked in a mix of half beef tallow and half vegetable oil, while most chains use only vegetable oil. This provides a taste that is closer to the traditional fried chicken that was invented in the American South. The second major difference between Harold's chicken and most other restaurants is that at Harold's, the chicken is not fried until it is ordered, while some chains fry their chicken in large batches and store it on warming racks until it is purchased. Harold Pierce set up a chain-wide policy from the beginning that all Harold's chicken would be cooked only after it was ordered, in order to preserve the freshly <b>cooked</b> <b>taste</b> of the chicken. Originally, this meant that there was a twelve- to fifteen-minute wait between ordering the chicken and receiving it. The family have subsequently modified the original method, however: the chicken is now partially fried beforehand, and then cooked to completion when it is ordered. This maintains the chicken's freshness while shortening the delivery time to seven or eight minutes.|$|E

50|$|A milanesa {{consists}} of a thin slice of beef, chicken, veal, or sometimes pork, eggplants, tempeh or soy. Each slice is dipped into beaten eggs, seasoned with salt, and other condiments according to the <b>cook's</b> <b>taste</b> (like parsley and garlic). Each slice is then dipped in bread crumbs (or occasionally flour) and shallow-fried in oil, one at a time. Some people prefer to use very little oil and then bake them in the oven as a healthier alternative. A similar dish is the chicken parmigiana.|$|R
5000|$|Formative {{assessment}} {{covers the}} range of informal diagnostic tests a teacher can use to assist {{the process of learning}} by his students. Prescriptive but ungraded feedback enables students to reflect on what they are learning and why. The goal is to improve performance and achieve successful outcomes. Robert Stake, Director of the Center for Instructional Research and Curriculum Evaluation, likens formative assessment to a <b>cook</b> <b>tasting</b> a soup before serving it to a guest. Despite its advantages, formative assessment can be time-consuming, and incentives in the school system tend to favor more objective assessments.|$|R

He swallowed-- a thing allowed only to a khshatriya or warrior-- Mithridatic every morning on the saliva[FN#19], and he made the <b>cooks</b> <b>taste</b> every dish before he ate of it. As soon as he had risen, the pages in waiting repeated his splendid qualities, and as he left his sleeping-room in full dress, several Brahmans rehearsed the praises of the gods. Presently he bathed, worshipped his guardian deity, again heard hymns, drank a little water, and saw alms distributed to the poor. He ended this watch by auditing his accounts.|$|R
25|$|Scrapple is {{typically}} made of hog offal, {{such as the}} head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to the pot and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning are very {{much a matter of}} the region and the <b>cook's</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|R

50|$|Typically, {{celeriac}} is harvested {{when its}} hypocotyl is 10 to 14 cm in diameter. However, {{a growing trend}} (specifically in Peruvian and South American cuisine) {{is to use the}} immature vegetable, valued for its intensity of flavour and tenderness overall. It is edible raw or <b>cooked,</b> and <b>tastes</b> similar to the stalks (the upper part of the stem) of common celery cultivars. Celeriac may be roasted, stewed, blanched, or mashed. Sliced celeriac occurs as an ingredient in soups, casseroles, and other savory dishes. The leaves and stems of the vegetable are quite flavoursome, and aesthetically delicate and vibrant, which has led to their use as a garnish in contemporary fine dining.|$|R
5000|$|The meat, {{which has}} a strong flavor, can be eaten raw or <b>cooked.</b> Its <b>taste</b> has been {{described}} as like that of iodine or [...] "something like a sea urchin though less delicate in flavor" [...] and a [...] "slightly bitter, soapy taste". It is usually cut into small pieces, and flavored with chopped onion, cilantro, and lemon. Minced and boiled, it serves as an element of many dishes, particularly arroz con piure picado, or [...] "rice with minced piure". It can also be fried and eaten on bread. A similar edible tunicate in the Mediterranean is Microcosmus sabatieri, also called a sea violet or sea fig.|$|R

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of cowpea [Vignaunguiculata(L) Walp] in fighting malnutrition and poverty, a socio-economic assessment of cowpea diversity found on the Ghanaian market was conducted. The objective was to investigate emerging consumer preference for cowpea and make recommendations {{for the development of}} tailor-made varieties. Forty-seven cowpea accessions were collected from traders interviewed for morphological characterization to ascertain the degree of diversity. Data was subjected to Hierarchical Cluster Analysis using Genstat Discovery Edition 3 software and variations among the cowpea varieties based on the selected seed traits established. Cowpea varieties found on the markets were broadly categorized into foreign and local varieties and usually named after their sources. Foreign Cowpea varieties were very popular on the markets surveyed as reflected in the per cent distribution of respondents by cowpea varieties sold; Niger (52 %), Burkina Faso (50 %), Togo (46 %), Lagos (36 %) and Ghana (18 – 21 %). At the trader level, the order of preference for cowpea characteristics was cleanliness (stone free and no dirt), colour (white seed colour), easy to <b>cook,</b> <b>taste,</b> size, less weevil damage, dryness and place of origin ranked in decreasing order of importance. At the consumer level, cleanliness that was also tied to the extent of weevil damage was ranked most important. This was followed by seed colour (preferable white), short cooking time, size and taste. From the sociological perspective, concerns are raised on the impact of past cowpea breeding activities giving the level of competitiveness and market performance of locally improved varieties observed. Recommendation is made for traders and consumers to be considered as relevant actors in all the stages of crop improvement and breeding activities. This is crucial for enhanced small-holder farmer market access and strengthened food networks in rural economie...|$|R
