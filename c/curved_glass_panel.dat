It {{is an example of}} postmodern Art Deco architecture. The MAS houses 470,000 objects, most of which are kept in storage. The first visitor's gallery is the [...] "visible store", which contains 180,000 items. The building is located on the spot where the Hanzehuis used to stand. International merchants worked and resided at the Hanzehuis. In the nineteenth century a fire destroyed the building.|$|E

Renderings of animation sequences with physics-based Monte Carlo light transport simulations are exceedingly costly to generate frame-by-frame, yet much of this computation is highly redundant due to the strong coherence in space, time and among samples. A promising approach pursued in prior work entails subsampling the sequence in space, time, and number of samples, followed by image-based spatio-temporal upsampling and denoising. These methods can provide significant performance gains, though major issues remain: firstly, in a multiple scattering simulation, the final pixel color is the composite of many different light transport phenomena, and this conflicting information causes artifacts in image-based methods. Secondly, motion vectors are needed to establish correspondence between the pixels in different frames, but {{it is unclear how}} to obtain them for most kinds of light paths (e. g. an object seen through a <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panel).</b> To reduce these ambiguities, we propose a general decomposition framework, where the final pixel color is separated into components corresponding to disjoint subsets of the space of light paths. Each component is accompanied b...|$|E
5000|$|In 1934 the {{bodywork}} was upgraded. The new {{and much}} vaunted [...] "Panoramique" [...] versions had a three-piece front windscreen. The main screen was still conventionally flat, but the A-pillars were distinguished by narrow <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panels.</b> Cars thus equipped carried in their names the suffix [...] "RL-N".|$|R
40|$|Despite glass’s ubiquity in {{the modern}} built {{environment}} it is rarely applied in applications requiring complex curvature. The high temperatures and complexity of techniques utilized in forming <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> are typically very expensive to employ, requiring dedicated hard-tooling which ultimately limits the formal variation that can be achieved. This combination of economic and manufacturing barriers limits both the formal possibilities and potentially the overall envelope-performance characteristics of the glazing system...|$|R
5000|$|Originally, {{the design}} called for curved, {{insulated}} (double paned) <b>glass</b> <b>panels,</b> {{but these were}} found to be prohibitively expensive. Flat, insulated glass had been suggested, but was dismissed by Jahn. Single-paned (non-insulated), <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> were eventually used, and resulted in the need for a more expensive air conditioning system, which remains very costly to operate, and is insufficient on hot days (internal temperatures have reached as high as 90 degrees Fahrenheit). [...] The building is also bitterly cold in the winter; in its early years, ice formed on the interior of some of the wall panels. The marble floor of the atrium initially developed unsightly water stains, an issue which has since been resolved.|$|R

2500|$|Two {{new models}} were {{exhibited}} at the 1950 Commercial Motor Show, with names instead of model codes for the first time. The Envoy was for traditional front-engined chassis, and featured a full-front cab with a vee-pattern windscreen, and aluminium trim across {{the lower part of}} the radiator grill extending around squared-off front corners to the wheel arches. The Crusader, which could be built on the traditional front-engined chassis or the new underfloor-engined chassis, had a more upright front profile, with <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> at the windscreen corners, and in most cases an enlarged side window with sloping pillars between this and the entrance. With the front-engined chassis, the Crusader employed the Envoy's front trim. Both the Envoy and Crusader were produced to the new maximum dimensions of [...] by , and many examples were originally fitted with rear wheel spats.|$|R
5000|$|The Louis Vuitton Foundation by Frank Gehry (2014) is {{gallery of}} {{contemporary}} art located adjacent to the Bois de Boulogne in Paris was opened in October 2014. Gehry described his architecture as inspired by the glass Grand Palais of the 1900 Paris Exposition and by the enormous glass greenhouses of the Jardin des Serres d'Auteuil near the park, built by Jean-Camille Formigé in 1894-95. Gehry had to work within strict height and volume restrictions, which required {{any part of the}} building over two stories to be made of glass. Because of the height limits, the building is low, sited in an artificial lake with water cascading beneath the building. The interior gallery structures are covered in a white fiber-reinforced concrete called Ductal. Similar in concept to Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall, the building is wrapped in <b>curving</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> resembling sails inflated by the wind. The glass [...] "Sails" [...] sails are made of 3,584 laminated <b>glass</b> <b>panels,</b> each one a different shape, specially curved for its place in the design. Inside the sails is a cluster of two-story towers containing 11 galleries of different sizes, with flower garden terraces, and rooftop spaces for displays.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{is based on}} the project of a free-form roofing system with double <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> that are cladding the structure. One of the challenges is a load-bearing structure that follows a free-form NURBS surface. The load-bearing members are going to be manufactured from bended metal tubes. Technology of production allows bending pipes in circular shapes, therefore, initially designed free-form NURBS curvature is difficult to transfer into buildable load-bearing structure due to its complex geometry. For the fabrication purposes the curve elements needs to be simplified to a set of arcs in order to achieve profiles for bending. To solve this problem, the Genetic Algorithm had been applied for fitting arcs into initial geometry. The algorithm fits elements to minimize Deviation from an initial curve and maximize Continuity between arcs. Base set up can be modified due to other parameters such as Length or a Number of elements etc. The aim is to achieve design methodology which will give full freedom of design, on the same time, but also to reassure possibility of construction...|$|R
40|$|Flat <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> are in use {{since the}} time of the Roman Empire. In the ruins of the city of Pompeii, {{destroyed}} by the Vulcan Vesuvius in 79 DC, a <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> in a bronze frame of 300 × 600 mm was found. In this article we describe a mayor improvement in the structural behaviour of <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> by making the <b>glass</b> <b>curved,</b> or more accurately, corrugated. Both the in- and out-plane loading meet far more resistance against deformation, and the corrugated <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> have a largely increased bearing capacity with the same thickness of <b>glass</b> the flat <b>panel</b> has.

40|$|The latest {{trends in}} {{contemporary}} architecture are fully transparent pavilions: a single storey building {{free of any}} steel or concrete frame, where <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> are used as unique vertical structural elements to support the roof and as wind bracing to stabilize and stiffen the building. In this application, individual <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> is supported on two sides (roof and foundation) and subjected to in-plane shear force (lateral wind), out-of-plane distributed load (perpendicular wind) and in-plane compression force (self weight of the roof, snow). While several studies on glass plate behaviour under distributed load and column buckling exist, shear buckling of two sides supported <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> has not been investigated yet. Therefore, research on this topic gives original and innovative importance to both theoretical (<b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> under shear loading) and practical (use of glass envelope for building stabilization) applications. Two structural concepts are developed: point support concept - the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> {{is attached to the}} substructure by bolted connections at corners linear support concept - the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> is glued to the substructure by two shorter sides. The local behaviour of the connection devices and the global behaviour of the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> under in-plane shear force are studied by means of experimental investigations, numerical modelling and parametric analyses. Experimental investigation and numerical simulation of connection devices was conducted in order to better understand the behaviour of different types of glass/substructure bolted (for point support) and glued (for linear support) connections. Deformation, stress distribution and local influence on the surrounding glass were analyzed. From these studies, the most suitable connection device for load introduction was chosen and implemented in the <b>glass</b> <b>panel.</b> Tests on full size <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> were conducted in order to estimate the shear buckling behaviour of a <b>glass</b> <b>panel.</b> Also the influence of different boundary conditions (point and linear) and load interaction (in-plane shear force with out-of-plane distributed load and in-plane compression force) on global <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> behaviour were analyzed. The specimen deformation, the stress distribution and the failure mode have been analyzed. Advanced numerical models of point and linear supported <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> were implemented using the Finite Element Code Ansys. Elastic buckling analysis was used to determine the critical shear buckling force, shear buckling coefficient and shear buckling mode shape, further used as the initial geometrical imperfection. By means of nonlinear buckling analyses the global <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> behaviour was studied analysing <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> deformations, stresses distribution and support reactions. The influence of initial imperfection shape was investigated as well as the interaction of in-plane shear force with out-of-plane distributed load and in-plane compression force. The models were validated by comparing their results with experimental measurements. The parametric study was carried out to identify the most important parameters, evaluating their influence on shear buckling behaviour. The influence of the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> and connection device geometrical/material properties on critical shear force, global deformation, stress distribution and support reaction could be determined. A simple method for preliminary design of <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> subjected to in-plane shear force was proposed by developing formulas, graphs and curves for determining the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> shear buckling resistance. Finally, this study led to some recommendations for practical use of <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> in fully-transparent pavilions as structural elements...|$|R
