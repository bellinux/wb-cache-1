Most of the wreck became broken after various salvage operations, although the wreck remains substantial and often diveable in comparison to most other wrecks that were blown out, due to her location in the relative lea of Portland and inside the shambles bank. However the wreck also rests close to the Portland Race and so strong currents can be found.|$|E
40|$|This research, {{initiated}} in October 1992, was {{located at the}} intersection of Blairs Ferry Road and Lindale Drive in the City of Marion. The wall is located on the southeast corner of the intersection. Reinforced retaining wall construction started with a five inch base of roadstone with one inch of sand for leveling purposes. One and one-half to two feet of one inch <b>clean</b> <b>stone</b> was placed behind the blocks. A four inch perforated plastic pipe was placed approximately nine inches {{from the bottom of the}} one inch <b>clean</b> <b>stone.</b> The Tenswal, tensar geogrid was placed at every third layer.

40|$|Rainfall {{trends for}} the UK show that some areas, {{including}} {{the west of}} Scotland, are experiencing an increase in both the amount and intensity of winter rain. Future changes to the climate are predicted to exacerbate this effect, creating significant potential problems for {{the integrity of the}} sandstone architecture that is a major feature of Scotland’s cultural heritage. Here we describe initial results from a suite of field and laboratory based studies designed to determine the impact of winter rainfall on the growth and loss of crusts on Scottish sandstone buildings. Monitoring of biological and pollutant crusts on existing structures, and under experimental conditions, will demonstrate how crusts develop in wet urban environments compared to those in drier, more rural regions. This approach should show whether elevated rainfall leads to an increase in biological activity and/or the development of complex biomineralic crusts. Conversely, increased rainfall may result in the preferential removal of these crusts, allowing the stonework to become ‘self-cleaning’, but potentially exacerbating degradation by exposing the stone beneath to other weathering agents. The impact of rainfall on biological crusts has important implications for the mechanisms and rates of sandstone decay and for the type and cost of strategies used to limit damage. If crusts are removed by winter rain, fewer resources will be needed to <b>clean</b> <b>stone</b> for aesthetic reasons. However, enhanced biological activity or degradation will increase financial costs for statutory and voluntary bodies responsible for the care of historic buildings. If the effects of winter rainfall are geographically constrained, {{it may be possible to}} offset these costs by concentrating preventative and/or remedial work in particular areas. </p...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis is concerned with different aspects of laser cleaning of stone sculpture including the interaction of laser radiation with stone, evaluation and monitoring of the cleaning process {{and the development of}} a practical cleaning tool. Results show that a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser is the most suitable type of laser for the removal of black encrustations from marble and limestone surfaces. Measurements of the absorptivity of polluted and <b>clean</b> <b>stone</b> surfaces at 1. 06 itm show that a typical black crust, resulting from atmospheric pollution, absorbs 2. 5 - 3. 5 times as much of the incident radiation as typical clean limestone and marble surfaces. This is shown to lead to the controlled removal of black crust material, by several thermal and mechanical mechanisms, without damaging the underlying stone. Measurements of ablation thresholds, by deflection of a probe beam, reveal that material is removed from a black crust at a fluence approximately half that required to remove material from a clean limestone or marble surface. Monitoring of the acoustic pulse generated during the laser beam/stone interaction is used to characterise the cleaning process. Results also show that cleaning is more efficient when a thin layer of water is applied to the surface prior to irradiation. Surface analysis techniques show that if cleaning is carried out below the damage threshold of the stone there is no modification to its physical or chemical structure. Cleaning of limestone sculpture from Lincoln Cathedral and terracotta sculpture from the Victoria and Albert Museum shows laser cleaning to be more refined than conventional cleaning techniques and to have considerable advantages in the area of health and safety...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a novel {{approach of}} corrosion damage analysis based on image processing for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of degradation effects on stone surfaces. This methodology can be applied in situ in association {{with a variety of}} non-destructive monitoring schemes, and on images acquired from several imaging modalities, capturing from micro- to macro-scale characteristics. Our analysis methodology was evaluated on three non-destructive monitoring techniques of cleaned and not <b>cleaned</b> <b>stone</b> surfaces, namely on digital camera, reflectography and fiber optic microscope images. Further to validating the potential of the various imaging modalities, the paper also assesses the corrosion rate and the efficiency of the recruited cleaning methods. The derived results are in accordance with chemical analyses revealing the deterioration patterns of the studied surfaces. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this work, {{infrared}} thermography was {{employed as a}} monitoring technique during water capillary rise tests on a choice of porous stones in the laboratory, {{as well as in}} situ on a <b>cleaned</b> porous <b>stone</b> surface of a historic building. While the emissivity values of the investigated materials were considered for the thermographic survey, other investigative techniques, such as mercury intrusion porosimetry and water sorption analysis for studying the stone in terms of their microstructure and isothermic behaviour respectively, were additionally used for the laboratory investigation on quarry samples. Results, such as water absorption coefficient and percentage, total porosity and isothermic behaviour were presented and discussed, in an attempt to explain the thermal images from the capillary rise tests. Furthermore, correlation between the thermal contrast and the imbibed water percentage for each sample obtained from the capillary rise tests was also presented in an attempt to show how powerful the action of water inside a porous stone is. Lastly, an in field thermographic survey on a <b>cleaned</b> historic <b>stone</b> surface, using a wet micro blasting method, was also carried out. Representative samples were collected from the investigated surface with the intention of studying their microstructure by means of mercury intrusion porosimetry and water sorption analysis...|$|R
