5|$|Albert and Joseph follow Dares {{in having}} Achilles behead Troilus {{as he tries}} to rise after his horse falls. In Guido and authors he influenced, Achilles {{specifically}} seeks out Troilus to avenge a previous encounter where Troilus has wounded him. He therefore instructs the Myrmidons to find Troilus, surround him and <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> from rescue.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the {{subsequent}} United States declaration of war upon Italy rendered Segrè an enemy alien and <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> from communication with his parents. Physicists began leaving the Radiation Laboratory to do war work, and Raymond T. Birge asked him to teach classes to the remaining students. This provided a useful supplement to Segrè's income, and he established important friendships and professional associations {{with some of these}} students, who included Owen Chamberlain and Clyde Wiegand.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly {{against the}} idea of divorce, however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she would <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism only recently.|$|E

5|$|By 14 August, Godwin-Austen {{realized}} the peril of his situation, with XV Brigade nearly able to <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> from behind, his troops exhausted, and his artillery completely deficient and running low on ammunition, and informed General Henry Maitland Wilson, {{who was in}} command at Cairo while Wavell was absent in England, that retreat from Tug Argan and evacuation from British Somaliland was now a necessity. If his forces could be evacuated, perhaps 70 percent of them might be removed. Otherwise, he {{would be forced to}} fight to the death, with his entire command destroyed. Wilson agreed to Godwin-Austen's request the next day, and preparations were made to flee after dark on 15 August. During that day, Observation Hill was attacked for the final time by De Simone's forces. De Simone had decided to doggedly press his attack in the gap, in lieu of completing the flanking maneuver, and finally this proved successful. By 7:00pm XIII Brigade had seized Observation Hill, and the British retreated from it in disarray. After sundown, the defenders of the remaining hills were withdrawn, along with the Punjab troops, who departed just as II Brigade was able to make inroads through their abandoned positions. British resistance had collapsed, and as Godwin-Austen and his forces fled towards Berbera, the Italians were in control of Tug Argan.|$|E
5|$|French {{sabotage}} by the FFI, {{together with}} the Allied bombing, severed German communication lines, causing initial confusion among the troops. German field commanders {{were not able to}} communicate with Army GroupG's headquarters. Despite the hampered communications, German commanders acted independently to put measures in effect to counter the Allied invasion. Directly facing the brunt of the Allied landings was the German LXII Corps at Draguignan, commanded by Ferdinand Neuling. Allied paratroopers interrupted his communication lines and trapped his headquarters in the city. He therefore ordered the nearby 148th Infantry Division to counterattack against the beaches at LeMuy, just before the Allied paratroopers <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> completely. Wiese, as commander of the 19th Army, was also unable to contact Blaskowitz's Army GroupG headquarters, but implemented a plan to push the Allied forces in the LeMuySaint-Raphaël region back into the sea unilaterally. With almost no mobile reserves to react against the beach landings, he ordered the commander of the 189th Infantry Division, Richard von Schwerin, to establish an ad-hoc battle group (Kampfgruppe) from all nearby units to counterattack the Allied bridgeheads in this area. While vonSchwerin assembled all the men he could find, the 148th Infantry Division near Draguignan encountered heavy resistance from the FFI, which had been reinforced by British paratroopers, upsetting the plan for a swift counterattack toward the beaches.|$|E

25|$|Hard Network Out – For some reason, {{unbeknownst to}} {{humanity}} at present, professional journalist and Miami Herald columnist Greg Cote cannot {{understand the concept}} of the hard network {{out at the end of}} an hour of the show and will continue to talk through the break. There was a period on the show wherein Le Batard would wear a hat with a clock on the brim to help Cote understand how much time remained at the end of a segment, but to no avail. The phenomenon has now morphed into Le Batard and Stugotz attempting to trap Cote by waiting until late in an hour to ask his opinion, setting him up to ramble through the out. The show maintains frequently that this feat is not a contrived gag but is an actual problem for Cote that they exploit to great comedic benefit. Le Batard and Stugotz also use this as a prank; during an episode in February 2017, the two had Cote on the phone to discuss a Twitter beef with Dwyane Wade, and <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> at the hard network out before he could respond to Dan's question regarding it. Le Batard admitted he was on the show just so they could <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

With Wurmser's Austrians and the original garrison crowded into the encircled city, disease and hunger began exacting a serious toll on the garrison.|$|E
25|$|De Vere's {{financial}} situation was steadily deteriorating. At this point he had sold almost all his inherited lands, which <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> from his principal source of income. Moreover, because the properties were security for his unpaid {{debt to the}} Queen in the Court of Wards, he had had {{to enter into a}} bond with the purchaser, guaranteeing that he would indemnify them if the Queen were to make a claim against the lands to collect on the debt. To avoid this eventuality, the purchasers of his estates agreed to repay De Vere's debt to the Court of Wards in instalments.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Italy {{across the}} Great St Bernard Pass in May 1800 and seized Milan on 2 June. Reacting to the {{surprise}} French offensive, Melas ordered O'Reilly to take 3,000 troops and an artillery convoy to defend Piacenza. The Austrian army commander hoped to use Piacenza as a base to launch a counterattack against Milan. In the event, Piacenza fell to the French before O'Reilly reached it. On 6 June, after an 11-hour skirmish, he successfully managed to save the artillery convoy and withdraw to the west, while fending off a French column that tried to <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wallace left NBC in 1989 for ABC. At ABC News, Wallace was {{the senior}} {{correspondent}} for Primetime Thursday and occasionally hosted Nightline. During the first Gulf War in 1991, he reported from Tel Aviv on the Iraqi Scud missiles attacks. At the time, the Israeli Government {{did not want}} to advertise where the Scuds landed, in order to prevent the Iraqis from making adjustments to their launchers. On one episode of Nightline, Wallace started describing the location in Tel Aviv where a Scud missile landed. Nightline host Ted Koppel <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off,</b> and asked him to point to a general area rather than give a specific location.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September, {{the fleet}} under Mahmud Pasha {{arrived at the}} island, docking in the harbour of St. George. Niccolò sent envoys to enquire as to the reason for their presence, since he had kept up the payment of tribute. Mahmud Pasha replied by {{demanding}} the surrender of Mytilene and the entire island. Mehmed himself crossed over with his army to the island via Agiasmati, and repeated his demand to Niccolò, but the latter replied that he would submit only by force. Mahmud Pasha then persuaded the Sultan to return to Anatolia and leave the siege to him, lest the Venetian fleet <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> on Lesbos.|$|E

25|$|Pressed by Wrede's 7th Bavarian Infantry Regiment, {{plus two}} of Hügel's Württemberg battalions, Radetzky {{conducted}} an orderly retreat on the Siegenburg road, {{covered by the}} grenzers and Kienmayer's grenadiers under General-Major Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspré. He managed to shepherd the V Armeekorps trains safely through Pfeffenhausen before the Bavarians <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off.</b> Wrede pursued aggressively and scooped up many prisoners but failed to capture the bridge, which the Austrians burned. Even so, the Bavarians kept up the pressure, crossing the shallow Große Laber at 11:00 PM to attack. Radetzky fell back to a hill called the Hornbach where his rear guard skirmished with the Bavarians into the early morning hours.|$|E
25|$|Isabella now marched south towards London, pausing at Dunstable, {{outside the}} city on 7 October. London was {{now in the hands}} of the mobs, {{although}} broadly allied to Isabella. Bishop Stapledon failed to realise the extent to which royal power had collapsed in the capital and tried to intervene militarily to protect his property against rioters; a hated figure locally, he was promptly attacked and killed– his head was later sent to Isabella by her local supporters. Edward, meanwhile, was still fleeing west, reaching Gloucester by the 9th. Isabella responded by marching swiftly west herself in an attempt to <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off,</b> reaching Gloucester a week after Edward, who slipped across the border into Wales the same day.|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} decisions came in May–June 1863, after Lee's smashing {{victory at}} the Battle of Chancellorsville. The western front was crumbling, as multiple uncoordinated Confederate armies were unable to handle General Ulysses S. Grant's campaign against Vicksburg. The top military advisers wanted to save Vicksburg, but Lee persuaded Davis to overrule them and authorize yet another invasion of the North. The immediate goal was to acquire urgently needed supplies from the rich farming districts of Pennsylvania; a long-term goal was to stimulate peace activity in the North by demonstrating {{the power of the}} South to invade. Lee's decision proved a significant strategic blunder and cost the Confederacy control of its western regions, and nearly cost Lee his own army as Union forces <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> from the South.|$|E

25|$|The Germans had {{recently}} added 300 battalions to their forces by intensive mobilisation, and Haig claimed (3 March) {{that with the}} BEF spread more thinly by having taken over line to the south, these forces {{might be used to}} attack at Ypres and <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> from the Channel Ports. Assuming Haig was inventing this threat, Nivelle wrote him a letter, addressing him as a subordinate, and revived the idea of a British staff at GQG, this time reporting to Robertson, but through whom Nivelle would issue orders to Haig. Nivelle now demanded that the BEF be split into two Army Groups or else that Haig be sacked and replaced by Gough. Nivelle also believed that Lloyd George hoped to become Allied Commander-in-Chief, a suggestion so absurd that it caused President Poincaré to laugh.|$|E

25|$|On December 30, the Union force {{moved into}} line two miles (threekm) {{northwest}} of Murfreesboro. The two armies were in parallel lines, about four miles (sixkm) long, oriented from southwest to northeast. Bragg's left flank was weak at the start, and Rosecrans could have attacked {{there when he}} arrived and wheeled left, around the flank and directly into the town of Murfreesboro, {{but he did not}} know the full disposition of Bragg's forces because of the skillful screening of the Confederate cavalry during the Union march. In a manner similar to the previous year's First Battle of Bull Run, both commanders devised similar plans for the following day: envelop the enemy's right, get into his rear, and <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> from his base. Since both plans were the same, the victory would probably go to the side that was able to attack first. Rosecrans ordered his men to be ready to attack after breakfast, but Bragg ordered an attack at dawn.|$|E
