Later, during a sketch rehearsal—involving impersonations of Condoleezza Rice, Laura Bush, and John Kerry—the various mishaps of Tracy, Jenna, and Josh prompt Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) that it would be impossible for the three to perform on the show.

5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, <b>canceling</b> the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, President Barack Obama asked Secretary of Defense Robert Gates about {{placing the}} project on hold or <b>canceling</b> it because of its high cost: over $13billion for the planned 28 helicopters.

5|$|Like their {{previous}} tours, The Joshua Tree Tour was a minimalistic, austere production, and U2 used this outlet for addressing {{political and social}} concerns. One such issue was Arizona Governor Evan Mecham's <b>canceling</b> the state's observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Throughout the tour, the group continued to explore American roots music: they collaborated with folk artist Bob Dylan, blues musician B. B. King, and Harlem's New Voices of Freedom gospel choir; U2 also visited Graceland and Sun Studios in Memphis, where they recorded new material. These new songs and the band's experiences on tour were documented for the 1988 Rattle and Hum album and Phil Joanou-directed motion picture.|$|E
5000|$|There can be some {{confusion}} {{with the term}} [...] "Bullseye" [...] as it can mean both the type of <b>cancel,</b> such as the early USA concentric ring <b>cancel</b> (as well as other countries that used them) {{and to have a}} <b>cancel</b> positioned right {{in the center of a}} stamp.

5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi {{that he thought}} his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; {{he did not like}} the idea of playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted to attract more attention to his character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives so much that they had discussed <b>canceling</b> the entire sketch altogether.|$|E
5|$|The band's studio autonomy, tours, {{managers}} and personal projects stalled the recording process, which lasted from {{shortly after the}} band's February 2009 reunion to July 2011. The band developed Neighborhoods in separate studios and regrouped at various periods to record. The band's numerous delays in the recording process resulted in the band <b>canceling</b> a European tour and the label setting a deadline for the album to be due. The trio wrote lyrics regarding such subjects as isolation, confusion and death. The band infused inspiration from each member's various musical tastes to form a unique sound that recalled their separate upbringings, leading the trio to compare the album to separate neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into <b>canceling</b> their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E
50|$|A used stamp {{with a pen}} <b>cancel</b> {{is usually}} worth much less than a stamp <b>cancelled</b> using a handstamp or machine.

40|$|Background/Objectives: This study {{explores the}} {{incidence}} of <b>cancelling</b> treasury shares events in Malaysia and examines the financial characteristics of companies that {{are more likely to}} <b>cancel</b> their shares. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The study utilizes descriptive analysis to assess {{the incidence of}} <b>cancelling</b> treasury share events among non-financial and non utility Malaysian companies. Tobit regression analysis is used to gauge the relationship between firm financial characteristics and the incidence of <b>cancelling</b> treasury share events. Findings: There were a total of 175 events of <b>cancelling</b> treasury shares occurred between the years 2001 and 2012. This study finds that profitability positively and significantly affects the decision to <b>cancel</b> treasury shares, while excess cash flows negatively influence a firm’s decision to <b>cancel</b> treasury shares. Furthermore, smaller size companies are {{more likely to engage in}} <b>cancelling</b> their shares. Application/Improvements: The study finds that smaller firms are more likely to <b>cancel</b> their treasury shares as these companies may have severe information asymmetry problems...|$|R
5|$|Development {{continued}} {{with a more}} experimental ethos until the company began {{to run out of}} capital. The Canadian government loan that had funded Polytron's prototyping phase was not renewed for their production phase. They also lost funding from the organization that preceded the Indie Fund as Polytron's producer left the company. Fish borrowed money from friends and family for three months to keep the company open. In dire straits, he considered <b>canceling</b> the project. In March 2011, the nearby Québécois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help Polytron, having just signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish their own game, Warp. Trapdoor assisted with Polytron's finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of Fez earnings. Fish felt that partnership rescued the game.|$|E

In September 2007, a UNRWA survey in the Gaza Strip revealed {{that there was a}} nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been <b>canceling</b> classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology, science labs and extra curricular activities.|$|E

However, on August 2 the Commission ruled that Wolf's 23% ownership of the company did create a conflict because Cape Air had ongoing contracts with the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort); Wolf was instructed he would either need to resign from the Senate and discontinue his campaign from Governor, divest his stake in Cape Air, or cancel all contracts between Cape Air and MassPort. In a statement to supporters, explaining that departing his company or <b>canceling</b> contacts would put his employees' jobs at risk, he announced that he would suspend his campaign, and resign from the Senate.|$|E
