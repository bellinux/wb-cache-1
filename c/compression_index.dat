40|$|Coding {{schemes for}} {{discrete}} memoryless multicast networks (DM-MN) with rate-limited {{feedback from the}} receivers and relays to the transmitter are proposed. The schemes improve over the noisy network coding proposed by Lim et al [...] For the single relay channel with relay-transmitter feedback, our coding schemes recover Gabbai and Bross's results, and strictly improve on noisy network coding, distributed decode-forward coding proposed by Lim et al., and all known lower bounds on the achievable rates proposed for the setup without feedback. The coding schemes are based on block-Markov coding, superposition coding, sliding-window/backward decoding and hybrid relaying strategies. In our Scheme 1 A, the relays and receivers use compress-forward strategy and send the <b>compression</b> <b>indices</b> to the transmitter through the feedback pipes. After obtaining the <b>compression</b> <b>indices</b> through feedback, the transmitter sends them together with the source message. Each receiver uses backward decoding to jointly decode the source message and all <b>compression</b> <b>indices.</b> Our Scheme 1 B is similar, except that here each relay not only uses compress forward to compress its channel outputs, but also performs partial decode forward to decode a common part of source message. Our Scheme 1 C allows different relays to decode {{different parts of the}} source message (in Scheme 1 A, no relay decodes any part of the source message; in Scheme 1 B, all relays decode the same part of source message), which can achieve higher rates than Scheme 1 A and Scheme 1 B. Motivated by the feedback coding scheme, we propose a new coding scheme for DM-MN without feedback, where the transmitter decodes the <b>compression</b> <b>indices</b> instead of obtaining them directly through feedback. It is shown that the scheme still improves noisy network coding and distributed decode-forward coding for some channels. Comment: 25 pages, submitted to IT transaction.

We study two multi-source relay networks, namely the multiple access relay channel (MARC) and the interference relay channel (IFRC), both with an oblivious relay.

The coding scheme is based on block-Markov coding, joint backward decoding and hybrid relay-ing strategy. In each block, the relays use partial decode-forward strategy to decode part of the source message. Meanwhile, the receivers and relays use compress-forward strategy to compress their channel outputs and send the <b>compression</b> <b>indices</b> to the transmitter through the feedback links.

Furthermore, motivated by the feedback coding scheme, we propose a new coding scheme for discrete memoryless multicast networks without feedback, which also improves noisy network coding and distributed decode-forward coding.

In particular, the sum capacity is upperbounded by considering the channel when the relay node has abundant power and is named potent for that reason. For the Gaussian interference relay channel with potent relay, we study the strong and the weak interference regimes and establish the sum capacity, which, in turn, serve as upperbounds for the sum capacity of the GIFRC with finite relay power. Numerical results demonstrate that upperbounds are tighter than the cut-set bound, and coincide with known achievable sum rates for many scenarios of interest. Additionally, the degrees of freedom of the GIFRC are shown to be 2 when the relay has large power, achievable using compress-and-forward.

40|$|During {{the last}} years, {{the amount of}} {{multimedia}} content has greatly increased. This has multiplied the need of efficient compression of the content but also the ability to search, retrieve, browse, or filter it. Generally, video <b>compression</b> and <b>indexing</b> have been investigated separately. However, {{as the amount of}} multimedia content grows, it will be very interesting to study representations that, at the same time, provide good <b>compression</b> and <b>indexing</b> functionalities. Moreover, even if the indexing metadata is created for functionalities such as search, retrieval, browsing, etc., it can also be employed to increase the efficiency of current video codecs. Here, we use it to improve the long term prediction step of the H. 264 /AVC video codec. This paper focuses on the comparison between four different MPEG- 7 descriptors when used in the proposed scheme. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
