40|$|CHDS State/LocalA {{substantial}} {{challenge to}} reducing security {{gaps in the}} international air cargo supply chain {{is the lack of}} a method of evaluating existing levels of risk based upon points of origin, points of departure and cargo and aircraft type. This is particularly challenging since the current United States air cargo security protocol requires the 100 percent screening of all air cargo without objectively analyzing or evaluating the risk posed by the air cargo. This thesis proposes a risk-based intelligence driven approach to identify and mitigate the threat of the successful introduction of an improvised explosive device into the international air cargo supply chain. The primary thrust of this research effort is to conduct a comparative analysis of the United States international air cargo policies and the European Unions international air cargo policies as a means of evaluating and proposing a risk based intelligence driven international air <b>cargo</b> <b>policy</b> that capitalizes on the strengths of United States and European Unions systems.

40|$|This paper uses {{a global}} computable general {{equilibrium}} model, global trade analysis project and a value-to-volume conversion to arrive at quantitative estimates of the new seaborne cargo volumes resulting from {{a free trade agreement}} between Taiwan and China, namely, the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA). The approach is designed to model asymmetric impacts of tariff removal and economy-wide interactions caused by the ECFA arriving at estimation in cargo value flows. Then a scientific approach is developed to convert the estimated cargo value flows into volume flows. The analysis concludes that in terms of total trade value, the ECFA liberalisation would induce a trade creation effect across the Strait of more than US$ 30 billions. There is an increase of US$ 26. 04 billions in exports to China, which is much higher than imports from China (US$ 4. 67 billions). Regarding the converted trade volume, the exports of uncontainerisable and containerisable cargo to China increase by 0. 37 and 5. 12 million tons (0. 43 million TEUs), respectively. The increases in imports from China are relatively minor at 0. 19 and 0. 75 million tons (0. 06 million TEUs) of uncontainerisable and containerisable <b>cargo.</b> <b>Policy</b> implications and suggestions for shipping and port industry are provided accordingly...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the political economy}} of the air cargo industry in the Philippines and Taiwan in the 1990 s. The air cargo industry is an important facilitator of economic globalization and now transports 34 % of world merchandise trade by value. The Philippines and Taiwan were selected because of their central location in East Asia, a region highly dependent on air cargo-facilitated trade. The growing economic role of air cargo service clashes with the propensity of national governments to protect domestic air cargo interests from air cargo transnational corporations (TNCs). The primary question addressed in this research is to determine what factors influenced air <b>cargo</b> <b>policy</b> decisions by the Philippines and Taiwan during the 1990 - 1999 timeframe. A levels-of-analysis empirical approach is utilized that includes causal factors emanating from domestic and international sources, including interests, institutions, and ideas. The potential contribution of crises to policy outcomes is also considered. The themes that emerge from this research are the interplay between interests and domestic political institutions on policy outcomes; the role of TNCs as political actors; the influence of state-state bargaining on commercial policy outcomes; and the constraints imposed by international institutions on national decision-makers. The empirical argument presented is that economic globalization and the rise of TNCs are challenging the ability of national governments to pursue independent commercial policies for some, but not all, air cargo issue-areas. It is also argued that the structure of domestic political institutions {{plays an important role in}} policy outcomes by attenuating the influence of air cargo interests...|$|E

50|$|The law of {{fundamental}} breach was historically {{treated as an}} extension of the doctrine of deviation. The development of this doctrine can be traced down to the first half of the 19th century, when Tindal C.J. stated in Davis v. Garrett that deviation made by the carrier from the agreed voyage route brings the latter outside of contract and therefore outside of exceptions or limitation clauses provided by such a contract. This harsh attitude to deviation cases originated from the earlier marine insurance practice when <b>cargo</b> insurance <b>policy</b> was lost in case of deviation. Thereby strict obligations imposed to the carrier were designed to afford protection to the cargo owner.|$|R
40|$|Distance and {{transport}} cost matters for international trade {{but which is}} more relevant? What impact does transport policy such as Open Sky have on cost of trade? Using US export data by air transport with 21 trading partners for 1998 - 2002 we first find that airfare is more significantly correlated with export than distance and that elasticity of export in ad-valorem with respect to airfare is - 0. 571. Second, the level of unit cost and market concentration has significant positive effect on airfare. Third, air cargo markets with Open Sky Agreements have lower unit cost but higher market concentration, and these agreements have negative dynamic effect on combined index of unit cost and market concentration. We may need to go beyond Open Skies {{if we are to}} pursue further enhancement of competitive forces in air cargo market to facilitate international trade.

In 1803, Britain {{utilized}} France’s {{interference in}} the Civil Swiss Strife as a pretext to continue its occupancy of Malta, effectively ending the short-lived Treaty of Amiens. As the most impressive Naval Power in the world, Britain proceeded to blockade French, Spanish, and Dutch ports. In 1805, Williams Woods purchased two insurance policies from The Maryland Insurance Company, a successful and lucrative Baltimore marine insurance institution. The two policies covered the ship, The William and Mary, and its <b>cargo.</b> The <b>policy</b> assured the journey from Baltimore to Laguira, with “liberty at one other neighboring port. ” After the William and Mary was captured as a prize by the British Ship of War, Fortune, and condemned in a Jamaican admiralty court, William Woods brought suit in the Circuit Court for the District of Maryland. The ensuing case spanned eight years and appeared before the Supreme Court in 1810 and 1813.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the capacity allocation problem in single-leg air cargo revenue management. We assume that each cargo booking request is endowed with a random weight, volume and profit rate and propose a Markovian model for the booking request/acceptance/rejection process. The {{decision on whether to}} accept the booking request or to reserve the capacity for future bookings follows a bid-price control policy. In particular, a cargo will be accepted only when the revenue from accepting it exceeds the opportunity cost, which is calculated based on bid prices. Optimal solutions are derived by maximizing a reward function of a Markov chain. Numerical comparisons between the proposed approach and two existing static single-leg air <b>cargo</b> capacity allocation <b>policies</b> are presented. OR in airlines Revenue management...|$|R
40|$|From the mid- 1950 s to 1990, sub-Saharan Africa's {{share of}} global exports fell from 3. 1 to under 1. 2 percent, a decline that implies {{associated}} export earning losses of about $ 65 billion annually. Previous {{studies show that}} foreign trade barriers do not account for this poor performance. Indeed, African exports enjoy OECD tariff preferences. In the sub-Saharan African countries, too high a proportion of foreign exchange earnings is paying for Africa's high export transport costs. The authors demonstrate that relatively high transportation costs - especially for processed products - often place African exporters at a serious competitive disadvantage. African countries must use a far larger share of their foreign exchange earnings to pay for international transport services than other developing countries do - and {{the relative importance of}} those payments has been increasing. Why are Africa's transport costs so high? Ill-advised policies {{on the part of some}} African governments seem to have played a role, as their <b>cargo</b> reservation <b>policies</b> produced high"rents"for lines that have been shielded from the effects of competition.

50|$|Numerous {{treaties}} defining contraband {{have been}} concluded among nations. In time of war, the nations involved have invariably violated the agreements, formulating their own definitions as {{the fortunes of}} war indicated. The Declaration of London, drafted at the London Naval Conference of 1908-1909 and made partly effective {{by most of the}} European maritime nations at the outbreak of World War I, established comprehensive classifications of absolute and conditional contraband. As the war developed, the lists of articles in each category were constantly revised by the various belligerents despite protests by neutral powers engaged in the carrying trade. By 1916, the list of conditional contraband included practically all waterborne cargo. Thereafter, for the duration of World War I, nearly all cargo in transit to an enemy nation was treated as contraband of war by the intercepting belligerent, regardless {{of the nature of the}} <b>cargo.</b> A similar <b>policy</b> was inaugurated by the belligerent powers early in World War II.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — At the port-of-entry {{containers}} are inspected {{through a}} specific sequence of sensor stations {{to detect the}} presence of radioactive materials, biological and chemical agents, and other illegal <b>cargo.</b> The inspection <b>policy,</b> which includes the sequence in which sensors are applied and the threshold levels used at the inspection stations, affects the probability of misclassifying a container {{as well as the}} cost and time spent in inspection. This work is an extension of [21], which considers an inspection system operating with a Boolean decision function combining station results. In this paper we present a multi-objective optimization approach to determine the optimal sensor arrangement and threshold levels while considering cost and time. The total cost includes cost incurred by misclassification errors and the total expected cost of inspection, while the time represents the total expected time a container spends in the inspection system. Examples which apply the approach in various systems are presented. Note to practitioners — The inspection of containers at a port-of-entry is becoming a challenging problem as the number of containers increase and a variety of new sensor technologies become available. The sequence of inspections and the level of inspection {{have a major impact on}} the total cost of inspection and delay of containers at a port. This paper presents methods that search for the optimum threshold levels at inspection stations as well as the optimum inspection sequence to minimize the total cost and delays. These methods provide the border protection and customs agencies with approaches based on theoretical foundations yet the results are readily applicable.

40|$|Currently, {{most of the}} {{research}} related to aviation sector of Hong Kong would focus on infrastructure perspective such as the building of 3 rd runway in HKIA and the cooperation issues among airports in Pearl River Delta (PRD) Region in order to analyze the impact towards competitiveness of Hong Kong as a major international air cargo hub. However, there are not much research on air cargo industry has been done from security perspective but the recent trend of tightening international security requirement has already brought significant impact on the competitiveness of Hong Kong air logistics sector. In fact, the United States enacted the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) after the 9 / 11 incident in 2001 already signaled a new era in air cargo transportation. Significant security measures have been implemented to all facilities shipping cargo to the United States and air cargo sector in Hong Kong would be included. Since most of the international air cargo that enters the United States transits through large hub facilities in Asia such as Hong Kong, there is a strong air cargo network linkage between Hong Kong and the United States. This study aims to understand the major development of international air cargo security requirement and the consequences for Hong Kong air cargo industry. This study also examines challenges of the requirement on Hong Kong air cargo industry from operational and economic perspective. An in-depth interview would be conducted to obtain industrial insights on developing recommendations on fulfilling the requirement in a cost-effective manner. This study would act as a stepping stone for further analysis on providing recommendations to facilitate the security requirement development in Hong Kong air <b>cargo</b> industry. published_or_final_versionTransport <b>Policy</b> and PlanningMasterMaster of Arts in Transport Policy and Plannin...|$|R
40|$|Analysis and {{presentation}} of this thesis {{is supported by}} studies of many relevant cases where the major arguments are set around the exclusion clauses concerning the ‘all risks cover’ policy as found in Institute Cargo Clauses. Two cases are especially emphasized, namely Mayban General Assurance BHD v. Alstom Power Plants Ltd. and Global Process Systems Inc v. Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Berhad, {{mainly because of the}} special nature of the subject matter insured in these cases. The legal issues arising from claims of loss during sea transportation of large technical equipments turn out to be complicated and might lead to different application of the law due to the special nature of the subject-matter insured. All risks insurance policies have many exclusion clauses expressly listed, however, most arguments about liabilities for damage to large equipments arise from application of these two clauses, namely inherent vice and improper or insufficient packaging. Inherent vice as well as insufficiency or improper packing are both exclusion clauses for insurer's liability under an all risk insurance policy. Different interpretation of the terms themselves might lead to different judgements regarding liability. Thus identifying the sources of such terms in different legislative works becomes very important. More often than not, the causes of such types of loss are complicated and involve mutual interaction between causes, and so it is necessary to discuss how the exclusion clauses are applied as well as their interactions. In practice, damage from inherent vice can and often will develop with the assistance of a fortuitous external circumstance such as harsh weather conditions which, if qualified as a peril of the sea and considered the sole proximate cause of the loss, could guarantee the insurance cover, even if inherent vice is an excluded clause in the all risks cover policy. It is very important to discuss the causational link between perils and losses, to identify the proximate causes to the loss and to discuss the insurance cover under situations where concurrent proximate causes of similar efficiency contribute to a loss. The purpose of this thesis is to make a presentation of these two exclusion clauses for ‘all risks’ insurance cover under British marine <b>cargo</b> insurance <b>policy</b> and discuss their application in previous cases. Frequent reference to the Marine Insurance Act 1906 and the Institute Cargo Clauses will be found in this thesis. There will also be found a discussion from perspectives of British maritime legislation, Norwegian maritime legislation, as well as Chinese Maritime legislation. At the end of this thesis, I’d like to enclose a simple legislative comparison between British marine cargo insurance and Chinese PICC insurance policy, through which a better understanding of different approaches for solutions under different jurisdiction will be gained...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses air cargo screening. In 2008, about 7. 3 billion pounds of cargo was transported on U. S. passenger flights [...] approximately 58 percent of which was transported domestically (domestic cargo) and 42 percent of which was transported on flights arriving in the United States from a foreign location (inbound cargo). The 2009 Christmas Day plot to detonate an explosive device during an international flight bound for Detroit provided a vivid reminder that terrorists continue to view passenger aircraft as attractive targets. According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the security threat posed by terrorists introducing explosive devices in air cargo shipments is significant, and the risk and likelihood of such an attack directed at passenger aircraft is high. To help enhance the security of air cargo, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9 / 11 Commission Act of 2007 (9 / 11 Commission Act) mandated the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) {{to establish a system}} to physically screen 50 percent of cargo on passenger aircraft [...] including the domestic and inbound flights of foreign and U. S. passenger operations [...] by February 2009, and 100 percent of such cargo by August 2010. The 9 / 11 Commission Act defines screening for purposes of the air cargo screening mandate as a physical examination or nonintrusive methods of assessing whether cargo poses a threat to transportation security. The act also requires that such a system provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of checked baggage. According to TSA, the mission of its air cargo security program is to secure the air cargo transportation system while not unduly impeding the flow of commerce. Although the mandate is applicable to both domestic and inbound cargo, TSA stated that it must address the mandate for domestic and inbound cargo through separate systems because of differences in its authority to regulate domestic and international air cargo industry stakeholders. This testimony is based on a report we are publicly releasing today that assesses TSA's progress and related challenges in meeting the air cargo screening mandate. It addresses the following key issues in our report: progress TSA has made in meeting the 9 / 11 Commission Act screening mandate as it applies to (1) domestic air cargo and (2) inbound air cargo and related challenges it faces for each. For our report, we reviewed documents such as TSA's air <b>cargo</b> security <b>policies</b> and procedures. We also conducted site visits to four category X U. S. commercial airports and one category I U. S. commercial airport that process domestic and inbound air cargo. We selected these airports based on airport size, passenger and air cargo volumes, location, and participation in TSA's screening program. At these airports, we observed screening operations and technologies and interviewed local TSA officials, airport management officials, and representatives from 7 air carriers, 24 freight forwarders, 3 shippers, and 2 handling agents to obtain their views on TSA's system to implement the screening mandate. We selected these air carriers, freight forwarders, shippers, and handling agents based on input from TSA and industry stakeholders. More detailed information about our scope and methodology is included in our June 2010 report. We conducted this work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. ...|$|R
