50|$|This type of retinoschisis is {{very common}} with a {{prevalence}} of up to 7 percent in normal persons. Its cause is unknown. It can easily be confused with retinal detachment by the non-expert observer and in difficult cases even the expert may have difficulty differentiating the two. Such differentiation is important since retinal detachment almost always requires treatment while retinoschisis never itself requires treatment and leads to retinal detachment (and hence to visual loss) only occasionally. Unfortunately one still sees cases of uncomplicated retinoschisis treated by laser retinopexy or <b>cryopexy</b> {{in an attempt to}} stop its progression towards the macula. Such treatments are not only ineffective but unnecessarily risk complications. There is no documented case in the literature of degenerative retinoschisis itself (as opposed to the occasional situation of retinal detachment complicating retinoschisis) in which the splitting of the retina has progressed through the fovea. There is no clinical utility in differentiating between typical and reticular retinoschisis. Degenerative retinoschisis is not known to be a genetically inherited condition.There is always vision loss in the region of the schisis as the sensory retina is separated from the ganglion layer. But like the loss is in the periphery, it goes unnoticed. It is the very rare schisis that encroaches on the macula where retinopexy is then properly used.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Forty-five out of 50 {{selected}} retinal detachments {{were successfully}} reattached by the D-ACE surgical sequence, that is, initial drainage of subretinal fluid followed by air injection into the vitreous, transcleral <b>cryopexy,</b> and definitive scleral buckling. The D-ACE sequence {{is recommended for}} difficult bullous detachments as a simple, safe, and effective alternative to non-drainage techniques. Experienced retinal surgeons report success rates of over 90 % reattachment (after one or more pro-cedures) in large series of heterogeneous retinal detachments treated by scleral buckling. Detach-ments resulting from single small breaks in the pre-equatorial region are especially easy to treat (usually by a non-drainage technique), while the advent of closed microsurgery combined with internal gas tamponade has substantially improved the prognosis for more difficult problems such as posterior breaks in high myopes. There remain, however, several types of retinal detachment which (i) pose special buckling problems, (ii) are not generally considered for closed microsurgery, and (iii) contribute dispro-portionately to failed surgery and subsequent development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Bullous detachments from multiple large equatorial breaks represent one such group, because the extensive buckling frequently results in fish-mouthing of the breaks. In 1980 a surgical sequence comprising initial subretinal fluid drainage (D), followed by intravitreal injection of air (A), transcleral <b>cryopexy</b> (C), and episcleral explant (E) -hence D-ACE sequence'-was introduced in order to overcome the problems which we had previously encountered in managing these difficult detachments.

Methods: A prospective review of cases that had posterior segment surgery under topical anesthesia and that needed sedation. Dexmedetomidine-loading infusion was 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion (0. 5 mcg/kg/h). Results: Nine patients were operated on under topical anesthesia: two scleral buckle, five <b>cryopexy,</b> one scleral laceration, and one pars plana vitrectomy with very dense laser therapy in an albinotic fundus; six patients had retinal detachment. General or local anesthesia were not possible due to medical or ocular morbidities, use of anticoagulants, or the surgery plan changed intraoperatively when new pathologies were discovered.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Retinal detachment is one of the most severe compli-cations following vitrectomy. The incidence of retinal detachment after vitrectomy is 6 – 8 % in epi-retinal membrane (ERM) cases [1, 2], 6 % in branch retinal vein occlusion cases [3], and varies between 0 - 11 % in macular hole (MH) cases [4 - 9]. Retinal detachment may be attrib-utable to the surgical technique, and can be affected by how much of the peripheral vitreous remained in MH cases. The presence of a gas bubble in an incompletely vitrectomized eye can induce traction on the peripheral retina, leading to formation of peripheral breaks and retinal detachment. Due to the vision-threatening nature of this complication, many attempts have been made to prevent retinal detachment, including; careful peripheral retinal examination with scleral depression, properly treating retinal breaks {{at the end of the}} vitrectomy, and even prophylactic scleral buckling [10] or <b>cryopexy</b> [11]. Combined vitrectomy and phacoemulsification (phacov-itrectomy) surgery has several advantages that preven...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevention}} of aphakic retinal detachment by cryotherapy is controversial. No study {{up to now}} has compared results. We performed a retrospective study of two groups of patients: both groups consisted of patients with mature cataract and certain risk factors for retinal detachment (myopia, previous retinal detachment in the eye in study or in the fellow eye etc.) in the first group (n= 299) circumferential <b>cryopexy</b> has been performed prior to cataract extraction while in the second group (n= 149) no prophylaxis has been done. Comparison {{between the two groups}} did not reveal any protection afforded by prior cryotherapy: despite the prophylactic cryotherapy, 7 patients (2, 3 %) in the first group developed a retinal detachment post cataract extraction; two patients (1. 3 %) in the second group developped a retinal detachment; both were high-risk patients. These results lead us to conclude that prophyactic treatment does not necessarily prevent this complication. The best propylaxis appears to be careful regularlily performed examination of the peripheral retina both pre- and post-operartively. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} whether prophylactic circumferential retinal <b>cryopexy</b> (CRC) can prevent pseudophakic retinal detachment (PRD) development after posterior capsule rupture (PCR) during phacoemulsification. Methods. Retrospective patient chart analysis of eyes experiencing a PCR during phacoemulsification. Comparison of PRD development between eyes receiving CRC (cryo+ group) or not (cryo− group). Results. Overall 106 patients were analyzed, thereof 61 (58 %) in the cryo+ and 45 (42 %) in the cryo− group. In both clusters {{a total of}} 10 PRDs (9. 4 %) occurred, thereof 3 (30 %) in the cryo+ as well as 7 (70 %) in the cryo− group (p= 0. 087), 79. 8 ± 81. 58 weeks after PCR. Relative/absolute risk reduction in CRC-treated eyes was calculated to be 68 %/ 11 %. Prophylactic CRC reduced PRD development 0. 3 -fold. Number needed to treat {{was estimated to be}} 9. 4. Conclusion. Prophylactic CRC might be a useful treatment option in eyes with PCR to hamper PRD development in the further course. Further research is indicated to evaluate this beneficial effect between eyes with and without a rupture of the anterior vitreous cortex and accompanying vitreous loss in an expanding number of eyes...|$|E
