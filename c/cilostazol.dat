The {{aim of this}} study was to prepare two sulfonate salts of <b>cilostazol</b> to increase the dissolution and hence the oral bioavailability of <b>cilostazol.</b> Methods: <b>Cilostazol</b> mesylate and <b>cilostazol</b> besylate were synthesized from <b>cilostazol</b> by acid addition reaction with methane sulfonic acid and benzene sulfonic acid, respectively. The salt preparations were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The water contents, hygroscopicity, stress stability, and photostability of the two <b>cilostazol</b> salts were also determined. The dissolution profiles in various pH conditions and pharmacokinetic studies in rats were compared with those of cilostazol-free base. Results: The two <b>cilostazol</b> salts exhibited good physicochemical properties, such as nonhygroscopicity, stress stability, and photostability, which make it suitable for the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations. Both <b>cilostazol</b> mesylate and <b>cilostazol</b> besylate showed significantly improved dissolution rate and extent of drug release in the pH range 1. 2 – 6. 8 compared to the cilostazol-free base. In addition, after oral administration to rats, <b>cilostazol</b> mesylate and <b>cilostazol</b> besylate showed increases in Cmax and AUCt of approximately 3. 65 - and 2. 87 -fold and 3. 88 - and 2. 94 -fold, respectively, compared to cilostazol-free base. Conclusion: This study showed that two novel salts of <b>cilostazol,</b> such as <b>cilostazol</b> mesylate and <b>cilostazol</b> besylate, could be used to enhance its oral absorption.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of <b>cilostazol</b> on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced maturation of DCs. DC 2. 4 cells were treated with <b>cilostazol</b> for 12 h and subsequently stimulated with LPS to induce maturation. <b>Cilostazol</b> reduced the expression of maturation-associated markers induced by LPS, such as CD 40, CD 86, and MHCII, improved the endocytotic function, and decreased production of the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) of these cells.

40|$|Background/Aims: <b>Cilostazol</b> {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated to inhibit IL- 23 production in human synovial macrophages via a RhoA/ROCK-dependent pathway. However, whether <b>cilostazol</b> affects IL- 23 production in human dendritic cells remains largely unknown. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate this question and elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms. Methods: Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) were pretreated with or without <b>cilostazol</b> and then incubated with zymosan. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real time PCR analyses were used to measure IL- 23 protein expression and RNA levels, respectively, whereas Western blotting was used to measure the expression and phosphorylation level of AMPK. Results: Our results demonstrated that <b>cilostazol</b> suppressed zymosan-induced IL- 23 protein production in a concentration dependent manner without affecting dendritic cell viability. In addition, it was found that <b>cilostazol</b> suppressed the expression of the p 19 and p 40 subunits of IL- 23. Moreover, <b>cilostazol</b> mimicked the effect of the AMPK agonist A- 769662, as demonstrated by the fact that IL- 23 production was also inhibited by A- 769662, and the effect of <b>cilostazol</b> on IL- 23 production was blocked by the AMPK antagonist Compound C. More importantly, Western blotting demonstrated that <b>cilostazol</b> led to an increased phosphorylation of AMPK. Conclusion: Collectively, our data suggest that <b>cilostazol</b> inhibits the production of IL- 23 in human mo-DCs, potentially via the activation of AMPK.

40|$|<b>Cilostazol</b> is a {{phosphodiesterase}} inhibitor {{that has}} been shown to inhibit platelet activation. Endothelin is known to be the most potent endogenous growth promoting and vasoactive peptide. In patients and animal models with stroke, the level of circulating endothelin increases and complicates the recovery progress contributed by vascular constriction (an immediate pathology) and vascular proliferation (a long-term pathology). However, the effects of <b>cilostazol</b> on endothelin have not been explored. To demonstrate the dual-antagonizing effects of <b>cilostazol</b> on vasoconstriction and cell proliferation induced by endothelin, we used primary culture of mouse vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro, mouse femoral artery ex vivo, and intracranial basilar artery ex vivo. We show that the dual-inhibition effects of <b>cilostazol</b> are mediated by blocking endothelin-induced extracellular calcium influx. Although <b>cilostazol</b> does not inhibit endothelin-induced intraorganellar calcium release, blockade of extracellular calcium influx is sufficient to blunt endothelin-induced vasoconstriction. We also show that <b>cilostazol</b> inhibits endothelin-induced cellular proliferation by blocking extracellular calcium influx. Inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can block anti-proliferation activity of <b>cilostazol,</b> confirming the downstream role of PKA in cellular proliferation.

Probucol, a lipid-lowering {{agent with}} {{anti-oxidant}} properties, {{is involved in}} protection against atheroscle-rosis, while <b>cilostazol,</b> an antiplatelet agent, has diverse neuroprotective properties. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of probucol and <b>cilostazol</b> on focal cerebral ischemia with hypercholesterolemia. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout (KO) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without 0. 3 % probucol and/or 0. 2 % <b>cilostazol</b> for 10 weeks. To assess the protective effects of the combined therapy of probucol and <b>cilostazol</b> on isch-emic injury, the mice received 40 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Infarct volumes, neurobehavioral deficits and neuroinflammatory mediators were subsequently evaluated 48 h after reperfusion. Probucol alone and probucol plus <b>cilostazol</b> significantly decreased total- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol in ApoE KO with HFD. MCAO resulted in significantly larger infarct volumes in ApoE KO mice provided with HFD compared to those fed a regular diet, although these volumes were significantly reduced in the probucol plus <b>cilostazol</b> group. Consistent with a smaller infarct size, probucol alone and the combined treatment of probucol and <b>cilostazol</b> improved neurological and motor func-tion. In addition, probucol alone and probucol plus <b>cilostazol</b> decreased MCP- 1 expression and CD 11 b and GFAP immuno-reactivity in the ischemic cortex. These findings suggested that the inhibitory effects of probucol plus <b>cilostazol</b> in MCP- 1 expression in the ischemic brain with hypercholesterolemia allowed the identification {{of one of the}} mechanisms respon-sible for anti-inflammatory action.

In our previous study, <b>cilostazol</b> was found to increase the expression of the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) in synovial cells. Thus, the present study was undertaken to examine whether <b>cilostazol</b> is able to counteract tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) -induced cell death in endothelial cells via the induction of HO- 1 expression. We exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to TNF-α (50 ng/ml), with or without <b>cilostazol</b> (10 µM). Pretreatment with <b>cilostazol</b> markedly reduced TNF-α-induced viability loss in the HUVECs, which was reversed by zinc protoporphyrine IX (ZnPP), an inhibitor of HO- 1.
