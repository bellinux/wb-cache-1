5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} physical examination in detecting <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> by pediatric residents and identify risk factors of <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases.</b> Material and Method: Five hundred term infants (GA ≥ 37 wks) who were born at Phramongkutklao Hospital from July 1 st, 1999 to June 30 th, 2000 were examined by pediatric residents and pediatric cardiologists within {{the first week of}} life. The echocardiography was performed in all 500 infants for definite diagnosis. The accuracy of physical examination was determined by comparing with echocardiographic finding and presented as sensitivity and specificity. Results: <b>Congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> were found in 18 of 500 term infants (3. 6 %).

There {{is the need to}} further elucidate the {{spectrum and}} epidemiology of <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> amongst African. Aim: This study was conducted to highlight the spectrum and occurrence of <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> in an African population. Methodology: All paediatric patients who were autopsied over a 98 -month period were checked for occurrence of <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases.</b> Attempts were made to ascertain the primary disease and causes of death. We noted their bio-data, ages, sexes and causes of death. The results were analysed with SPSS version 17. The results formed the basis for discussion and recommendations. Results: There were 135 cardiac related deaths and 36 of them were in paediatric age brackets. The mean age was 4. 7 + 1. 08 months {{with a standard deviation of}} 6. 27. M:F ratio was 1 : 1. 1. The commonest anomaly was ventricular septal defect. There was a weak association with other congenital anomalies. The commonest cause of death was bronchopneumonia. Discussion and Recommendation: The disease pattern showed reasonable similarity with reports from other parts of the world. However, there is need for development of capacity for prenatal diagnosis of <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> in Africa.

40|$|Objectives: {{to define}} the {{prevalence}} and characteristics of associated <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> in patients with Hirschsprung’s disease. Method: all patients with a histological diagnosis of Hirschsprung’s disease admitted to our hospital between January 2010 and December 2013 were included in this prospective observational study and underwent cardiovascular screening. Cardiac anatomy was assessed by a segmental echocardiographic approach. Measurements of aortic root and left ventricular dimensions, wall thickness and function were obtained. <b>Congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> requiring a percutaneous or surgical intervention were described as major <b>hearts</b> <b>diseases.</b> Results: 133 consecutive patients were enrolled at median age of 2. 3 years.

Conclusions: prevalence of associated <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> was slightly higher than in previous papers, and mostly represented by septal defects. 4 / 6 patients with major <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> had also a chromosomal anomaly.

Blood for serum uric acid, hemoglobin (Hb), hamatocrit (Hct), arterial blood gas (ABG), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr) and urinalysis (U/A) as well as pulmonary and aorta arterial pressures were obtained during catheterization. Findings: 24. 8 % of patients with cyanotic <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> (CCHD) had a serum uric acid level of greater than normal, related directly to the degree of polycythemia, but 0. 06 % in non cyanotic <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases.</b> Also 13 % of patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) had hyperuricemia corresponding to PH value.

40|$|SummaryDevelopmental {{genetics}} of <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> {{has evolved}} from analysis of embryo sections towards molecular genetics of cardiac morphogenesis with a dynamic view of cardiac development.

Based on these new concepts, genetic counselling in <b>congenital</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> {{is based on the}} mechanism of a given heart defect rather than on its anatomy.
