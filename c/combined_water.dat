25|$|The average water tariff was {{equivalent}} to US$1.33/m3 {{for water and}} US$1.13/m3 for sewerage in 2006. Because of Japan's negative inflation rate during some years (e.g. between 2003 and 2006) real tariffs increase even if nominal tariffs remain unchanged. Utilities cannot raise tariffs themselves, but have to receive approval for tariff increases from municipal councils. The <b>combined</b> <b>water</b> and sewerage bill amounts to about 1% of household income and is thus considered affordable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Combined</b> <b>water</b> {{and sewer}} bills amount, on average, {{to less than}} 0.5% of total {{household}} expenditures and are thus quite affordable. The intermittent supply leads many to rely on bottled or tanked water, which is about 8 to 10 times higher than piped water, so that total household expenditures are often {{much higher than the}} utility bill. Prices paid to water vendors are 4 to 8 JD per m3. In 2007 it was estimated that an average poor household with 6 members in the Middle Governorates spends 31-39 JD per year on its water and sewer bill at a consumption of 70 liter/capita/day, corresponding to only 0.4% of household expenditures. However, if other items are added the picture changes substantially: it costs 35 JD per year to depreciate the cost of a 2 m3 rooftop storage tank over 10 years; 160 JD per year to buy 2 liters/capita/day of bottled water at a price of 0.04 JD per liter (0.80 JD per canister of 5 gallons); and 153 JD per year to buy the equivalent of 28 liters/capita/day at a price of 2.50 JD/m3 from water vendors. This amounts to 374 JD per year and household, corresponding to 6.3% of expenditures. In addition, for households not connected to the sewer network the cost of emptying septic tanks at a cost between 21 and 40 JD per load needs to be added to calculate total water and sanitation expenditures. In conclusion, the cost of the water bill thus is only a fraction of total water expenditures, and household water expenditures could be lowered significantly if a sufficient quantity of good quality water was supplied on a reliable basis.|$|E

2500|$|As an {{amphibian}} the Kittiwake {{needed to}} have a retractable undercarriage, a most unusual feature at this time. [...] The two main wheels were retracted with a hand crank into boxes within the hull, placed {{between the first and}} second step. [...] These boxes had cam-operated doors to preserve the hull surface. [...] Inevitably, this arrangement led to a very narrow track undercarriage. [...] At the rear of the hull/central float was a <b>combined</b> <b>water</b> rudder/ tailskid.

2500|$|For {{residential}} {{users in}} the UWSCG service area that have water meters the <b>combined</b> <b>water</b> and sewer tariff was 0.50 Georgian Laris (USD 0.22) per cubic meter in 2016.

60|$|Take, for example, {{the laws}} of the {{chemical}} composition of substances; as that hydrogen and oxygen being <b>combined,</b> <b>water</b> is produced. All we see of the process is, that the two gases being mixed in certain proportions, and heat or electricity being applied, an explosion takes place, the gases disappear, and water remains. There is no doubt about the law, or about its being a law of causation. But between the antecedent (the gases in a state of mechanical mixture, heated or electrified), and the consequent (the production of water), there must be an intermediate process which we do not see. For if we take any portion whatever of the water, and subject it to analysis, we find that it always contains hydrogen and oxygen; nay, the very same proportions of them, namely, two-thirds, in volume, of hydrogen, and one-third oxygen. This is true of a single drop; it is true of the minutest portion which our instruments are capable of appreciating. Since, then, the smallest perceptible portion of the water contains both those substances, portions of hydrogen and oxygen smaller than the smallest perceptible must have come together in every such minute portion of space; must have come closer together than when the gases were in a state of mechanical mixture, since (to mention no other reasons) the water occupies far less space than the gases. Now, as we can not see this contact or close approach of the minute particles, we can not observe with what circumstances it is attended, or according to what laws it produces its effects. The production of water, that is, of the sensible phenomena which characterize the compound, may be a very remote effect of those laws. There may be innumerable intervening links; and we are sure that there must be some. Having full proof that corpuscular action of some kind takes place previous to any of the great transformations in the sensible properties of substances, we can have no doubt that {{the laws of}} chemical action, as at present known, are not ultimate, but derivative laws; however ignorant we may be, and even though we should forever remain ignorant, {{of the nature of the}} laws of corpuscular action from which they are derived.|$|E
