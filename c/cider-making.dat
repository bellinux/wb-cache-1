60|$|The scene {{reminded}} the sculptor of our New England vintages, {{where the big}} piles of golden and rosy apples lie under the orchard trees, in the mild, autumnal sunshine; and the creaking cider-mill, {{set in motion by}} a circumgyratory horse, is all a-gush with the luscious juice. To speak frankly, the <b>cider-making</b> is the more picturesque sight of the two, and the new, sweet cider an infinitely better drink than the ordinary, unripe Tuscan wine. Such as it is, however, the latter fills thousands upon thousands of small, flat barrels, and, still growing thinner and sharper, loses the little life it had, as wine, and becomes apotheosized as a more praiseworthy vinegar.|$|E
60|$|During these weeks Giles Winterborne {{was nowhere}} to be seen or heard of. At the close of his tenure in Hintock he had sold some of his furniture, packed up the rest--a few pieces endeared by associations, or {{necessary}} to his occupation--in the house of a friendly neighbor, and gone away. People said that a certain laxity had crept into his life; that he had never gone near a church latterly, and had been sometimes seen on Sundays with unblacked boots, lying on his elbow under a tree, with a cynical gaze at surrounding objects. He was likely to return to Hintock when the <b>cider-making</b> season came round, his apparatus being stored there, and travel with his mill and press from village to village.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{are only}} just {{grinding}} down the early pickthongs and griffins,' continued the farmer, in a half-apologetic tone for detaining by his <b>cider-making</b> any well-dressed woman. 'They rot {{as black as}} a chimney-crook if we keep 'em till the regulars turn in.' As he spoke {{he went back to}} the press, Cytherea keeping at his elbow. 'I'm later than I should have been by rights,' he continued, taking up a lever for propelling the screw, and beckoning to the men to come forward. 'The truth is, my son Edward had promised to come to-day, and I made preparations; but instead of him comes a letter: [...] "London, September the eighteenth, Dear Father," [...] says he, and went on to tell me he couldn't. It threw me out a bit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{realized}} {{in a moment}} how he had come there. Down {{in the heart of}} the apple country nearly every farmer kept up a <b>cider-making</b> apparatus and wring-house for his own use, building up the pomace in great straw [...] "cheeses," [...] as they were called; but here, on the margin of Pomona's plain, was a debatable land neither orchard nor sylvan exclusively, where the apple produce was hardly sufficient to warrant each proprietor in keeping a mill of his own. This was the field of the travelling cider-maker. His press and mill were fixed to wheels instead of being set up in a cider-house; and with a couple of horses, buckets, tubs, strainers, and an assistant or two, he wandered from place to place, deriving very satisfactory returns for his trouble in such a prolific season as the present.|$|E
60|$|Winterborne's {{house had}} been pulled down. On this account his face had been seen but fitfully in Hintock; and he would {{probably}} have disappeared from the place altogether but for his slight business connection with Melbury, on whose premises Giles kept his <b>cider-making</b> apparatus, {{now that he had}} no place of his own to stow it in. Coming here one evening {{on his way to a}} hut beyond the wood where he now slept, he noticed that the familiar brown-thatched pinion of his paternal roof had vanished from its site, and that the walls were levelled. In present circumstances he had a feeling for the spot that might have been called morbid, and when he had supped in the hut aforesaid he made use of the spare hour before bedtime to return to Little Hintock in the twilight and ramble over the patch of ground on which he had first seen the day.|$|E
60|$|She {{saw nothing}} of Winterborne {{during the days}} of her recovery; and perhaps on that account her fancy wove about him a more romantic tissue than it could have done if he had stood before her with all the specks and flaws inseparable from corporeity. He rose upon her memory as the fruit-god and the wood-god in alternation; {{sometimes}} leafy, and smeared with green lichen, as {{she had seen him}} among the sappy boughs of the plantations; sometimes cider-stained, and with apple-pips in the hair of his arms, as she had met him on his return from <b>cider-making</b> in White Hart Vale, with his vats and presses beside him. In her secret heart she almost approximated to her father's enthusiasm in wishing to show Giles once for all how she still regarded him. The question whether the future would indeed bring them together for life was a standing wonder with her. She knew that it could not with any propriety do so just yet. But reverently believing in her father's sound judgment and knowledge, as good girls are wont to do, she remembered what he had written about her giving a hint to Winterborne lest there should be risk in delay, and her feelings were not averse to such a step, so far as it could be done without danger at this early stage of the proceedings.|$|E
60|$|September 23d.--The vintage {{has been}} going on in our podere for about a week, and I saw a {{part of the process of}} making wine, under one of our back windows. It was on a very small scale, the grapes being thrown into a barrel, and crushed with a sort of pestle; and as each estate seems to make its own wine, there are {{probably}} no very extensive and elaborate appliances in general use for the manufacture. The <b>cider-making</b> of New England is far more picturesque; the great heap of golden or rosy apples under the trees, and the cider-mill worked by a circumgyratory horse, and all agush with sweet juice. Indeed, nothing connected with the grape-culture and the vintage here has been picturesque, except the large inverted pyramids in which the clusters hang; those great bunches, white or purple, really satisfy my idea both as to aspect and taste. We can buy a large basketful for less than a paul; and they are the only things that one can never devour too much of--and there is no enough short of a little too much without subsequent repentance. It is a shame to turn such delicious juice into such sour wine as they make in Tuscany. I tasted a sip or two of a flask which the contadini sent us for trial,-- the rich result of the process I had witnessed in the barrel. It took me altogether by surprise; for I remembered the nectareousness of the new cider which I used to sip through a straw in my boyhood, and I never doubted that this would be as dulcet, but finer and more ethereal; as much more delectable, in short, as these grapes are better than puckery cider apples. Positively, I never tasted anything so detestable, such a sour and bitter juice, still lukewarm with fermentation; it was a wail of woe, squeezed out of the wine-press of tribulation, and the more a man drinks of such, the sorrier he will be.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cider-making</b> {{was then}} an {{unpredictable}} activity, the natural fermentation process being achieved by yeast contained within apples; {{meant that the}} cider often became sour. It was a college friend of Fred's, Dr Herbert Durham, who, in the 1890s, isolated a wild yeast to create the first pure cider yeast culture, which would ensure that fermentations were consistent.

50|$|The {{challenge}} in the game comes almost completely {{in the form of}} natural obstacles in the cider factory.

Various <b>cider-making</b> instruments operate periodically to make the apples into cider. The entire factory is completely oblivious to the presence of the spider.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cider-making</b> {{takes place}} in {{numerous}} countries and regions. As with the cider itself, the various techniques used in milling and pressing the apples vary with each <b>cider-making</b> tradition. In most traditions, cider milling traditionally {{takes place in}} two stages: first, milling or grinding the apples into a pulpy mass called pulp, and a second stage, pressing the pulp to release the juice or [...] "must". The remaining solids after juice extraction is [...] "pomace" [...] or [...] "pommage".|$|E

50|$|The Channel Islands {{once had}} a strong <b>cider-making</b> {{tradition}} likely {{largely due to the}} cultural and linguistic ties it had with the Normandy region of France. Cider had been produced in the area since the Middle Ages, but production increased dramatically in the 16th century when commercial opportunities offered by cider exports spurred the transformation of feudal open-field agriculture to enclosure. By 1673, apple growing became so popular that the States of Jersey had to introduce legislation to keep farmers from growing them: the King forbade the Channel Islands from planting any more unless they had an orchard already extant because he was losing money on the tithes he normally collected. Late 18th and early 19th century accounts suggest the island of Jersey was breeding its own indigenous apples for cider making, apples with names like Noir Binet, Petit Jean, Limon, Pepin Jacob, Carré, Bretagne and de France and the islands's proximity to Brittany and Normandy encouraged the migration of seasonal workers just to pick them all, and cider was often part of their payment.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is unknown}} when the Gaymer family started selling cider. An {{advertisement}} in 1875 describes {{them as being}} “established upwards of two centuries”, one of 1883 “established nearly two centuries”, a 1961 newspaper report talks of “more than 300 years” and a modern bar towel has the phrase “established 1770” on it. One source states that in 1784 Robert Gaymer moved with his family from Starston to Banham (both are places in Norfolk), where he farmed “and produced the first identifiable Gaymer cider”. His son John, “Long” John as he was known, due to his height of 6 ft. 10½in., continued the <b>cider-making,</b> and indeed an advertisement from “The Bury and Norwich Post” of 26 May 1800 states that he had inherited the trade secrets of his father-in-law Joseph Chapman which were “the result of {{the last ten years}} practice and experience” and that “The cydermaking business is carried on by the said John Gaymer at Banham aforesaid, by whom all orders will be thankfully received, and readily executed”.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{influence}} of <b>cider-making</b> technology (pneumatic and traditional pressing) on the dynamics of wild yeast populations. Yeast colonies isolated from apple juice before and throughout fermentation at a cider cellar of Asturias (Spain), during two consecutive years were studied. The yeast strains were identified by {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis of the 5. 8 S rRNA gene and the two flanking internal transcribed sequences (ITS). The musts obtained by pneumatic pressing were dominated by non- Saccharomyces yeasts (Hanseniaspora genus and Metschnikowia pulcherrima) whereas in the apple juices obtained by traditional pressing Saccharomyces together with non-Saccharomyces, were always present. The species Saccharomyces present were S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus. Apparently S. bayanus, was the predominant species at the beginning and the middle fermentation steps of the fermentation process, reaching a percentage of isolation between 33 % and 41 %, whereas S. cerevisiae took over the process {{in the final stages of}} fermentation. During the 2001 harvest, with independence of <b>cider-making</b> technology, the species Hanseniaspora valbyensis was always isolated at the end of fermentations...|$|E
40|$|A pilot-scale {{model for}} {{controlled}} fermentation in <b>cider-making</b> is described.

Controlled cider fermentations were carried out by means of sequential inoculation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Leuconostoc oenos. It was observed that there are significant differences in fatty acid composition depending on the fermentation process employed. The contents in fatty acids of ciders elaborated by a conventional process were higher than those of ciders obtained by controlled fermentation. The use of principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) and partial least squares (PLS) in conjunction with the fatty acid composition allowed the authors to typify fermented apple products {{on the basis of the}} fermented technology. The most relevant variables for classification purposes were lauric and palmitic acids...|$|E

40|$|Seventeen {{phenolic}} compounds in 23 English apple ciders {{were identified and}} quantified by HPLC-PDA-MS 2. The total phenolic content of the ciders varied greatly ranging from 44 to 1559 mg/L. Four groups of compounds were identified, flavan- 3 -ols, hydroxycinnamates, flavonols, and dihydrochalcones. Hydroxycinnamates were the predominant group of phenolics {{in the majority of}} the ciders. Procyanidins were analyzed by HPLC after thiolysis, and total procyanidin content ranged from 8 to 722 mg/L and an average degree of polymerization of 2. 5 – 3. 5. This investigation {{of a wide range of}} ciders has shown a substantial variation in the profile and quantity of the phenolics.

The two hybrid strains had completely different restriction patterns of mitochondrial DNA as well as different sequences of the OLI 1 gene. The sequence of the OLI 1 gene from the wine hybrid strain appeared to be {{the same as that of}} the S. cerevisiae gene, whereas the OLI 1 gene of the cider hybrid strain is equally divergent from both putative parents, S. bayanus and S. cerevisiae.

40|$|Eleven {{different}} {{cider apple}} pomaces (six single-cultivar and five from the <b>cider-making</b> industry) have been analysed for low molecular phenolic profiles and antioxidant capacity. The Folin index ranged between 2. 3 and 15. 1 g gallic acid per kg of dry matter. Major phenols were flavanols, dihydrochalcones (phloridzin and phloretin- 2 ′-xyloglucoside), flavonols and cinnamic acids (chlorogenic and caffeic acids). The group of single-cultivar pomaces had higher contents of chlorogenic acid, (-) -epicatechin, procyanidin B 2 and dihydrochalcones, whereas the industrial samples presented higher amounts {{of up to}} four unknown compounds, with absorption maxima between 256 and 284 nm.

30|$|Apple {{proliferation}} symptoms {{have also}} been frequently observed {{in the last decade}} in apple orchards in Asturias, in the North coast of Spain. This region has long tradition in <b>cider-making,</b> and most of the 10, 000  ha of apple orchards are cultivated almost exclusively to produce cider-apples. The majority of the surface devoted to apple production is occupied by traditional extensive orchards with big trees grown on seedling rootstocks. Since the early 1990 s, an increasing percentage of these old orchards have been substituted by new semi-intensive ones with trees growing on semi-dwarfing rootstocks (Dapena et al. 2005). Those orchards are planted with selected local cultivars tolerant to several common apple diseases (scab, canker, powdery mildew). The use of pesticide in both situations is very low, even null. Sprays are mainly made with narrow-spectrum insecticides against the codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) or the rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea Passerini). Such situation of low pressure of pesticide use potentially allows high abundance and diversity of insects in orchards (Miñarro et al. 2005, 2009). The immersion of those orchards in an agricultural landscape characterized by a mosaic of small and different-land-use plots separated by hedgerows, as well as the occurrence of a permanent rich floral groundcover, also favour insect abundance and richness (Miñarro and Prida 2013; Rosa García and Miñarro 2014).|$|E
40|$|The {{flow cytometry}} (FC) {{technique}} used with certain fluorescent dyes (ChemChrome V 6 [CV 6], DRAQ 5, and PI) has proven useful to label and to detect different physiological states of yeast and malolactic bacterium starters conducting cider fermentation over time (by performing sequential inoculation of microorganisms). First, the technique was tested with pure cultures of {{both types of}} microorganisms grown in synthetic media under different induced stress conditions. Metabolically active cells detected by FC and by the standard plate-counting method for both types of microorganisms in fresh overnight pure cultures gave good correlations between the two techniques in samples taken at this stage.

A small number of studies have applied the FC technique to analyze fermentation processes and mixed cultures over time. The results were used to postulate equations explaining the different physiological states in cell populations taken from fresh, pure overnight cultures under nonstress conditions or cells subjected to stress conditions over time, either under a pure-culture fermentation process (in this work, corresponding to alcoholic fermentation) or under mixed-fermentation conditions (for the malolactic-fermentation phase), that could be useful to improve the control of the processes...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To analyse {{the genetic}} {{diversity}} and {{the dynamics of}} Saccharomyces strains in spontaneous fermentation in ciders. The effect of the cellar, harvest and <b>cider-making</b> technology were evaluated. Methods and Results: The ecology of spontaneous cider fermentations in the same cellar (Asturias) was studied for two consecutive harvests (2000 and 2001) by using mtDNA restriction analysis. Our results showed {{that there was a}} succession of genetically different strains of Saccharomyces during cider production. In general, strains of Saccharomyces bayanus species predominated at the early fermentation steps (begining and ⁄ or tumultuous fermentations), while Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts were the most abundant {{at the end of the}} fermentation. Five S. bayanus strains (patterns III, VII, VIII, XV and XVII) were present at significant frequencies in all the experimental tanks during the two consecutive years. The results of the cluster analysis (unweighted pair group method using average linkage) showed higher similarities for the patterns III, XV, VII and VIII. Therefore, these strains should be considered associated with the microbiota of this cellar. Conclusions: A high polymorphism within populations of Saccharomyces was found throughout the different stages of Asturian production of cider. In all the cider fermentations, a variable number of S. bayanus and S. cerevisiae strains was always present. Our results indicate, over the period of time studied, the existence of the natural microbiota in the cellar. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study has allowed us to gain a better understanding of the role of wild Saccharomyces yeast in Asturian cider fermentations...|$|E
