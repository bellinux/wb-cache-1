25|$|The {{concept that}} video games are {{a form of}} art {{is one that has}} begun to gain force in the later half of the 2000s with the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts {{recognizing}} games as a form of art in May 2011, for example. In viewing video games as cultural artifacts and the industry as a cultural industry, the disenfranchisement of women from the medium is regarded as negatively impacting the female voice in the industry and the woman's capacity {{to take part in the}} <b>cultural</b> <b>dialogue</b> that gaming inspires. From an education perspective, certain gaming genres particularly lacking in female players such as the first-person shooter game have been shown to increase spatial skills thereby giving advantages to players of the games that are currently skewed along gender lines. Video games have also been determined to provide an easy lead-in to computer literacy for children and correlations have been drawn between male video gaming and the predominance of male workers within the computer industry. With the increasing importance of tech jobs in the 21st century and the increased role of online networking, the lack of female video game players suggests a loss of future career opportunities for women.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} near-universal {{reliance}} upon Hofstede's cultural dimensions as the theory base for culturally related accounting research. Given the criticisms {{that have been}} raised in respect of Hofstede this paper proposes Mary Douglas's cultural theory as a more appropriate theory base for future research. Central to Douglasian cultural theory is the notion of <b>cultural</b> <b>dialogues</b> which proposes that within any community four solidarities will be present and in constant competition. The paper identifies <b>cultural</b> <b>dialogues</b> through an analysis of comments letters submitted to the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in response to their ‘complexity of corporate reporting’ discussion paper. To understand how a particular solution has been arrived at when an accounting or auditing issue is reviewed, the debates that precede the outcome need unscrambling by reference to <b>cultural</b> <b>dialogues</b> and the analysis of the comments letters reveals the voices of the different solidarities as they seek to persuade others of the validity of their way of life. The paper proposes a clumsy solutions approach is appropriate for resolving debates on accounting and auditing issues. This approach recognises that, because the solutions offered up by each culture have limitations, all four voices need to be heard in any debate...|$|R

500|$|Much {{critical}} commentary about Tzara {{surrounds the}} measure {{to which the}} poet identified with the national cultures which he represented. Paul Cernat notes that the association between Samyro and the Jancos, who were Jews, and their ethnic Romanian colleagues, was one sign of a <b>cultural</b> <b>dialogue,</b> in which [...] "the openness of Romanian environments toward artistic modernity" [...] was stimulated by [...] "young emancipated Jewish writers." [...] Salomon Schulman, a Swedish researcher of Yiddish literature, argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and Hasidic philosophy shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular, while American poet Andrei Codrescu speaks of Tzara as one in a Balkan line of [...] "absurdist writing", which also includes the Romanians Urmuz, Eugène Ionesco and Emil Cioran. According to literary historian George Călinescu, Samyro's early poems deal with [...] "the voluptuousness over the strong scents of rural life, which is typical among Jews compressed into ghettos." ...|$|E

2500|$|The system's {{nationalist}} traits {{grew and}} progressively blended with North Korean Juche and Maoist ideals. In 1971, the Party, {{which had already}} been completely purged of internal opposition (with {{the possible exception of}} Gheorghe Gaston Marin), approved the July Theses, expressing Ceaușescu's disdain of Western models as a whole, and the reevaluation of the recent liberalisation as bourgeois. The 1974 XIth Party Congress tightened the Party's grip on Romanian culture, guiding it towards Ceaușescu's nationalist principles. Notably, it demanded that Romanian historians refer to Dacians as having [...] "an unorganised State", part of a political continuum that culminated in the Socialist Republic. The government continued its <b>cultural</b> <b>dialogue</b> with ancient forms, with Ceaușescu connecting his cult of personality to figures such as Mircea cel Bătrân (lit. [...] "Mircea the Elder", whom he styled [...] "Mircea the Great") and Mihai Viteazul (Michael the Brave). It also started adding Dacian or Roman versions to the names of cities and towns (Drobeta to Turnu Severin, Napoca to Cluj). Although Ceaușescu maintained an independent, [...] "national Communist" [...] course, his absolute control over the country led many non-Romanian observers to describe his rule as one of the closest things to an old-style Stalinist regime. The last edition of the Country Study on Romania, for instance, referred to the PCR's [...] "Stalinist repression of individual liberties." [...] A new generation of committed supporters on the outside confirmed the administration's character. Ceaușescu probably never emphasized that his policies constituted a paradigm for theorists of National Bolshevism such as Jean-François Thiriart, but there was a publicised connection between him and Iosif Constantin Drăgan, an Iron Guardist Romanian-Italian émigré millionaire (Drăgan was already committed to a Dacian Protochronism that largely echoed the official cultural policy).|$|E

40|$|The seven {{publications}} comprising this PhD by publication employ neo-Durkheimian institutional theory (NDIT) {{to examine}} the relationship between the concept of culture and accounting practice. The primary focus of all the publications is on the dynamics of <b>cultural</b> <b>dialogues</b> (as defined in NDIT) and cultural change, and the publications contribute to accounting research in the areas of: audit failure, the financial crisis, developments in management accounting post- 1980, financialization, risk disclosure, and accounting regulation. The contributions of three of the publications contributions derive from identifying the impact that a shift to a dominant individualistic solidarity has upon the (in) effectiveness of Arthur Andersen as the Enron auditor, the behaviours of key actors in the 2007 - 8 financial crisis, and the development of strategic management accounting post- 1980. The fourth publication contributes by employing NDIT to explain cross-country variations in experiences of financialization. The fifth publication contributes to a new understanding of risk disclosures by demonstrating it is possible to trace through from patterns of social relations to risk management strategies and risk disclosures. The final two publications contribute to debates regarding the development of regulation by evidencing that accounting regulation is not subject to regulatory capture but rather to regulatory self-capture. Prior accounting-culture studies have depended heavily upon Hofstede’s cultural dimensions as the theory base and this is problematic as his work has been subject to important criticisms. NDIT, unlike Hofstede, does not assume nations are culturally homogenous and static. There has been little use made of NDIT in prior accounting research and, in addition to the aforementioned contributions, the publications also demonstrate the efficacy of the theory for undertaking nuanced analyses of the four solidarities by reference to patterns of social relations and for explaining the dynamics of cultural change via the notion of <b>cultural</b> <b>dialogues.</b> ...|$|R

For all the diversity of translingual trajectories these 5 texts represent, there are conspicuous parallels between their accounts of speaking in a 'minority voice'. My focus is on experiences of involuntary dissent, a form of ambivalent group membership, which constitutes a significant and critically overlooked aspect of translingual identity...|$|R
