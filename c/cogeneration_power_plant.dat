50|$|In {{thermal power}} stations, {{mechanical}} power {{is produced by}} a heat engine that transforms thermal energy, often from combustion of a fuel, into rotational energy. Most thermal power stations produce steam, so they are sometimes called steam power stations. Not all thermal energy can be transformed into mechanical power, according to the second law of thermodynamics; therefore, there is always heat lost to the environment. If this loss is employed as useful heat, for industrial processes or district heating, the power plant {{is referred to as}} a <b>cogeneration</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> or CHP (combined heat-and-power) plant.

40|$|This work details a novel {{method for}} {{assessing}} {{the performance of a}} PI (proportional-integral) feedback controller when the process displays non-self-regulating dynamic behavior. By applying an intuitive process control-based pattern recognition method to the autocorrelation function of the process measurement signal, the controller's disturbance rejection performance can automatically be categorized. Stochastic data collected over days or weeks is analyzed to compute an index descriptive of current controller performance. If the control response has drifted from a user-defined target value, the analysis further provides a guide for tuning adjustments to restore desired performance. Significant aspects of this approach are that no plant disruption or process knowledge is required for evaluation. Classic examples of non-self-regulating behavior include certain liquid level control loops and pressure control loops which are prevalent in <b>cogeneration</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> In this work, we detail how the performance assessment method was used to improve performance of such controllers in the University of Connecticut's <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> Controller performance assessment Integrating process Boiler level control Cogeneration...|$|R
