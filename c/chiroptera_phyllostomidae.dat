40|$|Two {{new species}} of yellow-shouldered bats Sturnira Gray, 1842 (<b>Chiroptera,</b> <b>Phyllostomidae)</b> from Central America and western South America are {{described}} using molecular and morphological data. The two new species, which occur in Costa Rica and Panama and in western Ecuador, were previously confused with S. ludovici, and S. lilium and S. luisi, respectively. Sturnira now includes 22 described species, making it the most speciose genus in the Neotropical family Phyllostomidae...|$|E

Niceforo's large-eared bat Trinycteris nicefori (<b>Chiroptera,</b> <b>Phyllostomidae)</b> is documented {{for the first}} time for Mexico, providing the northwestern most locality for the species. A new Belizean locality also is reported and constitutes the northernmost record. The dark Mexican shrew Cryptotis griseoventris (Soricomorpha, Soricidae) has been reported previously from the highlands from Chiapas, in coniferous forest at elevations above 2, 100...|$|E
40|$|A {{new species}} of Chiroderma Peters, 1860 (<b>Chiroptera,</b> <b>Phyllostomidae)</b> from the State of Piauí in Northeastern Brazil is {{described}} based on mensural analysis, morphological data and geographical distribution. It is most similar morphologically to C. doriae Thomas, 1891 but differentiated by a smaller body size and by differences in cranial traits. In comparison to {{other members of the}} genus, the new species can be distinguished by a combination of characters, including size of the body, conspicuousness of facial and median dorsal stripes, ear length, and variation in cranial and dentition traits...|$|E

50|$|The Ipanema bat (Pygoderma bilabiatum), is a bat {{species of}} order <b>Chiroptera</b> and family <b>Phyllostomidae.</b> It {{is found in}} South America, {{specifically}} in northern Argentina, Bolivia, southeastern Brazil and Paraguay. It is monotypic within its genus.|$|R
50|$|The little {{big-eared bat}} (Micronycteris megalotis) is a bat {{species in the}} order <b>Chiroptera</b> and family <b>Phyllostomidae.</b> It is from South and Central America {{particularly}} Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, Suriname and Trinidad. Though its exact population is unknown, it is considered widespread and occurs in protected areas, although its minor threats may be deforestation, but nonetheless is classified Least Concern. It is found in multistratal evergreen forests and dry thorn forests and forages near streams and is found hollow trees, logs, caverns, or houses with groups up to twelve. The head and body length measures at 43.8 mm for males and 44.6 for females and males usually weigh about 5 g while females weigh 5.7 g.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied a}} colony of Anoura geoffroyi (<b>Chiroptera,</b> <b>Phyllostomidae)</b> in a cerrado area near Brasilia, DF, central Brazil. The bats were netted {{at the mouth of}} a cave during 15 nights between May 1992 and May 1993. This species {{presented}} a seasonally monestrous reproductive pattern. Births occurred {{at the beginning of the}} dry season, and the lactation period was synchronous with the flowering of two species of Pseudobombax (Bombacaceae). The sex ratio of adults was female biased during most of the year, but for young and juveniles it was 1 : 1. Young A. geoffroyi started flying alone with 50 - 60 % of body mass and 90 % of forearm length of the mother. The forearm length increased faster than weight, enabling the bats to start flying alone as soon as possible...|$|E
40|$|To {{establish}} a technique which minimized {{the effects of}} fixation on the extraction of DNA from formalin-fixed tissues preserved in scientific collections we extracted DNA samples from fixed tissues using different methods and evaluated {{the effect of the}} different procedures on PCR and sequencing analysis. We investigated muscle and liver tissues from museum specimens of five species of fruit-eating (frugivorous) bats of the Neotropical genus Artibeus (<b>Chiroptera,</b> <b>Phyllostomidae)</b> : A. fimbriatus, A. lituratus, A. jamaicensis, A. obscurus, and A. planirostris. The results indicated that treatment of tissues in buffered solutions at neutral pH and about 37 °C for at least four days improves {{the quality and quantity of}} extracted DNA and the quality of the amplification and sequencing products. However, the comparison between the performance of DNA obtained from fixed and fresh tissues showed that, in spite of the fact that both types of tissue generate reliable sequences for use in phylogenetic analyses, DNA samples from fixed tissues presented a larger rate of errors in the different stages of the study. These results suggest that DNA extracted from formalin-fixed tissue can be used in molecular studies of Neotropical Artibeus bats and that our methodology may be applicable to other animal groups...|$|E
40|$|Izecksohn et al. (1999) {{described}} a new leaf-nosed frog species, originally named Proceratophrys phyllostomus, from north of Castelinho (20 ° 32 ’S, 41 ° 00 ’W), Municipality of Vargem Alta (Castelinho was considered {{belonging to the}} Municipality of Cachoeiro do Itapemirim in the original description), State of Espírito Santo, Brazil (Prado and Pombal 2008). The name of the species was originally treated as a substantive, phyllostomus, being {{the name of the}} type-genus of a family of bats which gathers species having a conspicuous rostral leaf-like appendage (Izecksohn et al. 1999). Actually, the genus Phyllostomus Lacépède, 1799 (Mammalia, <b>Chiroptera,</b> <b>Phyllostomidae)</b> is masculine in gender and congregates four species of the so called “Spear-nosed bats ” (Simmons 2005). This name, when utilized as specific epithet by Izecksohn et al. (1999), was clearly treated as a substantive in apposition to the genus name Proceratophrys, feminine in gender. In the version 2. 21 (15 July 2002), no longer available on-line, of his influential catalogue of the amphibian species of the world, D. R. Frost misinterpreted that specific epithet as an adjective and, coerently, made the correction of its gender, establishing the combination Proceratophrys phyllostoma. This combination was maintained in the posterior versions, including in the current one (see Frost 2011). However, as a substantive masculine noun in apposition, even thought the genus name as feminine, the specific epithet do not change from masculine. In view of this, the correct spelling for the species described by Izecksohn et al. (1999) is actually Proceratophrys phyllostomus, as originall...|$|E
40|$|Bone tissue has {{different}} models of vascularization, cellular distribution, mineralization and remodeling among mammals species. A variety of dietary habits {{associated with the}} mode of locomotion and habitat required from bats the establishment of different flying styles and some skeletal adaptations. This study aimed at examining the microscopic characteristics of mature bone tissue of Glossophaga soricina (<b>Phyllostomidae,</b> <b>Chiroptera).</b> Twelve animals of both genders were used, in which the right humerus were dissected, weighed, decalcified and submitted to routine histological processing. Semi-serial cuts of 5 micrometers were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H. E.), picrosirius red and silver nitrate 50 %. The histological preparations were subjected to histological and histomorphometric analysis. Lacunae density was significantly higher in humerus of females when compared to males (33. 96 x 27. 80, p = 0. 02). Microscopic analysis indicated the presence of parallel collagen fibers distributed in the bone matrix. Lacunes presented various shapes and canaliculi are well distributed and individualized. Few Havers systems and canals were observed. The mature bone tissue of the humerus Glossophaga soricina share microscopic features with other mammals, however, differences in the structural organization are peculiar to this species...|$|R
40|$|Chrotopterus auritus (Peters, 1856) (<b>Phyllostomidae,</b> <b>Chiroptera)</b> is {{the only}} species of {{carnivorous}} bat recorded in Rio Grande do Sul state. In this work we identified the diet items and observed their spatial distribution within roosting sites at daytime. We monitored seven caves, every fifteen days, from may/ 2002 to april/ 2003, in Machadinho and Barracão counties, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. The diet was inferred from fecal samples (n= 67) and food remains (n= 63). Mammals, birds and arthropods, composed the diet of the C. auritus. C. auritus did not show preference by food items, such as mammals, birds or arthropods, {{because there were no}} significant differences among them in fecal samples. The result was similar when comparing the presence of these items between seasons. Rodents, Passeriformes and Coleopterans were the prevailing items in the diet of the C. auritus. Fruits were consumed occasionally, about 5. 9 % of the total of the samples. C. auritus was, during the whole study period, present in the studied caves, varying in number of individuals and shelters. Cohabitation with Desmodus rotundus and Myotis nigricans was observed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In the wild, frugivorous and {{nectarivorous}} bats often eat fermenting {{fruits and}} nectar, and thus may consume levels of ethanol that could induce inebriation. To understand if consumption of ethanol by bats alters {{their access to}} food and general survival requires examination of behavioural responses to its ingestion, as well as assessment of interspecific variation in those responses. We predicted that bats fed ethanol would show impaired flight and echolocation behaviour compared to bats fed control sugar water, and {{that there would be}} behavioural differences among species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We fed wild caught Artibeus jamaicensis, A. lituratus, A. phaeotis, Carollia sowelli, Glossophaga soricina, and Sturnira lilium (<b>Chiroptera,</b> <b>Phyllostomidae)</b> sugar water (44 g of table sugar in 500 ml of water) or sugar water with ethanol before challenging them to fly through an obstacle course while we simultaneously recorded their echolocation calls. We used bat saliva, a non-invasive proxy, to measure blood ethanol concentrations ranging from 0 to > 0. 3 % immediately before flight trials. Flight performance and echolocation behaviour were not significantly affected by consumption of ethanol, but species differed in their blood alcohol concentrations after consuming it. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The bats we studied display a tolerance for ethanol that could have ramifications for the adaptive radiation of frugivorous and nectarivorous bats by allowing them to use ephemeral food resources over a wide span of time. By sampling across phyllostomid genera, we show that patterns of apparent ethanol tolerance in New World bats are broad, and thus may have been an important early step in the evolution of frugivory and nectarivory in these animals...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made on the {{geographical}} distribution and comparative external and cranial morphological analysis of Artibeus lituratus Olfers, 1818 and Artibeus fimbriatus Gray, 1838 (<b>Chiroptera,</b> <b>Phyllostomidae)</b> {{in the state of}} Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. A. lituratus and A. fimbriatus were found to be sympatric in the state north to the "Planície Costeira", in the "Depressão Central", in the hillsides of "Serra Geral", and in the northern region of the state, areas previously covered by forests. The southernmost point for Artibeus Leach, 1821 distribution is 30 º South, and A. lituratus and A. fimbriatus are the two species found more to the south. The two species studied do not show sexual dimorphism as to external characteristics. Cranial measurements revealed significant differences between males and females of A. lituratus in mandible length, which was significantly larger in females(p< 5 %), and between males and females of A. fimbriatus, in the length of the set of lower teeth and in the external width between the cingula of canine teeth, which were significantly larger in males (p< 5 %). No further morphological cranial differences were found between genders of both species. A. lituratus and A. fimbriatus can be externally distinguished by size, for A. lituratus is larger than A. fimbriatus as concerns all external dimensions analysed except for the tibia length (p< 5 %). The two species can also be differentiated by pelage colour, hair length, and facial stripes appearance. In the skull, a number of differences were found in rostrum format, in the developmental degree of supraorbital and post-orbital crests and pre-orbital and post-orbital processes, and in several cranial dimensions analysed...|$|E
