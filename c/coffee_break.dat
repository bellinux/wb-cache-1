This paper addresses the problem of interpreting social activity from human-human interactions captured by mobile sensing net-works. Our first goal is to discover different social activities such as chatting with friends from human-human interaction logs and then characterize them by the set of people involved, time and location of the occurring event. Our second goal is to perform automatic la-beling of the discovered activities using predefined semantic labels such as <b>coffee</b> <b>breaks,</b> weekly meetings, or random discussions. Our analysis was conducted on interaction networks sensed with Bluetooth and infrared sensors by about fifty subjects who carried sociometric badges over 6 weeks.
