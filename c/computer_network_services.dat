In a constraint satisfaction model of a diagnosis problem, the constraints capture the structure and behavior of the system to be modeled, and represent relations among the attributes of the system components. The system is found faulty if some constraints can not be satisfied; therefore the violated constraints are precise indicators of {{the cause of the}} fault. We formulate the diagnosis problem as a partial constraint satisfaction problem, where the partial solutions stand for the expected diagnoses. More generally, we address the issue of modeling network management problems by applying the constraint satisfaction technology.

To guarantee a effective computer network service we should improve the key quality of service(QoS) of each computer network service.

This text mainly introduces Markov decision process and Markov decision Petri nets. Markov decision processes A basic Markov decision process includes following several factors: (1) A state set S to describe the system’s state. (2) A action set to describe the possible actions of decision maker when they are in state space. Generally speaking, a action set will depend on present situation and can be written as A(s). (3) A income function R(s,s’,a),s,s’∈A,a∈A to describe the system’s income under the affection of decision maker’s action...|$|E
40|$|In {{companies}} environments, it {{is normal}} to exist several systems to ease daily activities. In academic environments, it also happens. However, academic environments {{may be even}} more heterogeneous as there are many specialized activities, such as: restaurant, library, academic processes, administrative processes and <b>computer</b> <b>network</b> <b>services,</b> such as email and network authentication. To maintain the data consistency throughout the systems, all the systems must be integrated. This integration was carried out in the Federal University of Lavras by using Simples Object Access Protocol (SOAP) as communication protocol. The development of a new system (mobile application), it was noticed that SOAP is very CPU-intensive and slow, as mobile devices have constraints such as internet and processing. Thus, a REST-JSON layer to integrate mobile application and the integration architecture was developed, benefiting from all the resources the integration architecture had. By using this new layer, the offer of functions from the integration architecture was also expanded to REST, attending to other applications without having to make big changes in the code. It was measured that the REST-JSON layer consumes around 73 % less data than SOAP. The REST-JSON layer was released, attending to about 5600 installations of the application that requests the integration around 54000 times a day...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{assesses the}} impact of international computer networks on the size and nature of international news windows. It expands on theoretical frameworks of structural news flow, media gatekeepers, ideological state apparatuses, global civil society, and global journalism. It makes valuable contributions to mass communications research by focusing on an entity largely overlooked by the field: computer-mediated communications systems. ^ A content analysis was applied to 2, 500 stories in a one-week sample of international news coverage drawn from print, radio, television, and online media from a Northern country (U. S. A.) and one from the South (Brazil). The study came up with three sets of findings. ^ First, online services enable individual users to access news in forms and types unavailable via traditional media, such as raw feeds of newswires, press releases, calls to activism, reports from non-media organizations, and news digests published on a regular, timely basis. Reportage on the online services constitutes a form of global and human journalism. Second, users had unfiltered access to news {{from a number of}} media and non-media organizations. Thus, subscribers of online services could bypass the gatekeepers of traditional media and access a news window which was larger (especially in coverage of the South), freer of domestic coverage constraints, and more pluralistic. But concerns also arose about intellectual property rights, authenticity of news sources, and ethical use of public forums. ^ Third, the online news material on these <b>computer</b> <b>network</b> <b>services</b> came from more news and information producing organizations based in the North (especially the U. S.) than in the South. The economic and infrastructural disparity between North and South leads to a domination of Northern information sources on such online services. Though these networking organizations, as compared to the traditional media, can better function as ideological apparatuses for international civil society, they largely reflect the views and ideology of Northern civil society. ^ This dissertation identifies recent technological developments like search engines, personalized news services, multimedia publishing, and the global growth of the Internet. The findings of the dissertation can apply to this newly emerging media landscape as well; promising directions for future research are identified. ...|$|E
