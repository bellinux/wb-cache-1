50|$|A {{variety of}} {{coloured}} filters {{in varying degrees}} of intensity are available. Kodak's amber filters, for example, vary from palest yellow ("81C") to deepest amber ("85B"). A photographer chooses which filter to use based {{on the quality of}} the ambient light. <b>Colour</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>meters</b> can read the temperature of the existing lighting conditions and guide the selection of the filter. Clouded sky, for example, requires a paler amber than clear blue sky. If a filter is unavailable, flash is an alternative solution which usually provides enough neutral white light to counter the cast.|$|R
2500|$|Digital {{cameras and}} {{photographic}} software often use <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> in K in edit and setup menus. The simple guide {{is that the}} higher the <b>colour</b> <b>temperature,</b> the more white or blue the image will be.

50|$|Often {{an artist}} {{will want to}} show {{his or her work}} in high <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> light. The reason for this is because a higher <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> will give a more {{accurate}} representation of colours in paintings, photos, etc.|$|R

40|$|We tested {{whether the}} <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> of the {{illumination}} (realised through manipulating the ceiling light) impacted on thermal comfort, {{based on the}} hypothesis that a lower <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> is associated with feeling warmer and a higher <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> with feeling cooler. If confirmed, then light might be a tool for energy-saving through allowing ambient air temperatures to vary over a wider range and hence reducing the need for space heating and cooling.

In Study 2, an observational design was used, where changes in clothing level, interpreted as thermal discomfort responses, were observed (N = 32).

40|$|Background: As {{light-emitting}} diodes {{become more common}} as the light source for low vision aids, the effect of illumination <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> on magnifier reading performance was investigated. Methods: Reading ability (maximum reading speed, critical print size, threshold near visual acuity) using Radner charts and subjective preference was assessed for 107 participants with visual impairment using three stand magnifiers with light emitting diode illumination <b>colour</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 2, 700 K, 4, 500 K and 6, 000 K. The results were compared with distance visual acuity, prescribed magnification, age and {{the primary cause of}} visual impairment. Results: Reading speed, critical print size and near visual acuity were unaffected by illumination <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> (p > 0. 05). Reading metrics decreased with worsening acuity and higher levels of prescribed magnification but acuity was unaffected by age. Each <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> was preferred and disliked by a similar number of patients and was unrelated to distance visual acuity, prescribed magnification and age (p > 0. 05). Patients had better near acuity (p = 0. 002), critical print size (p = 0. 034) and maximum reading speed (p < 0. 001), and the improvement in near from distance acuity was greater (p = 0. 004) with their preferred rather than least-liked <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> illumination. Conclusion: A range of <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> illuminations should be offered to all visually impaired individuals prescribed with an optical magnifier for near tasks to optimise subjective and objective benefits...|$|R
