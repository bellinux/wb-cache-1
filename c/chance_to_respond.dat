5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying {{that the lack of}} education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E

The Redskins then {{extended}} their lead, 10–0, driving 60 yards to quarterback Jay Schroeder's 14-yard touchdown to running back Kelvin Bryant. A key {{play on the}} drive was a controversial pass interference penalty against Rams Pro Bowl cornerback LeRoy Irvin, which gave the Redskins 28 yards; 13 from the initial penalty and another 15 against Irvin for arguing with officials about it. LA had a great <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> when quarterback Jim Everett completed a 45-yard pass to Kevin House on the Redskins 28, but the drive ended with no points when Dickerson lost another fumble.|$|E

40|$|A huge {{importer}} of {{food aid}} in the post-independence years, India has rapidly reached selfsufficiency in grain in the late sixties, thanks to a pro-active policy oriented towards grain production in the indo-gangetic plains. However facing the today’s gigantic surpluses of grains, and the worrisome budget deficit {{of the central government}} and the Indian states, India ha come under pressure from various national and international institutions to shift state support from grain production to other productions. For the indo-gangetic plains, current grain basket of India, dairy is considered among the best alternatives. Grain producers of these regions are already the one contributing most, with producers form the North West (Gujarat, Maharastra), to the national dairy production and they are the ones with the better <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the increasing national demand for dairy products. The simulations developed in this study show that there is an important potential for crop livestock integration and that this integration can maintain agricultural incomes; partially compensate the likely reduction of subsidies and contribute to a better management of soil fertility. Whether national production will be able <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the demand in grain from both humans and animals, is a hot debate in India. On one hand, dairy production system is so extensive that production can be increased easily without much additional feeding of grain or concentrates but with cheaper sources of forages. On the other hand, the rapidly increasing poultry industry depends heavily upon maize, which is still a marginal production in India...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Intravenous (iv) {{glucocorticoids}} (GC) (ivGC) and orbital radiotherapy (ORT) {{are commonly}} used in active Graves' orbitopathy (GO), with favorable outcomes in up to 80 % of patients. However, little is known on the factors that may affect GO outcome in the long term, an issue that we investigated here. Methods: We studied retrospectively 96 untreated patients with GO, identified out of 787 consecutive patients who came to our GO Clinic for a follow-up visit between September 2010 and June 2013. After the first observation, patients were treated with ivGC and ORT and were then re-examined after a median period of 55. 5 months. The primary end-point was the possible relation between GO outcome and several individual variables. Results: Exophthalmometry, eyelid aperture, CAS, diplopia and visual acuity (the latter only in patients with an initial reduction) improved significantly after treatment. Overall, 67. 7 % of patients had improved and were considered as responders, whereas the remaining (29. 1 % stable and 4. 5 % worsened) were considered as non-responders. Age, smoking, thyroid volume, thyroid treatment, serum anti-TSH receptor autoantibodies and individual GO features at first observation {{did not affect the}} outcome of GO, which, in contrast, was affected by gender and by the time elapsed between first and last observation. Thus, the prevalence of responders was higher in females (76. 4 vs 48 % in males, P = 0. 02) and the time elapsed between first and last observation was greater in responders (58 vs 39 months in non-responders, P = 0. 02). Whereas the prevalence of responders and non-responders was similar up to 36 months, there was an increase in responders beginning between 37 and 48 months and reaching a peak of ∼ 80 % between 61 and 72 months, to plateau thereafter. Conclusions: Given the limitations of retrospective investigations, our study confirms that the combination of GC and ORT is effective in GO and shows that females have greater <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> treatment. The notorious tendency of GO to improve spontaneously with time most likely contributes the long-term outcome of the eye syndrome...|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{identify}} clinical and/or genetic {{predictors of}} response to several therapies in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS:We included 242 patients with CD (133 females) aged (mean[*]±[*]standard deviation) 39 [*]±[*] 12 years and a disease duration of 12 [*]±[*] 8 years. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) studied were ABCB 1 C 3435 T and G 2677 T/A, IL 23 R G 1142 A, C 2370 A, and G 9 T, CASP 9 C 93 T, Fas G 670 A and LgC 844 T, and ATG 16 L 1 A 898 G. Genotyping was performed with real-time PCR with Taqman probes. RESULTS:Older patients <b>responded</b> better <b>to</b> 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) and to azathioprine (OR 1. 07, p[*]=[*] 0. 003 and OR 1. 03, p[*]=[*] 0. 01, respectively) while younger ones <b>responded</b> better <b>to</b> biologicals (OR 0. 95, p[*]=[*] 0. 06). Previous surgery negatively influenced response to 5 -ASA compounds (OR 0. 25, p[*]=[*] 0. 05), but favoured response to azathioprine (OR 2. 1, p[*]=[*] 0. 04). In respect to genetic predictors, we observed that heterozygotes for ATGL 16 L 1 SNP had a significantly higher <b>chance</b> of <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> corticosteroids (OR 2. 51, p[*]=[*] 0. 04), while homozygotes for Casp 9 C 93 T SNP had a lower <b>chance</b> of <b>responding</b> both <b>to</b> corticosteroids and to azathioprine (OR 0. 23, p[*]=[*] 0. 03 and OR 0. 08, p[*]=[*] 0. 02,).
