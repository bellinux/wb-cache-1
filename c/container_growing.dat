50|$|Biodynamic {{farming is}} an {{approach}} {{based on the}} esoteric teachings of Rudolf Steiner. The Japanese farmer and writer Masanobu Fukuoka invented a no-till system for small-scale grain production that he called Natural Farming. French intensive gardening and biointensive methods and SPIN Farming (Small Plot INtensive) are all small scale gardening techniques. These techniques {{were brought to the}} United States by Alan Chadwick in the 1930s. This method has since been promoted by John Jeavons, Director of Ecology Action. A garden {{is more than just a}} means of providing food, it is a model of what is possible in a community - everyone could have a garden of some kind (<b>container,</b> <b>growing</b> box, raised bed) and produce healthy, nutritious organic food, a farmers market, a place to pass on gardening experience, and a sharing of bounty, promoting a more sustainable way of living that would encourage their local economy. A simple 4' x 8' (32 square feet) raised bed garden based on the principles of bio-intensive planting and square foot gardening uses fewer nutrients and less water, and could keep a family, or community, supplied with an abundance of healthy, nutritious organic greens, while promoting a more sustainable way of living.|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of biodegradable wastes is increasing, {{including the use}} of waste as a source of energy. Anaerobic digestion involves organic-matter decomposition under anoxic conditions by a microbial consortium, obtaining a source of renewable energy (biogas), mainly constituted of a mixture of carbon dioxide (CO 2, 25 – 45 percent), methane (CH 4, 55 – 75 percent), and the digested substrate (digestate). The direct application of digestate into agricultural soils presents several problems. These include agronomic (low concentration of nutrients, high salinity, etc.), economic (cost of transport and handling), and environmental issues (gaseous emissions, nutrient leaching, and pathogen spread). However, it is possible to obtain quality compost from the solid fraction of digestate, and the compost obtained can have good properties for use as <b>container</b> <b>growing</b> medium or for crop production. In this work, an optimized procedure has been developed for composting the solid phase of a digestate obtained from a continuous, anaerobic codigestion of cattle slurry with 84 percent of cattle manure, 7. 4 percent of a mixture of maize/silage, and 8. 6 percent of peach-juice pulp (fresh-mass basis). The experiment was designed to optimize pH, carbon (C) / nitrogen (N) ratio, and moisture values in order to maximize self-heating activity, using Dewar self-heating tests. A factorial optimization of moisture and C/N ratio was carried out. In the best moisture-C/N ratio treatment, pH optimization was also developed. To predict the optimum conditions of the studied residue related to the increase of temperature per dry matter, a multiple correlation analysis based on moisture, C/N ratio, and pH was developed, which explained 80 {{percent of the variance in}} this experiment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The sweet {{passion fruit}} could be {{propagated}} by seeds, cuttings, grafting and micro propagation. Seeds and cuttings propagation, are more usual. Most commercial plants {{are produced by}} seeds, although, these two methods have specific aspects, and choice between them {{will depend on the}} goals and facilities that will be needed to do that. Propagation by seeds will require careful stock choice, because of incompatibility between plants originated from seeds with common stocks. Seeds should be sown immediately after removing from the fruit free of pulp. Besides taking care of productive and phytosanitary aspects, the stocks must be heterogeneous, due to incompatibility problems with future generations. The same purpose must be applied to cuttings stocks that even may need only artificial pollination. The choice of right <b>containers,</b> <b>growing</b> medium, preventive pest and disease management, irrigation system, adequate and cleaned facilities, are important factors that must be taken in consideration for successful quality plant production. 200...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe quality {{attributes}} of dambu-nama, a dried Nigerian meat product were studied for sixteen (16) weeks comparing traditional products and packaging systems with a laboratory product and simple modern packaging. The most optimum processing time, viz cooking and steaming for 60, 90 and 120 min respectively, was determined. The six resulting products {{were subjected to}} a 9 -point hedonic scale and {{results showed that the}} product of cooking for 90 min was the most adequate and acceptable in all organoleptic attributes by the sensory panellists. Process standardization was achieved by optimization of the cooking time and formulation of a standard ingredient mix. Proximate composition of the finished product showed that moisture ranged from 5. 50 % laboratory dambu-nama (LDBN) to 7. 60 % traditional dambu-nama (TDBN), protein from 46. 51 % (LDBN) to 39. 19 % (TDBN), Ash from 5. 76 % (LDBN) to 4. 90 % (TDBN), crude fibre from 0. 015 % (LDBN) to 0. 72 % (TDBN), crude fat from 15. 65 % (LDBN) to 24. 94 % (TDBN), and carbohydrate by difference of 26. 54 % (LDBN) to 22. 64 % (TDBN).

40|$|Template-directed {{replication}} {{is known}} to obey a parabolic growth law due to product inhibition (Sievers & Von Kiedrowski 1994 Nature 369, 221; Lee et al. 1996 Nature 382, 525; Varga & Szathmary 1997 Bull. Math. Biol. 59, 1145). We investigate a template-directed replication with a coupled template catalysed lipid aggregate production {{as a model of}} a minimal protocell and show analytically that the autocatalytic template-container feedback ensures balanced exponential replication kinetics; both the genes and the <b>container</b> <b>grow</b> exponentially with the same exponent. The parabolic gene replication does not limit the protocellular growth, and a detailed stoichiometric control of the individual protocell components is not necessary to ensure a balanced gene-container growth as conjectured by various authors (Ganti 2004 Chemoton theory). Our analysis also suggests that the exponential growth of most modern biological systems emerges from the inherent spatial quality of the container replication process as we show analytically how the internal gene and metabolic kinetics determine the cell population's generation time and not the growth law (Burdett & Kirkwood 1983 J. Theor. Biol. 103, 11 - 20; Novak et al. 1998 Biophys. Chem. 72, 185 - 200; Tyson et al. 2003 Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 15, 221 - 231). Previous extensive replication reaction kinetic studies have mainly focused on template replication and have not included a coupling to metabolic container dynamics (Stadler et al. 2000 Bull. Math. Biol. 62, 1061 - 1086; Stadler & Stadler 2003 Adv. Comp. Syst. 6, 47). The reported results extend these investigations.
