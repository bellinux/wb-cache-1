It was also extended to fiber composites (woven or braided laminates), rock, jointed rock mass, clay, sand, foam and metal. The microplane model has been shown to allow close fits of the concrete test data for uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial loadings with post-peak softening, compression-tension load cycles, opening and mixed mode fractures, tension-shear and compression-shear failures, axial compression followed by torsion (i.e., the vertex effect) and fatigue.

40|$|Abstract. The {{consideration}} {{is given to}} a specific component of the <b>creep</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> which becomes apparent within one day {{from the moment of}} load application, the so called “short-term creep”. Since the entire <b>creep</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> is conditioned by its water content, the short-time creep must be assigned to the most mobile water – capillary water. As far as the capillary water behavior is determined by the capillary forces acting in it, the short-term <b>creep</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> is considered and described in the present work as expression of capillary forces. Such description is based on a modified capillary theory of concrete shrinkage: creep is interpreted as forced shrinkage arising {{due to the fact that}} application of load leads to disturbance of hygrometric equilibrium of concrete and environment. In view of the mentioned creep interpretation as the forced shrinkage the isotropic loading of the body is considered. The purpose of this work is to determine the degree in which the capillary forces are source of the short-term <b>creep</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete...</b>|$|E

By using the 3 D numerical homogenization procedure for viscoelastic microstructures proposed by Šmilauer and Bažant (2010), it is shown that the size distribution and shape of inclusions have no measurable influence on the overall creep behavior. Moreover, a mean-field estimate provides close predictions. An Interfacial Transition Zone was introduced according to the model of Nadeau (2003).

As a result of this work, a mechanism has been proposed within a framework of a seepage-plastic the tensile <b>creep</b> and failure <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> A rheological model has also been suggested to describe this mechanism. The tensile <b>creep</b> <b>of</b> air drying <b>concrete</b> was larger than that expected in compression but smaller when the concrete is stored sealed or under water. The <b>creep</b> <b>of</b> sealed and immersed concrete reached limiting values within two months while that <b>of</b> air drying <b>concrete</b> continued for a much longer tie. in other respects tensile creep behaviour was similar to that in compression. The <b>creep</b> <b>of</b> sealed <b>concrete</b> was about half that <b>of</b> immersed <b>concrete</b> and as low as 0. 1 of that <b>of</b> air drying <b>concrete.</b> A relationship has been obtained between ultimate strength and the period of sustained loading.
