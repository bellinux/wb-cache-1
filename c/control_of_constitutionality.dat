40|$|The {{principle}} of each contemporary democratic society implies division of power into legislative, executive and judicial. If {{there is no}} division into these three branches of power and if preconditions have not been satisfied for judicial power to be independent from the legislative and executive power, that inevitably leads to disrespect {{of human rights and}} freedoms, violation of political freedoms and absence of the rule of law. Independence of judiciary is the principal element for realization of a constitutional parliamentary state, primarily as the guarantor of protection of human, political and minority rights. The usual practice is that a security service in a democratic state has to ask for a court order if it wants to perform monitoring and other investigative procedures against a person or a group of persons. The order is usually pretty concrete concerning particulars with regard to the type of monitoring to be approved, against whom and for how long, as well as what is the legal basis for implementation.

The ECJ states that it is the only body which has the competence to interpret the Community law, but it does not have the competence to interpret the national laws provisions.

The result of the internationalization of national rights is a progressive harmonization of concepts and legal rules. In the current state of international law, constitutions’ internationalization corresponds a concrete impact of international law on constitutional norms. The current trend of constitutions is to regulate in a more accurate and comprehensive way the relations between the state and international law. International law does not require any particular form of the conclusion of international treaties. In intensification of international relations, international conventions and integration of states in international organizations, the Parliament carries important consequences for both on normative function and the control function. Such legislative activity is guided by international treaties concluded by the state. While the executive and the legislative are involved in the development of international law, the jurisdictional power intervenes to reconcile domestic and international legal norms. States do not devote supremacy of international law over their constitution. Because international treaties {{to be part of the}} national legal order is not enough that the procedure for concluding treaties to be respected.

A partir de uma contextualização da jurisdição constitucional brasileira sob a influência de suas principais matrizes históricas, em especial a norte-americana e austríaca, verifica-se que tal fenômeno vem se ampliando na jurisprudência da Corte de modo a desvirtuar o desenho institucional delimitado pelo constituinte.
