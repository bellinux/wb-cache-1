500|$|Cohen and Ken Keeler {{traveled}} to New York {{to work with}} the Beastie Boys for their role. They waited three days for the Beastie Boys to <b>call</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> they were willing to record but eventually gave up and returned to the studios in Los Angeles. The audio tracks were recorded later. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch was unavailable {{at the time of the}} recording so only Adam [...] "King Adrock" [...] Horovitz and Michael [...] "Mike D" [...] Diamond voice themselves in the episode, with Horovitz also voicing Yauch. The Beastie Boys perform three songs in the episode: their 1998 hit single [...] "Intergalactic", [...] "Super Disco Breakin", and a brief a capella version of [...] "Sabotage". It was initially requested that they perform [...] "Fight for Your Right" [...] but they declined. The episode also contains Futuramas first original musical number. The lyrics to [...] "Welcome to Robot Hell" [...] were written by Kaplan and Keeler and the music was written by Keeler and Christopher Tyng. When praised for his performance in the audio commentary, John DiMaggio, the voice of Bender, noted that the most difficult part of the performance was singing in a lower octave rather than keeping up with the song's fast pace.|$|E
500|$|In August 2016, Singer {{said that}} Legion had been {{designed}} {{to fit into the}} X-Men universe, but also to stand alone, so [...] "you wouldn't have to label" [...] the relationship between the series and the films. Hawley explained that because the series is depicting the title character's [...] "subjective reality", it would not have to address any connections to the films straight away, noting that his series Fargo, which is connected to the 1996 film of the same name, at first [...] "had to stand on its own feet" [...] before exploring those connections more; [...] "We have to earn the right {{to be part of this}} universe. My hope is we create something so strong that the people in the movie studio <b>call</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> they would be foolish enough not to connect these things." [...] He did state that [...] "you can't tell this story without" [...] acknowledging that Legion is the son of Charles Xavier, who appears in the films. This acknowledgement comes in [...] "Chapter 7", with the appearance of Xavier's signature wheelchair in one of Haller's memories. Hawley explained that Haller would look to learn more of his father in future seasons, with Xavier potentially making a physical appearance in the series at that point.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Fazekas {{noted that}} the {{producers}} felt [...] "bad" [...] about the chances for a third season due to the series' low viewership, adding she [...] "would love to see it live on, even if it's in some other form, digital or whatever. I doubt that there's a Netflix play for it." [...] She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers {{would find a way}} to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed. On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series. Loeb said he did not understand the decision, as [...] "there were no conversations" [...] regarding the series, with Marvel only receiving a call from ABC saying Agent Carter was canceled. He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, [...] "if someone wants to <b>call</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'We want a two-hour Agent Carter [...] for May 2017,' [...] We'll put together the greatest Agent Carter movie we can.” Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it [...] "a network political thing" [...] since ABC wanted Atwell to headline the more [...] "mainstream" [...] drama Conviction [...] "to get their ratings up" [...] instead of staying on Agent Carter, which Atwell felt had gained a [...] "cult following". After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated the streaming service passed on reviving Agent Carter because it is [...] "looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have" [...] original Marvel series. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting [...] "deal complexities" [...] for the series, Netflix would not have been able to air Agent Carter globally, as [...] "Some of those output partners still had it on the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [...] Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{family had}} {{encountered}} {{an incident in}} the past; the family had to delist and change their phone number in Lower Manhattan because fans worldwide were calling their apartment relentlessly. Draper recalls, [...] "Little girls would <b>call</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'Helloooo, is [...] there? We just love him.' The only thing that's comforting is, they're pretty harmless at that age." [...] According to Nat, [...] "After the show came on, people began to really treat us like huge rock stars. They'd scream on the street, and we'd look behind us {{to see what they}} were screaming about, because we didn't realize it was us." ...|$|E

So she wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp corner, she came upon two fat little men, so {{suddenly}} that she could not help starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling sure that they must be.|$|E

6000|$|There now {{remained}} {{only the}} choice of a Road. Saint Augustine dates his own conversion from the day of his turning to the strait Christian orthodoxy. Even the Platonic writings, had he known Greek, would not have satisfied his desire. [...] "For where was that Charity that buildeth upon the foundation of Humility, which is Christ Jesus? [...] . These pages" [...] (of the Platonists) [...] "carried not in them this countenance of piety--the tears of confession, and that sacrifice of Thine which is an afflicted spirit, a contrite and humbled heart, the salvation of Thy people, the Spouse, the City, the pledge of Thy Holy Spirit, the Cup of our Redemption. No man doth there thus express himself. Shall not my soul be subject to God, for of Him is my salvation? For He is my God, and my salvation, my protectour; I shall never be moved. No man doth there once <b>call</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> to him: 'Come unto me all you that labour.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Mrs. Nettlepoint {{is going}} in that ship,' Mrs. Allen had said; and she had {{represented}} that nothing was simpler than to put the girl in her charge. When Mrs. Mavis had replied that that was all very well but that she didn't know the lady, Mrs. Allen had declared that that didn't make a speck of difference, for Mrs. Nettlepoint was kind enough for anything. It was easy enough to know her, if {{that was all the}} trouble. All Mrs. Mavis would have to do would be to go up to her the next morning when she took her daughter to the ship (she would see her there on the deck with her party) and tell her what she wanted. Mrs. Nettlepoint had daughters herself and she would easily understand. Very likely she would even look after Grace a little on the other side, in such a queer situation, going out alone to the gentleman she was engaged to; she would just help her to turn round before she was married. Mr. Porterfield seemed to think they wouldn't wait long, once she was there: they would have it right over at the American consul's. Mrs. Allen had said it would perhaps be better still to go and see Mrs. Nettlepoint beforehand, that day, to tell her what they wanted: then they wouldn't seem to spring it on her just as she was leaving. She herself (Mrs. Allen) would <b>call</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> a word for them if she could save ten minutes before catching her train. If she hadn't come it was because she hadn't saved her ten minutes; but she had made them feel that they must come all the same. Mrs. Mavis liked that better, because on the ship in the morning there would be such a confusion. She didn't think her daughter would be any trouble--conscientiously she didn't. It was just to have some one to speak to her and not sally forth like a servant-girl going to a situation.|$|E
