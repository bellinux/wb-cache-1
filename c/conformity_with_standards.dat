Therefore, Standards Conformity Framework (SCF) containing methods and tools which provide support for application of standards was proposed.

The article describes SCF and shows how it fits into the processes of achieving {{and assessing}} conformity.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we outline a {{software}} development process for safety-critical systems that aims at combining {{some of the}} specific strengths of model-based development with those of programming language based development using safety-critical subsets of Ada. Model-based software development and model-based test case generation techniques are combined with code generation techniques and tools providing a transition from model to code both for a system itself and for its test cases. This allows developers to combine domain-oriented, model-based techniques with source code based validation techniques, as required for <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> {{for the development of}} safety-critical software, such as the avionics standard RTCA/DO- 178 B. We introduce the AutoFocus and Validator modeling and validation toolset and sketch its usage for modeling, test case generation, and code generation in a combined approach, which is further illustrated by a simplified leading edge aerospace model with built-in fault tolerance.

40|$|Background: Health of {{swimming}} pools {{is important to}} maintain health of swimmers that in case of failure to comply of health standards, can be lead to health problems and the transmission of infectious diseases to swimmers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the water quality {{of swimming}} pools in Sanandaj city and compare of their results with the national standards. Methods: In this cross – sectional study, 108 water samples were collected from 9 swimming pools of Sanandaj city. Some parameters including residual chlorine, pH, turbidity, hardness, alkalinity, temperature and also microbial parameters such as heterotrophic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, fecal streptococcus, total coliform, and fecal coliform were evaluated. Results: The results of the study showed that residual chlorine, pH, turbidity, hardness, alkalinity, and temperature in 80. 5 %, 72. 2 %, 60. 1 %, 52. 7 %, 30. 5 %, and 100 % of samples, respectively, which were in desirable limit. Also the population of total coliform, fecal coliform, and Staphylococcus aureus in 32. 4 %, 45. 3 %, and 96. 3 % of samples, respectively, were in desirable ranges. Conclusion: Based on the results, turbidity, hardness, alkalinity, and also population of total coliform and fecal coliform of some samples didn’t have <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> that indicates the need for continuous monitoring of swimming pools water quality...|$|E
40|$|It is axiomatic that {{environmental}} controls are expressed as environmental standards, a traditional driver {{of investment in}} pollution control. Environmental standards spur investment in green technologies that promise to stimulate sustainable business models. The institutional framework of environmental standardization is complex; a widely misunderstood political process. A variety of standardization activities have impacted environmental protection historically and are now poised for further growth as green market discipline proliferates. Environmental standardization is a unique fusion of technology design and public policy development involving various constituencies: environmentalists, technologists, legislatures, regulators, standards-setting bodies, upstream suppliers, downstream users, and society’s affected communities. This chapter reviews the role of standardization activities in setting environmental constraints, {{in the development of}} green technologies and in establishing metrics for environmental certification and monitoring. The implications of managing environmental standardization to attract financing for sustainable business models are so significant that disregarding the risks of environmental standardization imperils competitiveness. KEY TERMS & DEFINITIONS ANSI due process requirements- process requirements for standardization activities that prescribe normative goals that control self-interest of the private parties engaged in standards development activities. Anticipatory standards- standards that are developed ex ante to markets that supply products and services compliant with the standard. Antitrust- the U. S. term for anti-monopoly or competition law applicable regulate markets where dominant participants possess market power or coordinated collaboration results in unlawful collusion.
