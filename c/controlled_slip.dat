50|$|WSP is {{generally}} {{fitted as standard}} to new fleets of multiple units. The primary function of the WSP {{is to improve the}} ability of a train to stop in poor adhesion conditions. However, within the rail industry it is also recognised to be valuable in protecting the wheels from damage during sliding when braking or spinning in traction. This improvement is achieved by regulation of the wheelset velocity in a controlled manner so that it maintains a relatively consistent level of slip. The <b>controlled</b> <b>slip</b> has the effect of conditioning the contamination layer on the rail (scrubbing action) thereby improving the level of friction and enhancing the ability of the train to stop. Controlled wheel slip can also have a limited cleaning action on the rail head along the length of a train. This tends to result in the vehicles at the rear having more grip than those at the front.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} novel {{experimental methods}} aimed at understanding the fundamental phenomena governing {{the motion of}} lightweight vehicles on dry, granular soils. A single-wheel test rig is used to empirically investigate wheel motion under controlled wheel slip and loading conditions on sandy, dry soil. Test conditions can be designed to replicate typical field scenarios for lightweight robots, while key operational parameters such as drawbar force, torque, and sinkage are measured. This test rig enables imposition of velocities, or application of loads, to interchangeable running gears within a confined soil bin of dimensions 1. 5 m long, 0. 7 m wide, and 0. 4 m deep. This allows testing of small-scale wheels, tracks, and cone or plate penetrators. Aside from standard wheel experiments (i. e., measurements of drawbar force, applied torque, and sinkage during <b>controlled</b> <b>slip</b> runs) two additional experimental methodologies have been developed. The first relies on high-speed imaging of the wheel-soil interface {{and the use of}} particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure micro-scale terrain kinematics. The second experimental methodology consists of a custom force sensor array located at the wheel-terrain interface. The sensors allow explicit measurement of normal and shear forces (and, therefore, estimation of normal and shear stresses) at numerous discrete points along the wheel-soil interface. Experimental measurements gathered by these test methodologies are to be compared against well-established semi-empirical models, to validate and understand limitations of the models and propose improvements...|$|E

For the evaluation of this system, the whole propulsion system including prime mover, clutches, propeller and ship are numerically simulated using the precise mathematical model described here. From several accelerating and decelerating simulations, the following results are pointed out. 1) FPP’s revolution can be easily changed in the slipping zone by using this system, although the main engine is governed constant revolution. 2) Astern and ahead maneuvering is also performed by this system. 3) The mathematical model for this simulation including engine, clutch, propeller and ship is useful for the design and evaluation of the whole propulsion system.

40|$|Frictional melting {{and fluid}} {{pressurization}} {{can play a}} key role in rupture dynamics of large earthquakes. For faulting under frictional stress σ_ƒ, the temperature increases with σ_ƒ and the earthquake magnitude, M_w. If the thickness of the heated zone, w, is of the order of a few mm, then, even for a modest σ_ƒ, the temperature rise, ΔT, would exceed 1000 ° for earthquakes with M_w = 5 to 6, and melting is likely to occur, and reduce friction during faulting. If fluid exists in a fault zone, a modest ΔT of 100 to 200 ° would likely increase the pore pressure enough to significantly reduce friction for earthquakes with M_w = 3 to 4. The microscopic state of stress can be tied to macroscopic seismic parameters such as the seismic moment, M_ 0, and the radiated energy, E_R, by averaging the stresses in the microscopic states. Since the thermal process is important only for large earthquakes, the dynamics of small and large earthquakes can be very different. This difference is reflected in the observed relation between the scaled energy ẽ = E_R/M_ 0 and M_W. The observed ẽ for large earthquakes is 10 to 100 times larger than for small earthquakes. Mature fault zones such as the San Andreas are at relatively moderate stress levels, but the stress in the plate interior can be high. Once slip exceeds a threshold, runaway rupture could occur, and could explain the anomalous magnitude-frequency relationship observed for some mature faults. The thermally <b>controlled</b> <b>slip</b> mechanism would produce a non-linear behavior, and under certain circumstances, the slip behavior at the same location may vary from event to event. Also, slip velocity during a large earthquake could be faster than what one would extrapolate from smaller earthquakes...|$|E
40|$|Shear {{bands in}} a {{volcanic}} conduit are modelled for crystal-rich magma flow using simplified conditions {{to capture the}} fundamental behaviour of a natural system. Our simulations begin with magma crystallinity in equilibrium with an applied pressure field and isothermal conditions. The viscosity of the magma is derived using existing empirical equations and is dependent upon temperature, water content and crystallinity. From these initial conduit conditions we utilize the Finite Element Method, using axi-symmetric coordinates, to simulate shear bands via shear localisation. We use the von Mises visco-plasticity model with constant magma shear strength for a first took into the effects of plasticity. The extent of shear bands in the conduit is explored with a numerical model parameterized with values appropriate for Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat, although the model is generic in nature. Our model simulates shallow (up to approximately 700 in) shear bands that occur within the upper conduit and probably govern the lava extrusion style due to shear boundaries. We also model {{the change in the}} over-pressure field within the conduit for flow with and without shear bands. The pressure change can be as large as several MPa at shallow depths in the conduit, which generates a maximum change in the pressure gradient of 102 ̆ 7 s of kPa/m. The formation of shear bands could therefore provide an alternative or additional mechanism for the inflation/deflation of the volcano flanks as measured by tilt-metres. Shear bands are found to have a significant effect upon the magma ascent rate due to shear-induced flow reducing conduit friction and altering the over-pressure in the upper conduit. Since we do not model frictional <b>controlled</b> <b>slip,</b> only plastic flow, our model calculates the minimum change in extrusion rate due to shear bands. However, extrusion rates can almost double due to the ton nation of shear bands, which may help suppress volatile loss. Due to the paucity of data and large parameter space available for the magma shear strength our model results can only allow for a qualitative comparison to a natural system at this stage.

40|$|The wheel {{rail contact}} {{operates}} in an arduous environment. Damage {{to the surface of}} either component is possible during manufacture, installation, or operation. The question arises as to how tolerant is the railway wheel or section of track to surface indentation or damage. In this work a twin disc simulation has been used to relate the level of surface damage (as well as the way it is generated) to the fatigue life of the surfaces. A related problem is the presence of solid contamination on the track. Sand (applied for improved adhesion) or track ballast material can cause damage to the rail and wheel surfaces. These mechanisms have been explored to assess the effect on contact fatigue life and wear. The disc specimens have been either artificially damaged (with dents and scratches) or run with particles of sand or ballast material. The discs were then loaded and rotated at realistic conditions of contact pressure and <b>controlled</b> <b>slip.</b> For normal operation of the contact, either dry or with water lubrication, surface dents and scratches have little effect on fatigue life. The normal plastic flow in the rail surface layer acts to close up dents. The failure of the disc is then by fatigue cracking across the whole surface with no particular preference to the dent location. Alternatively, if the contact is lubricated with oil then this plastic flow is greatly reduced and the dents act as stress raisers and fatigue cracks initiate from their trailing edge. Sand or ballast particles are crushed as they enter the wheel/rail contact. The fragments indent the surfaces and rapidly roughen the contact faces. The surface indentation is relatively minor, but the presence of particles increases the level of traction (over the wet case) and promotes further surface plastic flow. This can reduce the residual fatigue life of the contact. Further, high concentrations of sand were shown to promote a low cycle fatigue process that caused very high wear by the spallation of material. The twin disc simulations have shown that, under conditions similar to that of wheel/rail operation, surface damage is not a primary cause of fatigue failure. However, wear is greatly accelerated by the presence of solid contaminants and some evidence of a low cycle fatigue process was observed for sanded contacts...|$|E

40|$|In 1992 the Haldex group bought Sigvard Johansson’s patent from 1988. The {{original}} design {{is based on}} a rotational speed difference dependent pump that creates a hydraulic pressure to engage the clutch that locks up the rotational difference. From the originally rather simple solution this has developed to gain in controllability and engagement speed to become a market leading system. The traction division of the Haldex group was recently sold to BorgWarner. When designing a four wheel drive system in a car the goal is to get the desired speed on all four wheels. For example, when cornering on pavement the requested speed of the rear wheels is lower than the speed of the front wheels, which requires the coupling between the differentials to allow speed differences. When trying to maintain a <b>controlled</b> <b>slip</b> during specific conditions vibrations may occur. The goal is to foresee when this will happen, create greater understanding and possibilities to avoid them. In later years the benefits with simulation has become more and more obvious, what to expect from a physical system and when to expect it. This {{is one of the major}} differences between high-end products and those built in a shed. The goals of this thesis are to •Create a dynamics model of the drive train. •Verify the simulated results and improve the simulation based on the testing results. •Make it possible to foresee when dynamic problems will occur and how to avoid them. A simplified model of the drive train was created in Simulink. Parts like drive shafts are assumed to be constant torsion beams and other components stiff; moment of inertia and damping were measured and taken in consideration. Friction models with various lubricants were created and implemented into the simulation. Both simulation and verification in testing rig were performed with data and driving case taken from a real car. The driving case was also used in a testing rig in order to verify the results and improve the simulation model. To be able to compare results from both methods the simulation was modified to the configuration of the rig. Thermal and friction models have been confirmed in rig testing and vibrations in the drive train have been linked to variations in sliding velocity. However when simulating a complex system, like the drive train of a car, there are lots of factors that affects vibrations, neither does rig testing with the very same setup give the same result every time. The simulation time is a big success since it takes less than a minute to simulate a simple drive case and if the user has an overview of the programming changes can be made easily without complications or error messages. The simulation instrument can be used to initially evaluate a new drive train setup or new friction characteristics of a friction system. Validerat; 20110524 (anonymous...|$|E
