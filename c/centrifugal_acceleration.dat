25|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>acceleration</b> {{is used to}} {{separate}} the outer hull from the inner oat groat. Oats are fed by gravity onto the centre of a horizontally spinning stone, which accelerates them towards the outer ring. Groats and hulls are separated on impact with this ring.

Oat hulls can be used as feed, processed further into insoluble oat fibre, or used as a biomass fuel.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the KRL {{scientists}} suffered many setbacks {{and were}} unable to develop the machine. While visiting at the Physics Hall of Qau, Alam met with Tasnim Shah, a professor of mathematics at Qau. Alam introduced Shah with KRL scientists where they examined the problems. It was followed by forming Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Division. The CFD Division analyzed {{the problems of the}} SWU — measuring the amount of work done by the centrifuge, and <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>acceleration</b> — how many rpm would a machine covered, and Rotational dynamics — what would be its appropriate rotational speed. Tasneem Shah gained fame when he independently analysed the issue, and assisted the KRL scientists to develop a powerful version of the centrifuges.|$|E

40|$|The {{propagation}} of surface (Rayleigh) waves over a rotating orthorhombic crystal is studied. The crystal possesses three crystallographic axes, normal to the symmetry planes: the halfÂ¿space is cut {{along a plane}} normal {{to one of these}} axes, the wave travels in the direction of another, and the rotation occurs at a uniform rate about any of the three axes. The secular equation for the surface wave speed is found explicitly; in contrast to the nonÂ¿rotating case, it is dispersive (frequency dependent). Both Coriolis and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>accelerations</b> appear in the equations of motion: none can be neglected in favour of the other, even at small rotation rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between gravitropism and phototropism was analyzed for sporangiophores of Phycomyces blakesleeanus. Fluence rate-response curves for phototropism were generated under three different conditions: (a) for stationary sporangiophores, which reached photogravitropic equilibrium; (b) for sporangiophores, which were clinostated head-over during phototropic stimulation; and (c) for sporangiophores, which {{were subjected to}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>accelerations</b> of 2. 3 g to 8. 4 g. For blue light (454 nm), clinostating caused an increase of {{the slope of the}} fluence rate-response curves and an increase of the maximal bending angles at saturating fluence rates. The absolute threshold remained, however, practically unaffected. In contrast to the results obtained with blue light, no increase of the slope of the fluence rate-response curves was obtained with near-ultraviolet light at 369 nm. Bilateral irradiation with near-ultraviolet or blue light enhanced gravitropism, whereas symmetric gravitropic stimulation caused a partial suppression of phototropism. Gravitropism and phototropism appear to be tightly linked by a tonic feedback loop that allows the respective transduction chains a mutual influence over each other. The use of tropism mutants allowed conclusions to be drawn about the tonic feedback loop with the gravitropic and phototropic transduction chains. The results from clinostating mutants that lack octahedral crystals (implicated as statoliths) showed that these crystals are not involved in the tonic feedback loop. At elevated <b>centrifugal</b> <b>accelerations,</b> the fluence-rate-response curves for photogravitropic equilibrium were displaced to higher fluence rates and the slope decreased. The results indicate that light transduction possesses a logarithmic transducer, whereas gravi-transduction uses a linear one...|$|R

Halo orbits are the result of a complicated interaction between the gravitational pull of the two planetary bodies and the Coriolis and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>accelerations</b> on a spacecraft. Halo orbits exist in any three-body system, e.g. the Sun-Earth system and the Earth-Moon system.

The burning-rate augmentation was strongly dependent on (1) acceleration level, (2) propellant distance burned (or burn time), and (3) orientation of the acceleration vector with respect to the burning surface. This transient rate augmentation resulted from the retention of molten metallic residue on the burning surface by the normal acceleration loading.

40|$|In this work, we for {{the first}} time {{attempted}} to fabricate cast HEAs containing NiCrCoFeMnAlх and CrCoFeAlCux etc. by SHS-metallurgy. The investigated HEAs were prepared by combined centrifugal casting – metallothermic SHS. Combustion was performed at <b>centrifugal</b> <b>accelerations</b> a = 10 – 400 g [...] Our SEM and XRD data suggest that thus synthesized cast HAEs represent a solid solution based on Fe and Ni containing uniformly distributed elements into volume of ingots. Increasing of Al (and Cu) content into HEAs was found to markedly change the microstructure and phase composition of HEAs. On the second stage we carried out a search for the reactive systems and process parameters that would be favorable for deposition of protective coatings of HEAs directly onto commercially available Ti and Fe alloys. The cast protective coatings are formed due to strongly heat exchange between high temperature alloys and substrate (based on Ti and Fe alloys). The phase composition and microstructure of protective coatings was investigated...|$|R
40|$|Context: With {{the launch}} of space {{missions}} devoted to asteroseismology (like COROT), the scientific community will soon have accurate measurements of pulsation frequencies in many rapidly rotating stars. Aims: The present work focuses {{on the effects of}} rotation on pulsations of rapidly rotating stars when both the Coriolis and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>accelerations</b> require a non-perturbative treatment. Method: We develop a 2 -dimensional spectral numerical approach which allows us to compute acoustic modes in centrifugally distorted polytropes including the full influence of the Coriolis force. This method is validated through comparisons with previous studies, and the results are shown to be highly accurate. Results: In the frequency range considered and with COROT's accuracy, we establish a domain of validity for perturbative methods, thus showing the need for complete calculations beyond v. sin i = 50 km/s for a R = 2. 3 R_, M = 1. 9 M_ polytropic star. Furthermore, it is shown that the main differences between complete and perturbative calculations come essentially from the centrifugal distortion.
