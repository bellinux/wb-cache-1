The viticultural area is located on Snipes Mountain, a long anticline ridge that rises from the floor of the Lower Yakima Valley with comparatively unique, rocky soils, called aridisols. The viticultural area also includes Harrison Hill, which lies <b>contiguously</b> east of Snipes Mountain and has similar soil and topography.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{disorders}} or {{diseases are}} all congenital, {{though they may}} not be expressed or recognized until later in life. Genetic diseases may be divided into single-gene defects, multiple-gene disorders, or chromosomal defects. Single-gene defects may arise from abnormalities of both copies of an autosomal gene (a recessive disorder) or of only one of the two copies (a dominant disorder). Some conditions result from deletions or abnormalities of a few genes located <b>contiguously</b> on a chromosome. Chromosomal disorders involve the loss or duplication of larger portions of a chromosome (or an entire chromosome) containing hundreds of genes. Large chromosomal abnormalities always produce effects on many different body parts and organ systems.|$|E
25|$|After {{experimenting with}} {{additive}} systems (including a camera with two apertures, {{one with a}} red filter, one with a green filter) from 1915 to 1921, Dr. Herbert Kalmus, Dr. Daniel Comstock, and mechanic W. Burton Wescott developed a subtractive color system for Technicolor. The system used a beam splitter in a specially modified camera to send red and green light to adjacent frames of one strip of black-and-white film. From this negative, skip-printing was used to print each color's frames <b>contiguously</b> onto film stock with half the normal base thickness. The two prints were chemically toned to roughly complementary hues of red and green, then cemented together, back to back, into a single strip of film. The first film to use this process was Toll of the Sea (1922) starring Anna May Wong. Perhaps the most ambitious film to use it was The Black Pirate (1926), starring and produced by Douglas Fairbanks.|$|E
500|$|The gray-tailed vole is monotypic, {{but there}} are some {{differences}} between specimens obtained {{on either side of the}} Columbia River. It appears to be a sibling species of the montane vole (Microtus montanus) or of Townsend's vole (M. townsendii). It was classified as a geographic race or subspecies of the montane vole by Hall and Kelson in 1951, but laboratory analyses, including electrophoresis and karyotype evaluations, subsequently confirmed that they are two separate species. [...] The karyotypes of the montane vole and the gray-tailed vole are dissimilar in terms of homology in 6 of 22 autosomal arms. [...] The quantity and distribution of heterochromatin among both X chromosomes and autosomes is different as well. [...] The two species are allopatric, but not <b>contiguously</b> so.|$|E
500|$|At daybreak on 22 November, 16,000 {{infantry}} and 30004000 cavalry moved against the combined Austrian and WÃ¼rttemberg positions between the Kinzig and the Rhine. [...] The French infantry {{departed from the}} small island of Erlen, in the Rhine, and from {{the left of the}} entrenchment camp. [...] The first column forced the first two Imperial redoubts. [...] Another penetrated the earthen works near the center and carried the village of Sundheim and the two redoubts that ran <b>contiguously</b> to the village. Three other redoubts between the two were not carried, though, and the Austrians sallied out of these fortifications and fell upon the French. This action was the principal assault on the Austrian/Imperial line and apparently took the besiegers by surprise. [...] Latour and the archduke personally moved to the gap the French created, pulling six battalions of armed workmen and all the Austrian troops after them.|$|E
500|$|Boston is {{surrounded}} by the [...] "Greater Boston" [...] region and is <b>contiguously</b> bordered by the cities and towns of Winthrop, Revere, Chelsea, Everett, Somerville, Cambridge, Watertown, Newton, Brookline, Needham, Dedham, Canton, Milton, and Quincy. The Charles River separates Boston from Watertown {{and the majority of}} Cambridge, and the mass of Boston from its own Charlestown neighborhood. To the east lie Boston Harbor and the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (which includes part of the city's territory, specifically Calf Island, Gallops Island, Great Brewster Island, Green Island, Little Brewster Island, Little Calf Island, Long Island, Lovells Island, Middle Brewster Island, Nixes Mate, Outer Brewster Island, Rainsford Island, Shag Rocks, Spectacle Island, The Graves, and Thompson Island). The Neponset River forms the boundary between Boston's southern neighborhoods and the city of Quincy and the town of Milton. The Mystic River separates Charlestown from Chelsea and Everett, and Chelsea Creek and Boston Harbor separate East Boston from Boston proper.|$|E
500|$|Dense {{urban areas}} have emerged along the coasts and rivers, and they run almost <b>contiguously</b> {{into each other}} in places. The needs of trade and {{industry}} have produced an almost continuous thread of urbanisation from the Wirral Peninsula to Doncaster, taking in the cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield, {{with a population of}} at least 7.6 million. Uniquely for such a large urban belt in Europe, these cities are all recent; most of them started as scattered villages with no shared identity before the Industrial Revolution. On the east coast, trade fuelled the growth of major ports such as Kingston upon Hull and Newcastle upon Tyne, [...] and the riverside conurbations of Teesside, Tyneside and Wearside became the largest towns in the North East. Northern England is now heavily urbanised: analysis by The Northern Way in 2006 found that 90% {{of the population of the}} North lived in one of its city regions: Liverpool, Central Lancashire, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, Hull and Humber Ports, Tees Valley and Tyne and Wear. As of the 2011 census, 86% of the Northern population lived in urban areas as defined by the Office for National Statistics, compared to 82% for England as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Author Yoshihiro Togashi {{stated that}} he began working on Yu Yu Hakusho {{during a period of}} time around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time. As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and {{illustrate}} a manga based on his interests. Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga. When first producing Yu Yu Hakusho, {{he did not have a}} clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title [...] "How to be a Ghost" [...] while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed [...] "YuYu-Ki (Poltergeist Chronicles)" [...] for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu-Ki. Because a series with a similar name (Chin-Yu-Ki) had already begun publication, Togashi quickly created an alternative: [...] "YuYu Hakusho (Poltergeist Report)". He commented that he could have used [...] "Den (Legend)" [...] or [...] "Monogatari (Story)", but [...] "Hakusho (Report)" [...] was the first thing that came to his mind. He <b>contiguously</b> developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. [...] "Yusuke Urameshi" [...] is a pun, [...] "Kazuma Kuwabara" [...] is a combination of two professional baseball players, and [...] "Hiei" [...] and [...] "Kurama" [...] are [...] "just names that popped into [...] head". When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.|$|E

The airport is within {{a section of}} the City of Chicago <b>contiguously</b> connected {{to the rest of the}} city by a narrow strip of land about [...] wide, running along Foster Avenue, from the Des Plaines River to the airport. This land was annexed into the city limits in the 1950s to assure the massive tax revenues associated with the airport would go to the city. The strip is bounded on the north by Rosemont and the south by Schiller Park.|$|E
2500|$|...NET Framework {{includes}} a garbage collector (GC) which runs periodically, {{on a separate}} thread from the application's thread, that enumerates all the unusable objects and reclaims the memory allocated to them. It is a non-deterministic, compacting, mark-and-sweep garbage collector. GC runs only when a set amount of memory has been used or there is enough pressure for memory on the system. Since it is not guaranteed when the conditions to reclaim memory are reached, GC runs are non-deterministic. Each [...]NET application has a set of roots, which are pointers to objects on the managed heap (managed objects). These include references to static objects and objects defined as local variables or method parameters currently in scope, and objects referred to by CPU registers. When GC runs, it pauses the application and then, for each object {{referred to in the}} root, it recursively enumerates all the objects reachable from the root objects and marks them as reachable. It uses CLI metadata and reflection to discover the objects encapsulated by an object, and then recursively walk them. It then enumerates all the objects on the heap (which were initially allocated <b>contiguously)</b> using reflection. All objects not marked as reachable are garbage. This is the mark phase. Since the memory held by garbage is of no consequence, it is considered free space. However, this leaves chunks of free space between objects which were initially contiguous. The objects are then compacted together to make free space on the managed heap contiguous again. Any reference to an object invalidated by moving the object is updated by GC to reflect the new location. The application is resumed after garbage collection ends. The latest version of [...]NET framework uses concurrent garbage collection along with user code, making pauses unnoticeable, because it is done in the background.|$|E
60|$|I wish our way {{had always}} lain among woods. Trees {{are the most}} civil society. An old oak that has been growing where he stands since before the Reformation, taller than many spires, more stately than {{the greater part of}} mountains, and yet a living thing, liable to sicknesses and death, like you and me: is not that in itself a {{speaking}} lesson in history? But acres on acres full of such patriarchs <b>contiguously</b> rooted, their green tops billowing in the wind, their stalwart younglings pushing up about their knees: a whole forest, healthy and beautiful, giving colour to the light, giving perfume to the air: what is this but the most imposing piece in nature's repertory? Heine wished to lie like Merlin under the oaks of Broceliande. I should not be satisfied with one tree; but if the wood grew together like a banyan grove, I would be buried under the tap-root of the whole; my parts should circulate from oak to oak; and my consciousness should be diffused abroad in all the forest, and give a common heart to that assembly of green spires, so that it also might rejoice in its own loveliness and dignity. I think I feel a thousand squirrels leaping from bough to bough in my vast mausoleum; and the birds and the winds merrily coursing over its uneven, leafy surface.|$|E
