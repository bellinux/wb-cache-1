In this service, however, unexpected service degradation may occur and differentiation among classes may be disordered if {{the network is}} designed to minimize over-provisioning or is under-provisioned. We therefore developed a packet scheduling scheme that dynamically allocates bandwidth to each class queue to guarantee the differentiation among classes under any traffic conditions. The scheme estimates the sum of CIRs (<b>Committed</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Rates),</b> i. e. rate of the packets having lowest drop preference, of active flows in each class and initially allocates the link bandwidth according to the sum of CIRs.

The equal share part enables that the flows in best effort class or the flows having zero CIRs can utilize minimum share of the bandwidth.

The Marine Technology Workshop, Martech 2009 is an {{initiative}} from Tecnoterra Associated Unit (Technical University of Catalonia and Scientific Research Council. Two Broadband Satellite Communication Systems were installed in two of our vessels during 2008. In BO Sarmiento de Gamboa a VSAT Communication System in C band was installed with a data transfer rate of 192 kbps (CIR, <b>Commited</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Rate)</b> and a burst capacity of 256 kbps (MIR, Maximum <b>Information</b> <b>Rate)</b> which can be increased to 5 Mbps. While in BIO Hesperides, following Navy specifications (the ship-owner) a TNX 75 Communication System in X band was installed with a data transfer rate of 128 kbps (CIR) which can be also increased to 5 Mbps. Apart from the advantages that an Internet access has had for the researchers, {{one of the most important}} characteristics of this Broadband System is the possibility of configuring a Virtual Private Network (VPN) between the vessels and the UTM main offices on shore (Land-Site). This network enables real-time data transmission and remote systems control and operation (Figure 1). Furthermore, web browsing is possible and an IP telephone system has been installed. The installation of this kind of networks is not easy and several difficulties can appear. Therefore, an optimal configuration of protocol architecture has to be looked for. In satellite communication where TCP/IP protocols are used, data links are very sensitive to latency, asymmetric links, and package loss due to congestion or transmission errors. Both vessels are managed by UTM owned by different ministries. Administrative requirements were different at the time of choosing the satellite service providers. During start-up their services and their architectures were very different and they were modified until the problems were overcome, so both systems can currently offer the same services. For analysing the resolution of those problems, the behaviour of four basic parameters (jitter, round time trip, package loss and throughput) has been studied. Peer reviewe...|$|R
