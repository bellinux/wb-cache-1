40|$|<b>Crop</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{with obvious}} {{seasonal}} changes strongly influence soil loss. The {{purpose of this}} study is to measure and analyze the plant characteristics and their seasonal change in the Loess Plateau. A small watershed, Danangou in the Loess Plateau of north China, was selected for this study. <b>Crop</b> <b>characteristics</b> including plant cover, plant height and leaf area index (LAI) were measured every 2 weeks in 1998, 1999 and 2000. In Danangou watershed, half of the lands used as cropland for maize, foxtail millet, pearl millet, potato, buckwheat and soybean. The remainder of the land included wasteland, fallow, shrub, woodland and orchard. The woodlands have high leaf area index (LAI) with the value of 3 ¿ 7, and high cover of 40 ¿ 80 % in wet year and 30 ¿ 50 % in dry year. For shrub, the maximum height is about 1 m, 1 ¿ 2 LAI, and cover 50 ¿ 90 % in wet year, 40 ¿ 50 % in dry year. The characteristics of fallow and wasteland were similar with the height of 30 ¿ 50 cm in wet year and 10 ¿ 20 cm in dry year. For wasteland, LAI was 1 ¿ 2 in wet year and 0. 3 ¿ 0. 5 in dry year, and cover was 30 ¿ 40 % in wet year and 20 ¿ 30 % in dry year. For fallow, LAI was 0. 5 ¿ 1 in wet year and 0. 2 ¿ 0. 5 in dry year, and cover was 10 ¿ 20 % both in wet and dry years. For cropland, LAI, height and coverage changed greatly during the measurement season. For different crops, the range of height, LAI and cover was 0. 5 ¿ 2 m, 0 ¿ 4. 5 and 10 ¿ 90 %, respectively. For non-cropland, cover increased from April, reached maximum in May or June, and remained high until September or October.

40|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} of crop growth within fields is rarely quantified but essential for estimating yield and optimizing crop management. Relationships in fields between crop growth and soil physical characteristics {{have been described}} before but an unrealistically high number of invasive measurements {{have to be made}} to obtain spatially continuous soil information. Alternatively, non-invasive methods are available for characterizing soil heterogeneity but relationships to growth characteristics have rarely been investigated. Here, we use an electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor to measure the apparent electromagnetic conductivity of the soil (ECa), which {{can be used as a}} proxy for the relative spatial variability of the prevailing soil properties. We evaluate relationships between ECa and soil and <b>crop</b> <b>characteristics</b> assuming that measured ECa patterns relate to observed growth patterns in the field. The test fields were located in Western Germany where different crops (winter wheat, winter barley, and sugar beet) were grown between 2011 and 2013. Measurements include soil texture, soil moisture and crop growth characteristics taken frequently throughout the vegetation periods for plant height, leaf area index (LAI), dry matter of plants and selected organs (green leaves and storage organs). Spatial variability was observed for soil and <b>crop</b> <b>characteristics</b> that differed among fields, crops and years. Good correlations between ECa and soil texture and soil moisture confirmed that ECa measurements are suitable for characterizing spatial differences in soil properties for our test sites. Averaged over all sampling dates of a vegetation period the differences in the spatial variability of <b>crop</b> <b>characteristics</b> were small between the years and crops considered. However, the within-field crop growth heterogeneity changed throughout the growing period depending on the crop development stage. Correlations were found between ECa and the <b>crop</b> <b>characteristics</b> that varied with time and were most pronounced in the main growth phase when LAI approached its maximum. Crop height correlated better with ECa than yield, LAI, and dry matter but differences were observed between fields, years and crops. Our results suggest that in dry years soil patterns have a stronger influence on the crop growth patterns than in wetter years when water limitation is less severe. We conclude that ECa measurements are suitable for detecting spatial patterns in soil characteristics that influence the spatial crop growth patterns for the region, years and crops considered.
