40|$|Abstract. Metastable {{austenitic}} stainless steels are attractive industrial materials with excellent corrosion resistance, mechanical properties, and formability. However, during plastic deformation, α’martensite can be formed. The volume fraction of that particular phase influences the mechanical and other properties (such as corrosion resistance) of these steels. Therefore, {{it is important to}} determine the amount of α’martensite in the obtained microstructures. Currently, the volume fraction of deformation-induced martensite in stainless steel is most commonly measured by the X-ray diffraction or magnetic permeability methods. In this study, a novel method of measuring deformation-induced martensite using magnetic <b>contact</b> <b>holding</b> force is proposed. Measurement trials were carried out using a prototype measuring system, and the results of measurements taken from SUS 301 and SUS 304 stainless steels are discussed in terms of deformation and martensite volume fraction...|$|E

Literature review [...] Chapter 3. Methodology [...] Chapter 4. Results and discussion [...] Chapter 5. Conclusion and implications [...] Appendices. Studies {{in the field of}} second language acquisition have long been interested in the phenomenon of Foreign Language Anxiety (FLA) (e. g., Horwitz, Horwitz & Cope, 1986; MacIntyre & Gardner, 1994). These studies confirm that many L 2 learners experience anxiety during the process of language learning. In terms of speaking anxiety, current research points to the need to better understand this phenomenon. Recent research focusing on Saudi foreign language learners points to the important role of cultural factors and speaking context in speaking anxiety (e. g., Al-Saraj 2014 a; Javid, 2014). However, much of this research has been done in Saudi Arabia, and a gap exists in the current research literature pertaining to the relationship between speaking anxiety and language learning among Saudi ESL learners in mixed-gender classrooms. This study aimed to investigate the triggers of speaking anxiety for nine Saudi ESL learners studying in Australia. It also examined the manifestations of such anxiety, as well as coping strategies identified by the participants. Participants were observed in a classroom context participating in three types of speaking activities: pair work, group work, and oral presentation. This was followed by individual semi-structured interviews and stimulated recall sessions. Analysis of the data revealed five socio-contextual factors contributing to participants’ experiences of anxiety, including proximity to learners of the opposite gender, two psycho-linguistic factors including fear of incorrect L 2 usage, and three overlap factors including linguistically demanding speaking tasks. The manifestations of speaking anxiety among the participants were both physical and psychological in nature and included avoiding eye <b>contact,</b> <b>holding</b> onto objects tensely, and forgetting words. The main coping strategies reported by the study cohort were learning additional vocabulary and undertaking thorough preparation prior to speaking. The findings from this study have implications for pedagogical practices related to teacher behaviour, classroom management practices, and the design of learning activities when instructing Saudi ESL learners.

40|$|Direct {{evaporative}} cooling (DEC) uses evaporating water, {{combined with a}} wetted medium to cool the temperature of air as it passes through. Evaporative cooling devices can reduce the energy consumption of HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R (Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Equipment). Heat is absorbed whenever water is evaporated and converted to water vapor. By passing through or around a wetted surface, heat {{is removed from the}} surrounding air in the vaporization of the water. The process approximates the adiabatic-saturation process and the path lies on a constant wet-bulb temperature which is a constant enthalpy line. ^ This thesis consists of two major researches; one is the study of correlation of Direct Evaporative Cooling efficiency with media porosity. The wetted surface area in DEC depends on porosity and absorptivity of the media. The thesis evaluates the effect of media porosity on performance of a Direct Evaporative Cooling system. In this experimental work, the porosity is varied by changing the packing density and volume of media. The packing material allows air and water to come in direct <b>contact.</b> <b>Holding</b> all other variables like mass flow rates and inlet dry-bulb temperature constant, the effect Porosity on DEC performance is studied. The performance of DEC system is a function of porosity, dry- and wet-bulb temperatures and relative humidity. Efficiency increases with porosity. ^ The other research is focusing on relationship between system parameters and cooling efficiency. Effects of three system parameters on cooling performance were evaluated. The three parameters selected for focus were the speed of frontal air, the dry-bulb temperature of frontal air, and the temperature of the incoming water. Each parameter was varied while holding all other variables like air, water mass flow rates and so on constant respectively, and data was collected using several different levels of each parameter. The general relationship between each parameter and efficiency was determined by graphing the data collected and observing trends. The empirical correlation between supply frontal air velocity and cooling efficiency for DEC system in a typical applied environment was established and verified by experiment data. Within certain ranges, DEC cooling efficiency increases with frontal air dry-bulb temperature; decreases with frontal air velocity and incoming water temperature correspondingly. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{be trapped}} in a roller-coaster That ́s how some of the {{patients}} are describing the situa- tion of living with heart failure. To be stuck in their home not knowing if {{they will have to}} seek care today and not knowing if they will have the energy to attend that birth- day party later this week. Each year 2 - 3 % of the Swedish population are diagnosed with heart failure, which results in 30, 000 new individu- als with the disorder. Cardiovascular disease is rapidly in- creasing in the world and before 2030, people with heart failure will increased by 100 %. Our improved living condi- tions and better health have allowed us to grow older and made us more dependent on other types of care, care at home. Today the patients are only looking for changes in weight and if they have excessive water in their body. What if we could see changes in values before they develop in to symptoms? We could then use a smaller dosage of medicine and minimize the risk of damaging other organs. During my work I have met with patients, husbands, wives and care givers to gain a better insight and understanding of the different stakeholders problems. The common factor is the insufficient methods for monitoring that are being used today, which aren’t optimal for patients, relatives or care givers. That led me to look at non-invasive testing methods (PPG), which would make it possible to see a trend of a patients health. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique {{that can be used to}} detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. PPG is most often employed non-invasively and operates at a red or a near infrared wavelength due to its properties to permeate tissue. By sending out different wavelengths and recorde how much is transmit- ted, scattered and absorb, the sensor can measure levels in the blood. When the station is done with the test it will send the result automatically to “Mina vårdkontakter” which will be accessible for both care givers and the patient. The profile will provide the patients with test results and a first <b>contact</b> <b>holding</b> advice for immediate and awaiting care. This will educate the patients and lead to them gaining a better understanding of their current health situation...|$|E
40|$|Background/Problem: Maternal {{breastfeeding}} {{confidence is}} critical for successful breastfeeding. Midwives are well placed to improve maternal confidence by helping mothers learn how to attach their baby to initiate breastfeeding. This {{can be achieved by}} encouraging mothers to hold their nude baby against their bare chest. Continuous uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact is known to assist babies coordinate their suckling reflex to attach for effective breastfeeding. However, little attention has been given to events surrounding birth and the immediate postpartum in fostering effective breastfeeding. Some authors argue that many routine hospital procedures and midwifery practices adversely effect breastfeeding initiation and maternal confidence to breastfeed. Aim: To explore women's experiences of the first breastfeed and impact on maternal confidence. Setting: The participating site was a regional mother and baby unit seeking BFHI accreditation status. Sample: Convenience sample of birthing women. Design: Observation study and interviews. Procedure: Observations were conducted with 61 mothers in the birthing room who gave birth vaginally. Mothers were followed up with a face-to-face interview prior to discharge, and a telephone interview at two weeks postpartum to determine satisfaction with care, maternal confidence, and incidence of common breastfeeding problems. The Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (BSES) (Dennis & Faux, 1999) was used to measure maternal breastfeeding confidence. Results: The sample consisted of primipara (n = 28) and multipara (n = 32) women. Sixty-two percent (62 %) of the mothers held their babies in continuous uninterrupted skin contact during the first hour of birth. Seventy percent of the babies attempted to attach to the breast within the first hour, and 57 % successfully attached with deep rhythmical suckling. Participants reported a high level of satisfaction when offered the opportunity to hold their baby in skin-to-skin contact at the time of birth. At two weeks postpartum 76 % of mother-baby dyads were exclusively breastfeeding. Further analysis is currently being conducted to understand relationships between optimal attachment to the breast in the birthing room and problem free breastfeeding in the early postnatal period. Associations between skin-to-skin <b>contact</b> <b>holding,</b> babies' attaching well in the first hour of birth, and mothers confidence scores at 2 weeks postpartum will be reported. Discussion and implications for practice: This research contributes to our current understanding of how assistance to begin breastfeeding should be offered to mothers. Mothers' reported experience of holding their baby in skin-to-skin contact after birth and implications for breastfeeding initiation will be discussed. The study highlights the impact of midwifery practices on maternal confidence to breastfeed their newborn. Recommendations for practice change will be outlined.

This paper {{deals with}} {{continuous}} contact force models {{applied to the}} human-in-the-loop simulation of multibody systems, but the results are valid in general to all that applications with contacts when real-time is required. The contact model proposed in this work, is suited to collisions between massive solids for which the assumption of quasi static <b>contact</b> <b>holds</b> {{and it can be}} supposed that the deformation is limited to a small region of the colliding bodies while the remainder of them are assumed to be rigid. The model consist of two components: nor-mal compliance with nonlinear viscoelastic model based on Hertz law, and tangential friction force based on Coulomb’s law including sticktion. Furthermore, the model takes into account the geometry and the material of the colliding bodies. The tangential model presents original contributions while the normal model is completely taken from previous works. For this work, the formulation of the equations of motion is an augmented Lagrangian with projections of ve-locities and accelerations onto their constraints manifolds and implicit integrator. The whole solution proposed is tested in two applications: the first one is the simulation of a spring-mass system with Coulomb’s friction, which is an academic problem with known analytical solu-tion; the second one is a simulator of a hydraulic excavator Liebherr A 924, which is a realistic application that gives an idea of the capabilities of the method proposed. ...|$|R
