40|$|The {{projection}} for GDP {{growth in}} 2005 and 2006 remains unchanged, but {{the risk of}} adverse developments has increased. The further <b>cyclical</b> <b>profile</b> in the euro area is uncertain, since the gains in exports and corporate earnings have so far not translated into the expected higher investment and consumption. The high oil prices constitute a further risk element. The Austrian economy should fare better than the euro area average, {{on account of the}} demand incentives resulting from the tax reform. GDP is projected to grow at a steady 2 ¼ percent annual rate in 2005 and 2006. This will not suffice to lower the rate of unemployment, given the massive increase in labour supply.

40|$|The {{business}} cycle upturn {{that started in}} 2005 is continuing throughout the current year. After an increase of 3. 1 percent in 2006, real GDP is expected to expand by 3. 2 percent in 2007. While export growth is gradually decelerating, investment is gaining momentum to become the key driver of the upswing. Private household consumption, while picking up this year, still lags behind its normal <b>cyclical</b> <b>profile.</b> The strong pace of growth is leading to a marked {{increase in the number}} of jobs and a further decline in unemployment. In 2008, GDP growth is likely to decelerate to 2. 5 percent, due to slackening activity in the USA, the strength of the euro and the rise in long-term interest rates.

In particular, the output gap, defined as the difference between actual and potential output, conveys useful information on the cyclical position of a given economy. This paper proposes estimates of the Italian potential output based on a structural VAR model using data coming from business surveys.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{problems}} of low income among immigrants, analysed by using comparable panel datasets for two Scandinavian welfare states. After a brief survey of a few earlier studies on immigrant poverty, we present Denmark and Sweden as interesting cases for comparative research. <b>Cyclical</b> <b>profiles</b> have been very different since the 1980 s and both countries have experienced considerable differences with regard to the number and composition of immigrants from the less developed countries. Poverty rates, analysed relative to different background factors, are fairly high, in particular when considering the welfare state background of Denmark and Sweden.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{determinants}} of relative poverty among immigrants and natives in Denmark and Sweden during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Denmark and Sweden {{share the same}} properties {{in a range of}} labour market and welfare state characteristics. At the same time they differ very much in <b>cyclical</b> <b>profiles</b> and immigration experiences during recent decades. Both countries have followed the same principles regarding immigration policy, i. e. immigration from low income countries has been restricted to tied movers and refugees. We use 60 percent of the median in the distribution of equivalent disposable as poverty line. Data comes from two large panels based on administrative data. We find that immigrants have higher poverty rates than natives in both countries and that this difference has clearly increased in both countries. The paper reports results based on running probability models of poverty incidence. Explanatory variables include measures of years since immigration, demographic characteristics, and variables measuring country of origin. We conclude that {{a significant part of the}} difference in aggregate immigrant poverty rates reflect differences in composition by country of origin and differences in the structure of benefits to families with children...|$|R
40|$|Potential {{output and}} the related concept of output gap {{play a central role}} in the {{macroeconomic}} policy interventions and evaluations. In particular, the output gap, defined as the difference between actual and potential output, conveys useful information on the cyclical position of a given economy. The aim of this paper is to propose estimates of the Italian potential GDP based on structural VAR models. With respect to other techniques, like the univariate filters (i. e. the Hodrick-Prescott filter), the estimates obtained through the SVAR methodology are free from end-of-sample problems, thus resulting particularly useful for short-term analysis. In order to provide information on the economic fluctuations, data coming from business surveys are considered in the model. This kind of data, given their <b>cyclical</b> <b>profile,</b> are particularly useful for detrending purposes, as they allow to include information concerning the business cycle activity. To assess the estimate reliability, an end-of-sample revision evaluation is performed. The ability of the cyclical GDP component to detect business cycle turning points is then performed by comparing the estimated output gaps, extracted with different detrending methods, over the expansion and recession phases of the Italian business cycle chronology. ...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a period}} of {{sluggish}} growth averaging ½ percent p. a. from 2012 to 2015, economic activity in Austria is expected to pick up over the medium term, averaging at a moderate pace of + 1 ½ percent p. a. between 2016 and 2020. Foreign trade, government consumption and investment spending will contribute less to economic growth than prior to the financial market crisis and the recession 2008 - 09. Growth of private consumption should pick up from 0. 5 percent p. a. 2011 - 2015 to 1. 4 percent p. a. over the forecast period, receiving stimulus from higher disposable income due to the tax reform 2015 - 16, and from additional demand due to refugee immigration. While the moderate GDP growth will allow employment to increase by 1. 1 percent p. a. from 2016 to 2020, {{the creation of new}} jobs will not prevent unemployment from rising further until 2018, since labour supply, both domestic and from abroad (driven also by the inflow of refugees), will outpace demand. The rate of unemployment may reach almost 10 percent (national definition) by 2017 and change little thereafter. Inflationary pressure will remain moderate over the medium term, {{at an annual rate of}} 1. 7 percent. The inflation rate will be thus higher than the average in the euro area, making for somewhat smaller real income gains in Austria. Given the projected <b>cyclical</b> <b>profile</b> and the assumptions on the economic policy settings, a balanced general government budget, whether in nominal (Maastricht definition) or structural terms, may be difficult to achieve over the forecast horizon.

40|$|Background: Apicomplexan parasites {{replicate}} by {{varied and}} unusual processes where the typically eukaryotic expansion of cellular components and chromosome cycle are coordinated with the biosynthesis of parasite-specific structures essential for transmission. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here {{we describe the}} global cell cycle transcriptome of the tachyzoite stage of Toxoplasma gondii. In dividing tachyzoites, {{more than a third}} of the mRNAs exhibit significant <b>cyclical</b> <b>profiles</b> whose timing correlates with biosynthetic events that unfold during daughter parasite formation. These 2, 833 mRNAs have a bimodal organization with peak expression occurring in one of two transcriptional waves that are bounded by the transition into S phase and cell cycle exit following cytokinesis. The G 1 -subtranscriptome is enriched for genes required for basal biosynthetic and metabolic functions, similar to most eukaryotes, while the S/M-subtranscriptome is characterized by the uniquely apicomplexan requirements of parasite maturation, development of specialized organelles, and egress of infectious daughter cells. Two dozen AP 2 transcription factors form a series through the tachyzoite cycle with successive sharp peaks of protein expression in the same timeframes as their mRNA patterns, indicating that the mechanisms responsible for the timing of protein delivery might be mediated by AP 2 domains with different promoter recognition specificities...|$|R

40|$|The rhoptries are key {{secretory}} organelles from apicomplexan parasites {{that contain}} proteins involved in invasion and modulation {{of the host}} cell. Some rhoptry proteins are restricted to the posterior bulb (ROPs) and others to the anterior neck (RONs). As many rhoptry proteins {{have been shown to}} be key players in Toxoplasma invasion and virulence, it is important to identify, understand and characterise the biological function of the components of the rhoptries. In this report, we identified putative novel rhoptry genes by identifying Toxoplasma genes with similar <b>cyclical</b> expression <b>profiles</b> as known rhoptry protein encoding genes. Usin g this approach we identified two new rhoptry bulb (ROP 47 and ROP 48) and one new rhoptry neck protein (RON 12). ROP 47 is secreted and traffics to the host cell nucleus, RON 12 was not detected at the moving junction during invasion. Deletion of ROP 47 or ROP 48 in a type II strain did not show major influence in in vitro growth or virulence in mice. © 2013 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc...|$|R
40|$|A major {{advance in}} {{microchannel}} {{heating and cooling}} technology is described and {{has the potential to}} change the way thermal processing of microscale fluidic samples is achieved. The microchannel {{is one of the key}} building blocks of micro total analysis systems (?TAS), which are already being released to market in the form of disposable test kits for biometrics and disease identification. However, significant cost reductions and other advances in microchannel heating and cooling technology are still needed and can be expected to improve the accuracy with which quantitative analysis can be performed. In part, this is because the fidelity of many existing and potential microfluidic applications is critically dependent on precise temperature control. The scientific objective of the study was to understand and then manipulate the physics of thermal transport within fine scale composite materials containing an embedded microchannel. In essence, it was necessary that the composition of the composite materials be manipulated in a precise way that established a particular nonlinear pattern of temperature along the length of the microchannel. In practice, this required the development of a systematic inverse solution process that could identify an acceptable composition to exactly match the desired pattern of temperature variation. As a demonstration of capability, fully operational prototypes comprised of patterned copper laminated within polyimide and acrylic polymers were designed, fabricated, and tested. In terms of conceptual advances, this is the first time that composite materials of this type have been used for microchannel heating AND cooling. From an analytical perspective, the critical advance was the development of a robust simulation framework consisting of an outer optimization loop and an inner finite element analysis (FEA) loop, which was used to iteratively identify the optimal copper pattern for each of several applications. In terms of experimental advances, the key fabrication steps included UV laser micromachining, acid etching, microchannel formation, and hot vacuum lamination. To avoid any ambiguity or artifact, microchannel temperatures were painstakingly measured at each of several flow rates using fine thermocouples embedded in the microchannel wall. For the most part, the measured temperatures were within 1 ?C of the expected values based on simulation, with spatial temperature gradients of up to +/- 94 ?C/mm (or equivalently +/- 188 ?C/s at 2 &# 61549;l/min flow rate) within the range of 16 ?C to 92 ?C, using a resistively heated source at 100 ?C and a thermoelectrically cooled sink at 2 ?C. The temperature profiles studied here included two highly nonlinear <b>cyclical</b> <b>profiles</b> applicable to 1) continuous-flow polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 2) thermally mediated counter-flow separation in conjunction with electrophoresis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInterleukin 12 (IL- 12) is a heterodimeric, pro-inflammatory {{cytokine}} {{that plays}} {{a central role}} in activation and differentiation of CD 4 + T cells into interferon-γ secreting T-helper type 1 cells. IL- 12 B, a gene encoding the larger subunit of active IL- 12, has been reported to be down-regulated by the nuclear hormone 1 α, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1 α, 25 (OH) 2 D 3), but the mechanism of the regulation is unknown. In this study, we have examined the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the IL- 12 B gene by 1 α, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -treated human monocytes (THP- 1). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that IL- 12 B mRNA displays a <b>cyclical</b> expression <b>profile</b> and is down-regulated 2. 8 -fold during the first 8 h and even 12. 1 -fold 24 h after exposure to 1 α, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. Gel shift and quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding to genomic regions 480 and 6300 bp upstream of the IL- 12 B transcription start site (TSS). Quantitative ChIP assays also revealed that together with VDR and its partner RXR the above regions recruited the co-repressor NCOR 2 /SMRT and histone deacetylase 3 leading to a decreased histone 4 acetylation and increased histone 3 trimethylation at the IL- 12 B promoter and its TSS. We suggest that these repressive epigenetic changes eventually cause down-regulation of IL- 12 expression...|$|R
