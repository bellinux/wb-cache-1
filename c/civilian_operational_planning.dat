It describes milestones, conditions for success and explains how, or what portion of, a strategic plan will be put into operation during a given operational period, in the case of commercial application, a fiscal year or another given budgetary term. An <b>operational</b> <b>plan</b> is the basis for, and justification of an annual operating budget request. Therefore, a five-year strategic plan would typically require five <b>operational</b> <b>plans</b> funded by five operating budgets.|$|R

The <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> level of development has been measured by the scale of six intensity levels (1 – 6) to evaluate each of the eight targeted tasks (planning raw and materials, work planning, planning tools and equipment, capacity planning, termination of production, scheduling by work centres, drafting and launching of work documentation and various records terms and performance), while the effectiveness of the production process has been measured by the following indicators: productivity, stock turnover rate, capacity utilisation rate, delivery time and fallout ratio. The results have shown that enterprises with higher <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> level of development present better effectiveness of the production process in comparison to enterprises with less <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> level of development...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the implications of outsourcing at the <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> level, i. e. how the <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> function is complicated owing to the strategic outsourcing decisions that have been made in the past. Design/methodology/approach – First, a literature review on outsourcing is conducted. Second, two case studies at three pharmaceutical companies are conducted to gather insights into the planning of outsourced operations. Findings – The paper finds that nothing has been documented in the literature on outsourcing at the <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> level. Moreover, a number of implications of outsourcing at the <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> level are discussed. One of the main insights is that in an outsourcing relationship, the order process consists of different, hierarchically connected, decisions in time, hence requiring a richer and more developed communication and ordering pattern than is commonly assumed. Research limitations/implications – The results seem to be generalizable to the pharmaceutical industry. However, future research should determine whether these results replicate in other industries. Originality/value – The literature on outsourcing has mainly focused on the strategic outsourcing decision. The paper contributes to a better understanding of the implications of outsourcing at the <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> function, which has not been studied before...|$|R
