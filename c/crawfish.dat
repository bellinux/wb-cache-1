40|$|Sur les neuf espèces d'écrevisses présentes en France, six sont des espèces introduites dont les conséquences sur l’environnement créent de profonds déséquilibres biologiques. Dans le département des Vosges, des actions spécifiques sont expérimentées, notamment auprès des propriétaires d’étangs pour tenter de lutter contre l’expansion des écrevisses introduites et ainsi préserver les dernières populations d’écrevisses natives. Since {{the end of}} the XIXth century, the {{distribution}} of crayfish in France has gone through deep changes, and the introduction of allochtonous crayfish, essentially from the North American continent, has forever changed the French and European crayfish landscape. The four surveys organised in France by ONEMA since 1977 allow following the evolution of the different species of crayfish present on the national territory, showing each time the large expansion of the exotic species and the recess of the native species. The situation of our three native species must now be considered as alarming. Two of these species, Austropotamobius torrentium and Astacus astacus, are close to extinction, and the third one, Austropotamobius pallipes, can now be found on the upmost parts of the watersheds, confined in areas and under the pressure of the exotic species which are still making their way further up. Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procamabrus clarkii are showing the strongest geographical expansion. Everywhere they appear to be very strong competitors, more aggressive, resistant to pathologies, able to colonize varied environments. They are indeed colonizing new departments, new watersheds, and thus eliminating native species. The rhythm of the illegal introductions seems to accelerate because new species, native of the American continent, were recently discovered: Orconectes juvenilis in the department of the Doubs and Orconectes immunis in the departement of the Bas-Rhin. In terms of management of these species, the actions are rather rare at the national level.

40|$|International audienceMyriophyllum alterniflorum D. C., an aquatic {{macrophyte}} {{native to}} north-European stream freshwaters, was found even in polluted environments from the Vienne river {{and its tributaries}} which are often loaded with anthropogenic copper in the Limousin region (France). Vitroplants of this species were reintroduced in degraded localities and the restoration was successful as insect larvae's, <b>crawfishes,</b> leeches and moderlieschen alevins were found in reintroduced macrophyte beds. Furthermore, the good in situ acclimation of the M. alterniflorum patches foresaw potential applications of biomonitoring. Indeed, this species {{is known to be}} heavy-metal tolerant and it appears as a good candidate to develop new plant biomarker models specific to pollution in stream environments as none were developed until now. Among ten physiological parameters studied during 35 days after in situ reintroduction, the photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls a and b, and carotenoids) presented an excellent sensitivity to copper contamination. A strong correlation is obtained between pigment contents of M. alterniflorum and the copper water concentration. This allowed the establishment of models to estimate (i) the phytotoxicity of the heavy metal and (ii) the heavy-metal concentration from the pigment data. The accuracy of the models is limited to copper concentrations ranging from 0, 07 µg. l- 1 to 12, 60 µg. l- 1 hence offering many opportunities to apply this new method in a large quantity of European polluted stream waters while using expensive and complex analytical methodologies (e. g. ICP-MS). Owning biological and chemical information from this rapid and cost-effective approach, allows to develop environmental health programs to manage the heavy-metal load in stream ecosystems. Moreover, this study is a breakthrough in the biomonitoring of freshwaters as it leads to enhance environmental management program with the development of new biomarkers from freshwater macrophytes...|$|R
