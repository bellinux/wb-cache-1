40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} firms' {{incentive}} to offer <b>customized</b> products {{in addition to}} their standard products in a competitive environment. We offer several key insights. First, we delineate market conditions in which firms will (will not) offer <b>customized</b> products {{in addition to their}} standard products. Surprisingly, we find that when firms offer <b>customized</b> products they are able to not only expand demand, but can also the prices of their standard products relative to when they do not. Second, we find that when a firm offers <b>customized</b> products it is a dominant strategy for it to also offer its standard product. This result highlights the role of standard products and the importance of retaining them when firms offer <b>customized</b> products. Third, we identify market conditions under which ex ante symmetric firms will adopt symmetric or asymmetric customization strategies. Fourth, we highlight how the degree of customization offered in equilibrium is affected by market parameters. We find that the degree of customization is lower when both firms offer <b>customized</b> products relative to the case when only one firm offers <b>customized</b> products. Finally, we show that <b>customizing</b> products under competition does not lead to a prisoner's dilemma. degree of product customization, mass customization, standard products, competition, game theory...|$|R
