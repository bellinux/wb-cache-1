5|$|Fallout from {{atmospheric}} {{nuclear testing}} prior to 1980 contributed {{a small amount}} of <b>californium</b> to the environment. <b>Californium</b> isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion. <b>Californium</b> is not a major radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide curium, to the left of the actinide <b>californium</b> and below the lanthanide terbium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of curium (13.52g/cm3) and <b>californium</b> (15.1g/cm3), as does its melting point of 986°C, below that of curium (1340°C) but higher than that of <b>californium</b> (900°C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2Pa).|$|E
5|$|Californium-252 has {{a number}} of {{specialized}} applications as a strong neutron emitter, and each microgram of fresh <b>californium</b> produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes <b>californium</b> useful as a neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable (non-reactor based) neutron source for neutron activation analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples. Neutrons from <b>californium</b> are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119µg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant. It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in the coal and cement industries.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal.

Its density of 8.84 g/cm3 is lower than that of <b>californium</b> (15.1 g/cm3) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79 g/cm3), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of einsteinium (860°C) is also relatively low – below <b>californium</b> (900°C), fermium (1527°C) and holmium (1461°C). Einsteinium is a soft metal, with the bulk modulus of only 15 GPa, which value is one of the lowest among non-alkali metals.|$|E

All the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than a year, {{and the majority of}} these have half-lives shorter than 20 minutes. The isotopes of <b>californium</b> range in mass number from 237 to 256.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, B. B. Cunningham {{obtained}} the first bulk chemical compound of a transplutonium element, namely americium hydroxide. Over {{the next three}} to four years, milligram quantities of americium and microgram amounts of curium were accumulated that allowed production of isotopes of berkelium (Thomson, 1949) and <b>californium</b> (Thomson, 1950). Sizeable amounts of these elements were produced only in 1958 (Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thomson), and the first <b>californium</b> compound (0.3µg of CfOCl) was obtained only in 1960 by B. B. Cunningham and J. C. Wallmann.|$|E

5|$|<b>Californium</b> that bioaccumulates in {{skeletal}} tissue releases {{radiation that}} disrupts the body's ability to form red blood cells. The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Californium-251 has a {{very small}} {{calculated}} critical mass of about , high lethality, and {{a relatively short period}} of toxic environmental irradiation. The low critical mass of <b>californium</b> led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element.|$|E
5|$|In December 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) team in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, {{proposed}} a joint {{experiment with the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, United States, to synthesize element 117—so-called for the 117 protons in its nucleus. Their proposal involved fusing a berkelium (element 97) target and a calcium (element 20) beam, conducted via bombardment of the berkelium target with calcium nuclei: this would complete a set of experiments done at the JINR on the fusion of actinide targets with a calcium-48 beam, which had thus far produced the new elements 113–116 and 118. The ORNL—then the world's only producer of berkelium—could not then provide the element, as they had temporarily ceased production, and re-initiating {{it would be too}} costly. Plans to synthesize element 117 were suspended in favor of the confirmation of element 118, which had been produced earlier in 2002 by bombarding a <b>californium</b> target with calcium.Cf+48Ca experiment|url=http://www.jinr.ru/publish/Preprints/2002/287(D7-2002-287)e.pdf|journal=JINR Communication|last1=Oganessian|first1=Yu. Ts.|accessdate=2015-09-23}} The required berkelium-249 is a by-product in californium-252 production, and obtaining the required amount of berkelium was an even more difficult task than obtaining that of <b>californium,</b> as well as costly: it would cost around 3.5 million dollars, and the parties agreed to wait for a commercial order of <b>californium</b> production, from which berkelium could be extracted.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} most {{dangerous}} if {{taken into the}} body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through gamma ray emission. Ionizing radiation emitted by <b>californium</b> on bone and in the liver can cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|This {{discovery}} was further substantiated by their detailed {{measurements of the}} alpha decay chain of the produced bohrium atoms to previously known isotopes of fermium and <b>californium.</b> The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report.|$|E
5|$|Among the 16 known {{isotopes}} of einsteinium {{with mass}} numbers from 241 to 257 the most affordable is 253Es. It is an α-emitter with a half-life of 20.47 days, a relatively weak γ-emission and small spontaneous fission rate {{as compared with}} the isotopes of <b>californium.</b> Prolonged neutron irradiation also produces a long-lived isotope 254Es (t1/2 = 275.5 days).|$|E
5|$|<b>Californium</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} at the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, by the physics researchers Stanley G. Thompson, Kenneth Street, Jr., Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn T. Seaborg {{on or about}} February 9, 1950. It was the sixth transuranium element to be discovered; the team announced its discovery on March 17, 1950.|$|E
5|$|Californium-249 {{is formed}} from the beta decay of berkelium-249, {{and most other}} <b>californium</b> {{isotopes}} are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a nuclear reactor. Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high neutron capture) and its tendency to interact with other particles (high neutron cross-section).|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Ghiorso et al. {{obtained}} the first isotope of lawrencium by irradiating <b>californium</b> (mostly californium-252) with boron-10 and boron-11 ions. The mass number of this isotope was not clearly established (possibly 258 or 259) at the time. In 1965, 256Lr was synthesized by Flyorov et al. from 243Am and 18O. Thus IUPAC recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes of <b>californium</b> {{with mass}} numbers 237–256 are formed in nuclear reactors; californium-253 is a β-emitter {{and the rest}} are α-emitters. The {{isotopes}} with even mass numbers (250Cf, 252Cf and 254Cf) have {{a high rate of}} spontaneous fission, especially 254Cf of which 99.7% decays by spontaneous fission. Californium-249 has a relatively long half-life (352 years), weak spontaneous fission and strong γ-emission that facilitates its identification. 249Cf is not formed in large quantities in a nuclear reactor because of the slow β-decay of the parent isotope 249Bk and a large cross section of interaction with neutrons, but it can be accumulated in the isotopically pure form as the β-decay product of (pre-selected) 249Bk. <b>Californium</b> produced by reactor-irradiation of plutonium mostly consists of 250Cf and 252Cf, the latter being predominant for large neutron fluences, and its study is hindered by the strong neutron radiation.|$|E
5|$|Traces of <b>californium</b> can {{be found}} near {{facilities}} that use the element in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments. The element is fairly insoluble in water, but it adheres well to ordinary soil; and concentrations {{of it in the}} soil can be 500 times higher than in the water surrounding the soil particles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{very small}} amounts of {{berkelium}} were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was first intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in December 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso, Stanley G. Thompson, and Kenneth Street, Jr.. They used the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. Similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of americium (element 95) and curium (element 96) in 1944, the new elements berkelium and <b>californium</b> (element 98) were both produced in 1949–1950.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy {{electrons and}} thus is relatively safe to handle. It decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of <b>californium</b> brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Californium</b> is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol Cf and atomic number98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, {{and has the}} second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see {{with the unaided eye}} (after einsteinium). The element was named after the university and the state of California.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the lighter}} {{actinides}} <b>californium,</b> berkelium, curium and americium which crystallize {{in a double}} hexagonal structure at ambient conditions, einsteinium {{is believed to have}} a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry with the space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 575 pm. However, there is a report of room-temperature hexagonal einsteinium metal with a = 398 pm and c = 650 pm, which converted to the fcc phase upon heating to 300°C.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of all {{elements}} {{is based on}} properties of earlier actinides, which show a much wider variety of chemistry (for instance, in range of oxidation states) within their series than the lanthanides, and comparisons to scandium and yttrium are even less useful. However, these elements are destabilized, {{and if they were}} stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws, they would be similar to lanthanides as well. Also, the later actinides from <b>californium</b> onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides, with only the valence +3 (and sometimes +2) shown.|$|E
5|$|ORNL resumed <b>californium</b> {{production}} in spring 2008. Hamilton noted the restart {{during the summer}} and made a deal on subsequent extraction of berkelium. During a September 2008 symposium at Vanderbilt (in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.) celebrating his 50th year on the Physics faculty, he introduced Oganessian to James Roberto (then the deputy director for science and technology at ORNL). They established a collaboration among JINR, ORNL, and Vanderbilt; the team at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in Livermore, California, U.S., was soon invited to join.|$|E
5|$|The above {{cascade of}} (n,γ) {{reactions}} produces {{a mixture of}} different curium isotopes. Their post-synthesis separation is cumbersome, and therefore a selective synthesis is desired. Curium-248 is favored for research purposes because of its long half-life. The most efficient preparation method of this isotope is via α-decay of the <b>californium</b> isotope 252Cf, which is available in relatively large quantities due to its long half-life (2.65 years). About 35–50mg of 248Cm is being produced by this method every year. The associated reaction produces 248Cm with isotopic purity of 97%.|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of nobelium {{are mostly}} produced by bombarding actinide targets (uranium, plutonium, curium, <b>californium,</b> or einsteinium), {{with the exception}} of nobelium-262, which is produced as the daughter of lawrencium-262. The most commonly used isotope, 255No, can be produced from bombarding curium-248 or californium-249 with carbon-12: the latter method is more common. Irradiating a 350μgcm−2 target of californium-249 with threetrillion (3×1012) 73MeV carbon-12 ions per second for ten minutes can produce around 1200 nobelium-255 atoms.|$|E
5|$|There is {{currently}} {{no use for}} any isotope of berkelium outside basic scientific research. Berkelium-249 is a common target nuclide to prepare still heavier transuranic elements and transactinides, such as lawrencium, rutherfordium and bohrium. It is also useful {{as a source of}} the isotope californium-249, which is used for studies on the chemistry of <b>californium</b> in preference to the more radioactive californium-252 that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the HFIR.|$|E
5|$|Two {{forms of}} {{berkelium}}(III) bromide are known, a monoclinic with berkelium coordination 6 and orthorhombic with coordination 8; {{the latter is}} less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about 350 °C. An important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied for these two crystal forms: the structures of fresh and aged 249BkBr3 samples were studied using X-ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years, so that various fractions of 249Bk had beta decayed to 249Cf. No change in structure was observed upon the 249BkBr3—249CfBr3 transformation, even though the orthorhombic bromide was previously unknown for <b>californium.</b> However, other differences were noted for 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3. For example, the latter could be reduced with hydrogen to249CfBr2, but the former could be not – this result was reproduced on individual 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3 samples, as well on the samples containing both bromides. The intergrowth of <b>californium</b> in berkelium occurs {{at a rate of}} 0.22% per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties. Besides a chemical contamination, 249Cf, as an alpha emitter brings undesirable self-damage of the crystal lattice due to the resulting self-heating. This can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating the obtained results.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Berkeley {{scientists}} {{claimed the}} discovery of element 103 in the reaction of <b>californium</b> with boron and carbon ions. They claimed {{the production of the}} isotope 257103, and also claimed to have synthesized an alpha decaying isotope of element 102 that had a half-life of 15s and alpha decay energy 8.2MeV. They assigned this to 255102 without giving a reason for the assignment. The values do not agree with those now known for 255No, although they do agree with those now known for 257No, and while this isotope probably played a part in this experiment its discovery was inconclusive.|$|E
