5|$|Two {{different}} kelly pool-based derivations for {{behind the}} eight ball {{are provided in}} diverse sources. As noted, in kelly pool each player is randomly assigned a specific ball of the fifteen ball rack, which must be made in numerical order. The game ends when any player makes his assigned ball. Based on these rules, one origin theory holds that when {{a large number of}} players are participating, players assigned balls numerically higher than 8that is, balls that are behind the 8 ball in orderhave little chance of winning. This {{is a result of the}} likelihood that random distribution will result in multiple players with assigned balls numbered lower than 8 having an opportunity to shoot first, and that with such large a number of players at least one will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with the opportunity to shoot at his assigned ball.|$|E
25|$|The Seder {{table is}} {{traditionally}} set with the finest place settings and silverware, {{and family members}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> dressed in their holiday clothes. There is a tradition for the person leading the Seder to wear a white robe called a kittel. For {{the first half of}} the Seder, each participant will only need a plate and a wine glass. At the head of the table is a Seder plate containing various symbolic foods that will be eaten or pointed out during the course of the Seder. Placed nearby is a plate with three matzot and dishes of salt water for dipping.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{empirical}} analysis cited by Shearer, past civil wars with negotiated settlements {{have had little}} success. He cites a study from John Stedman that notes between 1900 and 1980 85% of civil wars were solved by one side winning outright (this excludes colonial wars). 15% percent ended {{as a result of}} negotiation. Additionally, Roy Licklider's study supports these conclusions by noting the following:"From 1945 to 1989, 58 {{out of a total of}} 93 civil conflicts, as he categorised them, were settled in some form, while the remainder continued. However, only 14 (or 24 percent) of those settled were solved by negotiation. The others (76 percent) ended with military victories. Additionally, fighting resumed in seven of the 14 conflict which were initially ended by negotiation. The overall success rate of negotiated settlements, therefore, was around 12 percent out of the internal wars that ended."In Sierra Leone the Revolutionary United Front, led by Foday Sankoh, fought an ongoing and bloody civil war with the government from 1991 to 1996. The conflict attracted little international attention, but managed to devastate the country and destroy its economy. Neither belligerent was willing to concede or compromise on their demands, despite multiple attempts at a negotiated settlement. It was not until the intervention of the private military corporation Executive Outcomes and a reversal in the RUF's battlefield fortunes that Sankoh would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

500|$|Larry Flick from Billboard {{was also}} positive, and {{expected}} [...] "radio to hungrily <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and dine on this wickedly catchy jeep/pop jam in which La M unapologetically snaps at her more close-minded critics". He complimented her vocals which were [...] "playfully snide and aggressive, holding strong against a forceful hip-hop groove {{and a host}} of ear-pleasing funk guitar links and synth hoops". Author Chris Wade wrote in his book, The Music of Madonna, that [...] "Human Nature" [...] lifted the sadness emanated from the first few tracks from the album. [...] "There's a great beat to this, a brilliant vocal where Madonna answers herself with whispers and an unforgettable chorus," [...] Wade added. Matthew Rettenmund wrote in his Encyclopedia Madonnica that [...] "inspite of the chart performance", the song has become a modern [...] "self-empowerment anthem".|$|E
2500|$|With plants facing {{imminent}} closings, Mann, with Mark Masaoka, and UAW Local 645 president Pete Beltran {{initiated a}} coalition between labor, {{the community and}} the Campaign to Keep GM Van Nuys Open, which Mann chaired for ten years. [...] Five thousand workers (50 percent Latino, 15 percent black, and 15 percent women) built the coalition in Black and Latino communities, where the members lived. Threatened with a boycott, GM kept the plant open for ten years. Reverend Frank Higgins, Sr. described the negotiation of the labor/community coalition with GM president F. James McDonald, “For the first time they have seen a coalition form in this nation that would make them <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> They didn’t come to bargain; they came to deal with us as though we were children. They wound up leaving knowing they had a tiger by the tail!” ...|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics on {{the record}} were {{described}} by the band members as [...] "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." [...] Vig said they tried to deal with [...] "dark themes that I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and [...] "the art of self-destruction." [...] Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, [...] "everybody has ideas that <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and I just use what I fancy. When we're working on something, the lyrics take a while to work on and [...] come to me and say 'I've had these ideas, use them if you want' and if there's something I like, I'll stick it in with my own, or vice-versa. Some people come in going 'I've got this great title for a song' and I might use that." [...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked." ...|$|E
