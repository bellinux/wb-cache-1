5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor. These lava flows began to rise up out of the ancient ocean to form the Superior craton; the Superior <b>craton</b> later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American <b>craton.</b> The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American <b>craton.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, {{evidence}} of the earliest known life on land on Earth may {{have been found in}} 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara <b>Craton</b> of Western Australia. These findings may be helpful in deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet Mars.|$|E
5|$|Many {{varieties}} of Precambrian bedrock are exposed including: granite, basalt, greenstone, gneiss, {{as well as}} metamorphic rocks derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Greenstone of the Superior <b>craton</b> located near Ely, Minnesota, is up to 2.7billion years old. Igneous rocks of the Duluth Complex comprise the bedrock of the eastern Boundary Waters. Ancient microfossils {{have been found in}} the banded iron formations of the Gunflint Chert.|$|E
50|$|The African {{continental}} {{crust is}} generally cool and strong. Many <b>cratons</b> are {{found throughout the}} EAR, such as the Tanzania and Kaapvaal <b>cratons.</b> The <b>cratons</b> are thick, and have survived for billions of years with little tectonic activity. They are characterized by greenstone belts, tonalites, and other high-grade metamorphic lithologies. The <b>cratons</b> are of significant importance in terms of mineral resources, with major deposits of gold, antimony, iron, chromium and nickel.|$|R
5000|$|Remarkably similar lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic {{structural}} sequences {{between these}} two <b>cratons</b> have been noted for the period between 3.5 and 2.7 billion years ago. Paleomagnetic data from two ultramafic complexes in the <b>cratons</b> showed that at [...] the two <b>cratons</b> could {{have been part of}} the same supercontinent. Both the Pilbara and Kaapvaal <b>cratons</b> show extensional faults which were active about [...] during felsic volcanism and coeval with the impact layers.|$|R
50|$|Atlantica formed {{simultaneously}} with Nena at about 1.9 Ga from Archaean <b>cratons,</b> including Amazonia in present-day South America, and the Congo, West Africa and North Africa <b>Cratons</b> in Africa.|$|R
5|$|Texas is {{the southernmost}} {{part of the}} Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico. The {{continental}} crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic <b>craton</b> which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old.|$|E
5|$|The Penokean Mountain Range {{formed in}} the Penokean orogeny 1880 to 1830 million years ago, when an oceanic island arc called the Pembine–Wausau terrane {{collided}} with the southern margin of the Superior <b>craton.</b> From 1880 to 1850 million years ago, the region was volcanically active. This volcanism ceased 1850 million years ago when a fragment of Archean crust arrived from the South at the subduction zone. Collision of this Archean crust in the south with the Superior <b>craton</b> in the North caused a period of intense crustal shortening. Rocks of the Pembine–Wassau terrane were thrust up over and onto the Superior <b>craton,</b> forming a mountain range that covered all but the northernmost portion of Lake Superior, crossed parts of three US states (south-central Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan), and continued to the southernmost tip of Ontario, Canada. Loading of the lithosphere by these thrust sheets caused it to flex downwards, forming a foreland basin at around 1850 million {{years ago in the}} south and 1835 million years ago in the north. The Rove Formation was deposited in the northern basin. In the southern basin, crustal thickening caused high-grade metamorphism of the sedimentary fill by 1830 million years ago. A series of post-orogenic plutons intruded into the overlying rocks 1830 million years ago,; these plutons mark the end of the Penokean orogeny.|$|E
5|$|Until {{at least}} {{the end of the}} Middle Triassic, high sea levels enabled shallow water to cover much of the South China Block, a tectonic plate that today {{consists}} of the stable Yangtze <b>Craton</b> and the less stable South China Fold Belt. A mountain-building event known as the Indosinian orogeny uplifted Precambrian rocks to form four major landmasses on the South China Block: Khamdian to the west, Jiangnan in the centre, Yunkai to the south, and Cathaysia to the east. Island chains also stretched between Yunkai and Cathaysia in the east. Located between Khamdian and Jiangnan was a deep oceanic basin known as the Nanpanjiang Basin. Along the western edge of this basin, fossil-bearing sediments were laid down to become what are now the Lagerstätten (sedimentary deposits characterized by exemplary preservation) of Panxian, Luoping, and other localities.|$|E
50|$|The {{basement}} {{has been}} analyzed at the neighbouring centre of Cerro Rico, where Ordovician shales and other Cretaceous and Tertiary formations form {{much of the}} basement. Three different <b>cratons</b> named Arequipa-Antofalla, Brazilian and Pampean underpin Bolivia and the Huarina belt, which is the zone that separates these <b>cratons.</b> Rocks from the <b>cratons</b> have influenced the composition of Cerro Rico stocks.|$|R
50|$|Since then, many {{alternative}} reconstructions {{have been}} proposed for {{the configuration of the}} <b>cratons</b> in this supercontinent. Most of these reconstructions are based on the correlation of the orogens on different <b>cratons.</b> Though the configuration of the core <b>cratons</b> in Rodinia is now reasonably well known, recent reconstructions still differ in many details. Geologists try to decrease the uncertainties by collecting geological and paleomagnetical data.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the Archaean <b>cratons</b> is {{extremely}} complex and protracted. The <b>cratons</b> {{appear to have been}} assembled to form the greater Australian landmass in the late Archaean to mesoProterozoic, (~2400 Ma to 1,600 Ma).|$|R
5|$|During the Triassic {{period of}} some 251–199.6Ma, the Indian subcontinent {{was part of}} a vast supercontinent known as Pangaea. Despite its {{position}} within a high-latitude belt at 55–75°S—latitudes now occupied by parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, as opposed to India's current position between 5 and 35°N—India likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm and frost-free weather, though with well-defined seasons. India later merged into the southern supercontinent Gondwana, a process beginning some 550–500Ma. During the Late Paleozoic, Gondwana extended from a point at or near the South Pole to near the equator, where the Indian <b>craton</b> (stable continental crust) was positioned, resulting in a mild climate favourable to hosting high-biomass ecosystems. This is underscored by India's vast coal reserves—much of it from the late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence—the fourth-largest reserves in the world. During the Mesozoic, the world, including India, was considerably warmer than today. With the coming of the Carboniferous, global cooling stoked extensive glaciation, which spread northwards from South Africa towards India; this cool period lasted well into the Permian.|$|E
25|$|The Circum-Superior Belt {{was formed}} 1,884to 1,864million {{years ago when}} the Superior <b>craton</b> was {{surrounded}} by mountain building processes, including the Trans-Hudson, New Quebec and Penokean orogenies. The major Trans-Hudson orogeny had its appearance when the Superior <b>craton</b> collided with the Rae-Hearne <b>craton</b> 1,900to 1,800million years ago. Massive orogenic belts with a change in horizontal direction are represented by the double promontory structure of the Superior <b>craton</b> that seem to have come from the beginning of a rifting event. The New Quebec orogen, also known as the Labrador Trough, lies at the northeastern portion of the Superior <b>craton</b> and is related to ocean closure and collision with the southeastern portion of the Rae <b>craton.</b> At 1,900and 1,800million years ago, an ocean closure and collision with the Wisconian arc terrane resulted {{in the creation of the}} Penokean orogeny at the southern Superior <b>craton</b> margin. The last collision occurred on the southeastern portion of the Superior <b>craton</b> to produce the Grenville orogeny 1,100million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The Yilgarn <b>Craton</b> is Australia's premier mineral province. It attracts {{more than}} half of Australia's {{minerals}} exploration expenditure, and produces two thirds of all gold and most of the nickel mined in Australia. The <b>craton</b> contains some 30% of the world's known gold reserves, about 20% of the world's nickel reserves, 80% of the world's tantalum reserves, considerable iron ore, copper, zinc and minor lead reserves. The <b>craton</b> contains significant platinum, vanadium, hard-rock titanium and considerable iron ore resources.|$|E
50|$|Other {{scientists}} {{dispute the}} existence of Vaalbara and explain similarities between the two <b>cratons</b> {{as the product of}} global processes. They point to, for example, thick volcanic deposits on other <b>cratons</b> such as Amazonia, São Francisco, and Karnataka.|$|R
50|$|Zimgarn, another {{proposed}} supercraton {{composed of}} the Zimbabwe and Yilgarn <b>cratons</b> at 2.41 Ga, is distinct from Vaalbara. Zimgarn should have disintegrated around 2.1-2.0 Ga to reassemble as the Kalahari and West Australian (Yilgarn and Pilbara) <b>cratons</b> around 1.95-1.8 Ga.|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of the depth extent of mantle high-velocity zones under ancient <b>cratons</b> by using seismic velocity maps from recent mantle tomographic studies. We divided old continents into two age provinces: 800 – 1700 Ma (Middle Proterozoic) and older than 1700 Ma (Archean and Early Proterozoic). The areas included in these age provinces are cross-correlated with the tomography at different depths to quantify the global occurrence of high-velocity anomaly (HVA) extensions beneath <b>cratons.</b> Statistically significant HVAs underlie the oldest <b>cratons</b> to a depth of 250 km. There is no significant consistent correlation between tomography and younger <b>cratons.</b> The older <b>cratons</b> have correlated HVAs extending to depths varying from < 100 to 450 km. There is {{no significant difference in the}} average velocity anomaly beneath the Early Proterozoic part and the Archean part of the Canadian Shield, whereas the Middle Proterozoic part does not contain any HVA. The mantle under Early Precambrian crust is distinctly different from mantle elsewhere. We propose two different hypotheses to explain these results: (1) <b>cratons</b> of Early Proterozoic age or older contain ancient and deep, physically attached roots, or (2) these <b>cratons</b> contain a small “permanent” physical root that induces cold downwellings beneath it. A root thickness of ∼ 200 km can be explained by an FeO-poor, olivine-rich mineralogy, whereas a requirement of high strength probably demands, in addition, a volatile-poor composition. Different root depths for <b>cratons</b> of similar age may be related to their location in the various supercontinents in which they were involved, and to their subsequent deformational history, or they may represent different snapshots in time of transient “roots,” such as thermal boundary layers...|$|R
25|$|The Yilgarn <b>Craton</b> {{is bound}} {{on all sides}} by younger terranes of various ages, but {{predominantly}} of Proterozoic age. The boundaries between the various flanking terranes provide considerable evidence of the post-Archaean events which have involved the Yilgarn <b>Craton.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Murchison Province {{is exposed}} {{in the western}} and {{northern}} third of the Yilgarn <b>Craton.</b> The Province is bounded by major transcrustal structures which separate it from the surrounding tectonic provinces of the <b>craton</b> and the Western Gneiss Belt.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the start}} of the Cryogenian, around 750 Ma, the <b>cratons</b> that made up the supercontinent Rodinia started to rift apart. The superocean Mirovia began to close while the superocean Panthalassa began to form. The <b>cratons</b> (possibly) later {{assembled}} into another supercontinent called Pannotia, in the Ediacaran.|$|R
40|$|The {{buoyancy}} {{and strength}} of sub-continental lithospheric mantle is thought to protect the oldest continental crust (<b>cratons)</b> from destruction by plate tectonic processes.

50|$|The Damara Orogeny {{was part}} of the Pan-African orogeny. It {{involved}} the suturing of the Congo-São Francisco and Río de la Plata <b>cratons</b> at 580-550 Ma (together with India forming northern Gondwana) before the amalgamation of the Kalahari and Mawson <b>cratons</b> in the Kuunga-Damara orogeny at 530 Ma (southern Gondwana).|$|R
25|$|The Pilbara <b>Craton</b> {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{pristine}} Archaean 3.6-2.7 Ga (billion years ago) crusts identified on the Earth, along with the Kaapvaal <b>Craton</b> in South Africa. Both locations may have once been part of the Vaalbara Supercontinent or the continent of Ur.|$|E
25|$|The bulk of Western Australia {{consists}} of the extremely old Yilgarn <b>craton</b> and Pilbara <b>craton</b> which merged with the Deccan Plateau of India, Madagascar and the Karoo and Zimbabwe cratons of Southern Africa, in the Archean Eon to form Ur, {{one of the oldest}} supercontinents on Earth (3 – 3.2 billion years ago). In May 2017, evidence of the earliest known life on land may have been found in 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara <b>craton.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Pilbara <b>Craton</b> is very geologically {{significant}} {{due to its}} age and {{the types}} of lithology found within it. Within the Eastern Pilbara <b>Craton</b> there are 2 distinct lithologic divisions: (1), early Earth crust (3.8–3.53 Ga); (2), intrusive granitic domes along with greenstone belts (3.53–3.23 Ga). What separates this East Pilbara terrane {{from the rest of the}} Pilbara region are regional unconformities and that these rocks were once part of or deposited on the original Pilbara <b>Craton</b> and are still exposed today. These groups not only differ in relative age, but also in composition.|$|E

25|$|The Yilgarn <b>Craton</b> {{is a large}} <b>craton</b> that {{constitutes}} {{the bulk of the}} Western Australian land mass. It is bounded by a mixture of sedimentary basins and Proterozoic fold and thrust belts. Zircon grains in the Jack Hills, Narryer Terrane have been dated at ~4.27 Ga, with one detrital zircon dated as old as 4.4 Ga.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Pilbara <b>Craton</b> is {{the eastern}} {{portion of the}} Pilbara <b>Craton</b> located in Western Australia. This region {{contains}} variably metamorphosed mafic and ultramafic greenstone belt rocks, intrusive granitic dome structures, and volcanic sedimentary rocks. These greenstone belts worldwide {{are thought to be}} the remnants of ancient volcanic belts, and are subject to much debate in today's scientific community. Areas such as Isua and Barberton which have similar lithologies and ages as Pilbara have been argued to be subduction accretion arcs, while others suggest that they are the result of vertical tectonics. This debate is crucial to investigating when/how plate tectonics began on Earth. The Pilbara <b>Craton</b> along with the Kaapvaal <b>Craton</b> are the only remaining areas of the Earth with pristine 3.6–2.5 Ga crust. The extremely old and rare nature of this crustal region makes it a valuable resource in the understanding of the evolution of the Archean Earth.|$|E

40|$|Heat {{flow from}} Archean <b>cratons</b> {{worldwide}} is typically lower than from younger mobile belts surrounding them. The contrast in heat flow between <b>cratons</b> and mobile belts has been attributed {{in previous studies}} to the greater thermal resistance of thicker lithosphere beneath the <b>cratons</b> which impedes the flow of mantle heat through the <b>cratons</b> and forces more mantle heat to escape through thinner mobile belt lithosphere. This interpretation is based on thermal models which employ a parameterized convection algorithm to calculate heat transfer in the sublithospheric mantle. We test this interpretation by comparing thermal models constructed using the parameterized convection scheme with models developed using an algorithm for full thermal convection. We show that thermal models constructed using the two different convection algorithms yield similar surface heat flow and thermal structure to moderate depths within the lithosphere. Therefore, we conclude that {{the interpretation of the}} heat-flow observations in terms of thicker lithosphere under Archean <b>cratons</b> than under mobile belts is robust in the sense that surface heat flow is not sensitive to the details of heat transfer within the convecting mantle and how deep mantle heat is delivered {{to the base of the}} lithosphere...|$|R
