50|$|Prior to the {{founding}} of the United States Submarine Veterans, Inc. (USSVI), there existed another U.S. submarine veterans association, the United States Submarine Veterans of World War II which still exists today. Founded in July 1955, membership in this organization is limited to submarine <b>crews</b> and <b>relief</b> <b>crews</b> who were on active duty from December 1, 1941 through September 1, 1945. As this organization grew, so did the development and deployment of American submarines across the globe, and it became apparent to many that there was a need and a strong desire for a new organization to include submariners of all eras.|$|R

It even had a <b>relief</b> <b>tube</b> {{in the shape of}} a funnel. The armored glass was very strong, extremely thick. The armor on the back was also thick. The oxygen equipment was reliable, although the mask was quite small, only covering the nose and mouth. We wore that mask only at high altitude. The HF radio set was powerful, reliable and clear."

50|$|The C-121A {{versions}} {{differed from}} the L-749 only through having a reinforced floor to handle cargo, and a large aft loading door.

25|$|In {{the third}} week of December 1925, the weather was atrocious. The Raz de Sein was always in full swing, leaving no {{breathing}} space to the men.

This traffic, along with the people leaving places around the Murrah Building clogged streets, delaying the arrival of rescue <b>crews</b> and <b>relief</b> agencies.|$|R

50|$|As World War II {{drew to a}} close, large {{quantities}} of military surplus became available on the civilian market along with the cancellation of the remaining C-69 Constellations still in production. With the Constellation's design at risk, Lockheed purchased the five remaining C-69 transports still in production back from the military, saving 15,000 jobs. The five aircraft were re-converted into L-049 civilian airliners and put up for sale on the market. These modifications included removal of the retractable tail stand; along with {{the inclusion of a}} luxury interior, more portholes, a galley, and <b>crew</b> <b>relief</b> areas. Better ventilation, insulation and heating were also added. The powerplants were replaced by R-3350-745C18BA-1 engines (the civilian equivalent to the wartime R-3350-35). Design tests {{did not need to be}} conducted, as Lockheed had already tasked them to the C-69 aircraft during the war (one of the C-69s also completed the trials for the civilian airworthiness certificate on December 11, 1945). This made the development of L-049 months ahead of the competing Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, Douglas DC-6 and Republic RC-2 Rainbow (which was still on the drawing board). 89 aircraft had been ordered by November 1945. The L-049 was used by TWA, Delta, Capital, Braniff, Pan American World Airways, American Overseas Airlines (AOA), Pan American-Grace Airways (Panagra), Air France, KLM, BOAC, El Al, Cubana de Aviación, and other less-known airlines.|$|R
