25|$|In the 21st century, {{multi-core}} CPUs became commercially available. <b>Content-addressable</b> memory (CAM) {{has become}} inexpensive {{enough to be}} used in networking, and is frequently used for on-chip cache memory in modern microprocessors, although no computer system has yet implemented hardware CAMs for use in programming languages. Currently, CAMs (or associative arrays) in software are programming-language-specific. Semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures, and manufacturers prove their processes on them; this allows price reductions on memory products. During the 1980s, CMOS logic gates developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types; computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically. Unlike the continuous current draw of a gate based on other logic types, a CMOS gate only draws significant current during the 'transition' between logic states, except for leakage.|$|E

2500|$|Linear time is {{the best}} {{possible}} time complexity in situations where the algorithm has to sequentially read its entire input. Therefore, much research has been invested into discovering algorithms exhibiting linear time or, at least, nearly linear time. This research includes both software and hardware methods. [...] There are several hardware technologies which exploit parallelism to provide this. An example is <b>content-addressable</b> memory. This concept of linear time is used in string matching algorithms such as the Boyer-Moore Algorithm and Ukkonen's Algorithm.|$|E
2500|$|Earlier {{models of}} memory are {{primarily}} {{based on the}} postulates of Hebbian learning.

These attempts are primarily focusing on the formation of medium- and long-term memory, localizing in the hippocampus. Models of working memory, relying on theories of network oscillations and persistent activity, have been built to capture some features of the prefrontal cortex in context-related memory.|$|E
50|$|<b>Content-addressable</b> storage, also {{referred}} to as associative storage or abbreviated CAS, is a mechanism for storing information that can be retrieved based on its content, not its storage location.
