5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity.

Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.|$|E

25|$|To pave way {{for such}} {{reservation}} scheme, the Constitution of India was amended (the 93rd Constitutional Amendment, originally drafted as 104th Amendment Bill). In 2006, the UPA government promised to implement 27% reservation for OBCs in institutes {{of higher education}} (twenty central universities, the IITs, IIMs and AIIMS) after 2006 Assembly elections.

25|$|Plants make {{cholesterol}} in {{very small}} amounts. Plants manufacture phytosterols (substances chemically similar to cholesterol), which <b>can</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption. When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, {{in place of}} cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the GI tract, an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant sterols and stanols, ranges between ~200–300mg/day depending on eating habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700mg/day.|$|E

25|$|There {{is clearly}} a demand for {{sustainable}} biofuel production, but whether a particular biofuel will be used ultimately depends not on sustainability but cost efficiency. Therefore, research is focusing on cutting the cost of algal biofuel production {{to the point where}} it <b>can</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> conventional petroleum. The production of several products from algae has been mentioned as the most important factor for making algae production economically viable. Other factors are the improving of the solar energy to biomass conversion efficiency (currently 3%, but 5 to 7% is theoretically attainable)and making the oil extraction from the algae easier.|$|E

25|$|Farmed {{salmonids}} can, {{and often}} do, escape from sea cages. If the farmed salmonid is not native, it <b>can</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> native wild species {{for food and}} habitat. If the farmed salmonid is native, it can interbreed with the wild native salmonids. Such interbreeding can reduce genetic diversity, disease resistance and adaptability. In 2004, about 500,000 salmon and trout escaped from ocean net pens off Norway. Around Scotland, 600,000 salmon were released during storms. Commercial fishermen targeting wild salmon not infrequently catch escaped farm salmon. At one stage, in the Faroe Islands, 20 to 40 percent of all fish caught were escaped farm salmon.|$|E
25|$|For {{multicellular}} {{organisms that}} develop in a womb, the physical interference or {{presence of other}} similarly developing organisms such as twins can result in the two cellular masses being integrated into a larger whole, with the combined cells attempting to continue to develop {{in a manner that}} satisfies the intended growth patterns of both cell masses. The two cellular masses <b>can</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> each other, and may either duplicate or merge various structures. This results in conditions such as conjoined twins, and the resulting merged organism may die at birth when it must leave the life-sustaining environment of the womb and must attempt to sustain its biological processes independently.|$|E
25|$|Class I RNR can be {{inhibited}} by peptides {{similar to}} the C-terminus of RNR2. These peptides <b>can</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> RNR2 for binding to RNR1, {{and as a result}} RNR1 does not form an enzymatically active complex with RNR2. Although the C-terminus of RNR2 proteins is different across species, RNR2 can interact with RNR1 across species. When the mouse RNR2 C-terminus was replaced with the E. coli RNR2 C-terminal (7 or 33) amino acid residues, the chimeric RNR2 subunit still binds to mouse RNR1 subunits. However, they lack enzymatic activity due probably to the elimination of residues involved in the transfer of the free radical electron from the RNR2 to the RNR1 subunit.|$|E

25|$|In {{the example}} {{shown to the}} left, ligand-binding curves are shown for two ligands with {{different}} binding affinities. Ligand binding is often characterized {{in terms of the}} concentration of ligand at which half of the receptor binding sites are occupied, known as the IC50, which is related to but different from the dissociation constant. The ligand illustrated by the red curve has a higher binding affinity and smaller Kd than the ligand illustrated by the green curve. If these two ligands were present at the same time, more of the higher-affinity ligand would be bound to the available receptor binding sites. This is how carbon monoxide <b>can</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> oxygen in binding to hemoglobin, resulting in carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
25|$|A Bulletin Board System, or BBS, is a {{computer}} system running software that allows users to connect and log into the system using a terminal program.

Many BBSes also offer on-line games, in which users <b>can</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other. CBBS, the first Bulletin Board System, was invented by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess in Chicago, becoming fully operational on February 16, 1978.|$|E
25|$|The open {{canopy of}} cumin is another problem. Only a low {{proportion}} of the incoming light is absorbed. The leaf area index (LAI) of cumin is low (about 1.5). This might be a problem because weeds <b>can</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> cumin for essential resources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. The slow growth and a short stature of cumin favours weed competition additionally. Two hoeing and weeding sessions (30 and 60 days after sowing) are needed for the control of weeds. During the first weeding session (30 days after sowing), thinning should be done, as well, to remove excess plants. The use of preplant or pre-emergence herbicides is very effective in India, but this kind of herbicide application requires soil moisture for a successful weed control.|$|E
