We apply multiple versions of these optimizations to selected SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks at base optimization levels used for SPEC reporting.

50|$|A {{signature}} file {{is a technique}} that creates a quick and dirty filter, for example a Bloom filter, that will keep all the documents that match to the query and hopefully a few ones that do not. The way this is done is by creating for each file a signature, typically a hash <b>coded</b> <b>version.</b> One method is superimposed coding. A post-processing step is done to discard the false alarms. Since in most cases this structure is inferior to inverted files in terms of speed, size and functionality, it is not used widely.

40|$|Abstract. Ensuring {{that every}} sensor node {{has the same}} <b>code</b> <b>version</b> is {{challenging}} in dynamic, unreliable multi-hop sensor networks. When nodes have different <b>code</b> <b>versions,</b> the network may not behave as intended, wasting time and energy. We propose and evaluate DHV, an efficient code consistency maintenance protocol to ensure that every node in a network will eventually have the same code. DHV {{is based on the}} simple observation that if two <b>code</b> <b>versions</b> are different, their corresponding version numbers often differ in only a few least significant bits of their binary representation. DHV allows nodes to carefully select and transmit only necessary bit level information to detect a newer <b>code</b> <b>version</b> in the network. DHV can detect and identify version differences in O(1) messages and latency compared to the logarithmic scale of current protocols. Simulations and experiments on a real MicaZ testbed show that DHV reduces the number of messages by 50 %, converges in half the time, and reduces the number of bits transmitted by 40 - 60 % compared to DIP, the state-of-the-art protocol. Key words: Code consistency, network reprogramming, sensor networks...|$|R

Towards this end, both original speech and its <b>coded</b> <b>version</b> are transformed from the timedomain to a perceptual-domain using a cochlear model. This perceptual-domain representation provides information pertaining to the probability-of-firings in the neural channels. We introduce a cochlear discrimination measure which compares these firing probabilit. ies in an information-theoretic sense. This measure, in essence, evaluates the neural-firing cross-entropy of the coded speech with respect {{to that of the}} original one.

However, the effort required in developing real-time applications that require high-performance and high input/output bandwidth for the HPC systems is still difficult.

This paper briefly describes the SAGE tool suite, which {{is followed by a}} detailed description of the SAGE automatic code generation and run-time components used for COTS based heterogeneous HPC platform.

We characterize the achievable average distortion and we find necessary and sufficient conditions under which systematic communication does not incur loss of optimality. The Wyner-Ziv rate distortion theorem plays a fundamental role in our setting. The general result is applied to several scenarios.
