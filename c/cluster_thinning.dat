The explanation is usually that our women have not the skill to cultivate it--the art to direct through a smiling land, between suggestive shores, a sinuous stream of talk. My affectionate, my pious memory of Mr. Offord contradicts this induction only, I fear, more insidiously to confirm it. The sallow and slightly smoked drawing-room in which he spent so large {{a portion of the}} last years of his life certainly deserved the distinguished name; {{but on the other hand}} it couldn't be said at all to owe its stamp to any intervention throwing into relief the fact that there was no Mrs. Offord. The dear man had indeed, at the most, been capable of one of those sacrifices to which women are deemed peculiarly apt: he had recognised--under the influence, in some degree, it is true, of physical infirmity--that if you wish people to find you at home you must manage not to be out. He had in short accepted the truth which many dabblers in the social art are slow to learn, that you must really, as they say, take a line, and that the only way as yet discovered of being at home is to stay at home. Finally his own fireside had become a summary of his habits. Why should he ever have left it?--since this would have been leaving what was notoriously pleasantest in London, the compact charmed <b>cluster</b> (<b>thinning</b> away indeed into casual couples) round the fine old last-century chimney-piece which, with the exception of the remarkable collection of miniatures, was the best thing the place contained.

In the case of Verdejo variety, {{it is necessary to}} know its response to the reduction of the number of clusters per vine in order to regulate the production and improve the grape quality. During the period 2012 – 2014, the application of <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> has been studied, by means of a treatment (A) of removing 27 % of clusters, in comparison with a reference treatment (T) without thinning. The trial has been developed with vines of cv. Verdejo on 110 R rootstock, planted in 2006 and trellised on bilateral Royat cordon. Vine distances were 2. 60 m × 1. 25 m (3077 plants/ ha).

30|$|<b>Cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> is {{described}} as the suppression of flowers or clusters before full maturation [14]. Therefore, <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> has a direct effect on the source/sink ratio; having less sinks (fruits) photosynthetic assimilation might be improved, increasing grape quality [15]. It inducts physiological adjustments in the plant, improving the maturation’s kinetics. Plus, this operation improves canopy sanitary conditions as thinning allows more enlightenment and fresh air penetration in the vegetation and clusters [16]. Cluster thinning’s most evident effect is apparently crop load reduction, but its decrease is not equivalent to the thinning’s intensity. Martins [17] found that, for the same intensity of thinning, in two consecutive years, the decline in production has been uneven. In fact, the vine compensates the stack lost, increasing the berry’s volume and weight [18]. For this reason, Climaco et al. [19] suggests that <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> must only be executed in the years when vineyards have such a fertility that may possibly undermine production quality. <b>Cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> advances grape maturity, improves grape quality, and also influences the chromatic characteristic of the wine [20].|$|E

The objectives were: 1) to identify odour-active compounds using gas chromatographic and sensory analysis; 2) to determine the effect of CL and HD on these compounds; 3) to determine the icewine sensory profiles; 4) to correlate analytical and sensory results for an overall icewine profile. CharmAnalysis™ determined the Top 15 odour-potent compounds in Vidal and Riesling icewine and table wines; 24 and 23 compounds, respectively. The majority of the compounds had the highest concentrations in the icewines compared to table wines. These compounds were used as the foundation for assessing differences in icewine chemical profiles from different HD and CL. Vidal and Riesling icewine were made from grapes picked at different HD; HI : 19 December; H 2 : 29 December; H 3 : 18 January; H 4 : 11 February (Vidal only). HI wines differed from H 3 and H 4 wines in both Vidal and Riesling for aroma compounds and sensory profiles. - Three·CL [control (fully cropped), <b>cluster</b> <b>thin</b> at fruit set to one basal cluster/shoot (TFS), and <b>cluster</b> <b>thin</b> at veraison to one basal cluster/shoot (TV) ] were evaluated for Riesling and Vidal cultivars over two seasons.

30|$|Objectives of the {{research}} program were to study the effect of some environmental and physiological aspects on the intensity of flavonoid synthesis. The {{study was conducted in}} 2011 in Podgorica, Montenegro. Two grapevine cultivars were selected to compare their ability in flavonoid accumulation: autochtonous variety Vranac, with moderate accumulation of flavonoids and Cabernet Sauvignon with good accumulation of polyphenols. The following experimental treatments were compared: early leaf removal (flowering time), <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> (veraison time) and combination of both treatments. The early defoliation reduced the yield per vine in Cabernet Sauvignon and Vranac. In Cabernet Sauvignon, defoliation initially delayed berry growth, but at harvest, only the treatment ‘defoliation-cluster thinning’ had significantly lower berry weight. In cultivar Vranac, defoliation did not modify the berry growth and berry weight. In both varieties, <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> had no effect on the berry weight. In the treatment ‘defoliated-thinned’, reduction of the cluster weight, berry weight, and berry number per cluster is observed. This is probably the consequence of a lower fruit set, where the defoliation had a greater impact on the first cluster. Cabernet Sauvignon showed a greater reactivity to the applied techniques, compared to Vranac. At harvest, no damaged bunches (caused by sunburn) were found in defoliated treatment. Early defoliation and <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> in both varieties raised the concentration of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. The enhanced contents of these compounds per berry in grape variety Vranac are the result of increased synthesis, while in Cabernet sauvignon variety, increased content was due to the less berry weight. Defoliation and <b>cluster</b> <b>thinning</b> led to better soluble solid accumulation than in the control sets (no treatments applied). The skin extracts contained the highest content of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins in the treatment defoliated-thinned followed by the treatment thinned, while these contents were higher in wines from the vineyards where defoliation was applied. It could be due to better extraction of these compounds during winemaking.

Prefixation of glycerol-treated cells with glutaraldehyde prevents the formation of these particle clusters, and unfixed nonglycerinated cells show no <b>clusters.</b> <b>Thin</b> sections of cells exposed to glycerol or DMSO without previous fixation exhibit bizarre membrane alterations and numerous other degenerative changes. These observations stress the importance of prefixation of lymphoid cells before exposure to glycerol or DMSO, as well as indicate that the membrane characteristics of certain cell types may be probed by glycerol treatment of unfixed cells...|$|R
50|$|This tall, robust, {{leafless}} {{aquatic plant}} can grow 4 to 5 m high. It forms a grass-like clump of triangular green stems that rise up from thick, woody rhizomes. Each stem is {{topped by a}} dense <b>cluster</b> of <b>thin,</b> bright green, thread-like stems around 10 to 30 cm in length, resembling a feather duster when the plant is young. Greenish-brown flower clusters eventually appear {{at the ends of}} the rays, giving way to brown, nut-like fruits.|$|R
