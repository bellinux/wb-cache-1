5|$|While {{connector}} interfaces <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> {{to allow}} plugging with either orientation, {{the original design}} omitted such functionality to decrease manufacturing costs. The reversible type-C plug is an addition to the USB3.1 specification comparable in size to the Micro-B SuperSpeed connector.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} such motif is the double {{crossover}} (DX) complex, which contains two Holliday junctions {{in close proximity}} to each other, resulting in a rigid structure that can self-assemble into larger arrays. The structure of the DX molecule forces the Holliday junctions to adopt a conformation with the double-helical domains directly side-by-side, in contrast to their preferred angle of about 60°. The complex <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> to force the junctions into either a parallel or antiparallel orientation, but in practice the antiparallel variety are more well-behaved, and the parallel version is rarely used.|$|E

5000|$|These {{arbitrary}} values <b>can</b> thus <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> with {{efficiency in}} mind - by selecting values that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used as direct indexes to data or function pointers.

5|$|Vertical {{broaching}} machines <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> for push broaching, pull-down broaching, pull-up broaching, or surface broaching. Push {{broaching machines}} {{are similar to}} an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of broaching machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface broaching is done on a vertical machine.|$|E
5|$|Developments in AspectJ have {{revealed}} {{the potential to}} incorporate just-in-time compilation into the execution of aspect-oriented code to address performance demands. At run-time, an aspect weaver could translate aspects in a more efficient manner than traditional, static weaving approaches. Using AspectJ on a Java Virtual Machine, dynamic weaving of aspects at run-time {{has been shown to}} improve code performance by 26%. While some implementations of just-in-time virtual machines implement this capability through a new virtual machine, some implementations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> to use features that already exist in current virtual machines. The requirement of a new virtual machine is contrary to one of the original design goals of AspectJ.|$|E
5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E

25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} {{are used}} in many audio applications. The drivers in horn loudspeakers can be very small, even for bass frequencies where conventional loudspeakers {{would need to be}} very large for equivalent performance. Horn loudspeakers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> to reproduce a wide range of frequencies using a single, small driver; to some extent these <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> without requiring a crossover.

25|$|These {{approaches}} {{utilize the}} concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or supramolecular chemistry to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a bottom-up approach. The concept of molecular recognition is especially important: molecules <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to non-covalent intermolecular forces. The Watson–Crick basepairing rules are {{a direct result of}} this, as is the specificity of an enzyme being targeted to a single substrate, or the specific folding of the protein itself. Thus, two or more components <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.|$|E
