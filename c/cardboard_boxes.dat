5|$|Han Sai Por {{was born}} on 19 July 1943 in Singapore during the Japanese occupation. She was one of six {{children}} of a poor couple, and her family were squatters living in Changi in a house made of <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes</b> and coconut leaves. Nonetheless, Han had a happy childhood, {{and went to a}} nearby beach to make figurine animals out of sand. This experience helped her to appreciate nature and instilled in her a sense of adventure and exploration. At ten years of age, Han was introduced to Michelangelo's sculptures through a book given to her by her mother.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} and Welsh employment bodies funded and subsidized external businesses to locate new ventures within the valleys {{to replace the}} vanishing heavy industries. The first attempt to bring in business not connected to the coal mining industry began in the 1920s when David Jones, Town Clerk to the Rhondda Urban Council, gained government support in attracting outside businesses to the area. Companies included Alfred Polikoff's clothing factory, Messers Jacob Beatus, manufacturing <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes</b> and Electrical and Musical Industries Ltd. Following {{the end of the}} Second World War, 23 companies were set up in the Rhondda Valleys, eighteen of them sponsored by the Board of Trade. Most companies had periods of growth and collapse, notably Thorn EMI in the 1970s and Burberry in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|The C5 was {{launched}} on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in North London. The event was staged in Sinclair's usual glitzy style, with girls handing out press packs {{and a variety}} of promotional giveaways: magazines, hats, pullovers, T-shirts, key rings, sun visors, badges, mugs, bags, and even a C5 video game. The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by girls dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes,</b> drove around the arena, and lined up side by side. Sinclair announced the launch of a £3 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign. The C5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of £399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.|$|E
5000|$|So {{prevalent}} is the <b>cardboard</b> <b>box's</b> {{reputation as}} a plaything that in 2005 a <b>cardboard</b> <b>box</b> {{was added to the}} National Toy Hall of Fame in the US, one of very few non-brand-specific toys to be honoured with inclusion. As a result, a toy [...] "house" [...] (actually a log cabin) made from a large <b>cardboard</b> <b>box</b> was added to the Hall, housed at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York.|$|R
50|$|The band {{released}} three music videos; {{the last}} {{of which is the}} video for Fever (from the Master of Imperfection album) which features the band being chased by domo-kun esque <b>cardboard</b> <b>box</b> monsters after they inadvertently anger a <b>cardboard</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
50|$|During missions, {{the player}} {{controls}} only one squad member at a time. Squad members {{not in use}} will hide themselves inside a <b>cardboard</b> <b>box,</b> and can be swapped into play when the player-controlled character finds a hiding spot, {{where he or she}} will hide in a <b>cardboard</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
5|$|To {{meet the}} game's {{projected}} release date of December 19, 1986, {{the staff members}} worked overtime and often stayed in the office at night. They used torn <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes</b> as beds, and covered themselves in curtains to resist the low temperatures of the unheated development building. Eventually, Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was finished and entered production a mere {{three days before the}} release date. Several ideas for additional stages had to be dropped because of these scheduling conflicts. In February and July 1987, respectively, a cartridge-based version was published for the NES in Europe and North America under the name Kid Icarus. For this release, the graphics of the ending were updated, and staff credits were added to the game. Unlike Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena, which saves the player's progress on the Disk Card, Kid Icarus uses a password system to return to a game after the console was turned off. In August 2004, Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was re-released as part of the Famicom Mini Disk System Selection for the Game Boy Advance. The game was published internationally for the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007. The North American, European and Australian versions of this digital release have the cheat codes of the NES version removed.|$|E
5|$|The episodes took {{seventeen}} days to film, where normally crew {{are given}} eight days to film a week's worth of episodes. Between forty and forty-five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode, including assistant directors, a design department, cameras, lighting, sound, make up, costume, visual effects, fire safety officers and a stunt team {{consisting of a}} stunt co-ordinator and stunt doubles. Filming was done with four television cameras, a steadicam and a dolly. The exterior fire scenes were filmed first, in five night shoots lasting until 4a.m., and the real exterior set was burnt. Safety was the top priority for the fire scenes, and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected. Stunt doubles wore flame-proof gel on their faces and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder, several layers of <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes</b> were stacked {{on the ground for}} the stunt doubles to fall onto. For filming the final explosion scene, all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for their reactions. The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios, two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off, which also affected a live broadcast of Big Brother. The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain. The explosion was completed in a third take. Despite the delay, the scenes were completed on schedule. Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears.|$|E

25|$|Litter {{consists}} of waste products {{that have been}} disposed improperly, without consent, at an inappropriate location. Litter {{can also be used}} as a verb.

25|$|Just like <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes</b> and pallets, these {{containers}} are a {{means to}} bundle cargo and goods into larger, unitized loads, {{that can be easily}} handled, moved, and stacked, and that will pack tightly in a ship or yard. Intermodal containers share a number of key construction features to withstand the stresses of intermodal shipping, to facilitate their handling and to allow stacking, as well as being identifiable through their individual, unique ISO 6346 reporting mark.|$|E
25|$|The media {{coverage}} of the murders reached Acremant's mother, who had moved to Medford three weeks earlier with her son. Believing her son had committed the murders, she called a police tip line and told police of her suspicion, based on her son's behavior and his resemblance to the composite sketch. She also showed police the labels of <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes</b> used during her move to Medford with Acremant. Police matched the address labels to those on the boxes used to cover the women's bodies.|$|E

25|$|Rubino's Pizzeria, {{mentioned}} in Be True to Your School, has become famous for barely changing since its {{opening in the}} early 1950s. Rubino's does not deliver, and only accepts cash or checks. The Main Street address is its only location and has always been independently run. Known for its thin crust pizza, carryout pizzas are packaged in paper rather than <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes.</b> Interestingly enough, Rubino's was founded {{by a man named}} Rubin Cohen. Another long-standing family-run business is Johnson's Real Ice Cream just east of the pizzeria.|$|E
25|$|The {{first group}} of Task Force Dagger {{included}} seven members of the CIA's Special Activities Division and Counter Terrorist Center (CTC), led by Gary Schroen who formed the Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team. The CIA team infiltrated Afghanistan into the Panjshir Valley, north of Kabul, on 26 September, only 15 days after the 11 September attacks. They brought three <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes</b> filled with $3 million in $100 bills to buy support. Known by the callsign Jawbreaker, it linked up with Northern Alliance commanders and prepared for the introduction of Army Special Forces into the region.|$|E
25|$|Seattle Box and Tacoma Box sought new {{products}} and more efficient ways to produce them. Wooden boxes continued {{to be the main}} product, but paper and corrugated <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes</b> were beginning to affect demand. The Tacoma plant set up a round conveyor system, which was then also implemented in the Seattle plant. The company adopted a new system for coloring boxes in 1957, and in 1958, began using clamp gluing and bulk shipping fasteners developed by North American Aviation. The Seattle and Tacoma plants both needed continuous foundation repairs.|$|E

Each of them will be protected with a wrapping paper, and the ends made an ornament in a spiral shape with a ribbon out of the same paper. Once individually wrapped, they may be packaged in wood or <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes,</b> but never in plastic.|$|E
25|$|In July 1988, in {{his second}} year at Goldsmiths College, Hirst was the main {{organiser}} of an independent student exhibition, Freeze, in a disused London Port Authority administrative block in London's Docklands. He gained sponsorship from the London Docklands Development Corporation. The show was visited by Charles Saatchi, Norman Rosenthal and Nicholas Serota, thanks to the influence of his Goldsmiths lecturer Michael Craig-Martin. Hirst's own contribution to the show consisted of a cluster of <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes</b> painted with household paint. After graduating, Hirst was included in New Contemporaries show and in a group show at Kettles Yard Gallery in Cambridge. Seeking a gallery dealer, he first approached Karsten Schubert, but was turned down.|$|E
25|$|And {{although}} {{lengths of}} containers vary from , {{according to two}} 2012 container census reports about 80% of the world's containers are either twenty or forty foot standard length boxes of the dry freight design. These typical containers are rectangular, closed box models, with doors fitted at one end, and made of corrugated weathering steel (commonly known as CorTen) with a plywood floor. Although corrugating the sheet metal used for the sides and roof contributes significantly to the container's rigidity and stacking strength, just like in corrugated iron or in <b>cardboard</b> <b>boxes,</b> the corrugated sides cause aerodynamic drag, and up to 10% fuel economy loss in road or rail transport, compared to smooth-sided vans.|$|E
