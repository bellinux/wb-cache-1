50|$|Many war time bureaux {{closed at}} the end of the war, {{although}} it was apparent that there was still a need for the services that had been established. A particular problem was the chronic housing shortage in the years immediately following the end of the war. In the 1950s, the funding was cut and by 1960 there were only 415 bureaux. The <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> <b>service</b> continued due to charitable support from groups such as the Nuffield Foundation, Carnegie Trust and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. In 1972, The <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> <b>service</b> became independent. Before then, the national organisation was part of NCSS (National Council of Social Services) and most bureaux were run by the local CVS (Council for Voluntary Service). In 1973, the government funded NACAB, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, to enlarge the network. The 1984 afternoon television drama series Miracles Take Longer depicted the type of cases that a 1980s branch would have to deal with. David Harker became CEO in 1997. He led Citizens Advice until 2010 and during that time oversaw a massive IT overhaul.|$|E

25|$|The report did {{not have}} the impact that Benson wanted - The {{government}} took four years to reply to the report, and did not institute many of the changes he recommended. By 1995 the <b>citizen</b> <b>advice</b> <b>services</b> were still not within the legal mainstream, and it took 12 years to implement other recommendations (such as that the Lord Chancellor should have a junior minister in the House of Commons). Despite this the Commission and its report are seen as leading to the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, even though the act disagreed with the report of the Commission in many ways.|$|R

According to Saxon, Reeves stated that she was [...] "misleading people", [...] "persuading people to go off their prescribed medications" [...] and [...] "upsetting disturbed people... on welfare benefits". The high court judge ruled in favor of Saxon. [...] "essentially because he did not believe that Ms Saxon had deliberately set out to deceive clients". The judge held that Reeves' [...] "statements were actuated by malice... by gratuitously attacking Ms Saxon's personal integrity."

[...] Citizens Advice research has calculated that for every £1 spent on the <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> <b>service</b> the Government saves £1.51 through reductions in health service demand, local authority homelessness services and out-of-work benefits and £8.74 in wider economic and social benefits and £10.94 in benefit to individuals.Research shows that Citizens Advice affects the most disadvantaged in society with Citizens Advice clients five times more likely to live in poverty than the average member of the United Kingdom population. Citizen Advice's own research has also known that volunteering has positive benefits in terms of helping people gain practical skills and improving mental health. Each year 31% of Citizens Advice's volunteers leave the service for paid employment and it has been calculated that the work of Citizens Advice volunteers is worth £111 million. Citizens Advice's campaigns work has had a number of successes including the Financial Conduct Authority capping payday loans.

5000|$|The trade {{publication}} Third Sector state that around 60% of Citizens Advice funding comes from government sources. Citron argues {{that there is}} a tension in the relationship between Citizens Advice and government as while the charity relies on government funding to survive it is most effective as a high-profile critic of government policy. Local bureaux received funding of £167m in 2014. Although Citizens Advice is a national charity local bureaux are responsible for raising their own funding. Some of this may some from other charities such as the National Lottery, from local authorities or from other services such as the Legal Services Commission. [...] Citizens Advice suffered cuts during the recession flowing from the Global Financial Crisis and over 100 Citizens Advice offices have closed or lost as a result of merger since 2009. Others resorted to reduced services. Some Councils have been forced to cut funding for Citizens Advice services and these cuts led to complaints that Citizens Advice was not meeting growing needs for its services during a period of high demand. Newcastle Citizens Advice faced a threat of closure in 2016 after Newcastle Council proposed large cuts to its funding. In February 2016, Derby City Council decided that it would no longer fund the city's Citizens Advice, leaving Derby as the only city in the UK not to have a <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> <b>Service,</b> according to its CEO.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> <b>service</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{volunteer}} organisations in the United Kingdom with 21,600 volunteers. The majority of these are part-time volunteer advisers, but the figure also includes trustees and administrators. While volunteers have varying levels of training, they are all required to receive basic training to ensure they fully understand the nature of the service including the four basic principles. Typically there will be a paid bureau manager, advice session supervisors and in some cases some paid advisers. Some staff may be qualified to give specialist legal advice or to advise on immigration. Each Citizens Advice is an affiliated to the national organisation but they are managed and run locally. Many bureaux are also limited companies and may have a board of directors, who will also be the organisation's trustees. Bureaux throughout the United Kingdom have varying community needs and very different resources, and consequently offer different styles and levels of service. All bureaux in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are members of Citizens Advice, the operating name of The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. Northern Ireland bureaux are also members of the Northern Ireland Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (NIACAB). Bureaux in Scotland are members of Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS), part of the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. Citizens Advice holds an Annual Conference each year. In 2015 this was held at the University of Warwick.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the modern <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> <b>service</b> {{can be traced back}} to the Betterton Report on Public Assistance from 1924. This report {{recommended}} that advice centres should be set up to offer members of the public advice to help them with their problems. During the 1930s, as preparations and plans were drawn up for the possibility of war, the role that the voluntary sector should have was determined. The National Council for Social Service (NCSS) called a meeting in 1938 in which plans to establish 'Citizens Aid Bureaux' were devised in the event of war.The first 200 bureaux opened on 4 September 1939, four days after World War II started. Many of these initial bureaux were run by 'people of standing' in the community. In The Story of The Citizens' Advice Bureaux Brasnett states that the typical bureau would include [...] "a committee chairman the editor of a respected county paper, as treasurer a local bank manager; and among the members the manager of the employment exchange, an estate agent who was able to lend part of a house for offices". Brasnett also describes a range of groups running provincial bureau including Toc H, Rotary Clubs and Soroptomist Clubs. Brasnett states in The Story of the Citizens' Advice Bureau that these first bureau were mainly offshoots of established organisations in London and other large provincial cities. These organisations included the Charity Organisation Society (now the Family Action) and the London Council of Social Service, the Liverpool Personal Service Society, the City of Glasgow Society of Social Service, the Birmingham Citizens' Society (now the Birmingham Council of Social Service). By 1942, there were 1,074 bureaux in a wide range of improvised offices such as cafes, church halls, private homes and air raid shelters. Sheffield set up in the cloisters of Sheffield Cathedral after its premises were bombed during World War II and another bureau worked in Chislehurst Caves. Mobile offices also became important in ensuring that people could access advice. Many of the issues dealt with during that time were directly related to the war. These included the tracing of missing servicemen or prisoners of war, evacuations, pensions and other allowances. The Independent describe Citizens Advice at this time as [...] "clearing houses for family and personal problems that abound from war conditions" [...] with common issues being lost ration books and debt issues as men went off to fight in World War II.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} case study of a {{successful}} innovative e-government project, iSAC 6 +, to examine {{some of the key}} factors in the project's success with the aim of contributing to the general understanding of the challenges associated with managing e-government projects. We make observations, identify areas for deeper consideration and draw conclusions as to how lessons learned might be applied to other e-government projects. There has been considerable analysis into the success and failure of e-government projects. We analyse some of the literature to identify the unique features which might add additional challenge and risk to e-government projects and then focus on the case study, specifically on individual participants and stakeholders rather than on the project as a whole. The discussion looks at the vulnerability of e-gov projects resulting from one of their defining characteristics, their collaborative and multi-organisational nature. A collaborative project which meets its objectives will rightly be seen as a success, though {{this may not be the}} viewpoint of all participants, some of whom may have found that the hoped for benefits have not been realised. For these participants the project is at best a limited success, but for many, a failure. The high failure rate for e-government projects is researched, analysed and documented. One feature which is a consequence of the complex and unpredictable environment within which e-government initiatives take place is that they are inherently innovative in that their purpose is invariably aimed at establishing new IT enabled solutions to embedded and complex problems. Innovative projects operating in complex, unpredictable environments are at high risk of failure for some if not all participants. The aim of iSAC 6 +, was to implement of a semantic web based <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> <b>Service</b> (CAS) application in five pilots. Success was judged by the achievement of cost and quality benefits for all stakeholders, citizens and administrators (cost burden reduction), and by the impact on the pilot organisation and operation (service modification). The analysis will demonstrate how the development of a management and measurement framework based upon the strategic aims and objectives for each partner supported success. It will also show how absence or lack of clarity about aims and objectives adversely affected some partners. Finally the paper will make comments and suggestions based upon the lessons learned...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Citizens Advice Administrative Dataset provides information regarding all Citizens Advice clients in England and Wales from April 2008. In particular, Citizens Advice is the national organisation responsible for providing advice and support for problems and issues faced by the public in England and Wales. Advice is provided by 384 Citizens Advice Bureaux (all independent charities) in England and Wales. There are separate national Citizens Advice organisations and CABx in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Citizens Advice {{is one of the}} largest volunteer organisations in the UK, with over 20, 000 volunteers. The service was established in 1939 just after the outbreak of the Second World War to offer members of the public general advice with their problems. The twin aims of Citizens Advice are to provide advice for problems that people have and to improve both the policies and practices which will affect people’s lives. The service offers advice and assistance in many areas including welfare benefits, debt, employment, housing, relationships, consumer issues and health. All Citizens Advice clients that enter a bureau are recorded onto a single database. A single record is created for that client and is updated every time they return to the same bureau. The client record collects information on the client profile (covering age, gender, ethnicity, disability and location of the client), the broad issue that the client seeks advice on (such as benefit, debt), the detail of the problem (such as the type of debt or benefit) and a third category which describes the nature of the advice given. The Bureaux record details of outcomes on a sample basis (approximately 7 %) covering advice outcomes (such the amount of benefit gained, debt managed or written off and employment tribunals won) and client outcomes (such as impact on health, relationships and confidence). At the moment advice outcomes are recorded in the case management system. Citizens Advice covers England and Wales only. Similar organisations exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland and together they form the <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> <b>service</b> network for the UK. Citizens Advice data is available from April 2008. External data is published quarterly six weeks after the end of each quarter. Internal data is consolidated around two to three weeks after each quarter. Data is available monthly for reporting and some data can be accessed in ‘real time’. Data collected in each client’s record is updated each time that they re-visit a bureau and when an outcome from any advice or support becomes available. Note that at present, a separate record is created if a client visits a different bureau. In the future, Citizens Advice plan to collect data onto one centralised system. Citizens Advice will consider applications for their micro level data providing that the research can demonstrate the impact of the Citizens Advice and cover key areas that they provide advice and support for, such as employment issues, discrimination, tribunals, welfare benefits, debt and housing. Research Usage and Linkage The Citizens Advice data is used to look at the problems people are experiencing and how this compares by geography, client profile and over time. Data has been used to inform research by the Government Equalities Office on intersectional discrimination and to look at how the recession was affecting different groups of people. Data was used as part of research by BIS on vulnerable workers. The data has also been used to inform the Cabinet Office on potential avoidable contacts in relation to benefit administration, used to look at the value of services and the return on investment and is routinely used to inform and support a wide range of policy work. Citizens Advice data has not been linked with any other datasets. In theory, it should be possible to link to other datasets using probabilistic matching techniques. </div...|$|E

The project was also guided throughout by a Research Steering Committee made up of representatives of all the interested parties. The aims of the research were to measure the long-term impact of advice-giving on clients who had approached <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> {{with one or more}} problems. <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> is an independent charity operating as <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> Cymru in Wales. It is the membership organisation for 31 member <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> Bureaux (CABx) in Wales, which deliver <b>advice</b> <b>services</b> from 50 main offices and 154 secondary advice outlets, these include a range of community settings such as high street offices, GP surgeries, health centres, libraries, courts and also offering home visiting services. Each CAB also offers access to services by telephone. The Twin Aims of the service are to provide the advice people need for the problems they face and to improve the policies and practices that affect people's lives. Adopting a quantitative longitudinal approach, this thesis provides evidence of improvements that occurred over time in clients' health, their financial and material wellbeing, and their quality of life as a direct outcome of the advice and support they received for their problems. Implications for service delivery arise from findings that highlight the complexities of the lives of many clients.

40|$|Introduction Welfare <b>advice</b> <b>services</b> {{can be used}} {{to address}} health inequalities, for example, through <b>Citizens</b> <b>Advice</b> Bureau (CAB). Recent reviews {{highlight}} evidence for the impact of <b>advice</b> <b>services</b> in improving people's financial position and improving mental health and well-being, daily living and social relationships. There is also some evidence for the impact of <b>advice</b> <b>services</b> in increasing accessibility of health services, and reducing general practitioner appointments and prescriptions. However, direct evidence for the impact of <b>advice</b> <b>services</b> on lifestyle behaviour and physical health is currently much less well established. There is a need for greater empirical testing of theories around the specific mechanisms through which <b>advice</b> <b>services</b> and associated financial or non-financial benefits may generate health improvements. Methods and analysis A realist evaluation will be conducted, operationalised in 5 phases: building the explanatory framework; refining the explanatory framework; testing the explanatory framework through empirical data (mixed methods); development of a bespoke data recording template to capture longer term impact; and verification of findings with a range of CAB services. This research will therefore aim to build, refine and test an explanatory framework about how CAB services can be optimally implemented to achieve health improvement. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the ethics committee at Northumbria University, UK. Project-related ethical issues are described and quality control aspects of the study are considered. A stakeholder mapping exercise will inform the dissemination of results in order to ensure all relevant institutions and organisations are targeted...|$|R
