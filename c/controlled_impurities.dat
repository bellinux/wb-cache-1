40|$|This report {{summarized}} {{the information available}} {{in the literature on}} the chemical reactivity of SiC/SiC composites and of their components in contact with the helium coolant used in HTGR, VHTR and GFR designs. In normal operation conditions, ultra-high purity helium will have chemically <b>controlled</b> <b>impurities</b> (water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, hydrogen) that will create a slightly oxidizing gas environment. Little is known from direct experiments on the reactivity of third generation (nuclear grade) SiC/SiC composites in contact with low concentrations of water or oxygen in inert gas, at high temperature. However, there is ample information about the oxidation in dry and moist air of SiC/SiC composites at high temperatures. This information is reviewed first in the next chapters. The emphasis is places on the improvement in material oxidation, thermal, and mechanical properties during three stages of development of SiC fibers and at least two stages of development of the fiber/matrix interphase. The chemical stability of SiC/SiC composites in contact with oxygen or steam at temperatures that may develop in off-normal reactor conditions supports the conclusion that most advanced composites (also known as nuclear grade SiC/SiC composites) have the chemical resistance that would allow them maintain mechanical properties at temperatures up to 1200 1300 oC in the extreme conditions of an air or water ingress accident scenario. Further research is needed to assess the long-term stability of advanced SiC/SiC composites in inert gas (helium) in presence of very low concentrations (traces) of water and oxygen at the temperatures of normal operation of helium-cooled reactors. Another aspect that needs to be investigated is the effect of fast neutron irradiation on the oxidation stability of advanced SiC/SiC composites in normal operation conditions...|$|E
40|$|This work {{concerns}} MBE-grown material, particularly {{physical effects}} due to <b>controlled</b> <b>impurities</b> of Si and N in arsenides, {{and the growth}} of nitrides and studies of Al- and As-impurities in them. Apart from interesting physical phenomena there are important device applications. The first part is devoted to studies of Si. delta. - to mono-layers in GaAs. The. delta. -doping represents the narrowest possible doping profile, which is important in order to realise small devices (e. g. with the purpose to decrease power consumption and increase device operation frequency). The second part concerns GaN. The direct large band gap of III-nitrides make them suitable for short wavelength, high intensity light emission applications in a vast range of wavelengths. Thin silicon layers, embedded in GaAs, extending from a low. delta. -doping concentration up to 6 monolayers, were studied using the growth temperatures of 500 - 630 °C. The electrical characteristics are discussed and a lattice relaxation of the Si-layer at 4 MLs was determined. The out-diffusion of the. delta. -layers as a function of growth temperature and doping concentration were measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry. For structures grown at temperatures near, or above 600 °C, the out-diffusion was significantly larger at high doping concentrations (above 10 12 cm - 2). We proposed an expression to predict the migration of Si from the layer to the surrounding GaAs-matrix, with doping concentration and growth temperature as parameters. Photoluminescence of thin Si-layers in the monolayer range provided two fairly broad emission bands, which were explained by inter-band transitions in GaAs and Si. Studies of DX-like centres in In x Ga 1 -x As, were undertaken using In x Ga 1 -x As-quantum wells, which were silicon. delta. -doped in the centre. Confinement effects from the combination of quantum wells and. delta. -doping, gave a shift of the Fermi-level to far above the conduction band edge into the energy region where trapping, and hence Fermi level pinning, from DX-centres occurred. The Fermi-level energy was determined by measuring the free carrier concentration and self consistently solving the Schrödinger and Poisson equations. The behaviour of the free carrier concentration, and thus the Fermi-level, indicated the presence of DX-centres. The optimum MBE growth conditions of GaN are very critical and narrow, particularly the N/Ga-flux ratio. We report optimisation of N/Ga-ratio on GaAs substrates using RHEED-reconstruction changes and surface morphology obtained by SEM. Aspects of isoelectronic doping in GaAs and GaN, and alloy concentrations of GaN x As 1 -x and Al x Ga 1 -x N are discussed. A series of AlGaN-samples using small amounts of Al were grown and characterised with photoluminescence, Hall effect and SEM. Effects on PL line-width and Hall effect data were observed due to aluminium concentration. Nitrogen was incorporated in GaAs from isoelectronic concentrations up to GaN. X-ray diffraction revealed two peaks from the layer, one close to the GaAs and the other at cubic GaN, respectively. Assuming the peak beside the GaAs was from GaN x As 1 -x, about one order of magnitude lower nitrogen concentration from XRD was present as from the SIMS results, which was explained by phase separation. In the intermediate region of the alloy the surface roughness increased as a result of phase separation between the GaAs and GaN. One work presents new findings of diffusion of N in GaAs. SIMS measurements were made on a 30 nm thick GaAs:N layer which was annealed at various temperatures. Assuming the kick-out mechanism, where interstitial nitrogen atoms replace the substitutional arsenic atoms, a set of coupled diffusion-reaction equations were solved using the SIMS-measured distributions as starting profiles. From these, the diffusion constants from nitrogen and arsenic atoms were obtained...|$|E
