25|$|The coils {{which produce}} the {{magnetic}} field are located within the lens yoke. The coils can contain a variable current, but typically use high voltages, and therefore require significant insulation {{in order to prevent}} short-circuiting the lens components. Thermal distributors are placed to ensure the extraction of the heat generated by the energy lost to resistance of the <b>coil</b> <b>windings.</b> The windings may be water-cooled, using a chilled water supply in order to facilitate the removal of the high thermal duty.|$|E
25|$|Flipper {{solenoids}} contain two <b>coil</b> <b>windings</b> in one package; a short, heavy gage 'power' winding to {{give the}} flipper its initial thrust up, and a long, light gage 'hold' winding that uses lower power (and creates far less heat) and essentially just holds the flipper up allowing the player to capture {{the ball in the}} inlane for more precise aiming. As the flipper nears the end of its upward travel, a switch under the flipper disconnects the power-winding and leaves only the second sustain winding to hold the flipper up in place. If this switch fails 'open' the flipper will be too weak to be usable, since only the weak winding is available. If it fails 'closed' the coil will overheat and destroy itself, since both windings will hold the flipper at the top of its stroke.|$|E
25|$|Power {{handling}} {{is related}} to the heat resistance of the wire insulation, adhesive, and bobbin material, and may be influenced by the coil's position within the magnetic gap. The majority of loudspeakers use 'overhung' voice coils, with windings that are taller than the height of the magnetic gap. In this topology, a portion of the coil remains within the gap at all times. The power handling is limited by the amount of heat that can be tolerated, and the amount that can be removed from the voice coil. Some magnet designs include aluminium heat-sink rings above and below the magnet gap, to improve conduction cooling, significantly improving power handling. If all other conditions remain constant, the area of the voice <b>coil</b> <b>windings</b> is proportional to the power handling of the coil. Thus a 100mm diameter voice coil, with a 12mm winding height has similar power handling to a 50mm diameter voice coil with a 24mm winding height.|$|E
50|$|A {{transformer}} is {{a device}} that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through its <b>coils</b> (<b>windings).</b> The properties needed for motor windings {{are similar to those}} needed for transformers, but with the additional requirement to withstand mechanical vibration and centrifugal forces at operating temperatures.|$|R
50|$|Invented by Shawn Frayne. A {{tensioned}} but flexible belt vibrates by {{the passing}} flow of air, due to aeroelastic flutter.

Firstly, {{in order to maximize}} the output power of SRM optimization of its control parameters was performed, such that the peak and RMS values of the current do not exceed the predefined values. The optimal control parameters vs. rotation speed, as well as the corresponding characteristics of torque, power and efficiency.

5000|$|In {{a series}} configuration, [...] and [...] {{cancel each other}} out. In real, rather than {{idealised}} components, the current is opposed, mostly by {{the resistance of the}} <b>coil</b> <b>windings.</b> Thus, the current supplied to a series resonant circuit is a maximum at resonance.|$|E
5000|$|The Lynch motor {{can achieve}} 90% efficiency. It is built from ferrite blocks {{sandwiched}} between strips of metal, instead of conventional copper <b>coil</b> <b>windings,</b> and is held together purely by magnets. The motor provides {{a power of}} [...] and only weighs 11 kg.|$|E
50|$|Motors that {{directly}} produce linear motion are called linear motors. The advantage of linear motors {{is that they}} can produce linear motion without the need of a transmission system, such as ballscrewsleadscrew, rack-and-pinion, cam, gears or belts, that would be necessary for rotary motors. Transmission systems are known to introduce less responsiveness and reduced accuracy. Direct drive, brushless DC linear motors consist of a slotted stator with magnetic teeth and a moving actuator, which has permanent magnets and <b>coil</b> <b>windings.</b> To obtain linear motion, a motor controller excites the <b>coil</b> <b>windings</b> in the actuator causing an interaction of the magnetic fields resulting in linear motion. Tubular linear motors are another form of linear motor design operated in a similar way.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{stabilization}} of the launch mass {{in and out of}} the bore of a plasma electromagnetic launcher. Appropriately <b>coiled</b> <b>windings</b> are assumed to produce a rotating magnetic field and, as a consequence, the rotating motion of the launch package necessary for the gyroscopic stabilization. The dynamic of the plasma arc interacting with contemporary translating and rotating field inside a hollow cylinder is focused. An analysis of the possible plasma structure flow is carried out starting from recent studies and works published by other authors. Launch mass angular and axial velocity in the presence and in the absence of the rotating magnetic field are the quantities of interest. Finally, the preparation of experimental setups purposely defined is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} {{was that}} the output voltage was very low, due to the single current path through the magnetic flux. Faraday and others found that higher, more useful voltages could be produced by winding multiple turns of wire into a <b>coil.</b> Wire <b>windings</b> can conveniently produce any voltage desired by changing the number of turns, so they have been a feature of all subsequent generator designs, requiring {{the invention of the}} commutator to produce direct current.|$|R

50|$|Because of {{its high}} {{electrical}} conductivity, copper is commonly used in <b>coil</b> <b>windings,</b> bearings, collectors, brushes, and connectors of motors, including the highest quality motors. Copperâ€™s greater conductivity versus other materials enhances the electrical energy efficiency of motors. For example, to reduce load losses in continuous-use induction-type motors above 1 horsepower, manufacturers invariably use copper as the conducting material in windings. Aluminium is an alternate material in smaller horsepower motors, especially when motors are not used continuously.|$|E

5000|$|The {{parallel}} shunt component on {{the equivalent}} circuit diagram {{is used to}} represent the core losses. These core losses come from {{the change in the}} direction of the flux and eddy currents. Eddy current losses are caused by currents induced in the iron due to the alternating flux. In contrast to the parallel shunt component, the series component in the circuit diagram represents the winding losses due to the resistance of the <b>coil</b> <b>windings</b> of the transformer.|$|E

50|$|Since {{they open}} and close several times with every turn of the engine, contact breaker points and cam {{follower}} suffer from wearâ€”both mechanical and pitting caused by arcing across the contacts. This latter effect is largely prevented by placing a capacitor parallel across the contact breakerâ€”this is usually referred to by the more old fashioned term condenser by mechanics. As well as suppressing arcing, it helps boost the coil output by creating a resonant LC circuit with the <b>coil</b> <b>windings.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”Three-phase fractional-slot PM {{machines}} {{are more and}} more used in many applications. In spite of the several ad- vantages, these machines exhibit high contents of space harmonics in the air-gap MMF distribution, whose amplitude depends on the particular combination of number of slots and poles. The main consequence of such harmonic contents is the induced losses in the rotor. The aim {{of this paper is to}} link the rotor losses to the combination of slots and poles of the PM machine. The effort is to determine a general rule to single out easily if a machine topology is suitable or not, as far as the rotor losses are concerned. Both overlapped and non-overlapped <b>coil</b> fractional-slot <b>windings</b> are considered...|$|R

By exploiting the coils resonance coupling effect, electric energy can be transferred from the inductor coil to the receiver in order to charge the batteries.

50|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of the magnetic circuit, it was realised that multiple magnetic paths could be provided through the same armature. The two coils were now separated and placed at the sides of the motor, with their iron core as a sideways figure-8 circuit and the armature in a central pole gap. Flux from both coils passed through this gap. This gave a magnetic circuit that was shorter overall and thus had fewer magnetic losses. The more compact <b>coil</b> <b>windings</b> were made possible by the use of shellac for impregnating the windings and improving the reliability of their insulation.|$|E
50|$|The major {{disadvantage}} of wheel hub motors {{are that the}} weight of the electric motors would increase the unsprung weight, which adversely affects handling and ride (the wheels are more sluggish in responding to road conditions, especially fast motions over bumps, and transmit the bumps to the chassis instead of absorbing them). Most conventional electric motors include ferrous material composed of laminated electrical steel. This ferrous material contributes most of the weight of electric motors. To minimize this weight several recent wheel motor designs have minimized the electrical steel content of the motor by utilizing a coreless design with Litz wire <b>coil</b> <b>windings</b> to reduce eddy current losses. This significantly reduces wheel motor weight and therefore unsprung weight.|$|E
50|$|The <b>coil</b> <b>windings</b> of a {{superconducting magnet}} {{are made of}} wires or tapes of Type II superconductors (e.g.niobium-titanium or niobium-tin). The wire or tape itself may be made of tiny {{filaments}} (about 20 micrometers thick) of superconductor in a copper matrix. The copper is needed to add mechanical stability, {{and to provide a}} low resistance path for the large currents in case the temperature rises above Tc or the current rises above Ic and superconductivity is lost. These filaments need to be this small because in this type of superconductor the current only flows skin-deep. (See Skin effect) The coil must be carefully designed to withstand (or counteract) magnetic pressure and Lorentz forces that could otherwise cause wire fracture or crushing of insulation between adjacent turns.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, {{the name}} [...] "Joule Thief" [...] was coined by Clive Mitchell {{and given to}} his variant of Kaparnik's circuit (from 1999 EPE magazine) which {{consisted}} of a single cell, a single BC549 NPN transistor, a <b>coil</b> with two <b>windings,</b> a single resistor (typically 1000 ohms), and a single white LED. Clive originally named the circuit [...] "Vampire Torch", because it sucked the last remnants of life from a battery.|$|R
5000|$|A {{commutator}} is {{a moving}} {{part of a}} rotary electrical switch in certain types of electric motors and electrical generators that periodically reverses the current direction between the rotor and the external circuit. It consists of a cylinder composed of multiple metal contact segments on the rotating armature of the machine. Two or more electrical contacts called [...] "brushes" [...] made of a soft conductive material like carbon press against the commutator, making sliding contact with successive segments of the commutator as it rotates. The <b>windings</b> (<b>coils</b> of wire) on the armature {{are connected to the}} commutator segments.|$|R
25|$|As {{the engine}} {{crankshaft}} turns, it also turns the distributor shaft at half the speed. In a four-stroke engine, the crankshaft turns twice for the ignition cycle. A multi-lobed cam {{is attached to}} the distributor shaft; there is one lobe for each engine cylinder. A spring-loaded rubbing block follows the lobed portions of the cam contour and controls the opening and closing of points. During most of the cycle, the rubbing block keeps the points closed to allow a current to build in the ignition coil's primary winding. As a piston reaches the top of the engine's compression cycle, the cam's lobe is high enough to cause the breaker points to open. Opening the points causes the current through the primary coil to stop. Without the steady current through the primary, the magnetic field generated in the coil immediately collapses. This high rate of change of magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the <b>coil's</b> secondary <b>windings</b> that ultimately causes the spark plug's gap to arc and ignite the fuel.|$|R
50|$|The {{current to}} the <b>coil</b> <b>windings</b> is {{provided}} by a high current, very low voltage DC power supply, since in steady state the only voltage across the magnet {{is due to the}} resistance of the feeder wires. Any change to the current through the magnet must be done very slowly, first because electrically the magnet is a large inductor and an abrupt current change will result in a large voltage spike across the windings, and more importantly because fast changes in current can cause eddy currents and mechanical stresses in the windings that can precipitate a quench (see below). So the power supply is usually microprocessor-controlled, programmed to accomplish current changes gradually, in gentle ramps. It usually takes several minutes to energize or de-energize a laboratory-sized magnet.|$|E
50|$|A humbucking pickup, {{shown in}} {{the image on the}} right, is {{composed}} of two coils. Each coil is wound reverse to one another. However, the six magnetic poles are opposite in polarity in each winding. Since ambient hum from power-supply transformers, radio frequencies, or electrical devices reaches the coils as common-mode noise, it induces an equal voltage in each coil. Because the windings are reversed in each pickup coil, the induced voltages cancel each other out. However, the signal from the guitar string is doubled, due to the phase reversal caused by the out of phase magnets. The magnets being out of phase in conjunction with the <b>coil</b> <b>windings</b> being out of phase put the guitar string signal from each pickup in phase with one another. Therefore, the voltage of the signal is approximately doubled, if the two coils are connected in series.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{electric}} motors for road electric vehicles (automobiles, scooters, bicycles), {{light rail transit}} (street cars, trolley lines, subway trains), guided transit systems and elevators have been discussed.

Modern permanent magnet (PM) motor technologies offer diversity of cutting-edge technology brushless motors, i. e., motors with one slot <b>coil</b> pitch <b>windings,</b> transverse flux motors, coreless disc type motors and PM assisted synchronous reluctance motors.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{new strategies}} to provide gyroscopic stabilization for armatures launched by railgun launchers. The rotating {{motion of the}} projectile is obtained {{by means of an}} electromagnetic field or, alternatively, of an appropriately shaped bore. In the first case <b>windings,</b> <b>coiled</b> in the bore axis direction, generate a rotating magnetic field. The interaction between the field and the conducting sleeve implies a rotation of the latter. The mechanical solution consists in a helicoidally extruded square bore launcher. In this way, the projectile moves along the main axis and it rotates at the same time. Results of a theoretical analysis are reported and the feasibility of both techniques is discussed...|$|R
