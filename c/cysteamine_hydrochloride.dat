The detection principles of the TFBG-SPR protein molecular probe are analyzed, and its feasibility is demonstrated. The intermediary material between the protein molecules and the golden layer outside of the fiber gratings is <b>cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> When the concentration of the <b>cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> solution is 2 M, the shift of the TFBG resonance peak is 2.23 nm, illustrating that the <b>cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> modifies the gold film successfully.

40|$|Summary: Cysteamine bitartrate {{capsules}} (Cystagon) {{have been}} approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with nephropathic cystinosis. Plasma cysteamine concentrations were virtually identical at various times follow-ing ingestion of either <b>cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> orCystagon capsules in 24 normal control subjects. A transfer study was done with eight eystinosis patients who had been receiving either <b>cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> or phosphocysteamine for many years. The plasma cysteamine concentration was significantly higher 2 h after Cystagon and the leukocyte cystine content was significantly lower at all times after Cystagon compared to older forms of the drug. These differences are probably the result of greater patient compliance in taking the capsules compared to the older, liquid forms of the drug. A new method for following the course of renal glomerular deterioration i diseases uch as cystinosis has been published recently. This method was used to re-analyse data on the efficacy of cysteamine treatment and to re-analyse new data on treating cystinosis patients with either of two doses of cysteamine (1. 30 g/m 2 per day and 1. 95 g/m 2 per day).

40|$|Understanding {{the phase}} {{behavior}} of pharmaceuticals {{is important for}} dosage form development and regulatory requirements, in particular after the incident with ritonavir. In the present paper, a comprehensive study of the solid-state phase behavior of <b>cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> used {{in the treatment of}} nephropathic cystinosis and recently granted orphan designation by the European Commission is presented employing (high-pressure) calorimetry, water vapor sorption, and X-ray diffraction as a function of temperature. A new crystal form (I 2 /a, form III) has been discovered, and its structure has been solved by X-ray powder diffraction, while two other crystalline forms are already known. The relative thermodynamic stabilities of the commercial form I and of the newly discovered form III have been established; they possess an overall enantiotropic phase relationship, with form I stable at room temperature and form III stable above 37 degrees C. Its melting temperature was found at 67. 3 +/- 0. 5 degrees C. <b>Cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is hygroscopic and immediately forms a concentrated saturated solution in water with a surprisingly high concentration of 47. 5 mol % above a relative humidity of 35 %.

Negative GO sheets with large sizes (> 10  μm) can be easily electrostatically attracted onto positive Au electrodes modified with <b>cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in aqueous solution. The assembled GO sheets on Au electrodes can be directly reduced into rGO sheets by hadrazine or pyrrole vapor and consequently provide the sensing devices based on self-assembled rGO sheets. In addition, pyrrole-vapor-reduced rGO-based sensor exhibits excellent response to NH 3. We expect the easy, reproducible, green, and scalable fabrication of the sensors based on rGO reduced by pyrrole, with excellent performance, miniature, low-cost, and portable characteristics, can pave a new avenue for the application of assembled rGO devices in gas sensing field.|$|E

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the successful functionalization of the SWCNTs. SWCNT-SH powders exhibited a threefold higher adsorption capacity for Hg(II) ions compared to pristine SWCNTs, and a fourfold higher adsorption capacity compared to activated carbon. The influence of adsorption time, pH, initial metal concentration and adsorbent dose on Hg(II) ion removal was investigated. The maximum adsorption {{capacity of the}} SWCNT-SH powders was estimated by using equilibrium isotherms, such as Freundlich and Langmuir, and the maximum adsorption capacity of the SWCNT-SH powder {{was found to be}} 131 mg/g. A first-order rate model was employed to describe the kinetic adsorption process of Hg(II) ions onto the SWCNT-SH powders. Desorption studies revealed that Hg(II) ions could be easily removed from the SWCNT-SH powders by altering the pH. Further, the adsorption efficiency of recovered SWCNT-SH powders was retained up to 91 %, even after 5 adsorption/desorption cycles. ...|$|E

30|$|We {{present a}} useful ammonia gas sensor based on {{chemically}} reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets by self-assembly technique to create conductive networks between parallel Au electrodes. Negative graphene oxide (GO) sheets with large sizes (> 10  μm) {{can be easily}} electrostatically attracted onto positive Au electrodes modified with <b>cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in aqueous solution. The assembled GO sheets on Au electrodes can be directly reduced into rGO sheets by hydrazine or pyrrole vapor and consequently provide the sensing devices based on self-assembled rGO sheets. Preliminary results, which have been presented on the detection of ammonia (NH 3) gas using this facile and scalable fabrication method for practical devices, suggest that pyrrole-vapor-reduced rGO exhibits much better (more than 2.7 times with the concentration of NH 3 at 50  ppm) response to NH 3 than that of rGO reduced from hydrazine vapor. Furthermore, this novel gas sensor based on rGO reduced from pyrrole shows excellent responsive repeatability to NH 3. Overall, the facile electrostatic self-assembly technique in aqueous solution facilitates device fabrication, the resultant self-assembled rGO-based sensing devices, with miniature, low-cost portable characteristics and outstanding sensing performances, which can ensure potential application in gas sensing fields.|$|E

The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of cod liver oil (0. 5 g/kg, p. o. and 1 g/kg, p. o.) on gastric and duodenal ulcers. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out on different gastric ulcer models such as acetic acid induced chronic gastric ulcers, pylorus ligation, indomethacin induced ulcers, stress induced ulcers and ethanol induced ulcers. The duodenal ulcers were induced using <b>cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (HCl). Ranitidine (50 mg/kg p. o.) and misoprostol (100 &#x 00 B 5;g/kg, p. o.) were used as standard drugs.

Cod liver oil also produced {{a significant reduction in}} the development of stress induced gastric ulcers and cysteamine induced duodenal ulcer. The high dose of cod liver oil (1 g/kg, p. o.) was more effective compared to the low dose (0. 5 g/kg, p. o.).

Others have shown cysteamine (CSH) to deplete the gastrointestinal tract and hypothalamus of rats of immunoreactive somatostatin, suggesting a toxic action of that compound directed against somatostatin-containing cells. The present study further defines the actions of cysteamine on somatostatin in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). <b>Cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> administered subcutaneously results in a depletion of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) in the retina, brain, and cervical spinal cord of rats. The effect is demonstrable at doses of 30 mg/kg of body weight and above, occurs within 2 to 4 hr of a single injection of the drug, and is largely reversible within 1 week. The mean depletion of SLI observed within the CNS varies from 38 % in cerebral cortex to 65 % in cervical spinal cord 24 hr following administration of CSH, 300 mg/kg of body weight, S. C. By gel permeation chromatography, all molecular weight forms of SLI are affected, with the largest reductions in those forms that co-chromatograph with synthetic somatostatin- 14 and somatostatin- 28.

40|$|Cystinosis is a {{hereditary}} {{genetic disease}} {{that results in}} the accumulation of cystine crystals in the lysosomes, leading to many clinical manifestations. One of these manifestations is the formation of corneal cystine crystals, which can cause serious ocular complications. The only available drug to treat cystinosis is cysteamine, which breaks cystine and depletes its accumulation in the lysosomes. However, the oral form of cysteamine is not effective in treating corneal manifestations. Thus, ophthalmic solutions of cysteamine are applied. Because the commercial cysteamine eye drops are not available in most countries, hospital pharmacies are responsible for preparing "homemade" drops usually without a control of stability of cysteamine in different storage conditions. Hence, we aimed in this study to investigate the effect of different storage conditions on the stability of a cysteamine ophthalmic compounded solution. Cysteamine ophthalmic solution was prepared in the hospital pharmacy and sterilized using a candle filter. The preparations are then stored either in the freezer at - 20 °C or in the refrigerator at + 4 °C for up to 52 weeks. The amount of <b>cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in the preparation at different time points was determined using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Storage of the cysteamine ophthalmic preparations at + 4 ° resulted in significant loss of free cysteamine at all time points, from 1 to 52 weeks of storage, when compared with storage in the freezer (- 20 °C). We demonstrate that cysteamine 0. 5 % compounded eye drops are easily oxidized within the first week after storage at + 4 °C, rendering the preparation less effective.

In the present study, GHRP- 6 action on GH secretion was examined in vivo and in vitro in sexually immature grass carp. GHRP- 6 injected intraperitoneally had no influences on serum GH levels in juvenile grass carp. Following intraperitonal injection of GHRP- 6 and dopamine (DA) or <b>cysteamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (CSH), alone and in combination into juvenile grass carp, DA and CSH were effective in elevating serum GH levels, but GHRP- 6 was not effective in this respect; in addition, the synergistic action of GHRP- 6 and DA or CSH on GH secretion was not seen. In this work, we had adapted and validated a perifusion system and a culture system for GH regulation studies. In a perifusion system, GHRP- 6 (1000 to 0. 1 nM), GHRP- 6 (0. 1 to 1000 nM), GHRP- 6 (1 μM), and Hexarelin (an analog of GHRP, 1 μM) had no action on GH release from juvenile grass carp pituitary fragments or cells. Under static incubation conditions, GHRP- 6 was inactive on GH release from juvenile grass carp pituitary fragments after 1 h and 6 h incubation, but human growth hormone-releasing hormone (hGHRH; 1 to 100 nM) as positive control could stimulate GH release in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, when GHRP- 6 (100 nM) in combination static incubation with neuropeptides [e. g., hGHRH (100 nM), salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (sGnRH-A) (100 nM), or D-Ala 6,Pro 9 - NEt-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (D-Ala 6,Pro 6 -NEt-LHRH, LHRH-A) (100 nM) ], GHRP- 6 did not strengthen GH secretion actions of neuropeptides, {{and at the same}} time neuropeptides also did not modify the effects of GHRP- 6 on GH secretion.
