5|$|Historians' {{assessments}} of the Vengeance's career in Australian service differ. While there is <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> type was obsolete, some argue that it nevertheless proved successful. Others, including the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre, have judged that the Vengeance's performance was mixed and the type was not suited to Australia's requirements.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the broader {{evolutionary}} relationships between the giant freshwater whipray {{and the rest of}} the family Dasyatidae, a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA reported that it was most closely related to the porcupine ray (Urogymnus asperrimus), and that they in turn formed a clade with the mangrove whipray (H. granulata) and the tubemouth whipray (H. lobistoma). This finding adds to a growing <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genus Himantura is paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{cerebellum}} is involved in pain processing. The cerebellum receives pain input from both descending cortico-cerebellar pathways and ascending spino-cerebellar pathways, through the pontine nuclei and inferior olives. Some of this information is transferred to the motor system inducing a conscious motor avoidance of pain, graded according to pain intensity.|$|E

5|$|There is an {{academic}} <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{events of the}} nine-month conflict were a genocide. The atrocities in East Pakistan were the first instances of war rape to attract international media attention, and Sally J. Scholz has written {{that this was the}} first genocide to capture the interest of the mass media. The women's human rights organisation Bangladesh Mahila Parishat took part in the war by publicising the atrocities being carried out by the Pakistani army.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} he took office, Bruce began {{investigating}} whether there would be interest in building a religious center and chapel complex at the school. After several years of negotiations with the various religious denominations which had operated on and off campus, Bruce engineered a <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> university would build a center based {{on the model of}} the Armed Forces Base Chapel. The new religious center would have a single chapel which would be shared by all of the groups, and office space for each group. The center opened in 1965 and was named for Bruce.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the general}} {{reputation}} as a mass producer and a <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> region {{is in the midst}} of an economic crisis, parts of the Languedoc wine industry are experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality. Sales have been improved by many vineyards that concentrate on creating a good brand name rather than relying on the sometimes infamous regional designations. Some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s, while other vineyards eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines, a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large New World wine market.|$|E

5|$|From 1830 to 1833, {{geologist}} Charles Lyell {{published his}} multi-volume work Principles of Geology, which, building on Hutton's ideas, advocated a uniformitarian {{alternative to the}} catastrophic theory of geology. Lyell claimed that, rather than being the products of cataclysmic (and possibly supernatural) events, the geologic features of the Earth are better explained {{as the result of}} the same gradual geologic forces observable in the present day—but acting over immensely long periods of time. Although Lyell opposed evolutionary ideas (even questioning the <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fossil record demonstrates a true progression), his concept that the Earth was shaped by forces working gradually over an extended period, and the immense age of the Earth assumed by his theories, would strongly influence future evolutionary thinkers such as Charles Darwin.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1880s {{marked a}} turning point in Shaw's life, both {{personally}} and professionally: he lost his virginity, had two novels published, and began a career as a critic. He had been celibate until his twenty-ninth birthday, when his shyness was overcome by Jane (Jenny) Patterson, a widow some years his senior. Their affair continued, not always smoothly, for eight years. Shaw's sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers, but there is a <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relationship with Patterson was one of his few non-platonic romantic liaisons.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Amir's writings were published in Poedjangga Baroe, although some earlier ones were published in Timboel and Pandji Poestaka. None of his creative works are dated, {{and there is no}} consensus regarding when individual poems were written. However, there is a <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> works included in Nyanyi Sunyi were written after those included in Buah Rindu, despite the latter being published last. Johns writes that the poems in the collections appear to be arranged in chronological order; he points to the various degrees of maturity Amir showed as his writing developed.|$|E

25|$|While {{some have}} disputed the {{authenticity}} of the poem, the current scholarly <b>consensus</b> is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poem is authentic and dates to the medieval period (late 12th century).|$|R
5|$|This {{thesis of}} a {{maritime}} foundation was {{contrary to the}} general scholarly <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rise of civilization was based on intensive agriculture, particularly {{of at least one}} cereal. The production of agricultural surpluses had long been seen as essential in promoting population density and the emergence of complex society. Moseley's ideas would be debated and challenged (that maritime remains and their caloric contribution were overestimated, for example) but have been treated as plausible as late as Mann's summary of the literature in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Even before {{planning}} of the Hell–Sunnan Line was completed, there arose disagreement {{as to the}} route onwards. In a plan from the 1870s, there was <b>consensus</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> towns of Stjørdal, Levanger, Steinkjer and Namsos should receive a line, {{but there was a}} disagreement as to the route. The Beitstad Line would run from Steinkjer via Beitstad and Namdalseid to Namsos and from there to Grong, while the Snåsa Line would run from Sunnan via Snåsa to Grong, with a branch from Grong to Namsos. The Beitstad Line would run through the most densely populated areas, while the Snåsa Line was shorter. Parliament decided on the Snåsa Line in 1900. The railway was extended from Sunnan to Snåsa Station on 30 October 1926, with the section from Hell to Sunnan becoming classified as part of the Nordland Line. The railway was completed to Bodø on 7 June 1962.|$|E
