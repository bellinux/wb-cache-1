50|$|MRL {{are still}} rarely able to {{properly}} shoot at rear slope positions in mountain warfare because the MRL crew cannot determine the trajectory {{as well as}} a howitzer's crew can do by adding or removing propellant increments.

According to aviation author Philip J.R. Moyes, the performance of the second prototype was considered to have been disappointing, particularly as the Hercules III engines of the initial production aircraft would likely provide little improvement, especially in light of additional operational equipment being installed; furthermore, it was recognised that demand for the Hercules engine to power other aircraft such as the Short Stirling bomber posed a potential risk to the production rate of the Beaufighter. These factors had thus sparked considerable interest in the adoption of alternative engines for the type.|$|E

50|$|The Grumman F-14 Tomcat {{with the}} TF30-P-414A was underpowered, {{because it was}} the Navy's intent to procure a jet fighter with a thrust-to-weight ratio (in <b>clean</b> <b>configuration)</b> of unity or better (the US Air Force had the same goals for the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon). However, due to the intent to {{incorporate}} as many of the systems of the failed Navy version of the F-111, the F-111B, into the project, it was deemed that the initial production run of F-14s utilize the F-111B's powerplant. The F-14A's thrust-to-weight ratio was similar to the F-4 Phantom II; however the new fuselage and wing design provided greater lift and a better climb profile than the F-4. The TF30 was found to be ill-adapted to the demands of air combat and was prone to compressor stalls at high angle of attack (AOA) if the throttles were moved aggressively. Because of the Tomcat's widely spaced engine nacelles, compressor stalls at high AOA were especially dangerous because they tended to produce asymmetric thrust that could send the Tomcat into an upright or inverted spin, from which recovery was very difficult.|$|E
5000|$|Four days later, the {{prototype}} {{was presented at}} Society of British Aircraft Constructors' Airshow at Farnborough; according to author Philip Kaplan, {{the timing of the}} first flight had been set as such to enable such a high-profile early appearance to be performed. The Brabazon's appearance at Farnborough would lead to the adoption of a formal and deliberate company policy as much of the aircraft's test programme in the vicinity of various British cities in order to spread public awareness. Accordingly, the Brabazon was demonstrated at the 1950 Farnborough Airshow, at which it performed a takeoff, <b>clean</b> <b>configuration</b> flypast and a landing. In June 1950, the Brabazon made a visit London's Heathrow Airport, during which it made a number of successful takeoffs and landings; it was also demonstrated at the 1951 Paris Air Show. Gibb, who flew the aircraft as pilot-in-command on multiple flights, summarised his flying experiences with the type: [...] "It was very comfortable. It flew very well. It was big.
