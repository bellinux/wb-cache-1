5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty. This {{would have the}} advantage that as few as 20 or 30 economically and geographically diverse countries could establish a UNPA, and it <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> as more countries ratified the treaty. Strauss notes {{that this is the}} method by which most international bodies, such the World Health Organization, International Labour Organization, and International Criminal Court, were founded. The way to get started presumably would be to hold a conference of plenipotentiaries to draft the treaty; then the ratification process would begin.|$|E
5|$|The Ashford Ring Road was {{completed}} in November 1974 around the town centre {{in an attempt to}} relieve congestion, though part of it involved demolition of existing properties and part of the old market. It initially opened as one way, but was converted back into a two-way operation in 2007, at a total cost of £14m, so the town centre <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> and accommodate more people. The two-way route incorporates the first shared space scheme in the country. An art installation, Lost O, curated by the artist Michael Pinsky, was created as part of this redevelopment but confused drivers.|$|E

5|$|Coventry Street {{has been}} a centre for {{high-volume}} food outlets. The first J. Lyons and Co. Corner House was built on Coventry Street in 1907, on the west corner with Rupert Street. It {{was one of the}} first buildings in London to have a white-glazed terracotta exterior. In 1920, the former premises of Lamberts at Nos.10–12 were demolished in order to accommodate an extension that could accommodate up to 3,000 diners. Scott's Restaurant first operated in Coventry Street. Originally opening as an oyster warehouse in 1872 at No.18 as part of the London Pavilion, it moved to No.19 in 1891, expanding as a full restaurant. The restaurant moved to Mount Street in Mayfair in 1967. In 1887, the Leicester, a public house, opened at the corner of Coventry Street and Wardour Street. It closed in 1927 so the neighbouring department store <b>could</b> <b>expand.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} the party had little chance of being elected unless it <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles of}} each deity were fluid, and each god <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> its nature {{to take on}} new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are {{difficult}} to categorize or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the creator god could reach {{beyond the boundaries of}} the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as beliefs about the god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Snow White, {{which was}} a short story that the writers <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> and {{experiment}} with, Pinocchio {{was based on a}} novel with a very fixed story. Therefore, the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation. In the original novel, Pinocchio is a cold, rude, ungrateful, inhuman creature that often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons by means of brutal torture. The writers decided to modernize the character and depict him similar to Edgar Bergen's dummy Charlie McCarthy, but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book. The story was still being developed {{in the early stages of}} animation.|$|E

25|$|Some people, {{who have}} paid {{attention}} to the governmental regulation on the Internet, mentioned another aspect of the ruling. April Glaser, a staff activist at the EFF, noted that the ruling had an aspect of a bar against the FCC's approach to network neutrality. Various commentators pointed to the possibility that by invoking the court's interpretation of Section 706, the FCC <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> its regulative power to the Internet thereby threatening its freedom.|$|E
25|$|When Murdoch {{became an}} American citizen in 1985 {{so that he}} <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> his media empire in the United States, Australia's media {{ownership}} laws obliged him {{to dispose of the}} flagship television stations, which were sold to The Northern Star, an offshoot of the Westfield Group conglomerate controlled by property tycoon Frank Lowy. However, Westfield was badly hit by the stock market crash of 1987, and in 1989 sold Network Ten to a consortium led by Charles Curran and former television journalist Steve Cosser.|$|E

25|$|Endangered Bengal tiger {{populations in}} the {{adjacent}} Project Tiger reserves of Anamalai Tiger Reserve and the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in the Agasthyamalai hills <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> back into this area when it is better protected. In February 2010, tigers were sighted in Kodaikanal forests during a six-day carnivore signs survey. A tigress and her cub were spotted playing in the wild. Forest Department officials are studying survey data to estimate the local tiger population based on indirect evidence like pug marks, scats and scratches.|$|E
25|$|Once the Ludendorff Bridge was captured, the Americans needed {{additional}} bridges as backups to the structurally weakened Ludendorff Bridge, and to {{get more}} troops and armor across the Rhine so they <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> and defend the bridgehead. On 8 March at 3:00 pm, they began constructing the first bridge. To procure the necessary bridge-building supplies, the First Army's 1111th Engineer Combat Group sent a man into Antwerp, where the supplies were dispatched by train to the front. He surreptitiously marked all of the bridge materials, including those destined for Patton's Third Army, as being destined for the First Army at Remagen.|$|E
25|$|Expansion {{continued}} and became more rapid {{by the beginning}} of the 19th century, with London growing in all directions. To the East the Port of London grew rapidly during the century, with the construction of many docks, needed as the Thames at the City could not cope with the volume of trade. The arrival of the railways and the Tube meant that London <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> over a much greater area. By the mid-19th century, with London still rapidly expanding in population and area, the City had already become only a small part of the wider metropolis.|$|E

25|$|An {{entrepreneurial}} class {{established in}} Rio de Janeiro during the mining surge {{was able to}} induce the government to help create basic conditions {{for the expansion of}} coffee, such as removing transportation and labor bottlenecks. From the area near Rio de Janeiro, coffee production moved along the Paraíba Valley toward São Paulo State, which later became Brazil's largest exporting region. Coffee was cultivated with primitive techniques and with no regard to land conservation. Land was abundant, and production <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> easily through the incorporation of new areas. However, it soon became necessary to ease two basic constraints: the lack of transportation and the shortage of labor.|$|E
25|$|Discovery {{carried the}} {{humanoid}} robot Robonaut2 (also known as R2) to the International Space Station (ISS). The microgravity conditions aboard {{the space station}} provide an ideal opportunity for robots like R2 to work with astronauts. Although the robot's primary initial task is teaching engineers how dexterous robots behave in space, it may eventually, through upgrades and advancements, assist spacewalking astronauts to perform scientific work once it has been verified as functional on the space station. It was the first humanoid robot in space, and was stowed on board the Leonardo PMM. Once Robonaut2 was unpacked, it began initial operation inside the Destiny module for operational testing, but over time, both its location and its applications <b>could</b> <b>expand.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{energy for}} {{hydrogen}} production were available (from wind, solar, fission or fusion nuclear power etc.), {{use of the}} substance for hydrocarbon synfuel production <b>could</b> <b>expand</b> captive use of hydrogen {{by a factor of}} 5 to 10. Present U.S. use of hydrogen for hydrocracking is roughly 4Mt per year. It is estimated that 37.7Mt/yr of hydrogen would be sufficient to convert enough domestic coal to liquid fuels to end U.S. dependence on foreign oil importation, and less than half this figure to end dependence on Middle East oil. Coal liquefaction would present significantly worse emissions of carbon dioxide than does the current system of burning fossil petroleum, but it would eliminate the political and economic vulnerabilities inherent in US oil importation before the commercialization of tight oil in North America.|$|E
