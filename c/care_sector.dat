Supporters argued that the Liberal program the Tories replaced was inflexible and discriminated against stay-at-home parents.

25|$|Nursing is a {{profession}} within the health <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> {{focused on the}} care of individuals, families, and communities so they may attain, maintain, or recover optimal health and quality of life. Nurses may be differentiated from other health care providers by their approach to patient care, training, and scope of practice. Nurses practice in many specialties with differing levels of prescription authority. Many nurses provide care within the ordering scope of physicians, and this traditional role has shaped the public image of nurses as care providers. However, nurses are permitted by most jurisdictions to practice independently {{in a variety of}} settings depending on training level. In the postwar period, nurse education has undergone a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials, and many of the traditional regulations and provider roles are changing.|$|E
