A censure debate followed on 1 May 1967, in which Healey claimed {{the cost of}} the TSR-2 would have been £1,700 million over 15 years including running costs, compared with £1,000 million for the F-111K/AFVG combination. Although 10 F-111Ks were ordered in April 1966 with an additional order for 40 in April 1967, the F-111 programme suffered enormous <b>cost</b> <b>escalation</b> coupled with the devaluation of the pound, far exceeding that of the TSR-2 projection. Many technical problems were still unresolved before successful operational deployment and, faced with poorer-than-projected performance estimates, the order for 50 F-111Ks for the RAF was eventually cancelled in January 1968.|$|E
25|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of BUA's financial results had shown that raising the airline's profile and quality during Max Stuart-Shaw's tenure meant that costs were growing faster than revenues. Other factors contributing to BUA's rapid <b>cost</b> <b>escalation</b> included high launch costs of several, initially unprofitable scheduled services, {{as well as an}} unexpected falloff in traffic {{as a result of a}} credit squeeze combined with new overseas travel restrictions due to a tightening of existing exchange controls. This was further compounded by the large number of overheads resulting from the group's complex organisation in which many functions were duplicated and the limited opportunities for independent airlines to operate scheduled services on domestic and international trunk routes in competition with the corporations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{frequent}} case of irrational {{decision making}} is the tendency to escalate commitment to a chosen course of action after unsuccessful prior investments of money, effort, or time (sunk costs). In previous research {{it is argued that}} escalation does not occur when future outcomes and alternative investments are transparent. Inconsistent with this argument, in an experiment in which undergraduates were presented fictitious investment problems with sunk <b>costs,</b> <b>escalation</b> was demonstrated when full information was given about investment alternatives and estimates of future returns. Thus, it is indicated that people may escalate despite knowing that it will not make them economically better off. A more comprehensive understanding of escalation requires disentangling people’s noneconomic reasons for escalation...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>escalation</b> {{is defined}} as changes in the cost or price of {{specific}} goods or services in a given economy over a period. This {{is similar to the}} concepts of inflation and deflation except that escalation is specific to an item or class of items (not as general in nature), it is often not primarily driven by changes in the money supply, and it tends to be less sustained. While escalation includes general inflation related to the money supply, it is also driven by changes in technology, practices, and particularly supply-demand imbalances that are specific to a good or service in a given economy. For example, while general inflation (e.g., consumer price index) in the US was less than 5% in the 2003-2007 time period, steel prices increased (escalated) by over 50% because of supply-demand imbalance. <b>Cost</b> <b>escalation</b> may contribute to a project cost overrun but it is not synonymous with it.|$|E
