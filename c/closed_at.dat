50|$|For example, {{assume that}} the price in a rising trend <b>closes</b> <b>at</b> its high of $84.00 and opens at $86.00 the {{following}} day and then does not fall below its opening.

A few days later or the very next day, market price opens <b>at</b> $84.00 and <b>closes</b> <b>at</b> $82.90, keeping itself below the area of $86.00 and $84.00. All the trading above $86.00 will appear on the technical analysis chart to be isolated and is known as, an island reversal.|$|R
