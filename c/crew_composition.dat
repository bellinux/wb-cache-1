Methods: To compare perceived safety in different medical crew models, we surveyed international HEMS medical directors regarding the types of <b>crew</b> <b>compositions</b> their system currently used and their supportive rationales and to evaluate patient and flight safety within their services. Results: Perceived patient and flight safety is higher when HEMS is staffed with a dual medical crew in the cabin.

Most respondents would rather retain their current crew configuration, but some would prefer to add a physician or supplement the physician with an assistant in the cabin.

40|$|An {{international}} maritime {{labour market}} study, the thesis {{focuses on the}} Dutch naval labour market, analysing wartime Zeeland admiralty crews. The research is based primarily on unique naval pay sources. Analysis of <b>crew</b> <b>compositions</b> {{has not been made}} on this scale in the period before. The 1667 Dutch Medway Raid is the starting point, where a few British played a leading role – amongst many others reported on the Dutch side. Pepys and Marvell primarily blamed their joining the enemy on the lure of superior Dutch payment. The thesis asks how many British there were really, how they came to be in Dutch service, and whether this involvement occurred, as indicated, at other times too. Part One is thematic and explores the background mechanisms of the maritime environment in detail, determining causation. First, the two naval recruitment systems are compared and completely reassessed in the light of state intervention in the trade sphere. Two new sets of ‘control’ data – naval wages and foreign shipping – are amongst the incentives and routes determined. British expatriate communities are examined as conduits for the supply of naval labour and civilian support. British personnel are compared and contrasted with other foreigners, against the background of Anglo-Dutch interlinkage and political transition from neutrality through conflict to alliance. Part Two is chronological, covering four major wars in three chapters. Micro-case studies assembled from the scattered record streams enable analysis of the crews of particular officers and ships. Seamen were an occupation that made them a very little known group: the thesis examines the different career types of British personnel of many different ranks, shedding light on their everyday lives. The thesis shows that British personnel were an integral part of Dutch crews throughout the period, even when the two nations were fighting each other. The basic need of subsistence labour for employment took precedence over allegiance to nation/ideology, demonstrating limitations in state power and the continual interdependence forced on the maritime powers through the realities of the labour market.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. In the conduct of construction, situations may arise where a shortage of craftsmen forces crew compositions with a larger than desirable proportion of unskilled workers to do the work that must be done. The net effect on total labor cost and duration of that work activity is critical. The issue is addressed from the viewpoint of group dynamics and conjunctive work tasks which require interaction of group members and the pooling of their resources in order to do what must be done. Three hypotheses are constructed for testing the relationships between crew size and work output, <b>crew</b> <b>composition</b> and work output and <b>crew</b> <b>composition</b> and labor cost. Analysis reveals that crew size and composition affect both work output and labor cost. Increasing crew size tends to increase work output. Increasing the proportion of unskilled workers on the crew tends to decrease both work output and labor cost. It is concluded that the crew mix phenomenon may be either beneficial or detrimental to overall project performance, depending upon circumstances. Implications for the findings include their impact on schedule balancing, cost control and resource allocation.

40|$|We’re {{investigating}} a new assignment of manning on board of modern coasters {{while maintaining the}} current level of safety. International marine legislation sets a high, but conservative standard to the ship’s <b>crew,</b> but other <b>composition</b> of the ship’s crew may fulfill these high standards as well. One example of such a standard is the obligation to have a Chief Engineer on board ships with a propulsion power higher than 750 kW. The Chief Engineer is mono disciplinary educated in the engineering department and cannot execute navigational tasks. Since modern coasters are equipped with engines requiring a minimum of maintenance, a Chief Engineer may use his time more effectively. He may also be replaced by a beginning maritime officer (MAROF) who has receives a dual education in both navigational and engineering skills. A MAROF may do maintenance and take over some shifts of the Master and the Chief Mate. The advantage is a more flexible way of operating the ship and potentially a rise of labor satisfaction.

Mechanization, automation and communications technology has made many manual tasks redundant,enabling ship operations with a minimum of manpower. However, there is an area of potential yet uncharted: occupational ergonomics and the interface between human and technology. As technological systems increase in complexity, the gap between the operator and the system tend to increase as well, causing inefficient operations, as well as maritime and occupational accidents. The purpose of the present thesis was to present how increased knowledge of ergonomics can contribute to improved overall systems performance and employee well‐being in the shipping industry. Using a qualitative, exploratory research approach, three studies have been performed. The studies addressed the key issues of maritime economics, the strategic constituents of maritime economics and how a shipping company’s overall systems performance can be operationalized and linked to ergonomic principles.

Additionally, three cross sectional analyses were conducted to determine the prevalence odds ratios for human causal factors and phase of flight, mission type, and <b>crew</b> <b>composition.</b> Overall, human error was the most common cause of MQ- 1 Predator UAS mishaps and four recurring patterns of error were identified. Based on the utility analysis, preventing mishaps is best accomplished by addressing latent failures involving organizational factors and the technological environment. There was a greater likelihood for mishaps to involve perceptual factors and perceptual errors during launch and recovery operations and training operations and organizational climate factors and violations during operations other than training...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance as {{discussed}} in this handbook includes the periodic improvement of drainage ways and certain accessory facilities, such as access roads. Small items of non-recurrent repair work are also included. All drainage needs some maintenance, but the need for maintenance work is greatest on temporary drainage construction. Most MCWA drainage has been of a temporary nature since the war emergency needs of 1942 and 1943 justified rapid construction with emphasis on conservation of materials and equipment. The cost of drainage maintenance can be held to a minimum if ditches are patrolled frequently, if obstructions are removed promptly, and if other needed work is noted. Immediate removal of an obstruction may take only a few minutes; {{but if it is}} allowed to remain, large quantities of silt may accumulate behind it. Bank slides and culvert blockage can be cared for with least expense if repairs are made at an early stage. Prompt attention to these maintenance needs also avoids unnecessary larvicidal costs.

40|$|Long {{duration}} {{space flight}} crews have {{relied heavily on}} almost constant communication with ground control mission support. Ground control teams provide vehicle status and system monitoring, while offering near real time support for specific tasks, emergencies, and ensuring crew health and well being. With extended exploration goals to lunar and Mars outposts, real time communication with ground control teams and the ground s ability to conduct mission monitoring will be very limited compared to the resources provided to current International Space Station (ISS) crews. An operational shift toward more autonomy and a heavier reliance on the crew to monitor their vehicle and operations will be required for these future missions. NASA s future exploration endeavors and the subsequent increased autonomy will require a shift in crew skill composition, i. e. engineer, doctor, mission specialist etc. and lead to new training challenges and mission scenarios. Specifically, operational and design changes will be necessary in many areas including: Habitat Infrastructure and Support Systems, <b>Crew</b> <b>Composition,</b> Training, Procedures and Mission Planning. This paper will specifically address how to apply ISS lessons learned to further use ISS as a test bed to address decreased amounts of ground support to achieve full autonomous operations for lunar and Mars missions. Understanding these lessons learned and applying them to current operations will help to address the future impacts of increased crew autonomy for the lunar and Mars outposts and {{pave the way for}} success in increasingly longer mission durations...|$|E
