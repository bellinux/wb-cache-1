40|$|If a {{borrower}} defaults on a loan, a bank’s recovery {{may depend}} {{on the value of}} the loan collateral. The value of collateral, like the value of other assets, fluctuates with economic conditions. If the economy experiences a downturn, a bank can experience a double misfortune: many obligors default, and the value of collateral is damaged. Conventional credit models overlook the effect of economic conditions on collateral. They allow default to vary from year to year, but they hold fixed the average value of collateral and the average level of recovery. The distinctive feature of the credit model presented here is that an economic downturn causes damage to the value of collateral. When systematic collateral damage enters the credit model, the capital allocated to a highly collateralised loan can double or triple. 1 Taking collateral damage into account complicates a <b>credit</b> <b>capital</b> model. However, the results of the model can be well approximated by a function of expected loss alone. Expected loss can therefore be used as the basis of a <b>credit</b> <b>capital</b> estimate. This estimate is simpler, and can be more accurate than using the results of a conventional credit model that ignores the role of collateral damage. <b>Credit</b> <b>capital</b> model The <b>credit</b> <b>capital</b> model uses the conditional approach suggested by Finger (1999) and Gordy (2000). The variables in the model depend on a systematic risk factor, a random variable representing the good years and bad years of the economy. The co-variation between two variables stems from their mutual dependence on the systematic factor. Two variables that relate strongly to the systematic factor relate strongly to each other and therefore have a strong correlation. Exposure of $ 1 is assumed to each obligor j. At the end of a one-year analysis horizon, the value of collateral is a random number characterised by three positive parameters: its amount, mj; its volatility, sj; and its sensitivity to X, the systematic risk factor, also known as its “loading”, qj: Collateral = µ 1 + σ...|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{there are}} some {{problems}} in current financial poverty alleviation practice, such as credit rationing, high cost, poor sustainability, and uncertain effects. The banks tend to directly provide the mortgage loan {{because of lack of}} risk identification ability. This makes no contribution to poverty alleviation because the poor have no assets for mortgage. The Internet finance, based on new information technologies which enable more comprehensive information collection of poverty population and employ future-oriented valuation method, can help the poor households to accumulate <b>credit</b> <b>capital</b> and play a greater role in the process of poverty alleviation. In this way, although the poor people lack of physical capital, they can still benefit from the financial market to get out of poverty and be better off with the support of <b>credit</b> <b>capital.</b> Based on this theory model, we also put forward some policy recommendations to support Internet finance poverty alleviation.|$|E
