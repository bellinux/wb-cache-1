5|$|Similar {{mechanisms}} {{exist to}} promote the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins via the proteasome system. In particular, proteasomes localized to the nucleus are regulated by PARP and actively degrade inappropriately oxidized histones. Oxidized proteins, which often form large amorphous aggregates in the cell, can be degraded directly by the 20S core particle without the 19S regulatory cap and do not require ATP hydrolysis or tagging with ubiquitin. However, high levels of oxidative damage increases the degree of <b>cross-linking</b> between protein fragments, rendering the aggregates resistant to proteolysis. Larger numbers and sizes of such highly oxidized aggregates are associated with aging.|$|E
5|$|All LDL {{receptor}} family proteins {{contain a}} cytoplasmic tail {{with at least}} one NPXY motif. This motif is important for binding intracellular adapter proteins and endocytosis. ApoER2 is distinct from most other members of the LDL family of receptors due to a unique insert on its cytoplasmic tail. In ApoER2, there is a proline-rich 59 amino acid insert encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 19. This insert allows for protein interactions that are unable to occur with other LDL receptors. It binds the PSD-95 adapter protein, <b>cross-linking</b> ApoER2 and the NMDA receptors during the process of long-term potentiation, and is also bound specifically by JIP-2, an important interaction in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also speculated that this insert may diminish the function of ApoER2 in lipoprotein endocytosis by somehow disrupting the NPXY motif.|$|E
5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the <b>cross-linking</b> of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E

The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH (to about 6.0 for actinium).

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} repair DNA interstrand <b>cross-links</b> {{may be an}} {{important}} factor contributing to mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin cytotoxicities.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} <b>cross-link</b> density on the {{visco-elastic}} performance of an ad-vanced polymer matrix (LaRC-PETI-SI) was investigated through creep compliance tests. Testing consisted of short-term isothermal creep and recovery with the creep seg-ments performed under constant load. The {{tests were conducted}} at three temperatures be-low the glass transition temperature of each material with different <b>cross-link</b> density. Through the use of time-aging-time superposition procedures, the material constants, ma-terial master curves and aging-related parameters were evaluated at each temperature for a given <b>cross-link</b> density. It was shown that the high <b>cross-link</b> density materials have in-creased creep compliance and creep compliance rate, and are less sensitive to physical ag-ing than the low <b>cross-link</b> density materials. The temperature sensitivity of the time-temperature superposition (TTSP) shift factor was shown to increase monotonically with increasing <b>cross-link</b> density. Furthermore, at the highest temperature, a separation in the TTSP shift factors was apparent between different <b>cross-link</b> densities. This separation occurred at a molecular weight (Mc) of ~ 3321 g/mol...|$|R
