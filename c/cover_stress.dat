40|$|The {{analysis}} of vegetation dynamics {{is essential in}} semi-arid regions, in particular because of the frequent occurrence of long periods of drought.

40|$|Mechanically induced calcite {{twins in}} veins and host rocks of Late Cretaceous to Miocene age in Iran {{have been used}} to {{determine}} regional Arabia-Eurasia collisional stresses. A late folding stress regime with a compression oriented 025 ° (± 15 °) has been identified across the Zagros belt and the southern Iranian Plateau. This late Neogene stress pattern agrees with the current stress field determined from the focal mechanisms of basement earthquakes and suggests that the Hormuz salt décollement poorly decouples the basement and <b>cover</b> <b>stress</b> fields. Our data show that the collisional state of stress has been relatively constant since ca. 5 Ma. The magnitudes of the stresses obtained from the twinning analysis are unexpectedly low, and, to a first approximation, they are constant across the Zagros simply folded belt. This result supports an overall mechanism of buckling of the detached Zagros cover. Internal viscous-plastic processes help to relieve stress within this cover, thus lowering its seismogenic potential. Beyond these regional implications, this study underlines the potential of paleostress analyses in constraining both the tectonics and the mechanics of ancient and active foreland fold belts. O.

40|$|QUESTIONS : Vegetation {{change in}} arid regions with a {{coefficient}} of rainfall exceeding 33 % usually displays non-equilibrium dynamics, where abiotic factors override internal biotic controls. Irreversible changes have nonetheless also been described for arid regions. What are {{the contributions of}} internal/equilibriumvs external/non-equilibriumfactors to vegetation dynamics and can degradation due to overstocking be reversed after removal of livestock? LOCATION : Goegap Nature Reserve, Namaqualand, South Africa. METHODS : The descending point method was conducted annually from 1974 at two transects. Vegetation change was assessed in terms of vegetation cover, species composition, life-form composition, range condition, species richness and diversity. Principal coordinates {{analysis was used to}} illustrate the trajectories in floristic data, and the effects of stocking density and rainfall were examined with redundancy analysis. RESULTS : Vegetation cover, species richness and Shannon-Wiener index of diversity showed an increase and range condition improved with time. These positive changes could be related to the removal of high numbers of livestock and low wildlife numbers {{in the first years of}} survey. A gradual decline in the rate of increase in some of these parameters could be related to high grazing pressure during the later monitored years. There was a notable increase in nonsucculent chamaephytes, but the initial increase in succulent chamaephytes was not sustained. The directional change evident in perennial species composition, supports the equilibrium concept, whereby the negative changes induced by heavy grazing were partially reversed. Within the directional change, four quasi-stable states could be distinguished, which could be reconciled with the state-and-transition model. The annual component showed no directional change, but displayed event-driven, non-equilibrium dynamics by fluctuating in reaction to the timing and quantity of rainfall. CONCLUSIONS : The vegetation change displayed elements of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics, and demonstrated that the effects of heavy grazing in the Succulent Karoo were reversible. Overall, the recovery process proceeded slowly and was primarily detected in the perennial component of the vegetation. The increase in wildlife numbers in the later studied years and decline in perennial vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>stress</b> the need for active management of animal numbers to avoid vegetation degradation.

40|$|International audienceA {{temporal}} and spatial scaling analysis of Arctic sea ice deformation is performed over timescales from 3 h to 3 months and over spatial scales from 300 m to 300 km. The deformation {{is derived from the}} dispersion of pairs of drifting buoys, using the IABP (International Arctic Buoy Program) buoy data sets. This study characterizes the deformation of a very large solid plate (the Arctic sea ice <b>cover)</b> <b>stressed</b> by heterogeneous forcing terms like winds and ocean currents. It shows that the sea ice deformation rate depends on the scales of observation following specific space and time scaling laws. These scaling properties share similarities with those observed for turbulent fluids, especially for the ocean and the atmosphere. However, in our case, the time scaling exponent depends on the spatial scale, and the spatial exponent on the temporal scale, which implies a time/space coupling. An analysis of the exponent values shows that Arctic sea ice deformation is very heterogeneous and intermittent whatever the scales, i. e., it cannot be considered as viscous-like, even at very large time and/or spatial scales. Instead, it suggests a deformation accommodated by a multiscale fracturing/faulting processes...|$|R

40|$|Emergent {{plants can}} be {{suitable}} indicators of anthropogenic stress in coastal wetlands if {{their responses to}} natural environmental variation can be parsed from their responses to human activities in and around wetlands. We used hierarchical partitioning to evaluate the independent influence of geomorphology, geography, and anthropogenic stress on common wetland plants of the U. S.

A seven-taxon model predicted condition relative to watershed-derived anthropogenic stress, and a four-taxon model predicted condition relative to within-wetland anthropogenic stressors that modified hydrology. The Great Lake on which the wetlands occurred explained {{an average of about}} half the variation in species cover, and subdividing the data by lake allowed us to remove that source of variation. We developed lake-specific multi-taxa models for all of the Great Lakes except Lake Ontario, which had no plant species with significant independent effects of anthropogenic stress. Plant responses were both positive (increasing <b>cover</b> with <b>stress)</b> and negative (decreasing <b>cover</b> with <b>stress),</b> and plant taxa incorporated into the lake-specific models differed by Great Lake.
