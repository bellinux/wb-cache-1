40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contemplate}} the degree to which Singaporean firms comply with the highly technical disclosure requirements required under International Accounting Standards (IAS) IAS 36 specific to goodwill impairment testing. Design/methodology/approach – The adoption of IAS in Singapore from 1 July 2004 introduced a highly technical standard (financial reporting standards – FRS 36) which has challenged many preparers. While it is generally accepted that accounting compliance may be suboptimal in transition periods as preparers accommodate change, it is assumed compliance quality improves with the passage of time. This study examines compliance of the largest 168 Singaporean goodwill-intensive firms over a three year period, 2005 - 2007, to interrogate compliance quality post-transition. Findings – The paper reports distinctly poor compliance systemically over the three years across many facets of goodwill impairment testing disclosures including <b>cash-generating</b> <b>unit</b> (CGU) definition and goodwill allocation, and key input variables used in estimating CGU recoverable amounts. Practical implications – The results raise questions about the quality of accounting information among goodwill-intensive firms in Singapore and the robustness of regulatory oversight institutions operating within Singapore. Originality/value – The paper illustrates a novel approach to examining the issue of accounting quality under IFRS by examining compliance quality through large sample time-series analysis focusing on note-form disclosures. 24 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract One of {{the most}} {{significant}} development in the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) has been the increased use of fair values as the most commonly used asset valuation approach. According to standard setters, the use of fair value estimates in valuing assets provides users of financial information more timely, accurate and transparent information of the underlying economic condition of companies that apply IFRS standards in their financial statements. This in turn improves the decision usefulness of financial information reported in these financial statements. Nevertheless, valuing assets at their fair values can be a complex task which requires a number of managers’ assumptions and estimations for the valuation of assets that are not actively traded in markets. Further, assets that are valued at their fair values can be opportunistically overstated or understated when such managements’ unverifiable estimates are used in valuing assets. The issue with unverifiable estimates is especially problematic with goodwill, which is recognized in a business combination as the excess of the purchase price and the fair value of net assets received in the acquisition. The current IFRS standards require companies to carry out an annual impairment test for goodwill instead of straight-line amortization. According to the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 36 Impairment of Assets, companies that apply IFRS standards in their financial reporting must apply fair value estimates to determine goodwill impairments. That is, a company must record a goodwill impairment loss if the fair value of a <b>cash-generating</b> <b>unit</b> to which goodwill has been allocated is less than its carrying amount. The IAS 36 standard itself does not give specific guidelines on how the goodwill impairment test should be executed. Thus, the standard may provide managers incentives to opportunistically manipulate the outcomes of goodwill impairment tests in order to overstate or understate earnings. The purpose of the thesis is to examine the determinants of goodwill impairment losses in Finnish listed companies. The determinants examined in the thesis are divided into three categories: the economic or actual indications of goodwill impairments, managerial discretion and corporate governance mechanisms. Firstly, the thesis examines the actual economic occurrences that impact on goodwill impairment losses in Finnish listed companies. Secondly, the thesis studies the extent to which managers of Finnish listed companies utilize discretion in goodwill impairment decisions. Finally, the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on goodwill impairment losses is investigated to determine whether the managers of Finnish listed companies are opportunistically manipulating goodwill impairment tests or if indications of opportunistic behavior are in fact due to managers’ attempts to convey their private information on the underlying economic condition of the company. The findings of the thesis indicate that the leading economic factors affecting goodwill impairment losses are a company’s book-to-market ratio and the amount of goodwill to total assets. The results show that the higher a company’s book-to-market ratio the more likely the company is to report a goodwill impairment loss. Likewise, the higher the amount of goodwill is to total assets the more likely a company is to impair goodwill. These results are consistent with a number of prior research on the subject. Furthermore, as predicted, the results disclose that Finnish listed companies that have experienced a recent change in CEO are more likely to impair goodwill. Newly appointed CEOs may be more inclined to impair goodwill in order to blame the impairments on the previous CEO. On the other hand, new CEOs may impair goodwill as they try to help a troubled company by restructuring a company’s assets. Finally, the results show a significant relationship between big bath behavior and goodwill impairment losses: companies that have abnormally low earnings are more likely to report goodwill impairment losses during in order to report higher future earnings. However, the results show no significant relationship between goodwill impairment losses and corporate governance mechanisms. This could mean that the managers of Finnish listed companies may be to some extent manipulating the outcomes goodwill impairment tests. The results of the thesis should be of standard setter’s interest. In order to assess if IAS 36 serves its purpose to provide users of financial information more timely and decision usefulness information on the fair values of a company’s assets and value, the standard setters should evaluate the findings of studies on goodwill impairment losses and the determinants that explain them. Additionally, the results of the thesis can be used in order to identify the circumstances in which managers may have incentives to opportunistically manipulate outcomes of goodwill impairment tests...|$|E

40|$|An {{accounting}} standard for goodwill, AASB 136 Impairment of Assets was implemented in Australia in 2005. However, several issues {{of compliance with}} the Standard were noted in the initial adoption periods. This study examines goodwill reporting practices in Australia over the five-year period from 2005 to 2010. It explores {{the extent to which}} Australian listed entities complied with mandatory requirements in relation to impairment testing. Using a sample of 287 Australian listed firms, we found that compliance with the Standard's goodwill allocation requirements generally improved; however, there was still non-compliance for all reporting periods. Also, there was a tendency for firms to define the same or smaller numbers of <b>cash-generating</b> <b>units</b> (CGUs) than reporting segments. This suggests the existence of CGU aggregation, which may have the capacity to influence the incidence of goodwill impairment, and thereby the financial position of an entity. Coupled with non-compliance and a lack of audit attention, compliance issues surrounding goodwill impairment testing under AASB 136 still remain of concern to regulators. The findings are useful to academics, regulators and policymakers because they signal the (lack of) compliance with AASB 136. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{critically}} {{examine the}} change in accounting treatment for goodwill pursuant to international financial reporting standards (IFRSs) by reference to the Australian reporting regime. Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses and compares the former Australian and the new IFRS treatments for goodwill. This comparison focuses on the advantages and potential complexities of the new method, {{with the aim of}} identifying the issues and challenges that preparers, independent auditors and those involved in corporate governance face in complying with the new requirements. Findings – The paper highlights that the identification and valuation of <b>cash-generating</b> <b>units</b> and goodwill require numerous assumptions to be made in estimating fair value, value in use and recoverable amount. Considerable ambiguity and subjectivity are inherent in the IFRS requirements. Research limitations/implications – Findings suggest that future research should examine how financial report preparers and corporate governance mechanisms are dealing with the complex change required by the new goodwill accounting treatment and how the many critical issues involved in auditing the resulting figures are being addressed. Practical implications – The research has practical implications for financial report preparers in identifying the issues that must be addressed in complying with the international goodwill accounting treatment. In turn, the paper highlights conceptual issues of relevance to auditors in their role of providing assurance on the resulting accounting numbers. It also has implications for others involved in corporate governance, such as audit committee members, in emphasising the areas in which they should be providing oversight of the accounting judgments. These issues are of relevance in any reporting regime based on IFRSs. Originality/value – While {{much has been written about}} the mechanics of the new goodwill accounting requirements, there has been a lack of critical research highlighting the many problems and ambiguities that will arise in the application of those rules. <br /...|$|R
