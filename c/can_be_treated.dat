5|$|Tetrabenazine was {{approved}} in 2008 {{for treatment of}} chorea in Huntington's disease in the US. Other drugs that help to reduce chorea include neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Compounds such as amantadine or remacemide are still under investigation but have shown preliminary positive results. Hypokinesia and rigidity, especially in juvenile cases, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with antiparkinsonian drugs, and myoclonic hyperkinesia <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with valproic acid.|$|E
5|$|Clonazepam, a {{benzodiazepine}} is used {{to treat}} many forms of parasomnia. Rapid eye movement behavior disorder responds well to low doses of clonazepam. Restless legs syndrome <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> using clonazepam as a third line treatment option {{as the use of}} clonazepam is still investigational.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the acute}} side effects {{associated}} with brachytherapy <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with medication or through dietary changes, and usually disappear over time (typically {{a matter of}} weeks), once the treatment is completed. The acute side effects of HDR brachytherapy are broadly similar to EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{with less}} potent forms of solar {{urticaria}} such as fixed solar urticaria <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with the medication fexofenadine, which {{may also be}} used prophylactically to prevent recurrence.|$|E
5|$|A diamond {{simulant}} is a non-diamond {{material that}} is used to simulate the appearance of a diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. Cubic zirconia is the most common. The gemstone moissanite (silicon carbide) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as a diamond simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia. Both are produced synthetically.|$|E

5|$|After it is dissolved, osmium is {{separated}} from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> using powder metallurgy techniques.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{de-icing}} vehicles usually {{consist of}} a large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Mildew: {{which is}} {{characterized}} by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring. The flowers will turn a creamy yellow color and will not develop correctly. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> in a manner not dissimilar from treating Botrytis; eliminating the conditions which caused the disease {{in the first place}} and burning the infected plants are among the recommended actions to take.|$|E

5|$|Myrmecia stings {{are very}} potent, and the venoms from these ants {{are among the}} most toxic in the insect world. In Tasmania, 3% of the human {{population}} are allergic to the venom of M. pilosula and can suffer life-threatening anaphylactic reactions if stung; many human deaths have been recorded. People prone to severe allergic reactions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E
5|$|Prevention at the {{population}} level {{has been with}} the universal salt iodization. Hypothyroidism <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with levothyroxine. The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important, excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Prevention is by washing {{hands and}} not sharing eating utensils. There is no vaccine for the disease. Treatment with {{antibiotics}} is only recommended {{in those with}} a confirmed diagnosis. Those infected should stay away from other people for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. Pain <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen.|$|E

5|$|Psychiatric {{symptoms}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with medications {{similar to}} those used in the general population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mirtazapine have been recommended for depression, while atypical antipsychotic drugs are recommended for psychosis and behavioral problems. Specialist neuropsychiatric input is recommended as people may require long-term treatment with multiple medications in combination.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{astronomy}} uses radiation {{outside the}} visible range with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter. Radio astronomy {{is different from}} most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|Sliced apples turn {{brown with}} {{exposure}} to air {{due to the}} conversion of natural phenolic substances into melanin upon exposure to oxygen. Different cultivars vary in their propensity to brown after slicing and the genetically engineered Arctic Apples do not brown. Sliced fruit <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with acidulated water to prevent this effect. Sliced apple consumption tripled in the US from 2004 to 2014 to 500 million apples annually due to its convenience.|$|E

5|$|There is {{debate about}} the {{taxonomy}} of the genus, {{as the number of}} accepted species varies from 13 to 30. The five domesticated species are Cucurbita argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.maxima, C.moschata, and C.pepo. All of these <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as winter squash because the full-grown fruits can be stored for months; however, C.pepo includes some cultivars that are better used only as summer squash.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold. The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. No cure {{for the common}} cold exists, but the symptoms <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated.</b> Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> {{as a form of}} predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E
