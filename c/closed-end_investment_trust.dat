5000|$|Dillon Read traces {{its roots}} to 1832 with the {{founding}} of the Wall Street brokerage firm Carpenter & Vermilye. This firm was succeeded by Read & Company in which chief principal was William A. Read. [...] An area of particular activity was underwriting the bonds of Latin American governments. However, it is best known for its actions during the 1920s. During that time Clarence Dillon managed the rescue of faltering Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, engineered the buyout (in 1925) and subsequent sale of Dodge Motors (in 1928) to Chrysler, launched the first post-war <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> (in 1924), and led the largest-ever stock offering (in 1926). By the end of the decade, Dillon Read was considered to be an investment-banking powerhouse, alongside J.P. Morgan & Co. and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Nicholas F. Brady served as Chairman from 1970 to 1982, before serving as a United States Senator from New Jersey and as U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. C. Douglas Dillon, the son of Dillon Read co-founder Clarence Dillon, served as Vice President and Director of Dillon Read before serving as U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under John F. Kennedy and as U.S. Undersecretary of State and U.S. Ambassador to France under Dwight Eisenhower.|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{development}} of the <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> in both the UK and the US, {{in the context of the}} investment management strategies adopted and whether they provided value-added services for investors. Although US investment trusts of the 1920 s boom years were heavily influenced by their earlier UK counterparts, they differed from British investment trusts in a number of key ways, in particular, size, capital structure, tax and accounting practices, management, and costs. These differences led to their relatively much worse performance in the stock market crash of the late 1920 s and early 1930 s. This poor US trust performance led directly to the creation of the US open-ended ‘fixed trust’, marketed as an antidote to the generally poor management of conventional closed-end investment trusts. As confidence in mutual funds slowly returned in the United States, open-ended funds were gradually given more flexibility, but US investment trust companies, with share prices at a steep discount to liquidation value, and partly blamed for the crash, were encouraged to convert to mutual fund status by the 1936 Revenue Act. By 1944, open-end funds had overtaken investment trusts in terms of asset size, a phenomenon that did not occur in Britain for another 30 years...|$|E
40|$|Using <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> as subject-matter, {{this paper}} explores this question: Are some {{portfolio}} managers "really" better than others? i. e., are there differences in performance among managers {{other than those}} differences due to chance? It also throws some light on whether investors, in the aggregate, act rationally upon the knowledge of performance that is reasonably available {{to them in the}} pricing of securities. The results of the study suggest that there is some consistency over time in a closed-end trust's relative success in portfolio management; success in any year is apparently not just a random occurrence, and hence some degree of "good" portfolio management of closed-end trusts seems to exist. (However, the lack of dependence from year to year calls this conclusion into question.) As is therefore rational, the price of the stock, as measured by the discount or premium at which it sells, is loosely related to the closed-end stock's success. The discount (premium) is therefore a better-than-chance prediction of the trust's success in the following year. Further research is called for to check the findings given here and to unravel some of the perplexities. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} IFRS {{on the performance of}} UK <b>investment</b> <b>closed-end</b> <b>trust</b> funds with domestic equity focus using Carhart’s Four-Factor model. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which argues that all available information is already included in the price of assets and therefore, investors cannot beat the market or generate abnormal returns. Findings: The results show that on average UK <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> do not generate abnormal returns, nor is their performance persistent. Our study provides empirical evidence to supports the efficient market hypotheses, and provides proof that the adoption of IFRS has on average, a decreasing impact on the excess returns generated by UK <b>investment</b> <b>trusts.</b> Originality/Value: The findings of the paper have business policy implications for <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> in the UK...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of Swedish and Scandinavian investor sentiment on the net asset value discounts of <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> companies. While previous studies have linked sentiment to discounts, both Scandinavian and Swedish evidence is lacking. The study contributes to existing literature by further developing the methodology by Baker & Wurgler (2006) to examine the investor sentiment effect brought forward by Lee et al. (1991) in a Scandinavian setting. In particular, this study offers additional evidence to Hjelström (2007) regarding the aggregate discounts of <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> companies in Swedish capital markets. Unlike previous studies, I provide evidence on individual investment companies and consider both regional and local sentiment as an explanatory factor. DATA The investor sentiment data set covers quarterly data for stock mutual fund inflows, trading volume for aggregate equity markets, and the number and first-day returns of all main-list IPOs within the time period of 1. 1. 1999 to 31. 3. 2011 separately for Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway. The net asset value data set covers 854 quarter-end net asset value discounts (or premiums) of 20 <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> companies during the same time period. Both of the novel datasets were manually collected from multiple sources. RESULTS My main findings indicate that the aggregate net asset value discount of <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> companies is not a sentiment indicator. I show that investor sentiment does not affect aggregate discounts but rather affects the discounts of individual <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> companies. Furthermore, sentiment affects the discounts of individual investment companies in conflicting ways (i. e. positive sentiment can either increase or decrease discounts). Finally, I find evidence indicating that discounts of individual investment companies do not exhibit correlation, and that the strength of the sentiment effect varies substantially between different types of individual investment companies. My results are mostly in contrast to Lee et al. (1991) but in line with Hjelström (2007) ...|$|R

40|$|In open-end {{mutual funds}} (unit trusts), {{there is a}} strong {{positive}} cross-sectional relationship between net inflows to individual funds and past performance, as if investors attributed performance to managerial skill. Performance shows only very weak persistence, however, so at first sight investors do not appear to gain anything by responding to past performance information. This behaviour {{can be explained by the}} fact that past performance is effectively unpriced in the unit trust market, since management fees are unresponsive to demand. If investors believe that there is a non-zero probability that future performance will turn out to be positively correlated with past performance (i. e. that there is an element of managerial skill in performance), but a zero probability that this correlation will be negative, it is rational to prefer funds with better past performance when performance is not priced. In other words, it costs nothing to insure against the possibility of some managerial skill effect. If this explanation of the flow-performance relationship in unit trusts is correct, one would expect the relationship between investor demand and past fund performance to be much weaker if past performance were to be priced. We test this hypothesis in the market for <b>closed-end</b> funds (<b>investment</b> <b>trusts).</b> Because <b>closed-end</b> funds do not trade at net asset value, but at a price determined in the market, strong demand will raise the ratio of price to net asset value (known as the premium). Since it is well established that premiums are mean-reverting, future shareholder returns on funds currently on high premiums tend to be depressed by the reversion of the premium to the mean. In the closed-end fund market, as for open-end funds, there is little evidence of performance persistence, and therefore, to the extent that funds with good past performance are pushed to higher premiums, the expected return on them is less than on the average fund. This implicit pricing mechanism should mean that demand is a declining function of the premium, so that, even if demand is an increasing function of past performance for a given premium, any effect on the premium itself will be muted. We test this hypothesis for closed-end funds traded in the US and the UK. We find that there is a statistically significant effect of past performance on the premium in both countries. However, consistent with the hypothesis, it has limited economic significance, since it represents only a small component of premium variability. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
