5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{believed}} to be the first steel box girder bridge built in the United States, and is considered a prototype of the cable-stayed bridge of which a very similar design by the Germans was completed, the Stroemsund Bridge in Sweden.

5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the <b>Chow</b> <b>Chow,</b> Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E

25|$|A genetic {{study has}} been done in Germany using the Elo, calculating the {{proportion}} of genes of the different founder breeds, of the inbreeding coefficient and relationship coefficients, and the percentage of stillborn puppies in litters. The study also found that all but 3.5% of the Elo were related to each other. The significant gene percentages of the Elo are 48% Eurasier, 23% Old English Sheepdog, 10% <b>Chow</b> <b>chow.</b> The inbreeding coefficient was found to be 12.04%.|$|E
25|$|The {{study found}} {{distinct}} genetic clusters within modern dogs that largely corresponded to phenotype or function. These included spitz-breeds, toy dogs, spaniels, Mastiff-like breeds, small terriers, retrievers, herding dogs, scent-hounds and sight-hounds. There were 17breeds that conflicted with phenotype or function {{and these were}} thought {{to be the result of}} crossing some of the other phenotypes. As in a 2004 study that found 9‘ancient breeds’ to be genetically divergent, the study found 13breeds that were genetically divergent from the modern breeds: the Basenji, Saluki, Afghan hound, Samoyed, Canaan dog, New Guinea singing dog, dingo, <b>Chow</b> <b>Chow,</b> Chinese Shar Pei, Akita, Alaskan malamute, Siberian husky and American Eskimo dog. Results also indicated that the Basenji had recent admixture with Middle Eastern wolves.|$|E

After pushing the car {{the rest of the}} way to the mansion, Tyson shows the trio footage of them at his house to help them locate Doug.

2500|$|The English word [...] "chopstick" [...] {{may have}} derived from Chinese Pidgin English, in which [...] "chop chop" [...] meant [...] "quickly".

Another possibility, is that the term is derived from <b>chow</b> (<b>chow</b> <b>chow)</b> which is also a pidgin word stemming from Southeast Asia meaning food, thus chopsticks would simply mean 'food sticks'. Also, the Middle Chinese pronunciation of the sign for chopsticks is [...] and in Korean chopsticks are chŏkkarak, where [...] "chok" [...] is the pronunciation of the same Chinese sign and [...] "karak" [...] is the word for [...] "stick".

2500|$|Legislative {{bodies have}} {{addressed}} concerns about dog bites that include licensing laws, statutes outlawing [...] organized dogfights, and leash laws.

Breeding has continued with long term focus on the inheritance of character.

[...] The impetus for Douglas's move to Iowa was when Walker had invited Chow to teach a clinic at her gym, Excalibur. Douglas was impressed when Chow was able to teach her how to perform the Amanar vault in a single afternoon. Douglas considered a move to Texas to train with a renowned coach there, but after that coach declined to train her out of loyalty to Walker, Douglas selected <b>Chow.</b> <b>Chow</b> was initially skeptical, since Douglas had been just one of hundreds of kids at the clinic in Virginia Beach. However, Chow subsequently informed Douglas's Excalibur coaches that he had agreed to train her, but pointed out that he did not recruit her, saying, [...] "I would never recruit anybody to my program." [...] Later on, Gabby suffered from a hamstring strain and a hip flexor injury in July. She couldn't do much during this time, but this allowed her to improve her bar skills.|$|E
