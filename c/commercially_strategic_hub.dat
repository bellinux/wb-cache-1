The media attention that these new members received during the summit, opened public debates about whether there was still a consensus about the purpose, the perceived threats and the future borders of NATO among its 26 members.

It marked the increasingly key role played by Turkey as a major <b>strategic</b> <b>hub</b> due to its location close to the hotbeds of tension and conflict in the South Caucasus and the Middle East. The location of the summit made clear that NATO’s security concerns had shifted towards the southeastern part of the European continent.

50|$|Most of Syrianair's {{flights are}} multiple-leg flights {{involving}} either {{a stop in}} Aleppo, a combination of international destinations with fifth freedom rights, or triangular routings. This route structure comes {{in sharp contrast to}} the current practices of modern airlines, which tend to focus on high-yield, high frequency nonstop flights evolving around a <b>strategic</b> <b>hub.</b> The airline, which is just completing its fleet modernization, will also need to catch up with modern marketing methods, revamp its in-flight service and become more profit conscious. With a workforce exceeding 4,000 employees, SyrianAir, which revenues nevertheless exceeded 171 million dollars in 2003, remains over-staffed. In 2004, and despite a difficult regional situation and U.S. sanctions, the airline improved its performance, carrying 1.07 million passengers. Syrian air carried close to 1.4 million passengers by 2005 however the number of passengers being carried declined to less than 740,000 passengers by 2009. Plans were made for the renewal of the fleet with the possible acquisition of several new Airbus aircraft in order to replace the ageing Boeing 727 and 747s. These plans were hampered by the reinforcement of a U.S.-led embargo against Syria, and fleet renewal using Russian equipment was being reconsidered.By 2012, Syrian Air had retired all its old Boeing 747,727 and Tupolev aircraft, leaving SyrianAir with just 8 aircraft in its fleet, 2 ATR's and 6 Airbus A320's.|$|R

40|$|The {{interactions}} among languages in the Qinghai Area of China involved the historical migration {{of those who}} came into the area {{at some point in time}} and settled in. In addition, political driving forces dictated various migratory movements of different ethnic groups to settle into the area throughout history. The Qinghai Area, known as Amdo in the Tibetan cultural world, constitutes a geographical depression in the northeastern end of the Tibetan plateau which is ideal for grazing and farming. The climate of the region is largely monitored by the mega size salt water lake known as the Qinghai Lake. The largest number of mixed cultural areal contact occurs around this lake particularly towards the east. The geographical feature of the area has proved itself as a <b>strategic</b> <b>hub</b> for military expansion at different time in history creating dynamics of interaction in every juncture. As a result, different levels of multilingual influences are observed among of the regional languages of each language groups. Among the diversified languages flourished in the area, the most prominent language groups are the Sinitic, Bodic and Mongolic languages. Through studies of corpuses, literature and contributions of human participants, the present condition of multilingual mixing among Chinese, Tibetan and Mongolian were explored. Within the various phenomena of language mixing and language changes, it is notable that these languages have lost parts of their original features while having gained foreign features as a result of language contacts among these ethnic groups. published_or_final_versionLinguisticsMasterMaster of Art...|$|R
