She won the <b>Coast</b> <b>to</b> <b>Coast</b> a record five times (1991–1994, 1996), the national mountain bike series every year until aged 40, and the Karapoti Classic all eight times that she started.

At the 1995 Karapoti Classic, she defeated the world number 2 – Caroline Alexander.|$|E

5|$|Agricola's successors {{were unable}} or unwilling to further subdue the far north. The {{fortress}} at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion, and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge were abandoned within the space of a few years. By CE 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands, {{and by the end of}} the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period, as may Castle Greg in West Lothian. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall from <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> <b>coast.</b>|$|E

As Black is investigating, Watts approaches him, showing him a second photograph of Taylor, now looking sickly, beside the canister. Watts believes she has less than two days to live. Meanwhile, Hollis has discovered that Swan frequently called Art Bell's <b>Coast</b> <b>to</b> <b>Coast</b> AM radio show under a pseudonym to discuss conspiracy theories about Gulf War syndrome. Bell invites Black onto the show to speak to a listening Swan; the two realise that Black's wife was killed by a pathogen Swan was ordered to test on his troops during the Gulf War—an order which came from a group outside of the Army.|$|E

5|$|On December 17, Judge Sanderson finally {{ruled that}} prize {{fighting}} was illegal in San Francisco {{and the courts}} would not determine who the winner was. Sharkey retained the purse, but the decision provided no vindication for Earp. Until the fight, Earp had been a minor figure known regionally in California and Arizona. Afterward, his name was known from <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> <b>coast</b> in the worst possible way. Earp sold his interest in his horses on December 20 and left San Francisco shortly afterward. He only returned when he caught a boat to Alaska. Earp's decision left a smear on his public character that followed him until he died and afterward.|$|E

5|$|Perry was {{inspired}} to write the episode due to his interest in conspiracy theory literature, which he finds interesting but does not believe in. The <b>Coast</b> <b>to</b> <b>Coast</b> AM radio show featured in the episode also served as an inspiration, and its host Art Bell agreed to appear as himself. Guest star James Marsters was cast immediately after his audition {{for the role of}} Eric Swan, and although several of Millennium crew were fans of the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in which Marsters had a recurring role, Perry recalled none of them recognizing the actor during his audition due to the strength of his performance.|$|E
5|$|The Romans began {{military}} expeditions {{into what}} is now Scotland from about 71 CE, building a series of forts, but by 87 the occupation {{was limited to the}} Southern Uplands {{and by the end of}} the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall from <b>coast</b> <b>to</b> <b>coast.</b> Around 141 CE they undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, moving up to construct a new limes between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde, where they built the fortification known as the Antonine Wall. The wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160 and the Romans withdrew back to the line of Hadrian's Wall, until Roman authority collapsed in the early fifth century.|$|E

5|$|Lynch {{competed in}} road races and time trials, and {{off-road}} in cross country, in several world championships. She was not {{selected for the}} New Zealand road cycling team for the 1992 Olympics. She believed that omitting her was a mistake and intended to prove it by doing well at that year's Tour de France Féminin. She placed sixth in that race and demonstrated her good form. In 1992, she entered the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in the veteran category and won bronze in both the cross country and the downhill events. When it was announced in 1994 that mountain biking was to become an Olympic discipline, Lynch's focus turned to being picked for the New Zealand team. For that reason, she swapped from the veteran class to elite at the world championships. She became New Zealand's first representative in an Olympic mountain biking event at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Aged 39, she was the oldest competitor in the event, but managed to achieve eighth place, leaving two previous world champions behind her. She retired from serious competition after the Olympics, {{with the exception of}} the first UCI World Cup in April 1997 that was held in New Zealand. Until her mid-40s, she competed at the top level in adventure racing. During her domestic career, Lynch won many national titles, and was a serial winner at premium events such as the Karapoti Classic and the <b>Coast</b> <b>to</b> <b>Coast.</b>|$|E
