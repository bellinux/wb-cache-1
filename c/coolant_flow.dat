40|$|Abstract — In {{continuous}} {{casting of steel}} a number of param-eters have to be set, such as the casting temperature, casting speed and <b>coolant</b> <b>flows,</b> that critically affect the safety, quality and productivity of steel production. We have implemented an optimization tool consisting of an optimization algorithm and a casting process simulator. The paper describes the process, the optimization task, and the proposed optimization approach, and shows illustrative results of its application on an industrial casting machine where spray <b>coolant</b> <b>flows</b> were optimized. In the comparative study two variants of an evolutionary algorithm and the downhill simplex method were used, {{and they were all}} able to significantly improve the manual setting of <b>coolant</b> <b>flows.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{design for}} the Advanced Neutron Source reactor core consists of closely spaced involute fuel plates. <b>Coolant</b> <b>flows</b> between the plates at high velocities. It is vital that adjacent plates do not come in contact and that the coolant channels between the plates remain open. Several scenarios {{that could result in}} problems with the fuel plates are studied. Finite element analyses are performed on fuel plates under pressure from the <b>coolant</b> <b>flowing</b> between the plates at a high velocity, under pressure because of a partial flow blockage in one of the channels, and with different temperature profiles...|$|R
25|$|The {{short-term}} ECCS subsystem {{consists of}} two groups of six accumulator tanks, containing water blanketed with nitrogen under pressure of 10MPa, connected by fast-acting valves to the reactor. Each group can supply 50% of the maximum <b>coolant</b> <b>flow</b> to the damaged half of the reactor. The third group {{is a set of}} electrical pumps drawing water from the deaerators. The short-term pumps can be powered by the spindown of the main turbogenerators.|$|E
25|$|The main {{circulating}} pumps {{have the capacity}} of 5,500–12,000m³/h and are powered by 6kV electric motors. The normal <b>coolant</b> <b>flow</b> is 8000m³/h per pump; this is throttled down by control valves to 6000–7000m³/h when the reactor power is below 500MWt. Each pump has a flow control valve and a backflow preventing check valve on the outlet, and shutoff valves on both inlet and outlet. Each of the pressure channels in the core has its own flow control valve so that the temperature distribution in the reactor core can be optimized. Each channel has a ball type flow meter.|$|E
25|$|ECCS for {{long-term}} cooling of the damaged circuit {{consists of three}} pairs of electrical pumps, drawing water from the pressure suppression pools; the water is cooled by the plant service water by means of heat exchangers in the suction lines. Each pair is able to supply half of the maximum <b>coolant</b> <b>flow.</b> ECCS {{for long-term}} cooling of the intact circuit consists of three separate pumps drawing water from the condensate storage tanks, each able to supply half of the maximum flow. The ECCS pumps are powered from the essential internal 6kV lines, backed up by diesel generators. Some valves that require uninterrupted power are also backed up by batteries.|$|E

Revised curvatures of nozzle wall provide shortened transonic region and enable selection of approach- and discharge-wall angles for maximum cooling.

Also enables <b>coolant</b> to <b>flow</b> through wall channels with lower pressure drop and lower pumping pressure...|$|R
2500|$|A coil {{condenser}} {{is essentially a}} [...] "Graham condenser" [...] with an inverted coolant/vapor configuration. [...] It has a spiral coil running {{the length of the}} condenser through which <b>coolant</b> <b>flows,</b> and this <b>coolant</b> coil is jacketed by the vapor/condensate path.|$|R
50|$|About {{one-fifth of}} the reactor core had {{experienced}} inadequate cooling caused by uneven <b>coolant</b> <b>flows.</b> Hot spots in the reactor had ruptured, releasing nuclear fuel and nuclear fission products into the liquid-metal coolant, which circulated them throughout its reactor compartment.|$|R
25|$|A nuclear {{meltdown}} is {{a severe}} nuclear reactor accident {{that results in}} reactor core damage from overheating. It {{has been defined as}} the accidental melting of the core of a nuclear reactor, and refers to the core's either complete or partial collapse. A core melt accident occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the cooling systems to the point where at least one nuclear fuel element exceeds its melting point. This differs from a fuel element failure, which is not caused by high temperatures. A meltdown may be caused by a loss of coolant, loss of coolant pressure, or low <b>coolant</b> <b>flow</b> rate or be the result of a criticality excursion in which the reactor is operated at a power level that exceeds its design limits. Alternately, in a reactor plant such as the RBMK-1000, an external fire may endanger the core, leading to a meltdown.|$|E
25|$|Boric acid {{is used in}} some {{nuclear power}} plants as a neutron poison. The boron in boric acid reduces the {{probability}} of thermal fission by absorbing some thermal neutrons. Fission chain reactions are generally driven by the probability that free neutrons will result in fission and {{is determined by the}} material and geometric properties of the reactor. Natural boron consists of approximately 20% boron-10 and 80% boron-11 isotopes. Boron-10 has a high cross-section for absorption of low energy (thermal) neutrons. By increasing boric acid concentration in the reactor coolant, the probability that a neutron will cause fission is reduced. Changes in boric acid concentration can effectively regulate the rate of fission taking place in the reactor. Boric acid is used only in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) whereas boiling water reactors (BWRs) employ control rod pattern and <b>coolant</b> <b>flow</b> for power control. BWRs use an aqueous solution of boric acid and borax or Sodium Pentaborate for an emergency shut down system. Boric acid may be dissolved in spent fuel pools used to store spent fuel elements. The concentration is high enough to keep neutron multiplication at a minimum. Boric acid was dumped over Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant after its meltdown to prevent another reaction from occurring.|$|E
2500|$|The Super Coupe {{came with}} an engine {{having the same}} {{displacement}} (3.8L) as the naturally aspirated V6, though most all internal components were upgraded to handle the increased torque and temperature generated due to {{the addition of a}} supercharger. Among the modifications, the engine block and heads were modified to enhance <b>coolant</b> <b>flow,</b> the crankshaft was upgraded to a fully counter weighted forged unit, the billet roller cam had a unique profile, and the pistons were made of a stronger hypereutectic alloy. The supercharger utilized was an Eaton M90 roots-style, designed for mounting atop the intake manifold. Boost pressure during hard acceleration under ideal conditions is approximately [...]|$|E
50|$|Larger {{condensers}} {{are also}} used in industrial-scale distillation processes to cool distilled vapor into liquid distillate. Commonly, the <b>coolant</b> <b>flows</b> through the tube side and distilled vapor through the shell side with distillate collecting at or flowing out the bottom.|$|R
5000|$|A coil {{condenser}} {{is essentially a}} [...] "Graham condenser" [...] with an inverted coolant/vapor configuration. It has a spiral coil running {{the length of the}} condenser through which <b>coolant</b> <b>flows,</b> and this <b>coolant</b> coil is jacketed by the vapor/condensate path.|$|R
2500|$|A Dimroth condenser, {{named after}} Otto Dimroth, is {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} [...] "coil condenser"; it has an internal double spiral through which <b>coolant</b> <b>flows</b> such that the coolant inlet and outlet are both at the top. The vapors travel through the jacket from bottom to top. Dimroth condensers are more effective than conventional coil condensers. They are often found in rotary evaporators.|$|R
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common example of purely {{mechanical}} thermostat technology in use today is {{the internal combustion engine}} cooling system thermostat, used to maintain the engine near its optimum operating temperature by regulating the flow of coolant to an air-cooled radiator. This type of thermostat operates using a sealed chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a set temperature. The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a valve when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is determined by the composition of the wax. [...] Once the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and <b>coolant</b> <b>flow</b> to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electrical}} energy {{is generated by}} a pair of 500MW hydrogen-cooled turbogenerators. These are located in the -long machine hall, adjacent to the reactor building. The turbines, the venerable five-cylinder K-500-65/3000, are supplied by the Kharkiv turbine plant; the electrical generators are the TVV-500. The turbine and the generator rotors are mounted on the same shaft; the combined weight of the rotors is almost [...] and their nominal rotational speed is 3000rpm. The turbogenerator is [...] long and its total weight is [...] The <b>coolant</b> <b>flow</b> for each turbine is /h. The generator produces 20kV 50Hz AC power. The generator's stator is cooled by water while its rotor is cooled by hydrogen. The hydrogen for the generators is manufactured on-site by electrolysis. The design and reliability of the turbines earned them the State Prize of Ukraine for 1979.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nuclear power}} {{industry}} {{has moved to}} improve engineering design. Generation IV reactors are now in late stage design and development to improve safety, sustainability, efficiency, and cost. Key to the latest designs {{is the concept of}} passive nuclear safety. [...] Passive nuclear safety does not require operator actions or electronic feedback in order to shut down safely {{in the event of a}} particular type of emergency (usually overheating resulting from a loss of coolant or loss of <b>coolant</b> <b>flow).</b> This is in contrast to older-yet-common reactor designs, where the natural tendency for the reaction was to accelerate rapidly from increased temperatures. [...] In such a case, cooling systems must be operative to prevent meltdown. [...] Past design mistakes like Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake. New reactors with passive nuclear safety eliminate this failure mode.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear Management Company, LLC, (NMC) {{proposes to}} amend Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Facility Operating License DRP- 43 by {{incorporating}} the attached changes into Technical Specification (TS) 3. 10. m for Reactor <b>Coolant</b> Minimum <b>Flow.</b> NMC plans to replace existing Westinghouse Model 51 original steam generators (OSG) with Westinghouse Model 54 F replacement steam generators (RSG) {{in the fall}} of 2001. Plugging and repair of OSG tubes during their operating life has diminished flow-performance. This reduction in performance required amendments to TS 3. 1 0. m {{from time to time in}} order to make Reactor <b>Coolant</b> Minimum <b>Flow</b> consistent with diminished flow. Now that the OSGs are being replaced, it is necessary to again amend TS 3. 10. m to return the minimum flow value to one appropriate for the new, non-repaired, RSGs. The last amendment (Reference 1) to TS 3. 10. m reduced Reactor <b>Coolant</b> Minimum <b>Flow</b> to 85, 500 gpm average flow per loop. KNPP is now requesting NRC approval for return of Reactor <b>Coolant</b> Minimum <b>Flow</b> to a value of 93, 000 gpm for the RSGs. This value is 440 gpm greater flow than the original value for the OSGs when new of 92, 560 gpm; a slight difference in the conservative direction.

2500|$|A Friedrichs {{condenser}} (sometimes incorrectly {{referred to}} as [...] "Friedrich's" [...] condenser), a spiraled finger condenser, was invented by Fritz Walter Paul Friedrichs, who published a design {{for this type of}} condenser in 1912. It consists of a large, spiraled internal cold finger-type capillary tube disposed within a wide cylindrical housing. <b>Coolant</b> <b>flows</b> through the internal cold finger; accordingly, vapors rising up through the housing must pass along the spiraled path.|$|R
50|$|The 10A {{featured}} twin side intake ports per rotor, each fed {{by one of}} four carburetor barrels. Only one port per rotor {{was used}} under low loads for added fuel economy. A single peripheral exhaust port routed hot gas through the coolest parts of the housing, and engine <b>coolant</b> <b>flowed</b> axially rather than the radial flow used by NSU. A bit of oil was mixed with the intake charge for lubrication.|$|R
50|$|Other {{changes to}} the engine were related to ease of {{manufacture}} and improved reliability. This led to elimination of <b>coolant</b> <b>flowing</b> through the intake manifold to prevent unnecessary heat transfer. To perform this change, {{the front of the}} engine block was extended to include provisions for the <b>coolant</b> to <b>flow</b> through a cross over in the block. This extension also acted as an integrated timing chain housing. The timing chain housing was covered with flat steel that was easier to seal than the typical large timing chain cover used on other Ford V8s. These changes resulted in a bigger and heavier engine block than the Windsor V8s. The 351 Cleveland was not an all-new design, but a development of the 351W into a higher-performance variation.|$|R

50|$|A heat {{exchanger}} will transfer heat {{directly from the}} chilled water loop to the cooling tower loop. The exchanger keeps the cooling tower water separate from the <b>coolant</b> <b>flowing</b> through the cooling coils. The chiller water is thus pre-cooled. An energy savings is due to reduced chiller loading and thus a reduction in energy consumption. There {{is an increase in}} cost due to the pump needing to compensate for the pressure differences.|$|R
