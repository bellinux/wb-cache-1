5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it felt like a painting that <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>life.</b> That's what I was trying to do.|$|E

25|$|Many ancient mythologies, {{and most}} modern {{religions}} include artificial people, {{such as the}} mechanical servants built by the Greek god Hephaestus (Vulcan to the Romans), the clay golems of Jewish legend and clay giants of Norse legend, and Galatea, the mythical statue of Pygmalion that <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>life.</b> Since circa 400 BC, myths of Crete include Talos, a man of bronze who guarded the Cretan island of Europa from pirates.|$|E
25|$|Tensor {{calculus}} really <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>life,</b> however, {{with the}} advent of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity in 1915. A few years after this, Levi-Civita formalized the unique connection associated to a Riemannian metric, now known as the Levi-Civita connection. More general affine connections were then studied around 1920, by Hermann Weyl, who developed a detailed mathematical foundation for general relativity, and Élie Cartan, who made the link with the geometrical ideas coming from surface theory.|$|E

25|$|The Survivors was {{published}} on March 28, 2011 by independent publisher Chafie Press,. The {{idea for the}} series <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> in June 2009 while Havard was driving to a friend's wedding in Tupelo, Mississippi. The writing process for the first book took only 27 days from idea to end while Havard was still obtaining her advanced degree from Vanderbilt University. The Survivors is also the pilot version of the Immersedition™ book app. The Immersedition™ version includes original music (written by Havard), maps, photos, music videos, historical and mythological background information, author commentary, and other relevant additions to the story world. The Survivors was also released in syndication on Wattpad throughout 2011 and has received over 5 million reads.|$|E

25|$|In Week 17, Vince Young and the Titans' playoff wishes <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> as they {{defeated}} the Indianapolis Colts 16–10 to clinch the 6th {{seed in the}} AFC Playoffs. Young would leave {{the game in the}} 3rd quarter after suffering {{what seemed to be a}} re-injury of his right quad which kept him out for a game earlier in the season. Backup quarterback Kerry Collins would enter in the game and lead the Titans to 2 field goals to break a 10–10 tie and seal the victory. Before the injury, Young posted some of his best numbers of the year by completing 14 of 18 passes for 157 yards with 0 touchdowns, 0 interceptions, and posting a 103.0 QB Rating.|$|E
25|$|A further major {{component}} of the armed resistance consisted of individuals and groups motivated by anti-communist convictions and persuaded that only an armed engagement could contain increasing terror and prevent an irrevocable communist takeover. Some of the resistance groups were led by ex-army officers and acted in a more coordinated and planned way. It appears that they put their hope in stirring up a more general armed insurrection, which never <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>life.</b> A smaller category of insurgents were Romanian refugees recruited in Europe by the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), trained in France, Italy and Greece and then dropped in the Carpathians. It seems, however, that most of them, {{not being able to}} create local contacts imperative for survival, were soon captured.|$|E
25|$|The best-known {{account of}} Wei Boyang {{is found in}} the Shenxian zhuan (Biographies of the Divine Immortals), a work {{attributed}} to Ge Hong (283-343). According to this record (trans. Campany, 2002:368-69), Wei Boyang {{was the son of a}} high-ranking family. He and three disciples retired to a mountain and compounded an elixir. When they tested it on a dog, the dog died. Despite this, Wei Boyang and one of his disciples decided to ingest the compound, and they also died. After the two other disciples had left, Wei Boyang <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> again. He poured some of the elixir into the mouths of the dead disciple and the dog, and they also revived. Thus Wei Boyang and his faithful disciple attained immortality. With an abrupt change in tone and language, the account ends with a final paragraph, which mentions Wei Boyang’s authorship of the Cantong qi and of another work entitled The Five Categories (Wu xianglei 五相類), criticizing at the same time those who read the Cantong qi as a work concerned with cosmology instead of alchemy.|$|E

25|$|East Carolina (ECU) got {{the ball}} to start the game, and {{promptly}} went three-and-out, ultimately punting. Ohio achieved a few first downs, however quarterback Tyler Tettleton threw an interception to Michael Dobson, setting ECU up with good field position around midfield. On the ensuing possession, ECU drove down the field on 5 plays for 55 yards, with the drive culminating in a 5-yard pass from Shane Carden to Cam Worthy, taking a 7–0 lead. Ohio failed to respond, and punted on their next drive. When ECU regained possession of the ball, they embarked on a drive that was highlighted by a 39-yard rush by Vintavious Cooper, {{as well as a}} 15-yard pass to Justin Hardy on which he broke the career receiving yard record, but failed to score when Ohio stopped ECU on a fourth down conversion attempt in the red zone. Ohio could not capitalize, and ultimately punted. ECU subsequently embarked on an 11-play drive that covered 76-yards and took up 3:40, and culminated with a 2-yard run by Breon Allen for a touchdown. Ohio's offense finally <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> on their next drive, which culminated in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} World Series game ever played in Colorado. At 4 hours 19 minutes, it became the longest nine-inning game in World Series history until game five of 2017. Game3 was also the 600th World Series game ever played. Starting pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka pitched five innings of {{scoreless}} ball and left in the sixth with no runs allowed. The Red Sox struck first with a six-run third inning. Rookie Jacoby Ellsbury hit a leadoff double, moved to third on Dustin Pedroia's single, and scored on David Ortiz's double. After Manny Ramirez was intentionally walked, Mike Lowell's single scored two more runs. J. D. Drew popped out before Ramirez was thrown out at home on Jason Varitek's single with Lowell advancing to third. After Julio Lugo walked to load the bases, Matsuzaka hit a two-run single for his first base hit and RBI in the Major Leagues. Ellsbury capped the scoring with his second double of the inning and knock Colorado starter Josh Fogg out of the game. The Rockies' bats <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> in the sixth and seventh innings against a normally solid but shaky Boston bullpen. After Matsuzaka walked two straight in the sixth with one out, reliever Javier López allowed back-to-back RBI singles to Brad Hawpe and Yorvit Torrealba. Mike Timlin allowed two straight leadoff singles in the seventh before NLCS MVP Matt Holliday brought the Rockies to within one run with a three-run home run off Hideki Okajima. Brian Fuentes gave back those runs in the eighth by walking Lugo with one out and allowing a subsequent single to Coco Crisp before Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia, who had four and three hits, respectively, on the night (the first time in World Series history two rookies had at least three hits in a game) hit back-to-back RBI doubles, raising Boston's lead to 9–5. Jonathan Papelbon came on for a four-out save, getting Holliday to fly out on one pitch, leaving runners on first and second. Jason Varitek would tack on Boston's tenth run {{in the top of}} the ninth off of LaTroy Hawkins with a sacrifice fly, scoring Mike Lowell who, not generally considered a stolen base threat, had just stolen third base, the first time a Red Sox baserunner stole third base in the World Series since 1975, after hitting a leadoff single and moving to second on a sacrifice bunt. Papelbon came back out in the bottom of the ninth to complete the save, getting the first two outs before surrendering a two-out triple to Brad Hawpe, then finishing the game with a groundout from Yorvit Torrealba. The Red Sox took Game3 by a final score of 10–5.|$|E

[...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years.

[...] "Twist" [...] <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>life.</b> There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E
