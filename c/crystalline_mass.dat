60|$|Not {{only has}} the Glacial epoch left these organic traces of its existence, however; {{in some parts of}} New Hampshire, where the glaciers were unusually thick and deep, {{fragments}} of the primæval ice itself still remain on the spots where they were originally stranded. Among the shady glens of the white mountains there occur here and there great masses of ancient ice, the unmelted remnant of primæval glaciers; and one of these is so large that an artificial cave has been cleverly excavated in it, as an attraction for tourists, by the canny Yankee proprietor. Elsewhere the old ice-blocks are buried under the débris of moraine-stuff and alluvium, and are only accidentally discovered by the sinking of what are locally known as ice-wells. No existing conditions can account for the formation of such solid rocks of ice at such a depth in the soil. They are essentially glacier-like in origin and character: they result from the pressure of snow into a <b>crystalline</b> <b>mass</b> in a mountain valley: and they must have remained there unmelted ever since the close of the Glacial epoch, which, by Dr. Croll's calculations, must most probably have ceased to plague our earth some eighty thousand years ago.

Either another grain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must be at work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the radial {{distribution}} of dust species in young brown dwarf disks. Our work is based on a compositional analysis of the 10 and 20 micron silicate emission features for brown dwarfs in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. A fundamental finding of our work is that brown dwarfs exhibit stronger signs of dust processing in the cold component of the disk, compared to the higher mass T Tauri stars in Taurus. For nearly all of our targets, we find a flat disk structure, which is consistent with the stronger signs of dust processing observed in these disks. For the case of one brown dwarf, 2 M 04230607, we find the forsterite mass fraction to be a factor of ~ 3 higher in the outer disk compared to the inner disk region. Simple large-scale radial mixing cannot account for this gradient in the dust chemical composition, and some local crystalline formation mechanism may be effective in this disk. The relatively high abundance of crystalline silicates in the outer cold regions of brown dwarf disks provides an interesting analogy to comets. In this context, we have discussed the applicability of the various mechanisms that have been proposed for comets on the formation and the outward transport of high-temperature material.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{electrical}} energy is growing {{fast as a}} result of the expanding world population and economic activities. On top of this the energy need of each individual is also growing. At present the growth in energy demand is not matched by the growth in energy generation because of insufficient energy production. This energy gap therefore needs to be bridged. In addition, most conventional means of energy generation are not environmentally-friendly and in turn affect human lives. Solar energy is one of the alternatives for renewable energy generation. It can be extracted directly in electrical form from solar radiation using photovoltaic (PV) solar cells or solar concentrators. The PV market is dominated by crystalline-silicon based solar cells. However, thin-film silicon solar cells are becoming increasingly important, because they are deposited at relatively low temperatures and as such offer the possibility to produce flexible and light-weight solar panels. The latter can be applied on for instance the roofs of factory buildings. Thin film nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) is an important material for application in thin-film silicon solar cells. It has been mainly developed because unlike amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) it is stable against light-induced degradation, and because with this material the solar cells have an extended spectral response up to the infrared wavelength region. Because of this extended response nc-Si:H films are used in combination with a-Si:H to form multi-junction solar cells, leading to an increased solar-cell efficiency. The focus of this thesis is on the development and characterization of nc-Si:H layers and solar cells. In chapter 3 we present results of research on how the deposition parameters during the growth affect nc-Si:H material properties and device performance when using radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Particular attention is paid to p-type and intrinsic films and their application in nc-Si:H solar cells. For the p-layer development, the effects of deposition power, the substrate roughness, and doping are investigated. Intrinsic layer investigation focused on the effect of substrate temperature, deposition power, deposition pressure, and the gas-flow ratio. Intrinsic layers deposited at the amorphous-to-nanocrystalline transition during growth are investigated in detail. At this transition nc-Si:H films with favorable properties for application in thin film solar cells can be made. Within our growth regime, this transition shows high sensitivity to the deposition parameters hence narrowing the process window. We show that materials deposited at the amorphous-to-nanocrystalline transition, but at different deposition settings, can have similar <b>crystalline</b> <b>mass</b> fraction while showing different electrical properties. In chapter 4 we present how seed layers are used to enhance crystal nucleation at the onset of nc-Si:H growth. By this approach, uniform and rapid evolution of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>mass</b> fraction as a function of thickness is obtained. Our results show a possibility to grow thin-film nc-Si:H without the usual amorphous incubation layer. A depth profile Raman technique that enables the ex-situ investigation of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>mass</b> fraction depth profile in nc-Si:H films is presented. This approach reveals different growth phases in the development of nc-Si:H. From transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses, we observe that crystal sizes are not affected by seed layers. However, horizontal cracks are observed to dominate the early growth of nc-Si:H in p-i-n solar cells and this effect is reduced upon seeding. For the n-i-p cells the appearance of these cracks is not affected by seeding. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate that the use of seed layers does not affect the crystal size, but affects the preferential orientation of the crystals. Solar-cell external parameters show that seeding of p-i-n solar cells leads to an increase in solar cell efficiency, mainly due to increase in the short-circuit current density. The investigation of seeding on the crystallinity development is further extended in chapter 5. Here, we show that different substrates have different profile for the development of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>mass</b> fraction. For the three substrates investigated, we found a gradual development of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>mass</b> fraction, starting from the amorphous incubation layer. By means of seeding, rapid nucleation is observed as indicated by the high value of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>mass</b> fraction from the onset of growth. The effect of the substrate is reduced as all three substrates show a similar development profile of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>mass</b> fraction upon seeding. In the last chapter of this thesis, the possibility to use Raman spectroscopy to determine the preferred crystal orientation in nc-Si:H is demonstrated. The preferred orientation of crystals in nc-Si:H can give insight into the film growth mechanism and is often determined from transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. The method presented in this thesis is based on the fact that molecular vibrations in films under polarized light give rise to polarization-dependent Raman scattering intensity, depending on the grain crystal orientation of the irradiated material. This approach has been tested on a series of nc-Si:H samples and the results comparable with x-ray diffraction results.

The dust crystallinity is measured for 42 class II T Tauri stars in the Taurus star-forming region using a decomposition fit of the 10 micron silicate feature, measured with the Spitzer IRS instrument.

Since these elements have ionic radii of 0 " 69 and o. 68 / ~ respectively their substitution for titanium (o- 68 A) in the structure is not unexpected, but no reliable reports exist of sphenes containing more than 2 % (Nb 2 Os+Ta 2 Os). One of the highest concentrations of these lements was noted by Sahama (I 946) in a large zoned sphene crystal from Nuolainniemi, Impilahti, Finland, the altered part of which contained 3 " 3 % Nb 2 Os and 2. 9 % Ta 2 Os. The crystal, however, contained numerous inclusions of a mineral thought to be wiikite, a metamict niobotantalate of Ti, the rare earths, Ca, and U, which casts some doubt on the analysis. A sphene from the Kola Peninsula has been reported by Burova (in Fersman and Bohnstedt, I 937) as containing 1. 87 % (Nb 2 Os-?Ta~Os). We have recently obtained further {{information on this subject}} during an examination of the type specimen of strtiverite (spec. no. BM. I 9 O 6, I 23). This strfiverite occurred as small black <b>crystalline</b> <b>masses</b> embedded in feldspar and quartz from the pegmatit...|$|R
