2500|$|In {{polyandrous}} mating it {{has been}} suggested that male cooperation may outweigh the costs of sharing paternity in situations of scarcity, of foods and of high competition levels for land or females. Female size and a large breeding territory defended by more males may force male cooperation. For males, such factors can promote an increase in reproductive success, leaving behind the cost of paternity share (Mating Systems, p277). Comb-crested jacana's (Irediparra gallinacea) [...] has shown genetic evidence for paternity assurance. The <b>comb-crested</b> <b>jacana</b> females had one to three more mates available for copulation. In order to guarantee paternity to their male mates, the females would spend time in the territory of the male, laying her eggs.|$|E

50|$|Waterbirds include large {{populations of}} magpie geese, {{wandering}} whistling ducks, green pygmy geese, <b>comb-crested</b> <b>jacana,</b> black-necked stork, Australian pelicans, little black cormorant, Australian darter, nankeen night herons, pied herons, black bittern, sarus crane and brolga.|$|E
50|$|The <b>comb-crested</b> <b>jacana</b> (Irediparra gallinacea), {{also known}} as the lotusbird or lilytrotter, is the only species of jacana in the genus Irediparra. Like other jacana species, it is adapted to the {{floating}} vegetation of tropical freshwater wetlands.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is known}} for its populations of waterbirds such as the brolga, sarus crane, black-necked stork, <b>comb-crested</b> <b>jacana</b> and magpie geese. In the {{woodland}} and grassland area the agile wallaby, northern nailtail wallaby and Australian bustard may be found.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>comb-crested</b> <b>jacana</b> is polyandrous. [...] It {{builds a}} flimsy nest on {{floating}} or emergent vegetation, {{in which the}} female lays four lustrous, pale brown eggs covered by black markings. Only males incubate. The young hatch well-developed and soon leave the nest.|$|E
50|$|More than 240 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} in the park, including the noisy pitta (Pitta versicolor), southern logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii), paradise riflebird (Ptiloris paradiseus), regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), brush-turkey (Alectura lathami), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiatus), marbled frogmouth (Podargus ocellatus), bush-hen (Amaurornis olivacea), black-breasted button quail (Turnix melanogaster), white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), <b>comb-crested</b> <b>jacana</b> (Irediparra gallinacea) and cotton pygmy goose (Nettapus coromandelianus).|$|E

50|$|The lakes form an {{important}} dry season refuge for waterbirds, with regular numbers of over 20,000 and sometimes {{of up to}} 200,000 individuals. Lake Argyle contains {{some of the largest}} aggregations of waterbirds in northern Australia. Abundant species include glossy ibis (with up to 6,000 counted), magpie goose (10,500), wandering whistling duck (11,000), plumed whistling duck (4,300), radjah shelduck (900), Pacific black duck (16,000), grey teal (17,200), pink-eared duck (1,800), hardhead (51,400), green pygmy goose (1,500) and Eurasian coot (50,000). The two lakes are a stronghold of the <b>comb-crested</b> <b>jacana.</b> Over 200 terrestrial and aquatic bird species have been recorded in the area, which also supports several kinds of microbats, the little red and black flying-foxes, rakali, and large numbers of freshwater crocodiles.|$|E
40|$|Mean {{numbers and}} annual {{variation}} of 52 species of waterbirds (families Podicipedidae; Pelicanidae; Anhingidae; Phalacrocoracidae; Ardeidae; Ciconiidae; Plataleidae; Anatidae; Rallidae; Jacanidae) from the Queensland Ornithological Societyâ€™s {{records of the}} Brisbane region during 1972 - 83 are presented. Changes {{in the numbers of}} many species showed significant negative correlations with changes in the Moreton winter rainfall (3 months before the count). Changes in numbers of hardheads, grey teal and Eurasian coot also had significant negative correlations with changes of inland rainfall, and many other species showed similar trends. Changes in numbers of darter and pied cormorant were positively correlated with changes in Moreton and Warrego rainfall respectively. Most species had non-significant correlations with Moreton dam levels, but for chestnut teal, white-faced heron and dusky moorhen these approached statistical significance (P < 0 - 1). Numbers of whitefaced heron, black swan, <b>comb-crested</b> <b>jacana</b> and darter decreased, and those of Australian pelican and plumed and wandering whistling-ducks increased during the survey period. The coastal and inland distribution of some species is also presented...|$|E
