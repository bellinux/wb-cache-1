25|$|In 2003, the bicentenary of Berlioz's birth, his {{achievements}} and status {{were much more}} widely recognized, and his music is now viewed as both serious and original, rather than an eccentric novelty. Newspaper articles reported his colourful life with zeal, very many festivals dedicated to the composer were held, readings of his books and a one-hour French television dramatised biography all helped to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> exposure to the composer's life and music– {{far more than the}} previous centenary anniversary. Numerous recording projects were begun or reissued, and broadcasts of his music increased. Prominent Berlioz conductor Colin Davis had already been in the process of recording much of Berlioz's music on the LSO Live label, and has continued this project to this date with a L'enfance du Christ recording issued in 2007. The internet was also a factor in the celebrations, with the comprehensive hberlioz.com site (which has been online since 1997) being an easily available source of information to anyone interested in the composer. The 'Berlioz 2003' celebrations, organised by French academic institutions, also had a prominent website, listing events, publications and gatherings the domain of which has now lapsed. There was also a site maintained by the Association nationale Hector Berlioz. A proposal was made to remove his remains to the Panthéon, and while initially encouraged by French President Jacques Chirac, the proposal was rejected on the basis that Berlioz was an anti-establishment figure and would have no interest in such a ceremony, and that he was happy to be buried next to his two wives in the location he has been in for almost 150 years.|$|E

In a May 2012 interview with Inside Soap's Jason Herbison, Barber said he liked the fact that Rhys' mother had been introduced and that he had the chance to learn more about his character's background. He expressed his wish of having Rhys' father introduced in the future, saying [...] "Rhys doesn't have a good relationship with him, as his dad abandoned the family when he was younger. It would certainly <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> interesting dilemmas".|$|E
500|$|The {{relationships}} among the families of lemurs have been problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. [...] Two competing phylogenies exist based on genetic and molecular data. [...] One approach (Horvath etal.) looks at a larger number of genes, but among fewer species. [...] This results in Lemuridae being a sister group to Lepilemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. [...] The other approach (Orlando etal.) looks at fewer genes, but more lemur species. [...] Using this analysis, Lepilemuridae becomes the sister group to Lemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. Both phylogenies agree that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic and that Daubentoniidae (the aye-aye) is basal to the lemuroid clade, having split off significantly earlier than the other families. [...] However, two problems create complications for both approaches. [...] First, the four most closely related living lemur families diverged within a narrow window of approximately 10million years, making it much harder to distinguish the splits with molecular evidence. [...] In addition, these families diverged from their last common ancestor approximately 42mya; such distant splits <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> noise for molecular techniques.|$|E

During an interview for the drama's BBC Online website, Fordham revealed that they tried to find references from every area, including eighteenth-century cartoons. Clapton stated that the team wanted {{to make a lot of}} the costumes, rather than re-use what was already available from other productions. To get the sense of colour that they wanted, they had to dye and <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the pieces. The wardrobe team worked closely with the make-up department and the production designer. After their first meeting, they came up with a colour palette for the whole show. Clapton chose to give Elinor and Marianne contrasting wardrobes.

Fordham revealed that with Marianne being younger and a [...] "wild child", her wardrobe contains a lot of Buttercup yellows, which suited Wakefield's complexion and her character's freshness.|$|E
