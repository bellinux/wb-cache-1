5000|$|The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Passenger Station is a {{historic}} building located in Iowa City, Iowa, United States. Built in 1898 for passenger use, {{it was the second}} depot in the city. [...] The first one was built by the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad, a predecessor of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (CRI&P), in 1855. This one was built through the efforts of Harry Breene, the local Rock Island agent. W.K. McFarlin, CRI&P's superintendent of maintenance and construction oversaw the building's construction. Architecturally, it is a combination of the Richardsonian Romanesque and Victorian Romanesque. The depot was built to similar designs of stations in Ottawa, Illinois and Council Bluffs, Iowa. Service included the CRI&P's <b>Corn</b> Belt <b>Rocket</b> and Rocky Mountain Rocket passenger lines. [...] The depot ceased operations in 1970, although the railroad continued to maintain offices here. In 1982 it was acquired by a couple of attorneys for their offices. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same year. The building sits adjacent to the Iowa Interstate Railroad lines, and the railroad has operated occasional excursion trains that have stopped at the former depot.|$|R
