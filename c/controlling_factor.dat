2500|$|Franklin, {{known as}} the [...] "Fluorescent Mineral Capital of the World," [...] is located over a rich ore body {{containing}} more than 150 minerals, many of them fluorescent and 25 of which are found nowhere else on earth. Settled in the 17th century, the village known as Franklin Furnace after Benjamin Franklin, developed near iron mines and iron smelting operations located along the Wallkill River. In the early 19th century, zinc deposits in the area began to be developed commercially. For most of the century many small companies mined zinc and iron in the Franklin area. In 1897 all zinc mining efforts merged into the New Jersey Zinc Company, which was a major <b>controlling</b> <b>factor</b> {{in the development of}} Franklin. Immigrants from Russia, Britain, Hungary and Poland joined the work force at the mine. The population, 500 in 1897, had swelled to 3,000 by 1913.

KEYWORDS: Design <b>factor,</b> target <b>control</b> <b>factor,</b> transformation, variability <b>control</b> <b>factor</b> 1 Introduction In Taguchi experiments the design factors are separated into variability <b>control</b> <b>factors,</b> target <b>control</b> <b>factors</b> and neutral factors (see, e. g. Logothetis and Wynn, 1989, p. 244). The variability <b>control</b> <b>factors</b> are the most important factors, they are used to reduce the variance of a product. It was pointed out by Box (1988) that correct identification of these factors requires appropriate transformation of the response y.

2500|$|Braided rivers, as {{distinct}} from meandering rivers, occur when a threshold level of sediment load or slope is reached whilst a steep gradient is also maintained. [...] Geologically speaking, an increase in sediment load will over time increase {{the slope of the}} river, so these two conditions can be considered synonymous; and, consequently, a variation of slope can model a variation in sediment load. [...] A threshold slope was experimentally determined to be 0.016 (ft/ft) for a [...] stream with poorly sorted coarse sand. [...] Any slope over this threshold created a braided stream, while any slope under the threshold created a meandering stream or—for very low slopes—a straight channel. So the main <b>controlling</b> <b>factor</b> on river development is the amount of sediment that the river carries; once a given system crosses a threshold value for sediment load, it will convert from a meandering system to a braided system. [...] Also important to channel development is the proportion of suspended load sediment to bed load. [...] An increase in suspended sediment allowed for the deposition of fine erosion-resistant material on the inside of a curve, which accentuated the curve and in some instances caused a river to shift from a braided to a meandering profile.|$|E
2500|$|Writers {{with a more}} {{historic}} Lutheran and Reformed perspective {{have generally}} translated the Greek word charis as [...] "grace" [...] and understood it {{to refer to the}} idea that there is a lack of human effort in salvation because God is the <b>controlling</b> <b>factor.</b> However those who study ancient Greek culture have pointed out that [...] "favor" [...] is a better translation, as the word refers normally to [...] "doing a favor". In ancient societies there was the expectation that such favors be repaid, and this semi-formal system of favors acted like loans. Therefore, it is argued that when Paul speaks of how God did us a [...] "favor" [...] by sending Jesus, he is saying that God took the initiative, but is not implying a lack of human effort in salvation, and is in fact implying that Christians have an obligation to repay the favor God has done for them. Some argue that this view then undermines the initial [...] "favor"—of sending Jesus—by saying that, despite his incarnation, life and death, Christians still have, as before, to earn their way to heaven. However, others note this is the horns of a false dilemma (all grace versus all works). Many new-perspective proponents that see [...] "charis" [...] as [...] "favor" [...] do not teach that [...] Christians earn their way to heaven outside of the death of Christ. Forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ is still necessary to salvation. But, that forgiveness demands effort on the part of the individual (cf. Paul in Phil. 3:12–16).|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{bed form}} <b>control</b> <b>factor</b> theory and the {{existing}} flume experimental data, the correspondence between values taken by the <b>control</b> <b>factor</b> and different bed form configurations is analyzed. A bed form parameters including the particle Froude number and the relative depth (ratio of depth to median diameter of sediment particle) are proposed. In addition, a computational method {{on the basis of}} simplified <b>control</b> <b>factor</b> m, and its scope of application are introduced. The adaptability of the relationship between bed form <b>control</b> <b>factor</b> and the bed form parameter is discussed. With the relationship and the characteristics of bed form movement observed in the lower reach of Yellow River, a method to discriminate bed forms is established. The study suggests that the flow resistance characteristics in upper and lower flow regimes can be described by the <b>control</b> <b>factor</b> m, and the relationship between the <b>control</b> <b>factor</b> m and the bed form parameter exists not only in the laboratory flume experiments but also in the natural river systems. The preliminarily test of the established method to discriminate various bed form phases is done using the field observations. The result shows that the method is able to discriminate bed forms in different flow regimes in the lower reach of Yellow River. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
