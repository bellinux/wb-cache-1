5|$|It is {{significant}} that the only musician with whom he remained a close personal friend, Ignaz Moscheles, was of an older generation and equally <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> outlook. Moscheles preserved this outlook at the Leipzig Conservatory until his own death in 1870.|$|E
5|$|Stela T was {{dedicated}} in 692 {{by an unknown}} ruler. It is a badly eroded schist sculpture bearing mostly unreadable glyphs accompanying a poorly preserved figure. The stela is <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> style, being similar to the much older StelaU.|$|E
50|$|After {{joining the}} Young <b>Conservatives</b> <b>in</b> 1955, Bendall was Vice-Chairman of Croydon South Young <b>Conservatives</b> <b>in</b> 1965 and Chairman of Greater London Young <b>Conservatives</b> <b>in</b> 1967. He {{was elected to}} Croydon Borough Council when it was created as a London Borough in 1964, serving until 1974, and also {{represented}} Croydon on the Greater London Council from 1970 to 1973. At the February 1974 general election, he stood for the <b>Conservative</b> Party <b>in</b> Hertford and Stevenage, losing to Labour's Shirley Williams by 8,176 votes; a second try in October 1974 saw defeat by 9,046.|$|R

5|$|Beach Thomas's primary {{interest}} {{as an adult}} was in rural matters. He was <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> his views, and feared that the post–Second World War socialist governments regarded the countryside only from an economic perspective. He was an advocate {{for the creation of}} national parks in England and Wales, and mourned the decline of traditional village society. He wrote extensively, particularly for The Observer newspaper and The Spectator, a conservative magazine. His book The English Landscape (1938) includes selections from his contributions to Country Life magazine.|$|E
5|$|The Tories (or Abhorrers) and Whigs (or Petitioners) {{originated}} in the Court and Country parties {{that emerged in the}} aftermath of the civil war, although it is more accurate to describe them as loose tendencies, both of which might be regarded as <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> modern terms. Modern party politics did not really begin to coalesce in Great Britain until at least 1784.|$|E
5|$|The painting's {{depiction}} of {{preparation for a}} fancy dress party would have been familiar to Etty's generally wealthy audience. In both London and the English provincial cities, such balls and parties had become extremely fashionable by the 1830s. Though <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> comparison to some costumes worn at contemporary fancy dress events, {{the richness of the}} design of the sisters' dress indicates the high status of the Williams-Wynn family in fashionable circles.|$|E

5|$|According to USA Today, the match-up {{between the}} Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes (OSU) {{was one of}} the most-anticipated games of the 2005season. Teams have become {{increasingly}} <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> scheduling highly ranked non-conference opponents, so a meeting of the number 2 and number 4 teams in the country was unusual this early in the season. Because of the significance of the game in the national championship race, ESPN College GameDay chose the game as the site of its weekly broadcast. The American Football Coaches Association brought the national championship trophy to the game and displayed it on the field near Bevo, the UT mascot (photo below).|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, most war {{memorials}} {{were relatively}} <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> design, aiming to use established styles {{to produce a}} tragic but comforting, noble and enduring commemoration of the war dead. Classical themes were particularly common, taking the prevailing styles of the late 19th century and typically simplifying them to produce cleaner, more abstract memorials. Allegorical and symbolic features, frequently drawing on Christian imagery, were used to communicate themes of self-sacrifice, victory and death. Some memorials adopted a medievalist theme instead, looking backwards to a more secure past, while others used emerging realist and Art Deco architectural styles to communicate the themes of the war.|$|E
5|$|Cross was a Liberal, {{and fast}} {{established}} himself {{was one of}} the party's leading Edmonton lights. By some assessments, he was the second most influential Liberal in the city after Frank Oliver, the owner of the Edmonton Bulletin and local Member of Parliament. Once {{the decision was made to}} create the province of Alberta, the question emerged of who would govern it: the Northwest Territories were governed on a non-partisan basis by Premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, who was a <b>Conservative</b> <b>in</b> federal politics. Some Liberals, such as Peter Talbot, were amenable to Haultain's becoming the first Premier of Alberta, either as the head of a non-partisan government or one formed by a coalition of Liberals and Conservatives. Cross was not among them.|$|E

Meanwhile, Labour also gained 2 seats from the <b>Conservatives</b> <b>in</b> Weston-super-Mare East. Long time {{councillor}} and independent Nan Kirsen lost her seat in Pill to another independent Don Davies, standing for the Sustainable Pill and District Party, by 17 votes, while Andy Cole won his seat in Nailsea East as an independent after leaving the Liberal Democrats.|$|R

5|$|III. Menuetto: Allegro – Trio. This is {{a somber}} movement, quite {{distinct}} from the typical atmosphere of dance movements. It is relatively <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> its key scheme, moving to the relative major key {{and back to the}} tonic. In the B section, a sequence of hemiolas is interrupted by a dramatic interpolation in A-flat major, referencing the departure to this key in the opening of the Allegro with the added minor 6th. The second A section is a transformation of the first, interrupted every four bars by a silent bar, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The trio is in A-flat major, ternary form, with a B section beginning in E-flat major colored by its own minor 6th, and modulating to G-flat major via the parallel minor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} department, Syme was succeeded by Peter Brunt. In the sciences, Dr John Baltrop was {{sometime}} Bursar; Bryan Birch, Professor of Arithmetic {{and co-author of}} the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture; and Nicholas Kurti, Vice-President of the Royal Society. Overall, although the immediate post-War staff remained traditional– if not overly <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> nature– with a third drawn from Brasenose itself, the late sixties signalled a change on this front. Then, a wave of new face emerged: among them, Laszlo Solymar (later Professor of Applied Electromagnetism), Vernon Bogdanor (Professor of Government), Robert Evans (Regius Professor of Modern History) and Graham Richards, Oxford's Chairman of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|John and Prudentia Hogg {{were glad}} to hear that the Shelleys had left England, hoping that their son would become more <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> Percy's absence. They were {{disappointed}} with his continued rejection of their Tory political views, but he did attend church with them during his visits and was no longer a vegetarian. They were also somewhat concerned about Hogg's association with the radical publisher Leigh Hunt and his circle of friends. Through Hunt, Hogg became acquainted with several members of London's literary circles, including Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Lamb and Walter Coulson. Hogg also met John Keats, who gave him a copy of his first book of poetry.|$|E

5|$|Maria Theresa was as <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> {{matters of}} state as in those of religion, but {{implemented}} significant reforms to strengthen Austria's military and bureaucratic efficiency. She employed Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz, who modernised the empire {{by creating a}} standing army of 108,000men, paid for with 14million gulden extracted from each crown-land. The central government {{was responsible for the}} army, although Haugwitz instituted taxation of the nobility, who never before had to pay taxes. Maria Theresa oversaw the unification of the Austrian and Bohemian chancellories in May 1749.|$|E
5|$|Most World War I war {{designers}} {{attempted to}} produce memorials that were, as cultural historian Jay Winter describes, noble, uplifting, tragic and endurably sad. There were various architectural styles used on memorials, {{but most were}} essentially <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> nature, typically embracing well established styles such as classicism and embracing mainstream Christian symbolism. This conservatism in part resulted from the age and background of the committees that were commissioning the memorials, and also from a sense that established architectural styles, rather a potentially more transitory but fashionable style, would be more enduring and appropriate.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Gardiner was refused {{access to}} Henry {{during his last}} months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; {{the day before the}} king's death his vast estates were seized, making them {{available}} for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the Tower of London. Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> religion, that conservatives remained on the Council, and that the radicalism of such men as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is debatable.|$|E

5|$|The 2005 Texas vs. Ohio State {{football}} game, played September 10, 2005, was {{the first-ever}} meeting between The University of Texas at Austin and The Ohio State University {{in a college}} football game. The two teams came into the game ranked No. 2 and No. 4, respectively. It was the second game of the 2005 season for both teams. Schools have become increasingly <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> scheduling non-conference opponents of a high caliber, so a meeting of two top-five teams in the country was unusual {{this early in the}} season. For either team, winning the game would boost their chances of ultimately playing in the BCS National Championship Game while the loser likely faced the end of their national championship hopes.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Expos hired Virdon {{as their}} manager before the 1983 season, {{replacing}} Jim Fanning, {{and signed a}} two-year contract. During the 1984 season, Virdon expressed his to Expos general manager John McHale {{that he did not}} want to return to the Expos in 1985. With a 64–67 record in August 1984, the Expos fired Virdon during the 1984 season, replacing him with Fanning. Gary Lucas, a pitcher for the Expos, felt that they had lost many one-run games because Virdon was too <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> his managing, not employing the hit and run play and relying on the starting pitcher for long in the game.|$|E
5|$|The ultraconservatives {{who opposed}} the Conciliation policy were led by the Viscount of Itaboraí, Eusébio de Queirós and the Viscount of Uruguai. These elder statesmen were of the same {{generation}} as the late Carneiro Leão and had taken {{the leadership of the}} Conservative Party after his death. Although <b>conservative</b> <b>in</b> name, they had repeatedly proven more progressive in many areas than their rivals, the Liberals. The Viscount of Uruguai had been Paranhos's protector since the 1851 diplomatic mission and greatly influenced his protégé, who stood by the ultraconservatives. Paranhos managed to persuade Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (who had been commander-in-chief during the Platine War, his colleague as War Minister in the Conciliation Cabinet, and later the Duke of Caxias) to stay {{on the side of the}} Conservative Party's old guard.|$|E

However, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Dec. 1941 united all Americans behind the war effort, with <b>conservatives</b> <b>in</b> Congress taking {{the opportunity to}} close down many New Deal agencies, such as the bête noire WPA.|$|R
