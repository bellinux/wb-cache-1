40|$|As far {{as energy}} policy is concerned, {{the design of}} the {{regulatory}} framework for energy transmission and distribution is a key issue. Consequently, also the embodiment of balancing power markets drives mainly the effectiveness of political implications for the energy sector. Initially, tertiary control in Germany was solely offered by transmission system operators of the respective power control areas and their associated power plant. The recast of the Energy Industry Act of 2005 led in last consequence to a <b>common</b> <b>procurement</b> auction for the supply of tertiary control, which starts on December 1, 2006. Admittedly, the reform has fallen short of expectations so far, first concerning the intensification of market entry of tertiary control providers as well as the desired decline of the price level. Hence, this article examines the effects of the changeover on observable demand charges. In order to identify attributes of the <b>common</b> <b>procurement</b> auction for tertiary control hampering market entry of providers, giving stimuli to collusion and strategic behavior, reducing intensity of competition and encouraging an upswing of prices, we analyze the design under an auction theoretical approach and deduce empirically whether structural components of the auction design have to be touched up again. ...|$|R

40|$|We analyse {{the bidding}} for unit-price contracts, a very <b>common</b> <b>procurement</b> auction. With a unit price contract, not the {{provision}} of the good but the employment of several kinds of inputs is priced. The seller charges a unit price for the employed quantity of each input. To select one seller, a linear selection rule is used to rank submitted lists of unit prices. In this paper, we model heterogeneous technologies of craftsmen: firms differ in their requirement of input-quantities. An equilibrium of this model is found. The composition of submitted lists does not mirror the cost structure and the selection probability is not monotone in the type. Sometimes the ''lamer'' of two craftsmen is selected, enhancing all but the very lame types to bid very aggressively. Caused by this, unit-price bidding can be cheaper (require a lower expected payment) than standard auctions like the first price auction. ...|$|R

40|$|Procurement is a {{critical}} supply chain management function that is susceptible to risk, due mainly to uncertain customer demand and purchase price volatility. A procurement approach {{in the form of}} a portfolio that incorporates the <b>common</b> <b>procurement</b> means is proposed. Such means include long-term contracts, spot procurements and option-based supply contracts. The objective is to explore possible synergies among the various procurement means, and so be able to produce optimal or near optimal results in profit while mitigating risk. The implementation of the portfolio approach is based on a multi-stage stochastic programming model in which replenishment decisions are made at various stages along a time horizon, with replenishment quantities being determined by simultaneously considering the stochastic demand and the price volatility of the spot market. The model attempts to minimise the risk exposure of procurement decisions measured as conditional value-at-risk. Numerical experiments to test the effectiveness of the proposed model are performed using demand data from a large air conditioner manufacturer in China and price volatility data from the Shanghai steel market. The results indicate that the proposed model can fairly reliably outperform other approaches, especially when either the demand and/or prices exhibit significant variability. ...|$|R

The aim of this study is to provide an overview the most <b>common</b> <b>procurement</b> methods used in constructing infrastructure transport projects and analyze how these methods contribute to the desired quality of the final product in relation to client competence. An on-line survey of construction actors was carried out to ascertain quality level of Swedish infrastructure transport projects and determinant factors of quality problems. An equal number of respondents indicated that the quality of infrastructure projects has either increased or remained same level over the past twenty years. Respondents also pointed out lack of client competence that is vital in realizing the desired quality level through proper procurement, monitoring and evaluation procedures. Public clients heavily rely on traditional design-build procurement that requires considerable client involvement of a project. Thus, the association of quality problems and lack of client competence may not be a mere coincidence but an overlooked outcome of current situation. QC 20140219 </p...|$|R
40|$|The core of diploma thesis lies in {{analysis}} of public procurement procedure of which defining features {{in all the}} world public procurement systems are elimination of competition and constraints to the transparency, which opens up the scope especially for disguised breaches of law, discrimination of suppliers and corruption - negotiated procedure without notice. Existence of negotiated procedure without notice is not overseen in the Czech legal environment. Frequency of its use currently amounts to significant 20 per cent of all awarded contracts. This procurement procedure has been traditionally justified in all procurement systems by specific circumstances, which from its nature either eliminate competition, or there is another public interest, which outweigh free competition. Thus balancing of such interests tends to be the major problem when assessing permission to use this non-transparent procedure. Negotiated procedure without notice has already occurred in the Czech law in the first legal act, which governed public procurement. The respective groundbreaker was the Act No. 199 / 1994 Coll., which was inspired by the UNCITRAL Model law on public procurement.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{need to improve}} {{performance}} of procurement in construction has resulted in several structural changes and re-arrangements for the acquisition of the client’s development scheme. Much of these changes {{have focused on the}} contribution and roles played by parties other than the client to the delivery of projects. The role of the client during these changes has evolved from one of a passive fund provider to an increasingly active participant and hands-on management in some of the procurement arrangements. However, {{there is little evidence that}} these evolving roles have been met with a commensurate progress in project delivery performance for client organisations. There is evidence that lack of progress is hindering project performance. Simultaneously, research has so far given less attention to the changes in client’s roles over time. This does not only call for a clarification of contribution the client makes in delivery of projects, but also highlights the need to re-visit the client roles under different procurement systems, and at different project phases, including pre-construction, construction and operational. This paper presents a review of <b>common</b> <b>procurement</b> arrangements in the construction industry and the changing roles of the client’s organisation. The paper also explores the client’s role in each of these arrangements to establish what capabilities enable effective project delivery and performance. The identification of the capabilities is achieved by mapping client roles against procurement arrangements. The analysis of mapping exercise shows that the client has two types of capabilities for the delivery of every project: a primary capability required by all clients; and secondary one that is specific to a particular procurement case. The primary capability could serve as the minimum threshold for self-evaluation by client organisations...|$|R

The second effect concerns the cartel’s ability to allocate the bidder with the highest incentive to deviate (the ‘maverick’) to the last object of the sequence, thus increasing the viability of the collu-sive agreement.
