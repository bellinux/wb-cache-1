40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 An ever-expanding global {{industry}} focuses {{attention on}} energy supply and use. Cost-effective electrical energy production and reduced consumption {{pave the way}} for this expansion. Eskom’s demand-side management (DSM) initiative provides the opportunity for reduced electricity consumption with cost-effective implementation for their respective clients. South African gold mines have to extend their operations to up to 4000 m below the surface to maintain profitable operations. Deep-level mining therefore requires large and energy-intensive cooling installations to provide safe working conditions. These installations generally consist of industrial chillers, cooling towers, bulk air coolers and water transport systems. All of these components operate in unison to provide chilled service water and cooled ventilation air underground. In this study the improved energy efficiency and control of a South African gold mine’s cooling plant is investigated. The plant is separated into a primary and secondary cooling load, resulting in a cascading cooling system. Necessary research was conducted to determine the optimal solution to improve the plant’s performance and electrical energy usage. Variable speed drives (VSD) were installed on the <b>chiller</b> <b>evaporator</b> and condenser water pumps to provide variable flow control of the water through the chillers, resulting in reduced motor electricity usage. Potential electricity savings were simulated. Proposed savings were estimated at 600 kW (13. 6 %) daily, with an expected saving of R 2 275 000 yearly, resulting in a payback period of less than 9 months. Results indicated are based on total savings, as VSD savings and control savings were combined. The VSDs that were installed, were controlled according to an optimum simulation model’s philosophy. A real-time energy management program was used to control the VSDs and monitor the respective systems. The program’s remote capabilities allow for off-site monitoring and control adjustments. A control strategy, which was implemented using the management program, is discussed. Energy efficiency was achieved through the respective installations and control improvements. The results were analysed over an assessment period of three months to determine the viability of the intervention. A newly installed Bulk Air Cooler (BAC) added to the service delivery of the cooling plant post installation of the VSDs. Focusing on service delivery to underground showed a savings of 1. 7 MW (33. 6 %) daily and a payback period of 3. 6 months (0. 3 years). The overall implementation showed an average energy saving of 2. 3 MW (47. 1 %) daily, with the result that a daily saving of R 23 988. 20 was experienced, reducing the payback period to 2. 3 months (0. 2 years). Through the installation of energy-efficiency technology and a suitable control philosophy, a cost-effective, energy-efficiency improvement was created on the case-study cooling plant. Master...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} any {{engineering}} {{project is to}} anticipate a need and meet that need through prediction analysis and design. Over 70 % of the nation’s energy is consumed by building infrastructure such as HVAC systems, electrical, etc. HVAC systems use boilers to generate hot water or steam to heat buildings and chillers to provide cold water for cooling. The overall solar evaporative fan coil unit project involves the design and construction {{of a system that}} will heat and cool air using a solar collector and an evaporative chiller. This report covers the design and construction of the evaporative <b>chiller</b> specifically. The <b>evaporator</b> harnesses the latent heat of vaporization to chill a fin tube heat exchanger which can then provide chilled water to an air handling device called a fan coil unit. Testing will consider input and output water temperature, relative humidity, as well as input and output air temperature in order to compare the changes and develop a value for efficiency of the system.

40|$|The vaccine {{cold chain}} is an {{integral}} part of the process of storing and distributing vaccines prior to administration. A key component of this cold chain for developing countries is the primary vaccine storage warehouse. As the starting point for the distribution of vaccines throughout the country, these buildings have a significant amount of refrigerated space and therefore consume large amounts of energy. Therefore, this thesis focuses on analyzing the relative importance of parameters for the design of an energy efficient primary vaccine storage warehouse with the end goal of achieving Net-Zero Energy operation. A total of 31 architectural design parameters, such as roof insulation U-Value and external wall thermal mass, along with 14 building control parameters, including evaporator coil defrost termination and thermostat set points, are examined. The analysis is conducted across five locations in the developing world with significant variations in climate conditions: Buenos Aires, Argentina; Tunis, Tunisia; Asuncion, Paraguay; Mombasa, Kenya; and Bangkok, Thailand. Variations in the parameters are examined through the implementation of a Monte Carlo-based global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to a case study building layout. A regression-based sensitivity analysis is used to analyze both the main effects of each parameter as well as the interactions between parameter pairs. The results of this research indicate that for all climates examined, the building control parameters have a larger relative importance than the architectural design parameters in determining the warehouse energy consumption. This is due to the dominance of the most influential building control parameter examined, the <b>Chilled</b> Storage <b>evaporator</b> fan control strategy. The importance of building control parameters across all climates examined emphasizes the need for an integrated design method to ensure the delivery of an energy efficient primary vaccine warehouse.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how {{to apply}} optimum condensing temperature control and variable chilled water flow to increase the coefficient of performance (COP) of air cooled centrifugal chillers. A thermodynamic model for the chillers was developed and validated using {{a wide range of}} operating data and specifications. The model considers real process phenomena, including capacity control by the inlet guide vanes of the compressor and an algorithm to determine the number and speed of condenser fans staged based on a set point of condensing temperature. Based on the validated model, it was found that optimizing the control of condensing temperature and varying the <b>evaporator's</b> <b>chilled</b> water flow rate enable the COP to increase by 0. 8 - 191. 7 %, depending on the load and ambient conditions. A cooling load profile of an office building in a subtropical climate was considered to assess the potential electricity savings resulting from the increased chiller COP and optimum staging of chillers and pumps. There is 16. 3 - 21. 0 % reduction in the annual electricity consumption of the building's chiller plant.

40|$|The use {{of natural}} {{evaporative}} cooling is one of technical solutions of problem of energy efficiency in air conditioning systems. The use of evaporative cooling in the first combined cooling stage allows reducing the load on the condenser of the cooling machine due to reducing of the condensing temperature. This combination allows {{the use of this}} type of system in any climatic conditions, including regions with small water resources. Multi-porous ceramic structure is used in evaporative air coolers and water coolers in this case. The objective {{of this paper is to}} show advantages of the using of porous ceramic as a working attachment, and to show advantages of the proposed scheme of compression-evaporation systems in comparison with standard vapor compression systems. Experimental research proved the fact, that in the film mode cooling efficiency of air flow is between EA= 0, 6 ÷ 0, 7 and is slightly dependent of water flow. For countries with hot and dry climate where reserves of water are limited, it is recommended to use cyclical regime with EA≈ 0, 65 value, or to use channel regime with a value of EA≈ 0, 55. This leads to considerable energy savings. It has been determined, that combined air conditioning system is completely closed on the consumption of water at the parameters of the outside air equal to tA = 32 ºC and XA> 13 g/kg (in system with direct evaporative cooling machine), and tA= 32 ºC and XA> 12 g/kg (in system with indirect evaporative cooling machine). With these parameters, the cost of water in evaporative cooling stage can be fully compensated by condensate from the <b>evaporator</b> <b>chiller...</b>|$|R
