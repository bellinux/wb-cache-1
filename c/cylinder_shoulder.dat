50|$|If a circlip (or any non {{preloaded}} system) is used, {{the force}} acting {{to separate the}} Piston Head and the <b>Cylinder</b> Shaft <b>shoulder</b> is the applied pressure multiplied by {{the area of the}} Piston Head. The Piston Head and Shaft shoulder will separate and the load is fully reacted by the Piston Head Retainer.|$|R
50|$|If a {{preloaded}} {{system is}} used the force between the Cylinder Shaft and Piston Head is initially the Piston Head Retainer preload value. Once pressure is applied this force will reduce. The Piston Head and <b>Cylinder</b> Shaft <b>shoulder</b> {{will remain in}} contact unless the applied pressure multiplied by Piston Head area exceeds the preload.|$|R
50|$|It {{is famous}} for its cool {{environment}} and Girijanath Temple. The yearly festival of Girijanath falls one day before holi which is a Hindu Spring Festival. On the Girijanath Festival one Jackfruit tree is cut and carved in the cylinder shape. And that <b>cylinder</b> shaped <b>shoulder</b> pole is carried out by the people. When they reach Girijanath Temple they remove old pole and the new pole is kept. And the old one is kept with the old ones. If we count those poles before keeping the pole they are 21 and after keeping the pole they are 21. Sangeli people think that one pole goes to Kashi.|$|R

50|$|Pool {{competency}} is {{a module}} {{to test a}} Naval Diver's water confidence, {{as well as the}} ability to keep calm under hectic situations. There are three parts to pool competency but is mainly an underwater attack. To stimulate such a situation, Instructors will rip off the Diver's face mask and regulator and, depending on the stage of the test, tying them onto the air <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Shoulder</b> straps will be unravelled and the waist belt will be unbuckled. To pass the test, the Diver will have to hold his breath throughout this incident and remedy the situation by getting back his air source and donning the air cylinder in the proper manner.|$|E
5000|$|The S&W M1917 is {{distinguishable}} {{from the}} Colt M1917 {{in that the}} S&W <b>cylinder</b> had a <b>shoulder</b> machined into it to permit rimless [...]45 ACP cartridges to headspace on the case mouth (as with automatic pistols). The S&W M1917 could thus be used without the half-moon clips, though the empty cases {{would have to be}} poked-out manually through the cylinder face, since the extractor star cannot engage the rimless cases.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{finite element}} {{analytical}} {{model of a}} diesel engine is established to analyze the stress, the flatness, the roundness {{and the rate of}} light leakage of the diesel engine block. The analysis result shows that the optimized scheme improves the body's stress concentration and deformation obviously: the tensile stress between the upper <b>cylinder</b> sleeve <b>shoulders</b> spigot and the counter bore of cylinder head bolt decreases by 15 % compares to the original diesel engine block. The maximum stress decreases obviously and the stress concentration region moves down slightly by changing the “T ” type stiffener above the head of the block into rectangular stiffener; the flatness of the end surface of cylinder liner spigot decreases by 11. 3 %; the circularity and the rate of light leakage of each cross section on cylinder liner decreases obviously...|$|R

An experimental investigation to obtain schlieren {{photographs of the}} flow over several blunt-nosed bodies and to determine the surface static pressure distribution on certain of these models was conducted in the GALCIT hypersonic wind tunnel, leg no. 1, at a nominal Mach number of 5. 8 and a free stream Reynolds number per inch of 2. 22 x 10 [ [...] . ]. Schlieren photographs were made of the following blunt-nosed models, all with cylindrical afterbodies, at angles of yaw of 0, 4, and 8 degrees: a family of nine round-nosed bodies with nose radii of curvature varying from the radius of the afterbody cylinder (hemispherical nose) to infinity (flat nose), two concave-nosed bodies having nose radii of curvature equal to 0. 8 and 1. 6 times the afterbody diameter, and three flat-nosed <b>cylinders</b> with rounded <b>shoulders</b> whose radii of curvature were. 083,. 125, and. 208 times the afterbody diameter. Static pressure distributions at angles of yaw of 0, 4, and 8 degrees were determined for three of the blunt bodies: (1) the flatnosed cylinder with infinite nose radius of curvature, (2) the flatnosed cylinder with a rounded shoulder of radius equal to. 208 of the afterbody diameter, and (3) a round-nosed cylinder with nose radius of curvature equal to 1. 3 times the afterbody diameter. The schlieren photographs were analyzed on a contour projector to measure shock standoff distances, to determine the sonic point on the shock, and to observe shock shape. Data derived from these studies and the pressure distributions are presented in graphical form. Comparisons are made between the experimental results and appropriate theoretical approximations for hypersonic flow...|$|R
5000|$|The {{innermost}} cylinder {{forming the}} chamber and rifled bore {{is called a}} tube or, with certain construction techniques, a liner. A second layer cylinder called the jacket extends rearward past the chamber to house the breechblock. The jacket usually extends forward through the areas of highest pressure, through the recoil slide, and may extend {{all the way to}} the muzzle. The forward part of the barrel may be tapered toward the muzzle because less strength is required for reduced pressures as the projectile approaches it. This tapered portion of barrel is called the chase. Very large guns sometimes use shorter outer cylinders called hoops when manufacturing limitations make full length jackets impractical. Hoops forward of the slide are called chase hoops. [...] The jacket or forward chase hoop may be flared outward in the form of a bell at the muzzle for extra strength to reduce splitting because the metal at that point is not supported on the forward end. [...] As many as four or five layers, or hoop courses, of successively tensioned cylinders have been used. [...] Layers are designated alphabetically as the [...] "A" [...] tube enclosed by the [...] "B" [...] jacket and chase hoops, enclosed by the [...] "C" [...] hoop course, enclosed by the [...] "D" [...] hoop course, etc. Individual hoops within a course are numbered from the breech forward as the B1 jacket, the B2 chase hoop, and then the C1 jacket hoop, the C2 hoop etc. [...] Successive hoop course joints are typically staggered and individual hoop courses use lap joints in preference to butt joints to minimize the weakness of joint locations. Cylinder diameter may be varied by including machined shoulders to prevent forward longitudinal movement of an inner cylinder within an outer <b>cylinder</b> during firing. <b>Shoulder</b> locations are similarly staggered to minimize weakness.|$|R
