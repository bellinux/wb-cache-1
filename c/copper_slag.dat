This latter approach had caused problems at Newport for the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, where ballast had been thrown into the river, and at Cardiff for the Glamorganshire Canal, {{where it had been}} thrown into the canal basin. Efforts were also made to improve the facilities at Neath. From 1818, a Harbour Board was established, and banks of <b>copper</b> <b>slag,</b> marked with buoys, were used to confine the channel. This enabled ships of over 300 tons to reach Neath quays on spring tides, although on neap tides Giant's Grave still had to be used. From 1824, when the connection to the Tennant Canal opened, much of the trade crossed the river and passed down the western bank to the port of Swansea.|$|E

40|$|The {{smelting}} <b>copper</b> <b>slags</b> {{from the}} archaeological sites of Transacquaand Segonzano in Trentino (Italy) weref ully analysed {{to study the}} extraction of copper from copper and iron sulphide minerals that were {{carried out in the}} southeastern Alps during the Late Bronze Age. A combined approach involving physical, chemical, mineralogical and petrographic analyses was applied on over 130 <b>copper</b> <b>slags</b> from Transacqua and Segonzano. Three different types of slags were distinguished from the mineralogical and chemical points of view, differing in the size and relative amount of the unreacted sulphides and matte, the size of metallic copper prills, the ratio between unreacted quartz and newly formed silicate phases and viscosity. By combining all the observations, it is suggested that the three types of slags are the product of a Cu-smelting process formed by three main operations: slagging, matting and refining, which were standardised in the southeast Alps between the fourteenth and the eleventh century BC...|$|R

50|$|<b>Copper</b> <b>slag</b> {{can be used}} in {{concrete}} production as a partial replacement for sand. <b>Copper</b> <b>slag</b> is used as a building material, formed into blocks. Such use was common in areas where smelting was done, including St Helens and Cornwall in England. In Sweden (Skellefteå region) fumed and settled granulated <b>copper</b> <b>slag</b> from the Boliden copper smelter is used as road-construction material. The granulated slag (<3 mm size fraction) has both insulating and drainage properties which are usable to avoid ground frost in winter which in turn prevents pavement cracks. The usage of this slag reduces the usage of primary materials as well as reduces the construction depth which in turn reduces energy demand in building. Due to the same reasons the granulated slag is usable as a filler and insulating material in house foundations in a cold climate. Numerous houses in the same region are built with a slag insulated foundation.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{reverberatory furnace}} bath is quiescent, very little {{oxidation}} of the feed occurs (and thus very little sulfur is {{eliminated from the}} concentrate). It is essentially a melting process. Consequently, wet-charged reverberatory furnaces have less copper in their matte product than calcine-charged furnaces, and they also have lower <b>copper</b> losses to <b>slag.</b> Gill quotes a <b>copper</b> in <b>slag</b> value of 0.23% for a wet-charged reverberatory furnace vs 0.37% for a calcine-charged furnace.|$|R
