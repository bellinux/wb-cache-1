40|$|An echo tracker/range finder or {{altimeter}} is described. The {{pulse repetition}} frequency (PFR) of a predetermined plurality of transmitted pulses is adjusted so that echo pulses received from a reflecting object are positioned between transmitted pulses and divided their interpulse time interval into two time intervals having a predetermined ratio with respect to each other. The invention described provides a means whereby the arrival time of a plurality of echo pulses {{is defined as the}} time at which a <b>composite</b> <b>echo</b> pulse formed of a sum of the individual echo pulses has the highest amplitude. The invention is applicable to radar systems, sonar systems, or any other kind of system in which pulses are transmitted and echoes received therefrom...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} {{improving}} techniques for rainfall intensity estimation over the sea surface through spaceborne rain radars is analysed. In such case, the backscattered signal is composed of a rainfall volumetric contribution and of the sea surface contribution, which {{gives rise to the}} problem of extracting the information of interest from the <b>composite</b> <b>echo.</b> In particular, we focus on the problem of deriving a better estimation of the rain perturbed backscattering coefficient of the sea surface from polarimetric measurements, as a means for achieving such improvements. The effects of the additional roughness of the sea surface due to the rainfall have been taken into account and analysed by resorting to an electromagnetic model able to provide a full polarimetric description of the rainfall perturbed sea surface...|$|E
40|$|HF-VHF radar {{techniques}} {{are easy to}} employ and commonly used in geophysical applications. They include deep radio soundings, used for probing the ionosphere, stratosphere-mesosphere measurement, weather forecast and radio-glaciology. Fast algorithms and powerful processors facilitate the development of several kinds of low power radars, but {{the reduction of the}} transmitted power has to be compensated by on-line processing of an encoded signal to maintain a favorable signal-to-noise ratio suitable for detection. Moreover, radars have to reconstruct return echoes with different travel times due to various origins (multi-path, adjacent objects, etc.). Such needs can be accomplished by means of signal phase coding {{and one of the most}} attractive is the reversal phase code. The <b>composite</b> <b>echo</b> signal must be processed to extract the physical information useful for the measurement considered. In this paper some algorithms used for on-line processing of phase-coded signals will be described, both in time and frequency domain...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{critical}} {{function of the}} CH operators was to estimate the number and type of aircraft in a raid. A gross level of the overall size could {{be determined by the}} strength of the return. But a much more accurate determination could be made by observing the [...] "beat" [...] rate of the <b>composite</b> <b>echoes,</b> the way they grew and diminished over time as they entered into different sections of the antenna reception pattern. To aid this, the operator could reduce the pulse length to 6 microseconds (from 20) with a push-button. This improved the range resolution, spreading the blip out on the display at the cost of lower returned energy.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a general purpose electromagnetic environment and target simulator which is used to test radar and its components. The simulator was a hardware system controlled by computer software which generated echoes of targets, clutter and jamming for radar electromagnetic environment scenario simulation. It responded to the subject radar’s antenna scan by producing <b>composite</b> <b>echoes</b> in real time. Computer programs were used to management the simulation process and allowed various combinations of electromagnetic environment. Parallel signal generator was exploited to increase the execution speed and achieve real-time performance. Since the simulator could produce video frequency and intermediate frequency echo separately it was used for the test of most components of radar. The capability to accommodate dynamic scenarios of long duration in real time for detailed tracking studies distinguished the simulator from other pulse-by-pulse simulators that had been previously reported...|$|R

40|$|The Warning Decision Support System – Integrated Information (WDSS-II) {{is capable}} of ingesting WSR- 88 D data in {{real-time}} {{from all of the}} available Continental United States (CONUS) radars and combining the information with data from the RUC 2 model, lightning detection network, and GOES satellite imagery to create severe weather diagnostic products. These products include parameters such as the probability of severe hail (POSH), reflectivity <b>composite,</b> <b>echo</b> tops, vertical integrated liquid (VIL), storm cell tracking, rotation tracks, lightning density and short-term forecast fields. Since these products are computed from data from multiple radars and other sensors, they are of better quality than their single-radar counterparts. Also, these products are available as latitude-longitude grids covering large spatial areas. Consequently, they are also much easier for researchers and end-users to work with. In the CONUS-wide real-time system that we describe here, the radar products are rapidly updated every 2 minutes from elevation scans as they arrive from any radar in the country. The resulting products are at a resolution of approximately 1 km x 1 km x 1 km. These products can be disseminated as GeoTiff, NetCDF and/or Grib 2 files for easy incorporation into other decisionsupport and visualization systems. 1...|$|E
5000|$|As already mentioned, {{a weather}} signal is a <b>composite</b> of <b>echoes</b> {{coming from a}} very large number of hydrometeors.

Since individual echoes are impossible to be resolved individually, we sample the signal coming from the atmosphere at given discrete time delays [...]|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{inherent}} inhomogeneous and anisotropy {{nature of the}} composite material, Ultrasonic waves suffer high acoustic attenuation and scattering effect, thus making data interpretation difficult. Especially for thin <b>composite</b> plate, <b>echoes</b> from the internal delamination interfere with surface echoes. In the present work, an enhanced Wigner-Ville distribution (EWVD) is obtained based on the chirplet decomposition and signal elimination. Echoes that are useless and affecting representation of flaws are eliminated from Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD). Details of ultrasonic signal, containing information of damage level in composite plate, are shown obviously and can be well explained through the EWVD. Compared to traditional WVD, the EWVD is effective in flaw identification and quantification. Key words: NDE, chirplet decomposition, composite, Wigner-Ville distributio...|$|R

40|$|Polarimetric {{weather radar}} echoes {{resulting}} from an observed resolution volume are commonly defined {{to be the}} <b>composite</b> of <b>echoes</b> from {{a large number of}} individual randomly distributed hydrometeors and refractive index irregularities of the atmosphere. In this contribution we shall examine some important statistical aspects of polarimetric weather radar echoes. The statistical properties of polarimetric weather radar echoes are readily obtained from basic principles, most of them are well known and their properties, {{from the point of view}} of interpretation of weather radar observables, are important features. Using time series weather radar data recorded with the coherent polarimetric C-band weather radar “POLDIRAD” (DLR, Wessling, Germany) allows us to examine the statistical properties of polarimetric weather radar echoes and also enables us to examine the dependence of the statistical properties of measured polarimetric weather radar signals on instrumental features. The proposed analysis can be used to detect possible radar-hardware malfunctions and can also serve as a diagnostic tool for validating or trouble-shooting radar hardware modifications...|$|R
40|$|In {{ultrasonic}} {{nondestructive testing}} use {{is made of}} the physical properties of elastic waves in solids in order to detect defects and material inhomogeneities. Difficulties in testing anisotropic materials are due to the direction dependence of the ultrasonic velocities and to the inherent effects of beam divergence and beam distortion. Based on a theory of elastic wave propagation in transversely isotropic media [1], the Generalized Point-Source-Synthesis-method (GPSS) has been developed to model the radiation, propagation and scattering of elastic waves as generated by ultrasonic transducers in these media [2]. The method accounts for the three-dimensionality and the vectorial character of anisotropic wave phenomena and is particularly useful in view of application-directed modeling at low computation times. A specifically interesting outcome is OPoSSM (‘Optimization by Point-Source-Synthesis-Modeling’), which allows optimized dimensioning and build-up of complex transducers according to their selected field of application. In this contribution, results are presented for austenitic weld material and fiber <b>composites,</b> covering <b>echo</b> dynamic curves — in comparison with experimental results — for commercial transducers. Furthermore, OPoSSM-results on optimized TR-array-probes are presented as well as snapshots of transducer-generated wavefronts, impressively illustrating the modeling of time-dependent rf-signals...|$|R
40|$|With {{its many}} {{conflicting}} approaches {{to issues of}} body, mind and soul, Joss Whedon’s science fiction television series Dollhouse (2009 - 2010) has provoked analysis from various philosophical positions. This chapter examines Dollhouse’s complex theoretical underpinnings by utilising the concepts of Poststructuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze (1925 - 1995), as principally espoused in his seminal work A Thousand Plateaus (1987). This approach principally engages with {{the manner in which}} the initially ‘fractured and fragmented’ (Perdigao 4) character of Echo performs a gradual construction of ‘self’ throughout the series. Initially this process is examined via the Deleuzian concept of the 'assemblage'; classical ontology (i. e Platonic or Decartian) treats the ‘self’ as a stable, bounded entity, but from the Deleuzian perspective the subject only has meaning dependent upon its relationship with other assemblages, which result in transformations and the potential for the development of new formations. The assemblage therefore offers a theoretical means to elaborate the multiple and collective dimensions of our unconscious: 'these peoples who are in us and who make us speak, and who are the source of our statements' (Deleuze 1987 256). This approach is ideally suited to the analysis of Dollhouse, where the very concept of ‘self’ is malleable and dependent upon external forces, and we are specifically witness to the literal assemblage of Echo as an amalgamation of many forces and personalities. Furthermore, the Dollhouse narrative depicts Echo as unique in her ability to function as a coherent amalgamation of personalities (as opposed to the psychopathic Alpha, for example), and the chapter subsequently considers how she manages to achieve this via the conceit of the Deleuzian ‘Body without Organs’; ‘a body that breaks free from its socially articulated, disciplined, semioticized, and subjectified state (as an ‘organism’), to become disarticulated, dismantled, and deterritorialized, and hence able to be reconstituted in a new way’ (Best and Kellner, 91 - 92). Ultimately, Echo is positioned in terms of Deleuzian ‘Schizoanalysis’; as she explores, assumes and utilises the many identities of her <b>composite</b> personality, <b>Echo</b> is harnessing the ‘liberatory power’ of the Deleuzian schizophrenic as conceptualised in A Thousand Plateaus. Via these various conceits, the chapter ultimately provides an in-depth and radical poststructural interpretation of how Dollhouse both confronts and negotiates issues of self and identity...|$|R
40|$|Lightning Launch Commit Criteria (LLCC) and Flight Rules (FR) {{are used}} for {{launches}} and landings at government and commercial spaceports. They are designed to avoid natural and triggered lightning strikes to space vehicles, which can endanger the vehicle, payload, and general public. The previous LLCC and FR were shown to be overly restrictive, potentially leading to costly launch delays and scrubs. A radar algorithm called Volume Averaged Height Integrated Radar Reflectivity (VAHIRR), along with new LLCC and FR for anvil clouds, were developed using data collected by the Airborne Field Mill II research program. VAHIRR is calculated at every horizontal position in the coverage area of the radar and can be displayed similar to a two-dimensional derived reflectivity product, such as <b>composite</b> reflectivity or <b>echo</b> tops. It is the arithmetic product of two quantities not currently generated by the Weather Surveillance Radar 1988 Doppler (WSR- 88 D) : a volume average of the reflectivity measured in dBZ and the average cloud thickness based on the average echo top height and base height. This presentation will describe the VAHIRR algorithm, and then explain how the VAHIRR radar product was implemented and tested on a clone of the National Weather Service's (NWS) Open Radar Product Generator (ORPG-clone). The VAHIRR radar product was then incorporated into the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS), {{to make it more}} convenient for weather forecasters to utilize. Finally, the reliability of the VAHIRR radar product was tested with real-time level II radar data from the WSR- 88 D NWS Melbourne radar...|$|R
40|$|NMR {{methods have}} been {{designed}} and employed in studying ofcomplex liquids and solids formed by surfactants. PGSE NMRexperiments are easily biased by convection; this artifact canbe avoided by changing the sample holder and by usingconvection-compensated pulse sequences. The temperaturedistribution within samples was controlled using thetemperature dependent order parameter for CBr 2 H 2 dissolved in a thermotropic nematic solvent. Electronic ringing that often spoils accurate NMR experimentsfor broad lines was removed by the using <b>composite</b> pulses andquadrupole <b>echo</b> sequences with appropriate phase cycles. Field-dependent 81 Br and 35 Cl NMR relaxation studies in micellar solutions ofC 16 TAX surfactants showed that the structure ordynamics of the hydration shell is more influenced by thesurfactant cation for bromide than for chloride, in agreementwith {{their position in the}} Hoffmeister series. The presence ofa small but significant frequency-dependent relaxation showedthat the lateral self diffusion of the anions may be reduced ascompared to its bulk value in diluted solutions but only with afactor of 1. 0 - 2. 5. The ions are clearly not "bound" to thesurface. A field-dependent 2 H NMR relaxation study on the CTABr-α-d 2 and benzene-d 6 showed an initial one-dimensional micellargrowth followed by the appearance of microemulsion droplets onaddition of benzene. The local mobility of the benzene wasreduced when solubilized in small amounts, consistent with aninitial average location of benzene at the micellar interface. The surfactant diffusion coefficients fromconvection-compensated PGSE NMR experiments in the C 12 E 8 -D 2 O system showed monotonous growth of the micellesupon increasing temperature. Emulsion droplets in the C 12 E 5 -decane-D 2 O system where shown to coarsen according to theOstwald ripening theory after being brought out of equilibriumby a temperature drop. X-ray scattering and 2 H NMR line-shape and relaxation experimentssuggested that complex solids formed by a partly-sulfatedpolysaccharide and CnTAB exhibit regular ordering at both microscopicand mesoscopic length scales.
