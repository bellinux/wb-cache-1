40|$|One {{difficulty}} in performing meta-analyses of observational cohort studies {{is that the}} availability of confounders may vary between cohorts, so that some cohorts provide fully adjusted analyses while others only provide partially adjusted <b>analyses.</b> <b>Commonly,</b> <b>analyses</b> of the association between an exposure and disease either are restricted to cohorts with full confounder information, or use all cohorts but do not fully adjust for confounding. We propose using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis model to use information from all available cohorts while still adjusting for all the potential confounders. Our method uses both the fully adjusted and the partially adjusted estimated effects in the cohorts with full confounder information, together with an estimate of their within-cohort correlation. The method is applied to estimate the association between fibrinogen level and coronary heart diseas...|$|R

40|$|However, {{veterinary}} {{life span}} studies <b>commonly</b> <b>analyse</b> {{a population of}} dead animals (for example, coming from animal cemetery records, clinical databases or postmortem examination records) and simply use their ages at death to calculate a survival function {{as well as other}} statistical param-eters regarding life span. Given that data from such sources are usually sorted by time of death rather than time of birth, right censored data are masked by this approach. If, for example, the average life expectancy of a hypotheti-cal group of dogs was calculated by taking the population of individuals who died in the year 2004 as the sample, the result would be too low due to right censored data. For instance, no members of the 2000 birth cohort would be recorded to have reached over four years of age. Obviously, this result does not imply that the maximum life expectancy for this cohort wa...|$|R

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{are often}} used for envi-ronment monitoring, an {{application}} which requires reliable routing of messages from source to sink nodes via multi-hop networks. Prior to installing such WSNs, engineers <b>commonly</b> <b>analyse</b> the network using discrete event simula-tion (DES). Whilst sophisticated simulators such as Castalia and TOSSIM take into account many low-level features of WSNs, their biggest drawback {{is the lack of}} scalability. This inhibits design-time system optimisation for large or com-plex networks. In this paper, we discuss how Population CTMC (PCTMC) models, used in conjunction with mean-field analysis, can be used to mitigate this problem. To illus-trate the potential of PCTMC models in the WSN domain, we present a PCTMC model for a failsafe, dynamic rout-ing protocol, which we implemented in Castalia. We show that the mean-field solution for the model yields good qual-itative agreement with corresponding low-level simulations, but {{at a fraction of the}} computational cost. In particular we see good agreement for average metrics describing buffer occupancy and data flow behaviour. Moreover, our PCTMC model produces good results when packets are lost due to channel interference, an important consideration for WSNs...|$|R

Difference measures show no effect on marital satisfaction, whereas compound measures and DRMs do show an effect. As DRMs also allow for the quantification of this effect, while being theoretically and methodologically appropriate, they are affirmed the best method...|$|E

40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Masson S. p. A. In the target paper, I {{outlined}} several methodological issues associated with attempts to document category specific deficits; and a potential solution based around certain minimal criteria. The main argument being that an accurate interpretation of patient performance requires a comparison with a normal control group and that the group performs below ceiling. Neither of these requirements is new or one would imagine, especially contentious. It is therefore surprising that {{a review of the}} category specific literature reveals no single study that meets these criteria (Laws, in this issue). Moreover, this has to be viewed in the context that the <b>commonly</b> used <b>analyses</b> (within-patient ?? 2 and betweensubject comparisons with controls at ceiling) produce false positive, false negative and even paradoxical deficits.

The latter can be extended to a multiscale distribution akin to fractal analysis. Here we report the spectrum of multiscale Renyi entropy measures.

40|$|Multifractionation isoeffect {{data are}} <b>commonly</b> <b>analysed</b> under the {{assumption}} that cell survival determines the observed tissue or tumour response, and that it follows a linear-quadratic dose dependence. The analysis is employed to derive the α/β ratios of the linear-quadratic dose dependence, and different methods have been developed for this purpose. A common method uses the so-called Fe plot. A more complex but also more rigorous method has been introduced by Lam et al. (1979). Their method, which is based on numerical optimization procedures, is generalized and somewhat simplified in the present study. Tumour-regrowth data are used to explain the nonparametric procedure which provides α/β ratios without the need to postulate analytical expressions for the relationship between cell survival and regrowth delay. ...|$|E
