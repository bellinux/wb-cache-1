50|$|A hair iron {{is a tool}} used {{to change}} the {{structure}} of the hair with the help of heat. There are three general kinds: <b>curling</b> <b>tongs,</b> used to make the hair curly; straighteners, used to straighten the hair; and crimpers, used to create small crimps in the hair.|$|R

No powder on her nose--that {{proved to be the}} correct solution. How can you build on such a quicksand? Their most trivial action may mean volumes, or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a <b>curling</b> <b>tongs.</b> Good-morning, Watson." ...|$|R

50|$|In ancient civilizations, women's {{hair was}} often elaborately and {{carefully}} dressed in special ways. Women coloured their hair, curled it, and pinned it up (ponytail) {{in a variety}} of ways. They set their hair in waves and curls using wet clay, which they dried in the sun and then combed out, or else by using a jelly made of quince seeds soaked in water, or <b>curling</b> <b>tongs</b> and <b>curling</b> irons of various kinds.|$|R
5000|$|Curling irons, {{also known}} as <b>curling</b> <b>tongs,</b> create waves or curls in hair {{using a variety of}} {{different}} methods. There are many different types of modern curling irons, which can vary by diameter, material, and shape of barrel and the type of handle. The barrel's diameter can be anywhere from [...]5 in to 2 in. Smaller barrels typically create spiral curls or ringlets, and larger barrels are used to give shape and volume to a hairstyle.|$|R
50|$|Bamberger {{claimed that}} Symonds had {{threatened}} her with acid {{and tried to}} kill her, but Symonds {{said that he had}} never been violent towards her, but that she had cut his head open and on another occasion thrust a pair of <b>curling</b> <b>tongs</b> in his ear; he also claimed that she had poured acid over him at a hotel where they were staying. Bamberger was found guilty of eight counts of perjury relating to her testimony in the divorce court and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment in a case that was regarded as unusual at the time due to the rareness of prosecutions for perjury arising from testimony in divorce proceedings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} which was {{directed}} by Rohan Blair-Mangat, was filmed in Middlesex on 31 May 2012.

6000|$|To-night John Perkins {{encountered}} a tremendous upheaval of the commonplace {{when he reached}} his door. No Katy was there with her affectionate, confectionate kiss. The three rooms seemed in portentous disorder. All about lay her things in confusion. Shoes {{in the middle of}} the floor, <b>curling</b> <b>tongs,</b> hair bows, kimonos, powder box, jumbled together on dresser and chairs--this was not Katy's way. With a sinking heart John saw the comb with a curling cloud of her brown hair among its teeth. Some unusual hurry and perturbation must have possessed her, for she always carefully placed these combings in the little blue vase on the mantel to be some day formed into the coveted feminine [...] "rat." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Twinkleton’s {{establishment}} {{was about}} to undergo a serene hush. The Christmas recess was at hand. What had once, and at no remote period, been called, even by the erudite Miss Twinkleton herself, ‘the half;’ but what was now called, as being more elegant, and more strictly collegiate, ‘the term,’ would expire to-morrow. A noticeable relaxation of discipline had for some few days pervaded the Nuns’ House. Club suppers had occurred in the bedrooms, and a dressed tongue had been carved {{with a pair of}} scissors, and handed round with the <b>curling</b> <b>tongs.</b> Portions of marmalade had likewise been distributed on a service of plates constructed of curlpaper; and cowslip wine had been quaffed from the small squat measuring glass in which little Rickitts (a junior of weakly constitution) took her steel drops daily. The housemaids had been bribed with various fragments of riband, and sundry pairs of shoes more or less down at heel, to make no mention of crumbs in the beds; the airiest costumes had been worn on these festive occasions; and the daring Miss Ferdinand had even surprised the company with a sprightly solo on the comb-and-curlpaper, until suffocated in her own pillow by two flowing-haired executioners.|$|R
50|$|The ancient Greeks {{regarded}} the beard as a badge or sign of virility; in the Homeric epics, it had almost sanctified significance, {{and a common}} form of entreaty was to touch the beard of the person addressed. It was shaven only {{as a sign of}} mourning; it was then instead often left untrimmed. A smooth face was regarded as a sign of effeminacy. The Spartans punished cowards by shaving off a portion of their beards. From the earliest times, however, the shaving of the upper lip was not uncommon. Greek beards were also frequently <b>curled</b> with <b>tongs.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Early one morning--for {{at twenty}} one is virtuous, and takes {{exercise}} before breakfast--as young Charles Seabohn lay upon the cliffs, watching the white waters {{coming and going}} upon the black rocks below, {{he became aware of}} a form rising from the waves. The figure was too far off for him to see it clearly, but judging from the costume, it was a female figure, and promptly the mind of Charles, poetically inclined, turned to thoughts of Venus--or Aphrodite, as he, being a gentleman of delicate taste would have preferred to term her. He saw the figure disappear behind a head-land, but still waited. In about ten minutes or {{a quarter of an hour}} it reappeared, clothed in the garments of the eighteen-sixties, and came towards him. Hidden from sight himself behind a group of rocks, he could watch it at his leisure, ascending the steep path from the beach, and an exceedingly sweet and dainty figure it would have appeared, even to eyes less susceptible than those of twenty. Sea- water--I stand open to correction--is not, I believe, considered anything of a substitute for <b>curling</b> <b>tongs,</b> but to the hair of the youngest Miss Evans it had given an additional and most fascinating wave. Nature's red and white had been most cunningly laid on, and the large childish eyes seemed to be searching the world for laughter, with which to feed a pair of delicious, pouting lips. Charles's upturned face, petrified into admiration, was just the sort of thing for which they were on the look- out. A startled [...] "Oh!" [...] came from the slightly parted lips, followed by the merriest of laughs, which in its turn was suddenly stopped by a deep blush. Then the youngest Miss Evans looked offended, as though the whole affair had been Charles's fault, which is the way of women. And Charles, feeling himself guilty under that stern gaze of indignation, rose awkwardly and apologised meekly, whether for being on the cliffs at all or for having got up too early, he would have been unable to explain.|$|R
6000|$|With an effort, she {{wrenched}} {{her gaze}} from his, and suddenly his crisp hair caught her eyes. Surely--surely it was <b>curled</b> with <b>tongs!</b> A kind of spasm of amusement was set free in her heart, and, almost inaudibly, the words escaped her lips: [...] "Une technique merveilleuse!" [...] His eyes wavered; he uttered a little gasp; his lips fell apart. Gyp {{walked across the}} room and put her hand on the bell. She had lost her fear. Without a word, he turned, and went out into the garden. She watched him cross the lawn. Gone! She had beaten him by the one thing not even violent passions can withstand--ridicule, almost unconscious ridicule. Then she gave way and pulled the bell with nervous violence. The sight of the maid, in her trim black dress and spotless white apron, coming from the house completed her restoration. Was it possible that she had really been frightened, nearly failing in that encounter, nearly dominated by that man--in her own house, with her own maids down there at hand? And she said quietly: ...|$|R
