2500|$|Three-edged ingots is a {{rare and}} late sub-type of Lithuanian longs. They are found full or cut in half (halfs are also known as poltina). As of 1981, they were found in seven {{locations}} in a triangle between Kaunas, Vilnius, and Alytus and in Kretinga. In total, 38 ingots were found – 5 full and 33 cut in half. In 2002, half of a three-edged ingot {{was found in the}} Lower Castle of Vilnius. In 2010, 52 full and 4 half ingots were found in Grigaičiai near Naujoji Vilnia. In 2004 and 2007, the Money Museum of the Bank of Lithuania acquired two halfs of three-edged ingots (circumstances of their discovery are not known). One of them is particularly interesting as it is countermarked with {{what appears to be a}} crown inside a <b>circular</b> <b>rope</b> border. In 2002 and 2003, the first three-edged ingots were found outside of Lithuania: 9 halfs in Palačany (Палачаны) and 10 halfs plus 1 full bar in Litva (Літва) villages in Maladzyechna Raion, Belarus.|$|E
5000|$|The patron, St. Edmund Campion, was hanged and the <b>circular</b> <b>rope</b> signifies his martyrdom. The cross {{inside the}} circle symbolises sacrifice. The {{initials}} {{of the school}} [...] - [...] CHS [...] - [...] stand for character, holiness and sportsmanship. The letters DS in the centre is an abbreviation of the motto of the Monfort Brothers [...] - [...] Dieu Seul [...] - [...] means God alone. The school motto cur hic statis means 'why stand ye here?' ...|$|E
5000|$|The Commanding Officer of Tower asked Richardson if {{he could}} offer a design for the badge for his ship. Richardson spoke to ffoulkes and {{together}} {{they came up with}} a design that showed the White Tower of the Tower of London, with the motto [...] "God save King George and his Tower". This was encased in a <b>circular</b> <b>rope</b> frame, with a Naval Crown at the top, along with the name [...] "Tower" [...] set into a rectangular panel at the bottom. This design set the standard for all future ship's badges and became the design from which all today's badges are derived. [...] Major ffoulkes was subsequently requested to design others and the Admiralty Board set up a Ships' Badges Committee in 1918 to regulate ships' badges with him as the first Adviser on Heraldry.|$|E

FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES NAVYBy Executive Order 10812 of 24 April 1959, the President, {{upon the}} {{recommendation}} of the Secretary of the Navy with the approval of the Secretary of Defense, established and prescribed an official flag for the United States Navy. This flag is to be 4 feet 4 inches hoist (width) by 5 feet 6 inches fly (length), of dark blue material, with yellow fringe, 2½ inches wide. In the center of the flag is a device 3 feet 1 inch overall, consisting of the inner pictorial portion of the seal of the Department of the Navy (with the exception that a continuation of the sea has been substituted for the land area), in its proper colors within a <b>circular</b> yellow <b>rope</b> edging, all 2 feet 6 inches in diameter above a yellow scroll inscribed [...] "UNITED STATES NAVY" [...] in dark blue letters.|$|R

To date, highly idealized models for prominences have been used, especially with respect to the overall magnetic configurations. Aims. We initiate a more systematic survey of filament wave modes, where we consider full multi-dimensional models with twisted magnetic fields representative of the surrounding magnetic flux rope. This requires the ability to compute accurate 2. 5 dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibria that balance Lorentz forces, gravity, and pressure gradients, while containing density enhancements (static or in motion). Methods. The governing extended Grad-Shafranov equation is discussed, along with an analytic prediction for <b>circular</b> flux <b>ropes</b> for the Shafranov shift of the central magnetic axis due to gravity. Numerical equilibria are computed with a finite element-based code, demonstrating fourth order accuracy on an explicitly known, non-trivial test case. Results. The code is then used to construct more realistic prominence equilibria, for all three possible choices of a free flux-function. We quantify the influence of gravity, and generate cool condensations in hot cavities, as well as multi- layered prominences. Conclusions. The internal flux rope equilibria computed here have the prerequisite numerical accuracy to allow a yet more advanced analysis of the complete spectrum of linear magnetohydrodynamic perturbations, as will be demonstrated in the companion paper.

5000|$|At Hammelev Church, on the {{northern}} part of the Djursland peninsula, 5 kilometers north of the town Grenå, there is also a Holter baptismal font. Hammelev Church is built of limestone, and there is lots of middle age graffiti in the outer walls of the nearly 1000 year old masonry. [...] A lot seems to be scratched out symbols aimed at confusing or entraping evil spirits, by use of symbols based on specialized geometries, such as connected circles, that the spirits supposedly could not get out of, or cross, easily. This is also seen with the unbroken twisted <b>circular</b> band of <b>rope</b> surrounding the Holter baptismal fonts at the Rolsø- and Hammelev churches. Rope circles like these are also found on other middle age baptismal fonts made by Holter, seen in churches on Djursland, and maybe also in other parts of Denmark. These middle age artifacts were crafted in times when evil spirits and witches were something one believed in literally, and to such a degree, that the superstition gave way to the burning of women alive, if these people became suspected of practicing witchery.|$|R
