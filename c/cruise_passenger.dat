50|$|Celebrity Cruises {{was founded}} in April 1988 as a {{subsidiary}} of the Greece-based Chandris Group to operate upmarket cruise ships to Bermuda. Chandris had been involved in cruise traffic since the 1960s, and during the late 1980s the company operated in the United States market under the brand name Chandris Cruises. Chandris Fantasy Cruises targeted {{the lower end of the}} <b>cruise</b> <b>passenger</b> market, with fleets consisting of second-hand ocean liners. Celebrity Cruises came into existence when, in April 1988, Home Lines, at the time one of the world's leading premium cruise lines, was sold to Holland America Line. Home Lines' ships had held two of the five contracts offered by the Government of Bermuda to cruise lines, giving the ships priority berthing arrangement and unlimited access of sail to the islands in exchange for the ships sailing to Bermuda between April and October each year. Although these contracts were highly valued, Holland America Line decided to withdraw the former Home Lines ships from this service, leaving an opening for two new ships to gain access. Chandris wanted to acquire the contracts, but the Government of Bermuda was only willing to award them to upmarket cruise lines, which Chandris Fantasy Cruises was not.|$|E
5000|$|The inquest {{heard the}} initial {{interview}} that Silvestri had given police in New Caledonia. The interview was taken {{two days after}} Brimble's death.

[...] Silvestri also described her as [...] "desperate", [...] "a yuck-ugly dog" [...] and a [...] "fat thing." [...] Silvestri told the police interviewers he was angry because Brimble [...] "fucked up his holiday" [...] by dying in his cabin. According to police witness statements, Silvestri allegedly said to another <b>cruise</b> <b>passenger,</b> Allison McKain, that [...] "The bitch is dead, the fucking bitch is dead. Some shit went down last night, some top secret shit," [...] and that a woman had died, naked {{on the floor of}} their cabin.

At least ten passengers saw Brimble, having lost control of her bodily functions, lying unconscious and naked on the cabin floor, including several women Wilhelm specifically invited into the cabin to see her in that state. When the group realised something was wrong they washed and dressed Brimble before calling for help.

40|$|As {{the fastest}} growing sector within the {{international}} tourism industry, having grown at roughly double the rate of international tourism as a whole, the cruise liner business has shown impressive growth in the North American and European markets. For port management purposes, {{as well as for}} transport policy, it is essential to be able to forecast accurately <b>cruise</b> <b>passenger</b> arrivals and their variability. In the presence of time-varying variances (or volatility), it is crucial to model such volatility in order to provide sensible forecast intervals in addition to the forecast themselves. Time-varying volatility in port management is important because governments and businesses {{need to be aware of}} the uncertainty associated with the number of <b>cruise</b> <b>passenger</b> arrivals and their associated growth. In calculating income elasticities, port taxes and tourist taxes, it is essential to obtain accurate estimates of <b>cruise</b> <b>passenger</b> arrivals and their volatility. Moreover, in an international context in which natural disasters, terrorism, crime and ethnic conflicts, among others, have significant impacts on tourism, it is crucial to assess the persistence of shocks on <b>cruise</b> <b>passenger</b> arrivals for effective crisis management plans, including different forms of co-operation among ports facing similar shocks. Appropriate models are required to enable optimal private and public decision making in designing ports for cruise ships. Daily <b>cruise</b> <b>passenger</b> arrivals data for the three major ports in the Balearic Islands, Spain, namely Palma, Ibiza and Mahon, for the period 1997 - 2006, as well as for the high cruise season for each island,are analyzed using alternative conditional mean and conditional volatility models in order to provide empirical support for purposes of optimal decision making. Four different types of asymmetries are analyzed according to the positive and negative shocks to daily <b>cruise</b> <b>passenger</b> arrivals, as well as from distinctions between the high and low cruise seasons. The estimates of <b>cruise</b> <b>passenger</b> arrivals and their volatility are generally found to be sensible and to have valid statistical properties. Likelihood ratio tests of the constancy of coefficients in the high and low cruise seasons indicate that the weekly delayed response of <b>cruise</b> <b>passenger</b> arrivals differ significantly spatially across islands and temporally across seasons. ...|$|E
