The trial was conducted in randomized block design and treatments corresponded to harvest heights of 20; 50; 80 and 110 cm from the soil surface. The agronomic evaluations were conducted 114 days after planting. The percentage of dry matter (DM) and productivity of stem, grain and participation of potassium remaining in the stem increased linearly with increasing <b>cutting</b> <b>height</b> (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Knowledge of {{the amount}} of {{cuttings}} that have accumulated in a drilled wellbore is part of the information necessary for the effective control of bottom-hole pressure, preventing stuck pipe and minimizing circulation time for cleaning the wellbore. Acquisition of this knowledge can be made difficult when washouts develop in the wellbore, thereby promoting uneven distribution of cuttings along different sections of the wellbore. The cuttings are essentially found to accumulate in the washouts causing the wells to be improperly cleaned and can also lead to stuck pipe scenarios {{and a host of other}} events causing Non Productive Time. This study was therefore conducted to investigate the stationary <b>cuttings</b> bed <b>height</b> in washouts and how long and wide the washouts need to be before any increase in height was expected. This was achieved by a theoretical and experimental approach. The theoretical approach involved a literature survey of issues relating to wellbore washouts such as its causes, basic indicators of its occurrence in a well, its effects on wellbore drilling and tripping processes as well as possible ways of minimizing these effects. In a bid to further unveil the concept of washouts in wellbores, a physical model was developed in the course of the work. Furthermore, a mathematical model useful for calculating the stationary <b>cuttings</b> bed <b>heights</b> in the washouts was also developed. The experimental work presented a detailed review of <b>cuttings</b> <b>height</b> in expansions. In order to verify this, a wellbore annulus with washout in the middle was simulated using a 6 m long loop. Three washouts of 60 cm, 30 cm and 15 cm in diameter respectively were used. The annulus was kept horizontal throughout the test period. Fluid flow rates were set in the frequency range of 5 to 30 Hz (28. 6 l/min to 51. 6 l/min). Water and aqueous solutions of hydroxyl ethyl cellulose polymer (HEC) were used for cleaning the cutting beds. Actual drill cuttings of were used. The stable <b>cuttings</b> bed <b>height</b> after long circulation as well as the effects of relevant drilling parameters was measured. During these tests, it was observed that a high Reynolds number leading to turbulent flow with low viscosity fluid (water) enabled cuttings to be removed in the largest washout diameter of 60 cm. It was equally observed that though cuttings accumulated in the washouts, it took an interval of 78 seconds at high flow rates for <b>cuttings</b> <b>height</b> increase to be seen in the largest washout, approximately 47 seconds for the 30 cm washout and 26 seconds for the 15 cm washout. This shows that washouts with wide diameters take much time to be filled with cuttings than when the washouts are smaller in diameter. However, the important issue here is the <b>height</b> of these <b>cuttings</b> in the washout sections. Experimental results were used together with a non-linear regression analysis program to establish a functional relationship among drilling fluid properties namely the fluid flow rate and the <b>cuttings</b> bed <b>height.</b> Finally, the results of non-linear regression analysis showed that the relationship between <b>cuttings</b> bed <b>height</b> and flow rate of mud in washouts could be described very well by a simple log-decay exponential expression: 	. </p...|$|R

40|$|Current {{recommendations}} regarding <b>cutting</b> <b>height</b> of alfalfa {{are designed}} to maximize yield while maintaining high quality forages and stand longevity. Forage growers frequently cut forages at a height of three or more inches. However, recent reports indicate {{that there may be}} an advantage to cutting alfalfa closer, leaving an inch or less of stubble height (@griculture Online, 1999). Research indicates that dry matter yields and nutrient yields are higher for shorter cutting heights as compared to leaving taller stubble (Sheaffer et al., 1988). Obtaining higher yields requires that the plants are healthy and that carbohydrate root reserves are adequate for plant regrowth following harvest. Early Wisconsin studies using Vernal alfalfa showed that forages harvested three or four times per season produced more total forage when cut at a 1 -inch height versus cutting at 3 inches or more (Kust and Smith, 1961, Smith and Nelson, 1967). North Dakota research looking at <b>cutting</b> <b>height</b> since the mid- 1960 s shows similar results where shorter <b>cutting</b> <b>height</b> leads to higher yields. Potassium is a critical nutrient for the growth, development, and persistence of alfalfa. Recent work in Wisconsin demonstrates the yield response of alfalfa to K (Peters and Kelling, 2000). While the critical concentration of K in the alfalfa plant for optimum yield is 1. 5 - 2 %, recent studies show that K concentrations more frequently range from 3 - 5 % or higher. When K concentration is at a very high levels in alfalfa, alfalfa-based dairy cows diets may become too alkaline and the incidence of milk fever increases (Oetzel, 1991). Dairymen with this problem need to find management solutions to reduce the K concentration in alfalfa. Some crop management factors influence K content in alfalfa including stage of maturity at harvest, time of year, grass or weed competition, fertilization, and soil and environmental conditions. Another factor that may influence K content of alfalfa is <b>cutting</b> <b>height.</b> By reducing alfalfa <b>cutting</b> <b>height,</b> forage yields may be higher, and K concentrations lower. Research was initiated at the Marshfield Agricultural Research Station during 1999 to explore the relationships among <b>cutting</b> <b>height,</b> forage yield and tissue K levels. This paper will discuss the influence of <b>cutting</b> <b>height</b> on yield and tissue K levels of alfalfa...|$|E

Lock.) in tropical Africa for soil fertility replenishment. Senna singueana (Senna), which is also locally known as Mhumba, was examined in mixed inter-cropping trial at four <b>cutting</b> <b>heights</b> (25, 50, 75 and 100 cm), measuring its foliage biomass production and maize yield. Senna was established using 3 months-old seedlings at 2. 0 m inter-row and 0. 9 m intra-row spacings. Staha maize variety {{was used as the}} test-crop. Foliar biomass, maize yield and N-partitioning between maize parts (grain, straws and cobs) were determined. Senna had the highest growth rate during 4 - 10 months after establishment. Foliage dry matter yield (fertilizer source) increased with <b>cutting</b> stubble <b>height</b> to 75 cm after which it declined. Cutting Senna plants at 75 cm height maximized both its potential for foliar biomass production (2. 70 t ha - 1), prunings N contribution to the maize crop (59. 5 kg N ha - 1), yields of maize grain (2. 70 t ha - 1), straws (2. 50 t ha - 1) and cobs (0. 55 t ha - 1) and N-partitioning between maize grain (40. 1 kg N ha - 1), straws (12. 8 kg N ha - 1) and cobs (3. 7 kg N ha - 1). It is concluded that Senna grows rapidly and recovers fast to coppice profusely following foliage harvesting. Pruning Senna plants at 75 cm height optimizes soil N availability and plant uptake and promotes healthy plant growth, maximizes biomass production and yield of associated maize crops. It is, however, suggested that future genetic improvement research should focus on evaluating various Senna singueana provenances with a view of identifying the strains that maximize its productivity...|$|R

Cunningham) and herbaceous legumes (Arachis pintoi) intercropped with Panicum maximum cv. Massai, simultaneously implanted in a maize crop. The study made use of a randomized block experimental design with four replications. Assessments of biomass accumulation and forage nutritional value were made after the maize harvest, between June 2008 and October 2010. It was found that the residues of maize provided better growing conditions for Massai grass during the dry season. L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham and the Leucaena hybrid had the highest accumulation of all forage legumes evaluated, and provided the best nutritional value of all the arrangements tested. Of all woody legumes tested in this system, Leucaena was considered feasible for intercropping with Massai grass. The intercrop of perennial woody Baru with maize is not recommended. Albizia lebbeck and Cratylia argentea require further study, especially the yield assessment at different cutting intervals and <b>cutting</b> <b>heights.</b> Arachis pintoi had a low participation in the intercropping, showing greater performance over time, indicating slow thriving in this experimental condition...|$|R

40|$|O experimento foi realizado com o objetivo de avaliar as características morfogênicas e estruturais em Andropogon gayanus cv. Planaltina e Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraés submetidos a três alturas de corte quando o dossel atingia 95 % de interceptação da luz incidente durante a rebrotação. O trabalho foi conduzido em área do Departamento de Zootecnia da Universidade Federal de Viçosa, em Viçosa, Minas Gerais, em um delineamento em blocos completos casualizados com três repetições, totalizando nove unidades experimentais. Para o capim-andropógon, as avaliações iniciaram-se em novembro de 2007 e findaram-se em novembro de 2008, sendo que os tratamentos corresponderam a três alturas de corte de 20, 27 e 34 cm. Já para o capim-xaraés, o período {{experimental}} foi {{de janeiro}} a novembro de 2008 e as alturas de corte utilizadas foram 15, 20 e 25 cm. A altura do pasto em pré-corte apresentou-se estável, com valores próximos a 50 e 30 cm, para os capins Andropógon e Xaraés, respectivamente, mostrando ser um bom parâmetro, prático e eficiente, para nortear o manejo da desfolhação dessas plantas forrageiras, uma vez que a altura se encontra fortemente relacionada com a interceptação de 95 % da luz incidente. Cortes mais altos resultaram em menor ângulo e maior área da folhagem, assim, as plantas interceptaram mais luz logo após a desfolhação, o que possibilitou rebrotações mais rápidas e intervalos entre cortes mais curtos. Todavia, independentemente da espécie forrageira avaliada, não houve diferença no índice de área da folhagem pré-corte entre os tratamentos ou épocas de avaliação, o que foi reflexo de respostas plásticas rápidas envolvendo ajustes nas características morfogênicas e estruturais das plantas. O capim-andropógon reduziu o comprimento final da lâmina foliar (CFLF), a taxa de aparecimento de folhas (TApF), o número de folhas vivas (NFV), a duração de vida da folha (DVF), a taxa de alongamento de colmo (TAlC) e a densidade populacional de perfilhos (DPP) e elevou o filocrono e a taxa de senescência de folhas (TSeF), quando submetido a cortes mais baixos. Devido ao florescimento típico do capim-andropógon no outono, observou-se elevação na TAlC e TApF nesse período. Adicionalmente, foram registrados maiores valores de NFV e menores de CFLF e DVF. Já o capim-xaraés demonstrou uma elevação na taxa de alongamento de folhas (TAlF) e NFV e uma redução na TAlC e DPP, quando submetido a cortes mais baixos. Entre as épocas avaliadas, o outono revelou menores TAlF e CFLF e maiores NFV, DVF, TSeF e DPP. O manejo adequado da desfolhação dos capins Andropógon e Xaraés seria corte aos 50 e 30 cm de altura do dossel durante a rebrotação a uma altura de 27 a 34 cm e 15 a 20 cm, respectivamente. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate morphogenetic and structural characteristics of Andropogon gayanus cv. Planaltina and Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraés submitted to three <b>cutting</b> <b>heights</b> when the sward reached 95 % of light interception during the regrowth time. The experiment was carried out at Animal Science Department at UFV, in Viçosa/MG, from November 2007 to November 2008, and it was allocated in a completed randomised block design with three replications, in a total of nine experimental units. The evaluations of Andropógon grass started in November 2007 and finished in November 2008, and its treatment corresponded to three <b>cutting</b> <b>heights</b> 20, 27 and 34 cm. Concerning Xaraés palisade grass, its evaluation time happened between January 2008 and November 2008, and its <b>cutting</b> <b>heights</b> were 15, 20 and 25 cm. The height of the pasture in the pre-cut time presented itself stable, and its values were about 50 and 30 cm for Andropógon grass and Xaraés palisade grass respectively. It revealed itself as a good practical and efficient parameter in order to manage the defoliation of these forage plants, since the height is highly related to 95 % of light interception. The highest cuts resulted in the lowest angle and the lowest foliage area, so the grasses intercepted more light right after the defoliation time, which possibly promoted faster regrowths in shorter cut intervals. However, independently of the evaluated forage specie, there was no difference in the foliage area index between the treatments or the evaluation times, which was a reflex of fast plastic responses involving adjustments in the structural and morphogenetic characteristics of the plants. The Andropógon grass reduced its final leaf lamina length (FLLL), leaf appearance rate (LAR), number of live leaves (NLL), leaf lifespan (LL), stem elongation rate (SER), and tiller density (TD). When this grass was submitted to the lowest cuts, it elevated the phyllochron and the leaf senescence rate (LSR). Because of Andropógon grass typical blossom time in the fall, it was observed an elevation in the values of SER and LAR in this season. In addition, it was registered the highest NLL and the lowest values for the length of leaf lamina and LS. On the other hand, Xaraés palisade grass presented an increase in the leaf elongation rate (LER) and in the NLL, and a decrease in the values of SER and of the TD when this grass was submitted to the lowest cuts. The fall presented the lowest values of TAIF and of length of leaf lamina, and the highest values of NLL, LL, leaf senescence rate (LSR), and TD. The adequate management of the defoliation in the Andropógon grass and Xaraés palisade grass would be the <b>cutting</b> <b>heights</b> of 50 and 30 cm of tiller during the regrowth time in the heights from 27 to 34 cm and from 15 to 20 cm respectively...|$|R

Mechanical methods are the first choice in environmentally sensitive areas. In this study, we aimed to find answers to the questions: does the application of <b>cutting</b> at a <b>height</b> of 1 m from the ground limit the sprouting capacities of black cherry? And, is stem girdling an effective method of eliminating black cherry? The study was carried out in the Kampinos National Park, on two mixed pine forest plots with undergrowth of black cherry. Three mechanical methods of elimination were applied: cut-stump at the base, <b>cutting</b> at a <b>height</b> of 1 m above the ground and girdling of the stem at a height of ca 1 m above the ground. In both locations, 225 trees were treated, at three different dates corresponding with three different phenological phases of black cherry development. The evaluation of effectiveness of treatments was based on the sprouting capacity of the tree afterwards, which included: the number of generated sprouts, the length of three longest sprouts, dry mass of sprouts, and the assessment of tree survival rate. It was discovered that girdling is a significantly more effective method of control than ground-level cut-stump or <b>cutting</b> at a <b>height</b> of 1 m above the ground in the conditions of central Poland.

40|$|Non-winterdonnant alfalfa (Medicago sativa L) {{from the}} Middle East regrows rapidly and {{produces}} high forage yield making it attractive {{for use in}} wann-desert regions. In the Middle East, alfalfa is commonly harvested before flowering (bud stage) leaving less than 2 cm stubble. Alfalfa from this reg-ion has unique adaptations to this management and regrow predominately from meristems originating near the stem base. Harvest management may influence productivity of Middle-Eastern alfalfas in mechanized agriculture where late harvest and <b>cutting</b> <b>heights</b> between 8 and 12 cm predominate. We compared yield, persistence, and crown architecture of six Middle-Eastern alfalfa ecotypes under tradi-tional (preflowering + 2 cm stubble) and contemporary harvest management (10 % bloom + 10 cm stub-ble), and a combined regime (preflowering + 10 cm stubble) in a 27 -month trial in Arizona. Contempo-rary harvest management resulted in significantly higher forage yield in the Middle-Eastern accessions than in either of the other regimes and did not disturb the initiation of regrowth stems. Forage yields of the most productive Middle-Eastern ecotype were 11 to 20 % higher than an elite southwestern cultivar regardless of harvest regime. The combined regime, with its higher forage quality, may be preferred as Middle-Eastern alfalfas are utilized in mechanized agriculture.
