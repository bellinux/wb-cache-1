40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the possibility of domino effect in underground parallel pipelines relying on historical accident data and pipeline crater models. An underground pipeline can be considered as safe following an accident with an adjacent gas or liquefied pipeline when it remains outside the ground crater generated. In order to prevent the domino effect in these cases, the design of parallel pipelines has to consider adequate pipeline separations based on the <b>crater</b> <b>width,</b> {{which is one of the}} widely used methods in engineering applications. The objective of this work is the analysis of underground petroleum product pipelines ruptures with the formation of a ground crater as well as the evaluation of possible domino effects in these cases. A detailed literature survey has been carried out to review existing crater models along with a historical analysis of past accidents. A FORTRAN code has been implemented to assess the performance of the Gasunie, the Batelle and the Advantica crater models. In addition to this, a novel Accident-Based crater model has been presented, which allows the prediction of the <b>crater</b> <b>width</b> as a function of the relevant design pipeline parameters as well as the soil density. Modifications have also been made to the Batelle and Accident-Based models in order to overcome the underestimation of the <b>crater</b> <b>width.</b> The calculated crater widths have been compared with real accident data and the performance evaluation showed that the proposed Accident-Based model has a better performance compared to other models studied in this work. The analysis of forty-eight past accidents indicated a major potential of underground parallel pipelines domino effect which is proven by two real cases taken from the literature. Relying on the investigated accidents, the <b>crater</b> <b>width</b> was smaller than or equal to 20 m in most cases indicating that the definition of underground pipeline separations at around 10 m would be sufficient to ensure a small probability of the domino effect...|$|E
30|$|The {{emergence}} of the LTR phase, for ɛ > 500 eV, can be rationalized from an atomistic viewpoint based on Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) investigations of single ion impacts on the Ag(001) and Pt(111) surfaces [24, 25]. In those studies vacancy clusters with size of several nanometers are generated by the ion collisions and are coupled to several surrounding clusters which consist of the displaced adatoms. Within the <b>crater</b> <b>width</b> every correlation is reasonably suppressed due to the locally hyperthermal collision transient. The ascending character of the wavelength, observed in our data, can be thus regarded {{as a consequence of}} the increasing crater radius with the impact energy in agreement with molecular dynamics simulations [26]. The LTR state arises then from the onset of impact-induced “hot spots” involving a local surface melting in the volume around the collision point [25, 27]. This assumption is corroborated by the slope relaxation intervening at higher impact energy (see Fig. 5), i.e. when the thermal spike affects wider areas of the surface [28]. In addition, the loss of correlation for higher energy can be reasonably associated either to the stronger excitation transferred to the surface atoms from the impinging ions or to an increase of the lateral extension of the impact crater.|$|E
40|$|An {{incident}} fast ion in {{the electronic}} stopping regime produces a track of excitations {{which can lead to}} particle ejection and cratering. Molecular Dynamics simulations of the evolution of the deposited energy were used to study the resulting crater morphology {{as a function of the}} excitation density in a cylindrical track for large angle of incidence with respect to the surface normal. Surprisingly, the overall behavior is shown to be similar to that seen in the experimental data for crater formation in polymers. However, the simulations give greater insight into the cratering process. The threshold for crater formation occurs when the excitation density approaches the cohesive energy density, and a crater rim is formed at about six times that energy density. The crater length scales roughly as the square root of the electronic stopping power, and the <b>crater</b> <b>width</b> and depth seem to saturate for the largest energy densities considered here. The number of ejected particles, the sputtering yield, is shown to be much smaller than simple estimates based on crater size unless the full crater morphology is considered. Therefore, crater size can not easily be used to estimate the sputtering yield. Comment: LaTeX, 7 pages, 5 EPS figures.

40|$|The {{effective}} cohesion of the cratered region during crater collapse is determined via the widths of slump terraces of complex <b>craters.</b> Terrace <b>widths</b> are measured for complex craters on Mercury; these generally increase outward toward the rim {{for a given}} <b>crater,</b> and the <b>width</b> of the outermost major terrace is generally an increasing function of crater diameter. The terrace widths on Mercury and a gravity-driven slump model are used to estimate {{the strength of the}} cratered region immediately after impact (about 1 - 2 MPa). A comparison with the previous study of lunar complex craters by Pearce and Melosh (1986) indicates that the transient strength of cratered Mercurian crust is no greater than that of the moon. The strength estimates vary only slightly with the geometric model used to restore the outermost major terrace to its precollapse configuration and are consistent with independent strength estimates from the simple-to-complex crater depth/diameter transition...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between an ultra-fast pulse laser and a material's surface {{has become a}} research hotspot in recent years. Micromachining of titanium alloy with an ultra-fast pulse laser {{is a very important}} research direction, and it has very important theoretical significance and application value in investigating the ablation threshold of titanium alloy irradiated by ultra-fast pulse lasers. Irradiated by a picosecond pulse laser with wavelengths of 1064 nm and 532 nm, the surface morphology and feature sizes, including ablation <b>crater</b> <b>width</b> (i. e. diameter), ablation depth, ablation area, ablation volume, single pulse ablation rate, and so forth, of the titanium alloy were studied, and their ablation distributions were obtained. The experimental results show that titanium alloy irradiated by a picosecond pulse infrared laser with a 1064 nm wavelength has better ablation morphology than that of the green picosecond pulse laser with a 532 nm wavelength. The feature sizes are approximately linearly dependent on the laser pulse energy density at low energy density and the monotonic increase in laser pulse energy density. With the increase in energy density, the ablation feature sizes are increased. The rate of increase in the feature sizes slows down gradually once the energy density reaches a certain value, and gradually saturated trends occur at a relatively high energy density. Based on the linear relation between the laser pulse energy density and the crater area of the titanium alloy surface, and the Gaussian distribution of the laser intensity on the cross section, the ablation threshold of titanium alloy irradiated by an ultra-fast pulse laser was calculated to be about 0. 109 J/cm 2...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMonazite [(LREE) PO 4], {{a common}} {{accessory}} mineral in magmatic and metamorphic rocks, is complementary to zircon in U–Th–Pb geochronology. Because the mineral can record successive growth phases {{it is useful}} for unravelling complex geological histories. A high spatial resolution is required to identify contrasted age domains that may occur at the crystal-scale. Bulk mineral techniques such as ID-TIMS, applied to single monazite grains recording multiple overgrowths or isotope resetting can result in partly scattered discordant analytical points that produce inaccurate intercept ages. Laser ablation (LA) -ICPMS has been demonstrated to be a useful technique for U–Th–Pb dating of zircons, and this study tests its analytical capabilities for dating monazite. A sector field high resolution ICPMS coupled with a 193 nm ArF excimer laser ablation microprobe is capable of achieving a high spatial resolution and producing stable and reliable isotope measurements. The U–Th–Pb systematic was applied to monazite grains from several samples: a lower Palaeozoic lens from high-grade terrains in Southern Madagascar, Neogene hydrothermal crystals from the Western Alps, a Palaeoproterozoic very high temperature granulite from central Madagascar and a Variscan leucogranite from Spain, directly on a polished thin section. The major aim was to compare and/or reproduce TIMS and EMP ages of monazite {{from a variety of}} settings and ages. The three independent 206 Pb/ 238 U, 207 Pb/ 235 U and 208 Pb/ 232 Th ratios and ages were calculated. Isotope fractionation effects (mass bias, laser induced fractionation) were corrected using a chemically homogeneous and U–Pb concordant monazite as external standard. This study demonstrates that excimer laser ablation (ELA) -ICPMS allows U–Th–Pb dating of monazite {{with a high level of}} repeatability, accuracy and precision as well as rapidity of analysis. A spatial resolution almost comparable to that of EMP in terms of <b>crater</b> <b>width</b> (5 μm) produced precise 208 Pb/ 232 Th, 206 Pb/ 238 U and 207 Pb/ 235 U ratios for dating Palaeozoic to Precambrian monazites. The advantages of (ELA) -ICPMS isotope dating are precision, accuracy and the ability to detect discordance. In the case of late Miocene hydrothermal monazites from the Alps, a larger spot size of 25 μm diameter is required, and precise and accurate ages were obtained only for 208 Pb/ 232 Th systematics. Results from the Variscan granite show that in situ U–Th–Pb dating of monazites with (ELA) -ICPMS is possible using a 5 μm spot directly on thin sections, so that age data can be placed in a textural contex...|$|E

40|$|For {{hypervelocity}} impacts {{the effects}} of impact angle obliquity on final crater morphology have been studied using the hydrocode AUTODYN- 3 D. The target material and velocity ranges have been chosen so that they correspond with typical space debris impacts on orbital spacecraft situations, such as NASA's LDEF and ESA's Eureca. The hydrocode calculations were first validated against oblique impact experiments for 1 mm aluminum spheres on aluminum at 6. 5 km/s and for the normal impact of 1 mu m iron spheres on copper at 16 km/s. The main study was for 1 mu m aluminum and iron spheres impacting aluminum at velocities of 6. 5, 10 and 16 km/s and impact angles from 0 degrees to 85 degrees. Results are presented which show the calculated relationships between the impact angle, and the main <b>crater</b> length, <b>width</b> and depth. A study of projectile size effects has also been performed by carrying out calculations for several different projectile sizes ranging from 1 mm to 1 mu m. The calculations used strain-rate dependent material models and the results suggest either that departure from exact size scaling cannot be explained by strain rate effects, or that the Johnson-Cook model used is not appropriate for the higher strain rates experienced {{in the case of}} smaller size projectiles. The calculations demonstrate that Lagrangian techniques, when coupled with an erosion algorithm, can be used for hypervelocity impact calculations, however care must be taken to use an appropriate erosion criterion...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of granite}} rock under normal incidence hypervelocity {{impact in the}} laboratory has been studied using impacts of 2 -mm diameter stainless-steel spheres at between 1 and 6 km s(- 1). It was found that, at normal incidence, {{there is a strong}} dependence of crater size with impact speed (v). Crater mass was found to depend on v((2. 3 +/- 0. 4)), i. e. compatible with scaling with impact energy. However, crater depth and diameter have different and dissimilar dependences on impact speed, such that the crater shape (depth/diameter) is not a constant, but decreases as impact speed increases, being 0. 26 at 1 km s(- 1) and falling linearly to 0. 16 at 6 km s(- 1). In addition, a second data set with the same projectile and target combination was taken at a mean impact speed of 5. 4 +/- 0. 2 km s(- 1), with the angle of incidence of impact ranging from 0 degrees (normal incidence) to 85 degrees (glancing incidence). The oblique incidence data show that crater depth and excavated mass start to decrease immediately when non-normal incidence occurs. <b>Crater</b> length and <b>width</b> initially decrease at a slower rate, with little decrease apparent until the angle of impact exceeds 50 degrees from the normal. At the highest angles of incidence (85 degrees, glancing incidence), there is a sudden change in crater shape, with crater length no longer decreasing as impact angle increases. It was found that for oblique impacts, excavated crater mass scales linearly with cos theta and not with the square of costheta as indicated in earlier work. This is similar to the scaling observed in other brittle and ductile materials. Finally, when used to predict populations of non-circular craters on large Solar system bodies, the results yield estimates (3 per cent) close to the observed rate (5 per cent) on Venus, Mars and the Moon...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the research {{efforts on the}} DOE supported research project Percussion Drilling (DE-FC 26 - 03 NT 41999), which is to significantly advance the fundamental understandings of the physical mechanisms involved in combined percussion and rotary drilling, and thereby facilitate more efficient and lower cost drilling and exploration of hard-rock reservoirs. The project has been divided into multiple tasks: literature reviews, analytical and numerical modeling, full scale laboratory testing and model validation, and final report delivery. Literature reviews document the history, pros and cons, and rock failure physics of percussion drilling in oil and gas industries. Based on the current understandings, a conceptual drilling model is proposed for modeling efforts. Both analytical and numerical approaches are deployed to investigate drilling processes such as drillbit penetration with compression, rotation and percussion, rock response with stress propagation, damage accumulation and failure, and debris transportation inside the annulus after disintegrated from rock. For rock mechanics modeling, a dynamic numerical tool has been developed to describe rock damage and failure, including rock crushing by compressive bit load, rock fracturing by both shearing and tensile forces, and rock weakening by repetitive compression-tension loading. Besides multiple failure criteria, the tool also includes a damping algorithm to dissipate oscillation energy and a fatigue/damage algorithm to update rock properties during each impact. From the model, Rate of Penetration (ROP) and rock failure history can be estimated. For cuttings transport in annulus, a 3 D numerical particle flowing model has been developed with aid of analytical approaches. The tool can simulate cuttings movement at particle scale under laminar or turbulent fluid flow conditions and evaluate the efficiency of cutting removal. To calibrate the modeling efforts, a series of full-scale fluid hammer drilling tests, as well as single impact tests, have been designed and executed. Both Berea sandstone and Mancos shale samples are used. In single impact tests, three impacts are sequentially loaded at the same rock location to investigate rock response to repetitive loadings. The <b>crater</b> depth and <b>width</b> are measured {{as well as the}} displacement and force in the rod and the force in the rock. Various pressure differences across the rock-indentor interface (i. e. bore pressure minus pore pressure) are used to investigate the pressure effect on rock penetration. For hammer drilling tests, an industrial fluid hammer is used to drill under both underbalanced and overbalanced conditions. Besides calibrating the modeling tool, the data and cuttings collected from the tests indicate several other important applications. For example, different rock penetrations during single impact tests may reveal why a fluid hammer behaves differently with diverse rock types and under various pressure conditions at the hole bottom. On the other hand, the shape of the cuttings from fluid hammer tests, comparing to those from traditional rotary drilling methods, may help to identify the dominant failure mechanism that percussion drilling relies on. If so, encouraging such a failure mechanism may improve hammer performance. The project is summarized in this report. Instead of compiling the information contained in the previous quarterly or other technical reports, this report focuses on the descriptions of tasks, findings, and conclusions, as well as the efforts on promoting percussion drilling technologies to industries including site visits, presentations, and publications. As a part of the final deliveries, the 3 D numerical model for rock mechanics is also attached...|$|R
