5000|$|Contact between {{pantograph}} {{and overhead}} catenary wire is usually assured through {{a block of}} graphite. This material conducts electricity {{while working as a}} lubricant. As graphite is brittle, pieces can break off during operation. Bad pantographs can seize the overhead wire and tear it down. So there is a two way influence where bad wires can damage the pantograph and bad pantographs can damage the wires. To prevent this, a pantograph monitoring station can be used. At sustained high speeds (above [...] ) friction can cause the <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> to become red hot, which causes excessive arcing, and fail.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} to {{estimate}} the electron diffusion length in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) is presented. DSCs were fabricated on conducting glass substrates that were patterned by laser ablation of the fluorine-doped tin oxide coating to form parallel <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> separated by uncontacted strips of the same width. The relative collection efficiency was measured {{as a function of}} the gap between the <b>contact</b> <b>strips,</b> which determines the lateral distance traveled by electrons to reach the contacts. To avoid complications arising from nonlinear recombination kinetics, current measurements were performed using small amplitude perturbations of the electron density close to open circuit and the maximum power point to minimize electron density gradients in the film. One and two-dimensional solutions of the continuity equation for electron transport and back reaction predict that the relative collection efficiency should fall as spacing between the <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> exceeds the electron diffusion length and electrons are lost by back electron transfer during transit to the contacts. Measurements of the relative collection efficiency were fitted to the predicted dependence of the collection efficiency on the spacing between the <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> to obtain the value of the electron diffusion length. The diffusion length is found to increase with voltage both at open circuit and at the maximum power point...|$|R

Amongst these parts is the carbon <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> which is brushing the overhead line. The life length of this <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> is very dependent of the external conditions, especially weather and temperature. During the colder months of the year, ice and frost occur in the catenary system creating electric arc discharges. These electric arcs cause great damage to the <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> and complicate maintenance service.

40|$|With the {{increase}} of the speed in the railway operation, a particular care {{has to be addressed}} to the interaction between pantograph and catenary: the variation of contact force and, consequently, the contact loss probability increases. The contact between pantograph and catenary is an electromechanical contact and when a contact loss occurs electrical arcing phenomena arise. One of the most important effects of arcing phenomenon is {{the increase}} of wear for both contact wire and <b>contact</b> <b>strip.</b> The monitoring of contact force between pantograph and catenary in the high frequency range (up to values greater than 100 Hz) should be useful to put in evidence problems on the pantograph-catenary interface.

Today, condition-based maintenance systems are focused on data collection and custom-made rule based systems for data analysis. In many cases, {{the focus is on}} measuring "everything" without considering how to use the measurements. In addition, the measurements are often noisy and the future is unpredictable which adds a lot of uncertainty.
