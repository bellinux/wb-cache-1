5|$|After a brief {{military}} standoff, Constantine confronted {{and defeated}} Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge outside Rome on October 28, 312; Maxentius {{retreated to the}} Tiber river and drowned. Constantine entered the city the next day, but declined {{to take part in}} the traditional ascent up the Capitoline Hill to the Temple of Jupiter. Constantine's army had advanced on Rome under a Christian sign. It had become, officially at least, a Christian army. Constantine's apparent conversion was visible elsewhere, too. Bishops dined at Constantine's table, and many <b>Christian</b> <b>building</b> projects began soon after his victory. On November 9, 312, the old headquarters of the Imperial Horse Guard were razed to make way for the Lateran Basilica. Under Constantine's rule, Christianity became the prime focus of official patronage.|$|E
5|$|As {{was often}} the case with Celtic churches from this period, the church was {{associated}} with a well. It was built by the monks of Penmon and was believed to have healing powers by some people visiting it. It {{is probably one of the}} oldest buildings in Penmon. It has been said that the lower stone walls near the well were part of Seiriol's church in the 6th century; if so, this would make it the oldest remaining <b>Christian</b> <b>building</b> in Wales. A small chamber surrounds the well. In modern times, water from the well has been used as a symbol of Anglesey by the island's representatives at the launch ceremony of the 10th International Island Games (held in Guernsey in June 2003) and the 11th Island Games (held in the Shetland Islands in July 2005).|$|E
25|$|The Victoria Church, {{which stands}} in the {{northeast}} of the site, below the Temple of Saturn, is the only <b>Christian</b> <b>building</b> that has been so far excavated at Dougga. At {{the end of the}} 4th century CE or {{at the start of the}} 5th century, the Christian community erected the unusually designed little church in a pagan cemetery. The small hypogeum is located nearby.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, {{the church}} sold its house {{and bought the}} three lots on East 69th Street. Two of the {{existing}} houses were demolished to clear a site for the church; the one that remained was renovated {{for use as a}} parsonage. Emery Roth, a Hungarian immigrant from Gálszécs, was retained to design the new building. It was only his second religious building, and the only <b>Christian</b> <b>building</b> ever for Roth, who designed several synagogues in the city. Since he was Jewish, it is likely that he was chosen for his familiarity with Hungarian vernacular architecture and close ties with the Hungarian community.|$|E
500|$|The {{church is}} in a churchyard in [...] "a remote rural location" [...] on Anglesey, Wales, about [...] {{from the county}} town of Llangefni, {{at the side of}} a small road between Gwalchmai and Llynfaes. The date of first {{construction}} of a <b>Christian</b> <b>building</b> at this location is unknown. The parish takes its name from Twrog, a saint who lived in the late 5th and early 6th centuries, to whom the church is dedicated: the Welsh word [...] means [...] "abode" [...] or [...] "dwelling", and [...] "-wrog" [...] is a modified form of the saint's name – i.e. [...] "Twrog's dwelling". One of his brothers, St Gredifael, is commemorated in another Anglesey church, St Gredifael's Church, Penmynydd.|$|E
500|$|The date of {{construction}} of the first <b>Christian</b> <b>building</b> on this site is unknown. [...] The church is dedicated to St Caian, a Christian from the 5th or 6th century, about whom little is known. [...] One manuscript says {{that his father was}} St Caw, a king in northern Britain who lost his lands and sought safety in Anglesey, where the ruler Maelgwn Gwynedd gave him land in the north-east of the island, the district known as Twrcelyn. If Caian was a son of St Caw, then his sisters included St Cwyllog, who established the nearby church of St Cwyllog, Llangwyllog, in the 6th century. Other manuscripts say that he was active in the 5th century and was a son or grandson of Brychan, a king from south Wales.|$|E

50|$|Within the Qrendi {{countryside}} one {{can find}} the Maqluba doline, an enormous sinkhole that occurred during a storm in 1343. According to legend a small chapel existed at the time, which must make {{it one of the}} oldest surviving <b>Christian</b> <b>buildings</b> in Malta.|$|R
500|$|The {{date of the}} {{original}} foundation of a <b>Christian</b> <b>building</b> at this location is unclear, although one 19th-century writer {{said that it is}} supposed that a church was first established here in about 605. No part of a building from that period survives; the walls of the present structure have been said (by the 19th-century clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones) to be [...] "probably not older than the fifteenth century". Some restoration took place in 1812. The building was again restored, and a new roof added, in the late 19th century. [...] The work was funded by Lord Stanley of Alderley, a convert to Islam and patron of the church, whose donations to rural churches carried the requirement that Islamic detail should be included in any restoration work. [...] At St Peirio's, the windows have geometric patterns of small panes of coloured glass as a result. The same condition was imposed by him for the work carried out in 1867 nearby at St Mary's Church, Bodewryd.|$|E
500|$|Penmon is a promontory, {{village and}} ecclesiastical parish on the {{south-east}} {{tip of the}} Isle of Anglesey in Wales, about [...] east {{of the town of}} Beaumaris. [...] It is in the community of Llangoed. [...] The name comes from [...] (which can mean [...] "head", [...] "end" [...] or [...] "promontory") and Môn, which is the Welsh word for Anglesey. [...] It is the site of a historic monastery and associated 12th-century church. Walls near the well next to the church may be part of the oldest remaining <b>Christian</b> <b>building</b> in Wales. Penmon also has an award-winning beach and the Anglesey Coastal Path follows its shores. Quarries in Penmon have provided stone for many important buildings and structures, including Birmingham Town Hall and the two bridges that cross the Menai Strait. The area is popular with locals and visitors alike for its monuments, tranquillity, bracing air and fine views of Snowdonia to the south across the Menai Strait.|$|E
