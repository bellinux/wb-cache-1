40|$|Background: Epidural {{parturition}} analgesia (EPA) {{is commonly}} employed technique of providing pain relief during labour. The newer form of low-dose intermittent EPA {{has been in}} the recent studies presented as solid, according to parturitient’s wish. The main goal of our review was to strenghten the influence of this form of EPA on <b>continuation,</b> <b>mode</b> and outcome of labour. Methods: We have retrospectively analysed all the labours in years 2005 and 2006 in nulliparous women in labour at term with the head presentation of fetus. They were divided in two groups – with and without EPA. Analgetic mixture of EPA contained 0. 1 % bupivacain and 2 µg of phentanyl/mL of local anesthetic. Main features of parturitients, duration of labour and outcomes of labour on mother and newborn were compared. We have excluded all labours with fetal breech presentation, multiple pregnancies, elective caesarean sections and all labours finished before 37 th week of pregnancy. Results: In nulliparous women with low-dose intermittent EPA labour was a bit longer and often finished with vacuum extraction. However level of caesarean sections was unchanged. In comparision with group without EPA the outcomes in newborns were not essentially different. Conclusions: Use of low-dose intermittent EPA is acceptable and safe method of decreasing the labour pains, ensuring good outcomes in mother and newborn despite higher risk. </p...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the existence of}} gravitational critical phenomena in higher dimensional electrovac bubble spacetimes. To this end, we study linear fluctuations about families of static, homogeneous spherically symmetric bubble spacetimes in Kaluza-Klein theories coupled to a Maxwell field. We prove that these solutions are linearly unstable and posses a unique unstable mode with a growth rate that is universal {{in the sense that}} it is independent of the family considered. Furthermore, by a double analytical <b>continuation</b> this <b>mode</b> can be seen to correspond to marginally stable stationary modes of perturbed black strings whose periods are integer multiples of the Gregory-Laflamme critical length. This allow us to rederive recent results about the behavior of the critical mass for large dimensions and to generalize them to the charged black string case.

40|$|Mixed mode (I+III) loading induces {{segmented}} crack front échelon structures {{connected by}} steps. We study this instability {{in a highly}} deformable, strain-hardening material. We find that échelons develop beyond a finite, size-independent mode mixity threshold, markedly growing with energy release rate. They appear via nucleation of localized helical front distortions, and their emergence is the <b>continuation</b> of the <b>mode</b> I cross-hatching instability of gels and rubbers, shifted by the biasing effect of shear. This result, {{at odds with the}} direct bifurcation predicted by linear elastic fracture mechanics, can be assigned to the controlling role of elastic nonlinearity...|$|R
40|$|In China {{ideology}} {{has played}} an important role in the research and teaching of the biological sciences since the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC). After the 1978 reforms, it was recognized that the discontinuation of political interference with the sciences was essential for their survival and development. However, not much later, when the fields of genetics and molecular biology became redefined as life sciences, internationally, bioethical regulation became an essential element of research regulation. The evolution of medical textbooks in the PRC reflects this. Using the cases of human cloning and human embryonic stem cell research, this article shows how science regulation incorporates cultural and political ideologies. These, on the one hand, form a <b>continuation</b> of <b>modes</b> of state propaganda and, on the other hand, embody newly formulated notions of Chinese society. This article provides a historical background of the role of ideology during the first decades of the PRC, after which it discusses the evolution of bioethical discussion of human cloning and human embryonic stem cell research in 17 medical textbooks over nine years (1996 - 2005). It concludes with a discussion on the changing role of ideology in bioethical policy-making for the life sciences...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of oscillatory flows over compliant surfaces is studied analytically and numerically. The type of compliant surfaces studied is the incompressible viscoelastic gel model. The stability is determined using the Floquet analysis, where amplitude of perturbations at time intervals separated by one time period is examined {{to determine whether}} perturbations grow or decay. Oscillatory flows pas viscoelastic gels exhibit an instability {{in the limit of}} zero Reynolds number, and the transition amplitude of the oscillatory velocity increases with the frequency of oscillations. The transition amplitude has a minimum at a finite wavenumber for the viscoelastic gel model. The instability is found to depend strongly on the gel viscosity eta (g), and the effect of oscillations on the <b>continuation</b> of viscous <b>modes</b> at intermediate Reynolds number shows a complicated dependence on the oscillation frequency. Experimental studies are carried out on the {{stability of}} an oscillatory flow past a viscoelastic gel at zero Reynolds number, and these confirm the theoretical predictions...|$|R
5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online {{gameplay}} was made available for players who had a Sony Network Adapter and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances.. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a <b>continuation</b> of MyCareer <b>Mode</b> in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature.|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of oscillatory flows over compliant surfaces is studied analytically and numerically. The types of compliant surfaces studied are the spring backed wall model, which permits tangential {{motion of the}} surface, and the incompressible viscoelastic gel model. The stability is determined using the Floquet analysis, where amplitude of perturbations at time intervals separated by one time period is examined to determine whether perturbations grow or decay. The oscillatory flows past both the spring backed wall model and the viscoelastic gel model exhibit an instability {{in the limit of}} zero Reynolds number, and the transition amplitude of the oscillatory velocity increases with the frequency of oscillations. The transition amplitude has a minimum at zero wave number for the spring backed plate model, whereas the minimum occurs at finite wavenumber for the viscoelastic gel model. For the spring backed plate model, it is shown that the instability due to steady mean flow and the purely oscillatory instability reinforce each other, and the regions of instability are mapped in the (Λ-A) plane, where Λ is the steady strain rate and A is the oscillatory strain rate. For the viscoelastic gel model, the instability is found to depend strongly on the gel viscosity η_g, and the effect of oscillations on the <b>continuation</b> of viscous <b>modes</b> at intermediate Reynolds number shows a complicated dependence on the oscillation frequency.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of avoided crossings (level repulsion) in phononic crystals and suggest a computationally efficient strategy to distinguish them from normal cross points. This process {{is essential for the}} correct sorting of the phononic bands and, subsequently, for the accurate determination of <b>mode</b> <b>continuation,</b> group velocities, and emergent properties which depend on them such as thermal conductivity. Through explicit phononic calculations using generalized Rayleigh quotient, we identify exact locations of exceptional points in the complex wavenumber domain which results in level repulsion in the real domain. We show that {{in the vicinity of the}} exceptional point the relevant phononic eigenvalue surfaces resemble the surfaces of a 2 by 2 parameter-dependent matrix. Along a closed loop encircling the exceptional point we show that the phononic eigenvalues are exchanged, just as they are for the 2 by 2 matrix case. However, the behavior of the associated eigenvectors is shown to be more complex in the phononic case. Along a closed loop around an exceptional point, we show that the eigenvectors can flip signs multiple times unlike a 2 by 2 matrix where the flip of sign occurs only once. Finally, we exploit these eigenvector sign flips around exceptional points to propose a simple and efficient method of distinguishing them from normal crosses and of correctly sorting the band-structure. Our proposed method is roughly an order-of magnitude faster than the zoom-in method and correctly identifies > 97 % of the cases considered. Both its speed and accuracy can be further improved and we suggest some ways of achieving this. Our method is general and, as such, would be directly applicable to other eigenvalue problems where the eigenspectrum needs to be correctly sorted...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} explores {{whether the}} intrinsic spatial surplus {{of the post}} - war, detached dwellings and low-density, dispersed residential neighbo urhoods in Flanders, holds potential for transformation in line with con temporary housing standards and demands. This work adopted an architectu ral approach in order to investigate the feasibility of transformative s trategies. Hence, it forms one of three complementary tracks of the FWO funded project Large, Underused Dwellings in Flanders, {{and is based on}} t ypological and design-based research, whereas the other two tracks have respectively studied the shared problem from a geographical and a discur sive perspective. This doctoral project has also taken on a second goal which is to frame such design-based enquiry in an academic context. As m ain source for data gathering throughout the entire project, 10 municipa lities across Flanders, with a significant share of detached dwellings, were selected as case studies. About 80 % of the Flemish housing stock consists of single family houses, of which 42 % are detached dwellings. Many of these were built on spacio us lots in a semi-rural or suburban environment during the massive subur banisation process which was started after the Second World War. The det ached dwelling in a semi-rural, green environment has been a key buildin g stone in this process, and is still perceived as the ideal housing sit uation by many Flemings. The structure of small-scale ownership ensures continuity, and the system facilitates incremental infill of empty lots and retrofitting existing dwellings. This housing model and its mode of production can however be seen as problematical, because they no longer match demographical and socio-economic developments. The ageing populati on, and the decreasing average household size, result in a demand for ot her residential typologies: smaller, more compact, and preferably closer to urbanised cores. Moreover, academic researchers, spatial planners an d designers associate the <b>continuation</b> of this <b>mode</b> of spatial productio n with high emission levels, traffic congestion and loss of open space. Hence there is an emerging interest in, and a need for, alternative mode ls and strategies of transformation. The main body of the work is preceded by an exploration of designerly re search, which emerged as a methodology proper to architectural research. Chapter two describes how different approaches to designerly research a re used in practice and academia, sharing the goal to address inert and ill-defined problems. A theoretical framework for exchange between scien tific and design-based methodologies, allowing the development of transd isciplinary modes of enquiry into ill-defined problems is proposed. Cons equentially, the thesis develops such a process of exchange. Complementa ry research approaches build on tentative observations and results, and contribute to the understanding of design strategies intervening in the residential environment on different scale levels. The viewpoints of inh abitants of detached dwellings regarding potential adaptive strategies a re presented in chapter three. In chapter four, the viewpoints of inhabi tants are complemented with a typological analysis of a sample of 65 dwe llings documented during field work, in order to determine potential and resistance vis-à-vis transformative concepts on the scale of the dwelli ng. Chapter five enquires how professional actors involve the detached d welling and potential design strategies for transformation in their work. A site- and case specific design approach is explored in chapter six, based on a workshop with students in interior architecture and architect ure. The workshop investigated plausible conditions and narratives to im plement transformative design concepts on the level of the dwelling. The thesis concludes by reviewing these diverse perspectives, addressing th e paradoxes and alliances which are exposed, and outlines how these prot otypical strategies could impact concrete municipalities. This analysis informs the formulation of three visions on transformation of low densit y residential environments, combining the strategies of reconfiguration (the retrofitting of existing dwellings) replacement (demolishing existi ng dwellings and replacing these with alternative dwelling types on site) and removal (the demolition of dwellings in remote locations followed by densification in more central areas). These visions outline potential evolutions towards differentiation and densification of Flemish residen tial neighbourhoods. status: publishe...|$|R
