5000|$|The Kawasaki W1 {{is based}} {{heavily on the}} post-war, pre-unit construction, 650cc vertical-twin BSA A7 design {{inherited}} from Meguro, but as time passed, the Kawasaki and BSA designs diverged. [...] The BSA A10 (aka Rocket) engine is an undersquare design with a 73 mm bore and an 84 mm stroke, whereas the W1 inherited its 72.6 mm stroke from the K2 engine, adding displacement by increasing {{the size of its}} bore to 74 mm. This slightly oversquare (i.e., short-stroke) design favors higher engine speeds, while reducing stresses on the crankshaft. In addition, the new W1 had a one-piece pressed <b>crankshaft</b> <b>assembly</b> with ball bearings and one-piece connecting rods with needle bearings, significant improvements over the earlier BSA (and Meguro) engines that used plain insert type bearings and two-piece connecting rods. Even though the BSA and Kawasaki 650cc engines were mechanically different from each other, visually they gave very much the same impression.|$|E
50|$|With {{help from}} Norton {{motorcycle}} racer Don Evans, Devin adapted the cylinder barrels, cylinder heads and pistons from the Norton Manx motorcycle to the two-cylinder boxer Panhard crankcase, roller-bearing <b>crankshaft</b> <b>assembly</b> and piston rods. He then fabricated a custom manifold that accepted two-barrel side-draft Weber carburetors. All of these alterations {{did not affect}} the displacement of the engine, leaving the 79.5mm bore and 75mm stroke unchanged for a total displacement of 745cc. What made the engine unique was the method Devin used to operate the valves. He abandoned the Panhard's pushrod OHV system and contacted the L. H. Gilmer company about using their toothed belts to drive the Manx cylinder heads' overhead cams. Development of synchronous toothed-belts was begun by the Gilmer company around 1940. Their primary application had been as a means of transmitting power in textile mills. Devin's use of the technology to drive the valve train in the Devin-Panhard engine was the first time toothed belts were used in a timing belt application. Devin did not apply for a patent on this innovation.|$|E

40|$|Assembling rotor with {{crankshaft}} of a hermetic {{reciprocating compressor}} is, normally, heating of the rotor and then {{putting it into}} <b>crankshaft.</b> This <b>assembly</b> method allows larger magnitude of interference between rotor and crankshaft. Tolerance band of crankshaft could be relaxed and facilitate the process, however, the process requires heating equipment and higher energy consumption, obviously, this will increase the manufacturing cost of the compressor.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Present {{research}} work pertains to development a rotating cylinder valve mechanism and eliminating the poppet valve mechanism for a four stroke engine. The present mechanism overcomes the various drawbacks of poppet valves viz., reduced efficiency- {{part of the}} energy generated in IC engine is taken to operate poppet valve mechanism thus reducing the efficiency, more number of parts to operate poppet valve and extra manufacturing, maintenance and handling due to additional parts thus incurring additional cost. The valve mechanism consists of rotating cylinder fitted with a bevel gear {{at the bottom and}} has floating seals for the valves. Overall the camless rotating cylinder (CRC) engine offers quite simple and rugged construction; it consists of a piston, connecting rod and <b>crankshaft</b> <b>assembly</b> (including flywheel and crown gear) and a rotating cylinder assembly. Thing which distinguishes the CRC engine from the conventional engine is the use of less number of parts, and all the other differences come {{as a result of the}} above stated.

50|$|Over time engine {{development}} has continually advanced {{in almost all}} areas from material, operation and function. Many of the advances were led by the Japanese manufacturers as they have made quality and durability the cornerstone of their programs. The Japanese advanced the proliferation of forged <b>crankshafts</b> with rotating <b>assemblies</b> at 0 gram balance. Forged crankshafts are much stronger, significantly less apt to exhibit detrimental torsional crankshaft movement which also mitigates harmonic frequencies. This progression has also seen the addition of forged rods and pistons initially in forced induction engines and more recently in normally aspirated engines. Adding these additional forged components ramps the engines rigidity reducing concern about crankshaft damage even further. With the advent of computer aided design and finite element analysis manufacturers can now find and re-engineer weaker areas. Regardless {{of some of these}} improvements certain engines like the traditional V8 which has a firing order by nature prone to excessive harmonics necessitating the use of this device. The flat plane V8, traditionally used in more exotic engines, does not suffer from the excessive harmonics and therefore may use a solid undampened device. Modern (roughly 1988+) DOHC, SOHC Flat 4, I4, Flat 6, I6, V6, Flat 8, Flat Plane V8 have no need for this device. Over the years many of these engines use solid cast iron or aluminum crank pulley or audible NVH damper (reducing engine noise heard in the occupant compartment). Audible NVH has been the biggest factor in OE manufacturer decisions throughout the vehicle. In addition the pulleys on these engines are mounted loosely with a location fit negating any potential to act as an engine protective damper. Continental has recently provided detailed information on the maximum acceptable noise (NVH) that should be heard from under the hood from the engine in their Elite Belt program http://www.thequietbelt.com/#the-art-of-silence.|$|R
40|$|This Low Friction (High Efficiency Roller Bearing) Engine (LFE) report {{presents}} {{the work done}} by The Timken Company to conduct a technology demonstration {{of the benefits of}} replacing hydrodynamic bearings with roller bearings in the <b>crankshaft</b> and camshaft <b>assemblies</b> of an internal combustion engine for the purpose of collecting data sufficient to prove merit. The engines in the present study have been more extensively converted to roller bearings than any previous studies (40 needle roller bearings per engine) to gain understanding of the full potential of application of bearing technology. The project plan called for comparative testing of a production vehicle which was already respected for having demonstrated low engine friction levels with a rollerized version of that engine. Testing was to include industry standard tests for friction, emissions and fuel efficiency conducted on instrumented dynamometers. Additional tests for fuel efficiency, cold start resistance and other measures of performance were {{to be made in the}} actual vehicle. Comparative measurements of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH), were planned, although any work to mitigate the suspected higher NVH level in the rollerized engine was beyond the scope of this project. Timken selected the Toyota Avalon with a 3. 5 L V- 6 engine as the test vehicle. In an attempt to minimize cost and fabrication time, a ‘made-from’ approach was proposed in which as many parts as possible would be used or modified from production parts to create the rollerized engine. Timken commissioned its test partner, FEV Engine Technology, to do a feasibility study in which they confirmed that using such an approach was possible to meet the required dimensional restrictions and tolerances. In designing the roller bearing systems for the crank and cam trains, Timken utilized as many production engine parts as possible. The crankshafts were produced from production line forgings, which use Timken steel, modified with special machining and heat treatment. Timken designed and manufactured all of the roller bearing related components such as the thrust bearing package. The production connecting rods and camshafts could not be used for the roller bearing engine, so new ones were produced according to the team’s designs using Timken steel. The remaining miscellaneous components were designed and procured by FEV. Timken prepared a display version of the crankshaft portion of the production engine without connecting rods which could be driven by a motor through a cogged-belt and electrically actuated clutch arrangement. A modified version was also made in which the engine was outfitted with roller bearings on the main bearing positions. Preliminary tests showed that the rollerized engine was running with 1 / 3 less friction than the standard display engine. Additional friction testing and noise characterization was cut short because of shipping damage to the rollerized engine display and because of other project priorities. The team did successfully demonstrate the ability to package roller bearings satisfactorily in numerous locations in a typical automotive engine. The scope of this project did not include durability demonstration and that subject would have to be addressed in any follow-on work. In the actual test phase, the rollerized engine did show significantly less friction in motored dynamometer tests compared to its production equivalent. The 5 - 10 % improvement measured in this study was about half that seen in other studies. However, the fired test results did not show a reduction in friction which did not match prior experience or expectations. Subsequent teardown and inspection of the rollerized engine revealed potential sources of excessive friction in the experimental application. These features would be eliminated in a design not based on modification of production parts. The team is confident (based on experience) that friction reduction would be realized with proper modifications...|$|R
