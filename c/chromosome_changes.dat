5000|$|Early in her career, Dr. Bloomfield {{focused on}} the study of {{chromosome}} abnormalities in cancers of the hematopoietic system (leukemias and lymphomas). She and her co-workers identified several novel <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> in leukemia and lymphoma, and discovered that these abnormalities are among the most important factors that determine a patient's prognosis. For example, Dr Bloomfield was involved in the discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). [...] She was also involved in describing the rearrangement of chromosome 16q22 in acute myeloid leukemia.|$|E

50|$|Historically, when {{sequencing}} eukaryotic genomes (such as {{the worm}} Caenorhabditis elegans) {{it was common}} to first map the genome to provide a series of landmarks across the genome. Rather than sequence a chromosome in one go, it would be sequenced piece by piece (with the prior knowledge of approximately where that piece {{is located on the}} larger <b>chromosome).</b> <b>Changes</b> in technology and in particular improvements to the processing power of computers, means that genomes can now be 'shotgun sequenced' in one go (there are caveats to this approach though when compared to the traditional approach).|$|E
50|$|Array CGH {{has proven}} to be a specific, sensitive, fast and highthroughput technique, with {{considerable}} advantages compared to other methods used for the analysis of DNA copy number changes making it more amenable to diagnostic applications. Using this method, copy number changes at a level of 5-10 kilobases of DNA sequences can be detected. , even high-resolution CGH (HR-CGH) arrays are accurate to detect structural variations (SV) at resolution of 200 bp. This method allows one to identify new recurrent <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> such as microdeletions and duplications in human conditions such as cancer and birth defects due to chromosome aberrations.|$|E

40|$|This review has {{provided}} {{an update on}} current progress in identifying recurring sites of <b>chromosome</b> <b>change</b> in human malignant melanoma. Despite methodologic difficulties, a recurring and decidedly nonrandom pattern of <b>chromosome</b> <b>change</b> is beginning to emerge for this neoplasia. It appears most reasonable to suggest that as {{an increasing number of}} cases of melanoma are cytogenetically examined, the stratification of patients into defined subgroups based upon specific chromosome abnormalities will be possible. At present, the clinical utility of chromosome analysis in malignant melanoma is indeterminate. However, the pinpointing of regions of the genome which are characteristically altered in this tumor may be of significant benefit in targeting future molecular (and hopefully mechanistic) investigations. Continued study of the basic genetics of malignant melanoma would appear a particularly fruitful avenue to continue and it assuredly will add {{to our understanding of the}} causation, progression, and ultimately the control of this disorder...|$|R
50|$|A {{specific}} {{chromosome rearrangement}} {{is also found}} in patients with CML, among the 46 chromosomes in human cells. Part of chromosome nine breaks off and attaches itself to chromosome 22, meaning there is an exchange of genetic material between chromosomes 9 and 22. The rearrangement of the <b>chromosomes</b> <b>changes</b> the positions and functions of certain genes, which causes uncontrolled cell growth.|$|R

50|$|Structural {{variation}} {{is an important}} type of human genetic variation that contributes to phenotypic diversity. There are microscopic and submicroscopic structural variants which include deletions, duplications, and large copy number variants as well as insertions, inversions, and translocations. These are several different types of structural variants in the human genome and they are quite distinctive from each other. A translocation is a chromosomal rearrangement, at the inter- or intra-chromosomal level, where a section of a <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> position but with {{no change in the}} whole DNA content. A Section of DNA that is larger than 1 kb and occurs in two or more copies per haploid genome, in which the different copies share greater than 90% of the same sequence, are considered to be segmental duplications or low-copy repeats. These are {{only a few of the}} several different types of structural variants that have been known to exist in the human genome. A table visualizing these different forms of structural variants, as well as others, is shown in Figure 1.|$|E
40|$|WHEREAS metaphases {{from the}} same tumour {{commonly}} show similarities indicating a clonal relationship (Atkin, 1967), the <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> vary greatly from tumour to tumour. There are indications, however, {{that they are not}} entirely at random: malignant tumours at some sites, e. g. the ovary, tend to have similar marker chromosomes and there is a general tendency for some chromosome groups to be under-represented and others over-represented. Although less extensively studied, precancerous lesions also show variable <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes,</b> e. g. in the cervix uteri (Auersperg, Corey and Worth...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal {{abnormalities}} are {{a frequent}} concomitant of neoplasia, {{and although it}} is tempting to relate these mutations and alterations in chromatin (DNA) function to cancer, their relationship to the initiation or progression of carcinogenesis is unknown. Mammalian cells in culture, after interacting with chemical carcinogens, often exhibit chromosome damage consisting of breaks and exchanges of chromatid material. The pattern of damage of banded metaphases indicates that negative bands are especially vulnerable to the action of chemical carcinogens, probably because of differential chromatin condensation. Damage to individual chromosomes may be random or nonrandom, depending on the species. Cell death can be correlated with chromatid alterations that occur shortly after treatment with chemical carcinogens. There is also a correlation between mutagenic and carcinogenic activity of some chemical carcinogens and the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges. The question of whether specific <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> are absolutely required for neoplastic transformation cannot be answered because of conflicting data and diverse results from studies even with known carcinogens. Cell transformation may occur without any visible <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes.</b> A universal specific numerical or visible structural chromosomal alteration is not necessarily associated with chemical or viral transformation. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> are independent of the etiologic agents: different carcinogens may produce transformation associated with the same abnormal chromosomes, but not all transformed lines invariably exhibit the same abnormality, even with the same chemical. In some species, chromosome having nucleolar organizer regions may be more frequently involved in numerical or structural deviations. Progressively growing tumors also may occur {{as a result of the}} proliferation of transformed cells without detectable <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes,</b> indicating that tumorigenicity need not be related to an imbalance of chromosome number or structure. Our studies indicate that <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> are not essential for establishment of neoplasms but that karyotypic instability may result in response to selective growth pressures...|$|E

40|$|Sarcomatoid renal {{carcinoma}} (SRC) is {{an uncommon}} and highly malignant renal tumor with sarcomatous morphology or with both sarcomatous and carcinomatous components. The tumors are generally {{referred to as}} dedifferentiated or transformed renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Information on their genomic changes is scarce. Data from a cytogenetic study of four cases of SRC are presented in this article. Combined with a few other cases from the literature, it appears that genomic changes in most cases of SRC {{have little in common}} with those characterizing conventional RCC. Sarcomatoid transformation thus may occur occasionally in RCC without the characteristic <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> but also, and perhaps more frequently, in a subgroup of RCC without the characteristic <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes.</b> status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|There are {{concerns}} about {{the health effects of}} formaldehyde exposure, including carcinogenicity, in light of elevated indoor air levels in new homes and occupational exposures experienced by workers in health care, embalming, manufacturing, and other industries. Epidemiologic studies suggest that formaldehyde exposure is associated with an increased risk of leukemia. However, the biological plausibility of these findings has been questioned because limited information is available on the ability of formaldehyde to disrupt hematopoietic function. Our objective was to determine if formaldehyde exposure disrupts hematopoietic function and produces leukemia-related <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> in exposed humans. We examined the ability of formaldehyde to disrupt hematopoiesis in a study of 94 workers in China (43 exposed to formaldehyde and 51 frequency-matched controls) by measuring complete blood counts and peripheral stem/progenitor cell colony formation. Further, myeloid progenitor cells, the target for leukemogenesis, were cultured from the workers to quantify the level of leukemia-specific <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes,</b> including monosomy 7 and trisomy 8, in metaphase spreads of these cells. Among exposed workers, peripheral blood cell counts were significantly lowered {{in a manner consistent with}} toxic effects on the bone marrow and leukemia-specific <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> were significantly elevated in myeloid blood progenitor cells. These findings suggest that formaldehyd...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Chromosome banding {{techniques}} {{have been used}} in a large-scale survey of karyo-typic variation within and between the chromosomal races of the Gehyra variegata-punctata species group. A total of nine chromosome races are now known among these taxa. G-banding confirms that the principal mode of <b>chromosome</b> <b>change</b> is centric fusion and, in most cases, allowed the specific chromosomes involved to be identified. The location of C-band heterochromatin and the nucleolar organizing region varied within and between the races. In two of the chromosome forms, heteromorphic sex chromosomes were observed {{in the early stages of}} evolution. The cytogenetic characters were evaluated and then used to construct a phylogeny for these taxa. The types of <b>chromosome</b> <b>change</b> between the races and their geographic relationships were then considered to examine the role of chromosomal mechanisms of speciation in these gekkos. The previously suggested role of single centric fusions as initiators of speciation in Gehyra requires further evaluation. In one case, an unusual form of tandem fusion has been established and this race is clearly reproductively isolated from all others. The presence of monobrachial homology between the biarmed chromosomes of some taxa suggests that a distinct mode of chromosomal speciation may also be important in Gehyra.

40|$|It is now common {{knowledge}} that two types of genetic instability, microsatellite instabilty (13 % of cancers) and chromosome instability (87 % of cancers), substantially contribute to the sequential accumulation of genetic alterations leading to cancer. Aneuploidy, a mirror of chromosome instability, characterizes a subgroup of follicular thyroid lesions, often associated with oncocytic features, which show simple trisomy 7 or trisomy 7 accompained by additional polysomies, accumulating according to an evolutionary scheme which parallels the progression from hyperplasia to carcinoma. In order to: a) verify the possibility of recognizing numerical <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> in thyroid cells prior to surgical resection, b) establish the frequency of nodules with numerical chromsome changes prior to surgery selection and c) to confirm the association between aneuploidy and mithocondria accumulation, cells from the thyroid nodules of 108 patients undergoing echo-guided FNAB were investigated, using Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) with centromeric probes specific for chromosomes 7 and 17, and immunofluorescence and FISH (FICTION), using anti-mitochondrion antibody. Numerical <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> for chromosome 7 and/or 17 were found in cells from 8 nodules (4 with oncocytic features), and chromosome 7 and 17 heterozygous centromeric fusion was observed in 1 nodule. All cytological specimens were classified as suspicious. Six of them were subsequently surgically removed (4 carcinomas, 2 adenomas) and <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> were confirmed in nuclei from fresh (touch preparations) or fixed (paraffin embedded) surgical material of 5 cases. CONCLUSIONS. Our data demonstrate the possibilty of performing FISH and FICTION experiments on cells from FNAB material, indicate that 7. 4 % of nodules subjected to echo-guided FNAB were associated with numerical <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes,</b> and, finally, confirmed that trisomy 7 alone or accompained by other chromosomes gains is present in oncocytic cells.
