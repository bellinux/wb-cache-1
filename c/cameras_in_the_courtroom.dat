2500|$|During {{the opening}} {{weeks of the}} trial, the {{prosecution}} presented evidence that Simpson {{had a history of}} physically abusing Nicole. Simpson's lawyer Alan Dershowitz argued that {{only a tiny fraction of}} women who are abused by their mates are murdered. Within days after the start of the trial, lawyers and those viewing the trial from a single closed-circuit TV <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> saw an emerging pattern: continual and countless interruptions with objections from both sides of <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> as well as one [...] "sidebar" [...] conference after another with the judge, beyond earshot of the unseen jury located just below and out of the camera's frame.|$|R

He {{has begun to}} plot many schemes to reach to the jury. He planned to get to Millie Dupree through blackmailing her husband through a tape that has him trying to bribe an official. He reaches to Lonnie Shaver through convincing a company to buy his employer and convince him through orientation. He also tries to reach Rikki Coleman through a blackmail of revealing her abortion to her husband.

At the conclusion of the trial, New York State Supreme Court Justice Vincent Del Guidice sentenced Gelman to 200 years in prison, telling Gelman, [...] "You are a violent sociopath."

They initiated surveys and drafted legislation, such as the fair housing bill submitted to <b>the</b> state legislature <b>in</b> 1965. In 1960 and 1963, he was named to the Governor's Commission on Constitutional Revision. They were tasked with [...] "drafting of the actual texts of suitable constitutional amendments, the publicizing of their purpose and the promotion of their adoption." [...] Among the notable changes that resulted was the increase of the term for governor from two years to four years beginning in 1970. In 1970, {{he was appointed}} by Chief Justice E.

50|$|As judge {{during the}} Anna Nicole Smith body custody hearing, Judge Seidlin made one-liners and other {{attempts}} at humor which some {{who know him}} said was normal for him, but led to speculation that his actions and comments were for the <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> and were made {{as an attempt to}} secure a courtroom television show similar to Judge Judy's. The judgment was given in what some have viewed as an overly theatrical style, with the Judge weeping and fumbling his words, though others close to him have said that his courtroom conduct was genuine.|$|E

50|$|The {{trial was}} moved to Orange County after a New York State appeals court ruled that a change of venue was {{necessary}} to ensure Porco received a fair trial because of the intense pre-trial media coverage in the Albany area. Orange County criminal court justice Judge Jeffrey G. Berry, {{who presided over the}} trial, allowed still <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> during proceedings, a rarity in New York State, which gives judges great discretion over the electronic recording of cases. The judge did allow videotaping of the summations of both defense and prosecution lawyers. The announcement of the verdict was also videotaped.|$|E
5000|$|As {{mass media}} {{technology}} advanced {{in the early}} twentieth century, courts began experimenting with allowing photography and radio broadcasts of court proceedings. Following the media [...] "circus" [...] surrounding the trial of Richard Bruno Hauptmann for the Lindbergh kidnapping, broadcasts from federal courtrooms were banned by Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Additionally, the American Bar Association adopted Judicial Canon 35, which prohibited the use of motion or still <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> and was codified into law by the majority of states. On the other hand, no state or federal court prohibited the publication of courtroom sketches and courtroom sketch artistry continued.|$|E

A public trial ensures fairness. That {{is the purpose of}} a public trial. It ensures professionalism by the lawyers and the judge, and a camera in the courtroom protects the defendant’s right to a public trial. Poe also opined that lawyers play to the jury, not to the camera, and that jurors stated they liked the camera inside the courtroom because they wanted the public to know what they heard [...] "instead of waiting to hear a 30-second sound bite from a newscaster {{who may or may not}} have the facts correct." [...] Judge John R. Tunheim opposed the bill, stating that it could deny some defendants a fair trial; e.g. a defendant corporation might forgo its right to a trial because it does not want its president to be cross-examined on television. He also expressed concern that televising trials could increase the incidence of threats against federal judges.|$|E

40|$|The sensational {{trial of}} Richard Bruno Hauptmann for the {{kidnapping}} {{and murder of}} Charles Lindberg’s young son in 1935 marked {{the starting point of}} the debate regarding the propriety of allowing cameras in courtrooms during judicial proceedings. This debate intensified during and following the 1994 - 1997 trial of O. J. Simpson. At issue is how a court must weigh the Sixth Amendment right of the accused to a public trial and the First Amendment right to a free press, as well as its own interest in preserving the dignity and decorum of the courtroom. This paper examines the history, Federal rules, seminal court cases, and California rules concerning <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> in the context of these important Constitutional issues.

40|$|The {{conflict}} between {{freedom of speech}} and the right to a fair trial is hardly new. Hundreds of articles have been written attempting to reconcile the constitutional demand that the defendant receives a fair trial with First Amendment issues posed by pretrial publicity, <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> or the gagging of lawyers who attempt to try their cases in public. In recent years, however, a new face to the conflict has appeared, having to do not with lawyers or the news media, but with the jury. Increasingly, individuals have tried to capitalize on their jury service by selling their perspective on the trial. This practice of 2 ̆ 2 juror journalism 2 ̆ 2 has been criticized by numerous academics and even lambasted by many journalists as threatening the integrity and fairness of the trial. The fear is that the profit motive may affect the juror 2 ̆ 7 s ability to fairly, openly, and without bias deliberate and render a just verdict...|$|E
