40|$|Splenic cysts are {{uncommon}} lesions and {{are classified}} as true or pseudocysts based {{on the presence of}} an epithelial lining. True congenital cysts can be epidermoid, dermoid or endodermoid and require surgery when large, sympthomatic or complicated. Ultrasonography and <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan</b> are useful for diagnosis and serum test for echinococcosis should be done. Several procedures, open or laparoscopic, have been described, with emphasis on the spleen-preserving surgery, when possible.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold: first, we compute quality-adjusted {{measures}} of productivity change for the three most important diagnostic technologies (i. e., the <b>Computerised</b> <b>Tomography</b> <b>Scan,</b> Electrocardiogram and Echocardiogram) in the major Portuguese hospitals. We use the Malmquist–Luenberger index, which allows to measure productivity growth while controlling for the quality of the production. Second, using non-parametric tests, we analyse whether the implementation of the Prospective Payment System may have had a positive impact on the movements of productivity over time. The results show that the PPS has helped hospitals to use these tools more efficiently and to improve their effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|Stereotactic biopsy is {{a common}} minimal access neurosurgical procedure. It {{requires}} a stereotactic frame to be secured on the head, and thereafter, based on <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan</b> markings on the frame, precise biopsy is retrieved.

Case Presentation. A 70 -year-old Caucasian woman was treated with transarterial chemoembolization for advanced hepatocellular, but no cancer control was obtained. A hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy was planned delivering 40 [*]Gy in 5 fractions. A dramatic reduction in alpha-fetoprotein was observed.

40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} of the renal pelvis is a rare neoplasm, often unsuspected clinically due to its rarity and ambiguous clinical and radiological features, and hence patients present at advanced stages resulting in poor prognosis. We report here four cases of incidentally diagnosed primary renal squamous {{cell carcinoma}}, treated at our hospital over a short span of one year, and review the relevant literature. Mean age of the patients (3 males, 1 female) was 60 years. All suffered from staghorn stones. Interestingly, renal carcinoma was unsuspected clinically in all patients. In one case, a <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan</b> showed a suspicious nodule. All underwent nephrectomy for nonfunctioning kidney.

40|$|Introduction: Gas-forming pyogenic liver abscess (GPLA) {{caused by}} C. {{perfringens}} is rare but fatal. Patients with past gastrectomy may {{be prone to}} such infection post-ablation. Presentation of case: An 84 -year-old male patient with past gastrectomy had MW ablation of his liver tumors complicated by GPLA. <b>Computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan</b> showed gas-containing abscess in the liver and he was managed successfully with antibiotic and percutaneous drainage of the abscess. Discussion: C. perfringens GPLA secondary to MW ablation in a patient with previous gastrectomy has not {{been reported in the}} literature. Gastrectomy may predispose to such infection. Even in high-risk patients, empirical antibiotic before ablation is not a standard of practice. Therefore following the procedure, close observation of patients’ conditions is necessary to allow early diagnosis and intervention that will prevent progression of infection. Conclusion: Potential complication of liver abscess following MW ablation can never be overlooked. The risk may be enhanced in patients with previous gastrectomy.

40|$|AbstractMarfan {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant illness of the connective tissue, with typical skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular manifestations. Less frequently, pulmonary involvement occurs, namely spontaneous pneumothorax, which generally is recurrent and occurs in 4 - 11 % of cases. The authors describe a 14 -year-old boy, previously healthy, admitted with a unilateral spontaneous pneumothorax, and clinical phenotype of Marfan syndrome. The subsequent investigation {{led to the}} diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse and dilatation of the root of aorta. Pneumothorax resolved through active drainage and a <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan</b> excluded subpleural blebs.

40|$|Abstract Background Isolated splenic vein {{thrombosis}} with left sided portal hypertension {{is a rare}} cause of upper gastrointestinal bleed. Diagnosis is difficult and requires a high index of suspicion, especially in patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleed {{in the presence of}} splenomegaly and normal liver function tests. Case presentation A 64 year old male presented with haematemesis and melaena. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of antral erosions in the stomach and fundal varices. A <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan</b> of abdomen confirmed the presence of a diaphragmatic tear and the spleen to be lying in the left hemi thorax. The appearances of the splenic vein on the scan were consistent with thrombosis. Conclusion Left sided portal hypertension as a result of isolated splenic {{vein thrombosis}} secondary to trauma is rare. The unusual presentation of our case, splenic herniation into the left hemithorax, causing fundal varices leading to upper gastrointestinal bleed 28 years after the penetrating injury, makes this case most interesting.

40|$|Abstract Background Orlistat is an anti-obesity drug {{licensed}} in the United Kingdom for 7 years. We {{present a}} case of a patient who developed pancreatitis four days after commencing orlistat. Case presentation A 36 year old man presented to hospital with acute severe pancreatitis four days after starting a course of Orlistat, a lipase inhibitor used in the treatment of obesity. A diagnosis of drug related pancreatitis was made by exclusion of other causes of pancreatitis; he was a teetotaller, had a normal serum calcium, had no family history of pancreatitis or hyperlipidaemia, no history of trauma and had no evidence of gallstones on <b>Computerised</b> <b>Tomography</b> <b>scan</b> (CT). Conclusion Orlistat was the only drug that had been started recently and has been associated with pancreatitis previously. We found no case reports of similar cases, however 99 cases of orlistat related pancreatitis have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but no causative link has been found in clinical trials by the drug company.

40|$|Purpose : The pterygopalatine fossa {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex {{anatomical}} regions to understand. It is poorly visualized in cadaveric dissection and most textbooks rely on schematic depictions. We describe our approach to creating a low-cost, 3 D model of the pterygopalatine fossa, including its associated canals and foramina, using an affordable “desktop” 3 D printer. Methods:  We used open source software to create a volume render of the pterygopalatine fossa from axial slices of a head <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan.</b> These data were then exported to a 3 D printer to produce an anatomically accurate model. Results:  The resulting ‘negative space’ model of the pterygopalatine fossa provides a useful and innovative aid for understanding the complex anatomical relationships of the pterygopalatine fossa. Conclusion: This model was designed primarily for medical students; however, it will also be of interest to postgraduates in ENT, ophthalmology, neurosurgery, and radiology.
