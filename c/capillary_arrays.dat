Materials and Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging of a <b>capillary</b> <b>array</b> phantom was performed with imaging parameter changes, including voxel size, number of sensitivity encoding (SENSE) factor, echo time (TE), number of signal acquisitions, b-value, and number of diffusion gradient directions (NDGD), one-at-a-time in a stepwise-incremental fashion. We repeated the entire series of DTI scans thrice. The coefficients of variation (CoV) were evaluated for FA and ADC, and the correlation between each MR imaging parameter and the corresponding FA and ADC was evaluated using Spearman’s correlation analysis. Results: The <b>capillary</b> <b>array</b> phantom CoVs of FA and ADC were 7. 1 % and 2. 4 %, respectively.

The Large Area Picosecond Photodetector (LAPPD) is an MCP based photodetector, capable of imaging, with high {{spatial and temporal}} resolution in a hermetic package with an active area of 400 square centimeters. A key component of LAPPD is a chevron pair of large area (20 x 20 cm) MCPs.

Using our newly developed bottom-up process flow, we have fabricated large area MCPs (8 x 8). We used Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), {{a powerful and}} precise thin film deposition technique, to tailor the electrical resistance and secondary electron emission (SEE) properties of large area, low cost, borosilicate glass <b>capillary</b> <b>arrays.</b> The self limiting growth mechanism in ALD allows atomic level control over the thickness and composition of resistive and secondary electron emission (SEE) layers that can be deposited conformally on high aspect ratio capillary glass arrays. We have developed several robust and reliable ALD processes for the resistive coatings and SEE layers to give us precise control over the resistance in the target range for MCPs (106 - 109 Ω) and SEE coefficient (up to 8). The MCPs are tested in stacks {{of one or two}} plates and exhibit gains as high as 107 for a pair of MCPs.

40|$|Discovering {{the genetic}} causes of common {{diseases}} may require scanning for mutations {{in all of}} the genes in a million people, a significant undertaking. Such discoveries would revolutionize biotechnology, potentially enabling simple genetic tests for risk and targeted preventative or therapeutic strategies. An increase in throughput of genetic analysis instrumentation by several orders of magnitude is essential to undertake such an ambitious task. In this thesis, progress will be presented towards the creation of such a "mutational spectrometer" instrument containing up to 10, 000 capillary channels and enabled with subsystems for loading, separating, and detecting fluorescently-labeled DNA. Challenges include DNA manipulation, optical signal detection, macro/micro design integration, precision alignment and assembly, and thermal control. To manipulate DNA, we have utilized a bioMEMS design platform for interfacing to an array of separation channels that enables electrokinetic biomolecule loading, detection, and fraction collection in independent wells. (cont.) Signal detection is accomplished by a sensitive (107 molecule limit-of-detection), scalable (to 10, 000 independent channels), end-of-column fluorescence detection technology that accommodates tightly packed <b>capillary</b> <b>arrays</b> as required for ultra-high throughput electrophoretic separation. Capillary array assembly and constraint technologies have been developed for 2 -D arrays containing as many as 10, 000 replaceable capillaries.

Additional subsystems for forcing a viscous polymer matrix into the capillaries, and interfacing the capillary array to a fluid reservoir for electrophoresis have also been developed, as required.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a multiplexed sample processing system in conjunction with multiplexed capillary electrophoresis for high-throughput DNA sequencing. The concept from DNA template to called bases was first demonstrated with a manually operated single capillary system. Later, an automated microfluidic system with 8 channels based on the same principle was successfully constructed. The instrument automatically processes 8 templates through reaction, purification, denaturation, pre-concentration, injection, separation and detection in a parallel fashion.

Expanded common buffer chambers for the cathode, anode, and waste reservoirs are used to simplify electrode addressing and to counteract buffering capacity depletion arising from the high electrophoretic current.

Cross-talk is eliminated through proper optical coupling, good focusing and immersing capillary array into index matching fluid. A side-entry excitation scheme with orthogonal detection was established for large capillary array. Two 100 capillary array formats were used for DNA sequencing.

The <b>capillary</b> <b>arrays</b> were sandwiched between two fused silica plates with immersion solution in between, which formed a channel to guide the light. Different immersion fluids were chosen for different capillary formats. Immersion oil with a higher refractive index was chosen for the cylindrical capillary due to a higher trapping efficiency.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} Human Genome Project is to {{sequence}} all 3 billion base pairs of the human genome. Progress in this has been rapid; GenBank{reg_sign} finished 1994 with 286 million bases of sequence and grew by 2470 {{in the first quarter}} of 1995. The challenge to the scientific community is to understand the biological relevance of this genetic information. In most cases the sequence being generated for any single region of the genome represents the genotype of a single individual. A complete understanding of the function of specific genes and other regions of the genome and their role in human disease and development will only become apparent when the sequence of many more individuals is known. Access to genetic information is ultimately limited by the ability to screen DNA sequence. Although the pioneering sequencing methods of Sanger et al. (15) and Maxam and Gilbert (11) have become standard in virtually all molecular biology laboratories, the basic protocols remain largely unchanged. The throughput of this sequencing technology is now becoming the rate-limiting step in both large-scale sequencing projects such as the Human Genome Project and the subsequent efforts to understand genetic diversity. This has inspired the development of advanced DNA sequencing technologies (9), Incremental improvements to Sanger sequencing have been made in DNA labeling and detection. High-speed electrophoresis methods using ultrathin gels or <b>capillary</b> <b>arrays</b> are now being more widely employed. However, these methods are throughput-limited by their sequential nature and the speed and resolution of separations. This limitation will become more pronounced as the need to rapidly screen newly discovered genes for biologically relevant polymorphisms increases. An alternative to gel-based sequencing is to use high-density oligonucleotide probe arrays. Oligonucleotide probe arrays display specific oligonucleotide probes at precise locations in a high density, information-rich format (5, 4, 1 2). The hybridization pattern of a fluorescently labeled nucleic acid target is used to gain primary structure information of the target. This format can be applied to a broad range of nucleic acid sequence analysis problems including pathogen identification, polymorphism detection, human identification, mRNA expression monitoring and de novo sequencing. In this review, we briefly describe the method of light-directed chemid synthesis to create high-density arrays of oligonucleotide probes, the method of fluorescently labeling target nucleic acids for hybridization to the probe arrays, the detection of hybridized targets by epi-fluorescence confocal scanning and the data analysis procedures used to interpret the hybridization signals. To illustrate the use of specific high-density oligonucleotide probe arrays, we describe their application to screening the reverse transcriptase (rt) and protease (pro) genes of HIV-I for polymorphisms and drug-resistance conferring mutations...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{microvascular}} blood flow, particularly to the skeletal muscle, {{there has been a}} considerable history of reference to the incongruity of total limb blood flow and actual myocyte perfusion. Embedded in such an idea is the concept that flow to skeletal muscle should be composed of two physiologically distinct circulations — one that perfuses the myoctes (and therefore may be called "nutritive") and another which must act as a form of physiological shunt or "non-nutritive". The "nutritive and non-nutritive flow" hypothesis was renewed by the muscle research group of the Biochemistry Department at the University of Tasmania to explain perfusion dependent metabolic effects of vasoconstrictors on skeletal muscle. This thesis focuses on the assessment of microvascular perfusion, compared to total flow, in skeletal muscle and in particular in relation to reports of direct and indirect effects of insulin to increase microvascular perfusion of this tissue in vivo. Initially laser Doppler Fluxmetry technology (LDF) was applied to estimate muscle perfusion. For the purposes of verification and comparison two other techniques under development by our group, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU) and 1 -methyl xanthine metabolism, were also used. In the first section of this thesis the variable of total flow is eliminated by using a constant flow (pump perfused) rat hindlimb. During the application of vasoconstrictors that caused either predominantly nutritive or non-nutritive flow LDF estimation of perfusion was found to be highly variable in spite of the constant total flow. LDF comprises a non vectorial voltage measurement generated by particle movement through a volume of tissue illuminated by the laser light. LDF measurement using a large probe was highly correlated with the metabolic changes induced by changes in nutritive and non-nutritive flow. However, LDF measurement using a smaller implantable probe which measures particle movement in a smaller volume of muscle tissue, showed that there is considerable heterogeneity of response. To better understand the factors that influence changes in the LDF measurement LDF measurements were made of flow controlled through fabricated glass <b>capillary</b> <b>arrays</b> of various architectures. The third study addressed changes induced by insulin in vivo, in anaethetised rats during a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp. Using a large surface LDF probe the LDF signal from the muscle increased during the administration of insulin. In contrast the LDF signal did not increase during epinephrine administration even though the epinephrine caused a comparable increase in femoral artery blood flow as seen with insulin. Furthermore the time course of LDF change in the presence of insulin was more closely aligned with changes in glucose uptake than it was with changes in femoral blood flow. In the final series of experiments using LDF, changes due to insulin in human muscle was assessed. The results suggested that physiological hyperinsulinaemia stimulated not only total blood flow and skin microvascular perfusion, but also augmented human skeletal muscle microvascular recruitment and vasomotion as detected directly by laser Doppler measurement. In the second technique, CEU, microbubbles (an albumin membrane encapsulating an inert gas {{in the form of a}} 4 micron diameter sphere) act as contrast when tissue is visualised using ultrasonography. Analysis of the rate and extent of contrast (microbubble) appearance during imaging of the target tissue allows us to calculate indicators of the microvascular velocity and microvascular volume. The third technique based on capillary endothelial metabolism of the exogenous substrate 1 -methylxanthine, was developed at the University of Tasmania. 1 -Methylxanthine is a reporter substrate, which as it passes through the nutritive capillary route of the muscle is metabolized to 1 -methyl urate; metabolism is proportional to available capillary surface area. To consolidate the LDF findings, the two additional techniques for assessing changes in capillary recruitment were used. Once again, the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp was used but on this occasion a physiologic dose of insulin was infused. Microvascular recruitment (measured by 1 -MX metabolism as well as by CEU) increased during insulin administration. Furthermore, at certain time points microvascular recruitment occurred without changes to femoral artery flow. From these studies it was evident that insulin increases tissue perfusion by recruiting microvascular beds, and at physiological concentrations this precedes increases in total muscle blood flow by 60 - 90 min. Since there was no change in the mean red cell velocity, it seem likely that insulin had increased capillary recruitment by redistributing blood flow from other vessels possibly non-nutritive. In the final study capillary recruitment was again measured by the metabolism of infused 1 -methyl xanthine and used to assess responses to insulin in normal colony rats as well as lean and obese Zucker rats (an animal model for type 2 diabetes). It was concluded that muscle insulin resistance of obese Zucker rats is accompanied by impaired hemodynamic responses to insulin including markedly impaired capillary recruitment and femoral blood flow when compared to lean Zuckers or colony control rats. Taken together, the findings embodied by this thesis show that the three techniques of LDF, CEU and 1 -MX metabolism, each detect a vascular effect of insulin in vivo, characterized by capillary recruitment. This was detectable at physiologic insulin and occurred in both muscle of rats and humans. In addition, LDF added a further aspect of insulin action of an insulin-mediated increase in vasomotion at low frequency, very likely suggesting increased neural activity...|$|E

CDCE uses a region of constant temperature and constant denaturant concentration to separate fragments with distinct melting points. The concept of the Ultra-high Throughput Mutational Spectrometer (UTMS) will perform massively parallel CDCE on a 100 by 100 <b>capillary</b> <b>array.</b> A modular aluminum structure was designed for the instrument to provide a chamber to house the array and modulate the flow of coolant, providing temperature control. The first iteration of the structure experienced leakage problems, which this project rectified. The structure was also modified to interface with a gel loading mechanism below, and the LED fluorescent excitation array above. The current subunit will enable the testing the complete UTMS system. In addition, an immersion heater was installed in the water-tight structure to simulate the 200 to 275 W heat dissipation within the chamber, caused by Joule heating in the <b>capillary</b> <b>array.</b> Correlation of a theoretical model to experimental data characterized and verified the transient thermal response of the system. by Jiengju J.
