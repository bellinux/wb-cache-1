The arrangement is modified and disguised in every possible way, according to the leaf's need: in the aspen, the leaf-stalk becomes an absolute vertical plank; and in the large trees is often almost rounded into the likeness of a fruit-stalk;--but, in all,[36] the essential structure is this doubled one; and in all, it opens at the place where the leaf joins the main stem, into a kind of cup, which holds next year's bud in the hollow of it.|$|E
60|$|The {{varieties}} of the banana are infinite in number, and, {{as in most}} other plants of ancient cultivation, they shade off into one another by infinitesimal gradations. Two principal sorts, however, are commonly recognised--the true banana of commerce, and the <b>common</b> <b>plantain.</b> The banana proper is eaten raw, as a fruit, and is allowed accordingly to ripen thoroughly before being picked for market; the plantain, which is the true food-stuff of all the equatorial region in both hemispheres, is gathered green and roasted as a vegetable, or, to use the more expressive West Indian negro phrase, as a bread-kind. Millions of human beings in Asia, Africa, America, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean live almost entirely on the mild and succulent but tasteless plantain. Some people like the fruit; to me personally it is more suggestive of a very flavourless over-ripe pear than of anything else in heaven or earth or the waters that are under the earth--the latter being the most probable {{place to look for}} it, as its taste and substance are decidedly watery. Baked dry in the green state 'it resembles roasted chestnuts,' or rather baked parsnip; pulped and boiled with water it makes 'a very agreeable sweet soup,' almost as nice as peasoup with brown sugar in it; and cut into slices, sweetened, and fried, it forms 'an excellent substitute for fruit pudding,' having a flavour much like that of potatoes à la maítre d'hótel served up in treacle.|$|E

There are two tolerably distinct kinds, the ray kel and the common kel. The ray kel is like the Chinese banana. The fruit, though thinner skinned and somewhat better flavoured than the <b>common</b> <b>plantain,</b> is less suitable for cooking, and being a light cropper and wanting much water, is but sparingly cultivated. The common three-cornered plantain, the taperi of Gujarat, the monde of Madras, and the gulur bale of Mysor, is easily grown and yields freely. [...] During the British period, Chinawal village was known for handloom weaving and quality cloth production, not for banana production. Page 229 of the British gazette made the following observation: [...] The chief hand-woven cloth goods are ... floor cloths, cotton sheets, stamped dirty-red coverlets, smaller sheets and cushions, from Nandurbar, Shahada, Varsi, Betavad, Sindkheda, Chopda, Jalgaon, Jamner, Faizpur, and Chinaval.|$|E

Here, {{we describe the}} kinetic characterization of these sorbitol transporters by functional expression in Brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in Xenopus sp. oocytes {{and for the first}} time the localization of plant PLTs in specific cell types of the vascular tissue. In the yeast system, both proteins were shown to be uncoupler sensitive and could be characterized as low-affinity and low-specificity polyol symporters. The Km value for the physiological substrate sorbitol is 12 mm for PmPLT 1 and even higher for PmPLT 2, which showed an almost linear increase in sorbitol transport rates up to 20 mm. These data were confirmed in the Xenopus sp. system, where PmPLT 1 was analyzed in detail and characterized as a H+ symporter. Using peptide-specific polyclonal antisera against PmPLT 1 or PmPLT 2 and simultaneous labeling with the monoclonal antiserum 1 A 2 raised against the companion cell-specific PmSUC 2 Suc transporter, both PLTs were localized to companion cells of the phloem in <b>common</b> <b>plantain</b> source leaves. These analyses revealed two different types of companion cells in the <b>common</b> <b>plantain</b> phloem: younger cells expressing PmSUC 2 at higher levels and older cells expressing lower levels of PmSUC 2 plus both PLT genes.

In addition to sucrose, <b>common</b> <b>plantain,</b> sea plantain, and peach also translocated substantial amounts of sorbitol, whereas celery translocated mannitol as well. Sucrose was always present in vacuole and cytosol of mesophyll cells, whereas sorbitol and mannitol were found in vacuole, stroma, and cytosol in all cases except for sea plantain. The concentration of sorbitol, mannitol and sucrose in phloem sap was 2 - to 40 -fold higher than that in the cytosol of mesophyll cells. Apoplastic carbohydrate concentrations in all species tested were in the low millimolar range versus high millimolar concentrations in symplastic compartments. Therefore, the concentration ratios between the apoplast and the phloem were very strong, ranging between 20 - to 100 -fold for sorbitol and mannitol, and between 200 - and 2000 -fold for sucrose. The woody species, peach, showed the smallest concentration ratios between the cytosol of mesophyll cells and the phloem {{as well as between}} the apoplast and the phloem, suggesting a mixture of apoplastic and symplastic phloem loading, in contrast to the herbal plant species (<b>common</b> <b>plantain,</b> sea plantain, celery) which likely exhibit an active loading mode for sorbitol and mannitol as well as sucrose from the apoplast into the phloem...|$|E

Different bioactive compounds have been proposed to contribute to the wound healing properties of this plant. The present study was undertaken to investigate the impact of some genetic and environmental factors on the wound healing activity of <b>common</b> <b>plantain.</b> Seeds of P. major were collected from five populations in different parts of Sweden, and were germinated and grown in a greenhouse. As expected for an inbreeding species, RAPD analyses demonstrated considerable between-population variation but very sparse within-population and within-subpopulation variation. Six major phenolic compounds were encountered in samples of P. major, four of which were identified for the first time in this thesis; PLMA 1 –PLMA 4. Between-population and sub-population differences in the contents of these chemical compounds showed no correlation with RAPD-based estimates of genetic relatedness. The contents of these compounds differed greatly between different plant organs of P. major. The highest concentration of plantamajoside and PLMA 2 was found in leaves whereas the highest concentration of verbascoside was found in flower stalks and seeds. Contents were significantly higher in freeze-dried leaf samples compared to samples dried at higher temperatures. Both water and ethanol-based extracts of P. major leaves stimulated the cell proliferation and migration in an in vitro scratch assay, and also showed anti-inflammatory activity in an in vitro NF-kB assay with oral epithelial cell cultures. Similarly, these extracts stimulated wound healing activities in ex vivo tests using detached pig ears. Further breeding efforts aimed at developing P. major as a crop plant, and medicinal research aimed at elucidating and optimizing extracts with wound healing properties, are thus warranted...|$|E

Transient expression of an AtPLT 5 –green fluorescent protein fusion in plant cells and functional analyses of the AtPLT 5 protein in yeast and Xenopus oocytes demonstrate that AtPLT 5 is located in the plasma membrane and characterize this protein as a broad-spectrum H þ-symporter for linear polyols, such as sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol, or glycerol. Unexpectedly, however, AtPLT 5 catalyzes also the transport of the cyclic polyol myo-inositol and of different hexoses and pentoses, including ribose, a sugar that is not transported by any of the previously characterized plant sugar transporters. RT-PCR analyses and AtPLT 5 promoter-reporter gene plants revealed that AtPLT 5 is most strongly expressed in Arabidopsis roots, but also in the vascular tissue of leaves and in specific floral organs.

40|$|Background and purpose: Allometry is {{the study}} of the {{relationship}} of body size to shape, anatomy, physiology and behavior. Plants displaying allometric relationships between certain traits across different environments should have higher relative fitness then plants lacking these allometric relationships. We hypothesized that there are differences in external morphology between Plantago major L.

Materials and methods: Seven, linear dimensions on each leaf: leafblade apical width (AW), leaf-blade length (LL), leaf size (LS), leaf width (LW), leaf shape (LW/LL), the distance from the midrib to the neighboring vein (MV) and vein distances within a leaf (VD) were analysed. Here, besides analyzing allometric relationships between the <b>common</b> <b>plantain</b> leaves exposed to different environmental conditions, morphological data were also used for a regression analysis and for a cluster analysis. Results: In the reference area (Vinci village) leaves have significantly longer LL and they are significantly broader compared with leaves from polluted site (Pančevo). At both sites, LL decreased relatively to LS (i. e. negative allometry is character specific). This study also revealed that VD and LW/LL are developmentally and functionally integrated P. major leaf characters. Moreover, VD is under more selective pressure to adapt to current environmental conditions than LW/LL. Conclusions: Obtained data showed that leaf size is significantly related to both, developmental and environmental conditions. This indicates that plant species such as Plantago major L.

In plants, glycosidic defense compounds and hydrolytic enzymes often form a dual defense system, {{in which the}} glycosides are activated by the enzymes to exert biological effects. Yet, {{little is known about}} the activating enzymes in iridoid glycoside-containing plants. To examine the role of plant-derived β-glucosidases in the dual defense system of two <b>common</b> <b>plantain</b> species, Plantago lanceolata and Plantago major, we determined the concentration of iridoid glycosides as well as the β-glucosidase activity in leaves of different age. To investigate the presence of other leaf metabolites potentially involved in plant defense, we used a metabolic fingerprinting approach with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. According to the optimal defense hypothesis, more valuable parts such as young leaves should be better protected than less valuable parts. Therefore, we expected that both, the concentrations of defense compounds as well as the β-glucosidase activity, should be highest in younger leaves and decrease with increasing leaf age. Both species possessed β-glucosidase activity, which hydrolyzed aucubin, one of the two most abundant iridoid glycosides in both plant species, with high activity. In line with the optimal defense hypothesis, the β-glucosidase activity in both Plantago species as well as the concentration of defense-related metabolites such as iridoid glycosides correlated negatively to leaf age. When leaf extracts were incubated with bovine serum albumin and aucubin, SDS–PAGE revealed a protein-denaturing effect of the leaf extracts of both plantain species, suggesting that iridoid glycosides and plant β-glucosidase interact in a dual defense system. ...|$|E
