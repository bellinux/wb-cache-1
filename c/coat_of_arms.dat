5|$|As of 2006, the Ecuadoran flag still shares some {{similarity}} {{with the}} flags of Colombia and Venezuela. All three flags use the yellow, {{blue and red}} tricolor, but {{that is where the}} similarities end. In a decree passed in Colombia in 1934, the ratio of the stripes were set at 2:1:1 and the flag ratio was set at 2:3, similar to the present Ecuador flag. However, the <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> is only changed {{in the middle of the}} flag when it is used by government officials or by military forces. For Venezuela, the basic design was to have all three strips even vertically, unlike those of Colombia and Ecuador. Since 1863, Venezuela decided to change their flag with white stars instead of a <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms.</b> A <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> was not added to the national flag 1954, then changed again in 2006 to add another star and alter the <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms.</b> The position of the <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> on the Venezuelan flag also differs from Ecuador and Colombia by placing the arms at the very top hoist (left) side of the flag instead of in the center.|$|E

50|$|Norwegian {{heraldry}} has {{roots in}} early medieval times, {{soon after the}} use <b>of</b> <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> first appeared in continental Europe. Some <b>of</b> the medieval <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> are rather simple of design, while others have more naturalistic charges. The king-granted <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> later times, were usually detailed and complex.

50|$|Spanish <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> {{are divided}} {{in the same}} fashion used by other European countries.

Thus Spanish escutcheons are commonly parted.|$|R
