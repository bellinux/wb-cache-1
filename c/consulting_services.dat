5|$|Senior partner Anil Kumar, {{described}} as Gupta's protégé, left the firm after the allegations in 2009 and {{pleaded guilty in}} January 2010. While he and other partners had been pitching McKinsey's <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> to the Galleon Group, Kumar and Rajaratnam reached a private consulting agreement, violating McKinsey's policies on confidentiality. Gupta was convicted in June 2012 of four counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, and acquitted on two counts. In October 2011, he was arrested by the FBI on criminal charges of sharing insider information from these confidential board meetings with Rajaratnam. At least twice, Gupta used a McKinsey phone to call Rajaratnam and retained other perks — an office, assistant, and $6 million retirement salary that year — as a senior partner emeritus.|$|E
