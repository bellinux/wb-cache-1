5|$|The {{other two}} clones are then {{seen in a}} forest – one walks behind a tree and reappears dressed in casual attire. He climbs another tree and {{ends up in the}} {{bathroom}} of the woman's apartment, where he retrieves a package. The clone then crawls underneath her bed and finds himself underneath a car. He opens the package and finds a gasoline can, which he pours into a compartment located behind the car's license plate. All three clones enter the <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> to the box, which they step back into; the video concludes with the box's explosion.|$|E
5|$|Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 {{wrote the}} title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) {{described}} him as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. He would borrow his mother's <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for hours without purpose on occasion, until {{he ran out of}} petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends have recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods of his illness, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.|$|E
5|$|Picking {{up where}} Subspecies II leaves off, Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994) finds Michelle {{deep in the}} catacombs with Radu's mother, who brings her son {{back from the dead}} with Michelle's blood and the enchanted dagger that killed him; Radu, his mother, and Michelle return to Castle Vladislas. Michelle {{promises}} to obey Radu if he teaches her everything that he knows. Radu takes Michelle out hunting so she can enhance her powers, while Mel contacts a former operative of the CIA for help. While trying to rescue Michelle, Radu's mother quickly kills Mel's CIA friend, and knocks Mel unconscious. In an effort to get Michelle to stay with him forever, Radu kills his mother when she attacks Michelle. Becky arrives to save Michelle, but before everyone leaves, Michelle takes a gun from Becky, which contains silver bullets, and shoots Radu. The rising sun slows Michelle, so she is placed inside a body bag that was brought along; the delay allows Radu time to catch up to the group. Wanting the Bloodstone, which was taken by Michelle, Radu attempts to barter the group's lives in exchange for it. Becky throws it over the roof's edge, and when Radu attempts to follow it he is engulfed in the rays of the Sun. Radu's body bursts into flames and falls from the castle wall. Becky and the group make it to their <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> off. Radu's burning corpse is left smoldering and impaled on tree branches, with his burning blood dropping to the ground; the flames go out and the blood morphs into new subspecies.|$|E

25|$|Messerschmitt, and {{subsequently}} FMR, made factory-converted Service Cars to {{order for the}} automobile service industry. Similar in concept to the Harley-Davidson Servi-Car and the Indian Dispatch Tow, the Service Car had a detachable tow bar and clamp, a revised front suspension to accommodate the tow bar when in use, and a storage system inside the car to accommodate the tow bar when not in use. The service technician would drive the Service Car to the customer's car and, if the customer's car was drivable, attach the tow bar {{to the front of}} the Service Car, clamp the other end of the tow bar to the bumper of the customer's <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> the customer's car to the garage. When the service was complete, he would drive the car back to the customer while towing the Service Car, detach the Service Car from the customer's <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> back to the garage. Approximately 12 were built; only one is known to exist at present.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks before}} he was killed, Bermúdez Zacarías {{reached out to the}} Metepec {{municipal}} police for help and told them that he suspected that someone was following him. He also told this to Manuel Delgadillo Aguiñaga, one of his coworkers. After the murder, his coworker told investigators that Bermúdez Zacarías saw two suspicious men on a motorcycle one day in his neighborhood when he was coming back home from work. Bermúdez Zacarías decided to turn around in his <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> away. Minutes later, he arrived home escorted by a Metepec police car. Despite fearing for his life, Bermúdez Zacarías did not officially ask for any sort of security measures or protection, and continued his daily activities as usual.

500|$|The police detain Brandon {{on charges}} that arose prior to his relocation; they place him in the women's section of the Falls City prison. Lana bails Brandon out and asks why he {{was placed in a}} women's prison. Brandon {{attempts}} to lie to her, saying he was born a hermaphrodite and will soon receive a sex change; but Lana stops him, declaring her love for Brandon regardless of his gender. However, while Brandon is in prison, Candace finds a number of documents listing Brandon's birth name, Teena Brandon, and she and her friends react upon these news with shock and disgust. Tom and John violently confront Brandon, forcing him to remove his pants and reveal his genitals. They try to make Lana look, but she shields her eyes and turns away. After this confrontation, Tom and John drag Brandon into John's <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> to an isolated location, where they brutally beat and gang rape him. Afterwards, they take Brandon to Tom's house. Though injured, Brandon escapes through a bathroom window.

60|$|One more {{experience}} of this wonderful day--the most crowded with impressions of my whole life. At night {{we take a}} <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> north, and ever north, until at a late hour we halt and climb a hill in the darkness. Below is a wonderful sight. Down on the flats, in a huge semi-circle, lights are rising and falling. They are very brilliant, going up {{for a few seconds}} and then dying down. Sometimes a dozen are in the air at one time. There are the dull thuds of explosions and an occasional rat-tat-tat. I have seen nothing like it, but the nearest comparison would be an enormous ten-mile railway station in full swing at night, with signals winking, lamps waving, engines hissing and carriages bumping. It is a terrible place down yonder, a place which will live as long as military history is written, for it is the Ypres Salient. What a salient it is, too! A huge curve, as outlined by the lights, needing only a little more to be an encirclement. Something caught the rope as it closed, and that something was the British soldier. But it is a perilous place still by day and by night. Never shall I forget the impression of ceaseless, malignant activity which was borne in upon me by the white, winking lights, the red sudden glares, and the horrible thudding noises in that place of death beneath me.|$|E
