50|$|The typical Trojan is condition-based: It is {{triggered}} by sensors, internal logic states, a particular input pattern or an internal counter value. Condition-based Trojans are detectable with power traces {{to some degree}} when inactive.

The algorithm was tested on different counter circuits and performs exceptionally well compared to the random test patterns by ATALANTA [15]. The hardware required for the TPG in the <b>counter</b> <b>circuit</b> is the same irrespective {{of the size of}} the counter.

40|$|An {{electronic}} device is reliable {{if it is}} available for use {{most of the times}} throughout its life. The reliability can be affected by mishandling and use under abnormal operating conditions. High quality product cannot be achieved without proper verification and testing during the product development cycle. If the design is difficult to test, then it is very likely that most of the faults will not be detected before it is shipped to the customer. This paper describes how product quality can be improved by making the hardware design testable. Various designs for testability techniqueswere discussed.

This has been due, especially in the earlier period, to the lack of apparatus capable of obtaining the necessary data, and as the field of Nuclear Physics was new, no adequate theories had been developed. Within the past two decades, two valuable pieces of apparatus have been developed for the experimental study of Cosmic Rays.

In the present paper a modified AD conversion technique along with opto-isolation is used to indicate digitally the temperature without using any conventional analog-to-digital converter. The theory and design of the measuring technique are described in the paper. The non-linearity of thermocouple is eliminated by using look-up table within software program.

50|$|The {{tunnel diode}} showed great promise as an {{oscillator}} and high-frequency threshold (trigger) device since it operated at frequencies {{far greater than}} the tetrode could, well into the microwave bands. Applications for tunnel diodes included local oscillators for UHF television tuners, trigger circuits in oscilloscopes, high-speed <b>counter</b> <b>circuits,</b> and very fast-rise time pulse generator circuits. The tunnel diode {{can also be used}} as a low-noise microwave amplifier. However, since its discovery, more conventional semiconductor devices have surpassed its performance using conventional oscillator techniques. For many purposes, a three-terminal device, such as a field-effect transistor, is more flexible than a device with only two terminals. Practical tunnel diodes operate at a few milliamperes and a few tenths of a volt, making them low-power devices. The Gunn diode has similar high frequency capability and can handle more power.|$|R

Narrow directivities of the emitter and the receiver have reduced the measurement error due to the echo from the inside hopper wall. Output voltage of the receiver was enhanced to shorten the lag time which emerged in the signal level sensing circuit. The inclination angle of the surface was detected by the swinging method, which also decreased the receiving error of the reflected wave.

50|$|To handle an {{external}} signal promptly on the Propeller, {{any one of}} the 32 I/O lines is configured as an input. A cog is then configured to wait for a transition (either positive or negative edge) on that input using one of the two <b>counter</b> <b>circuits</b> available to each cog. While waiting for the signal, the cog operates in low-power mode, essentially sleeping. Extending this technique, a Propeller can be set up to respond to eight independent interrupt lines with essentially zero handling delay. Alternately, one line can be used to signal the interrupt, and then additional input lines can be read to determine the nature of the event. The code running in the other cores is not affected by the interrupt handling cog. Unlike a traditional multitasking single-processor interrupt architecture, the signal response timing remains predictable, and indeed using the term interrupt in this context can cause confusion, since this function can be more properly thought of as polling with a zero loop time.|$|R
