25|$|Pyrimidine ribonucleosides {{and their}} {{respective}} nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries. Sutherland has demonstrated high yielding routes to cytidine and uridine ribonucleotides built from small 2 and 3 carbon fragments such as glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, <b>cyanamide</b> and cyanoacetylene. One of the steps in this sequence allows the isolation of enantiopure ribose aminooxazoline if the enantiomeric excess of glyceraldehyde is 60% or greater. This {{can be viewed as}} a prebiotic purification step, where the said compound spontaneously crystallized out from a mixture of the other pentose aminooxazolines. Ribose aminooxazoline can then react with cyanoacetylene in a mild and highly efficient manner to give the alpha cytidine ribonucleotide. Photoanomerization with UV light allows for inversion about the 1' anomeric centre to give the correct beta stereochemistry. In 2009 they showed that the same simple building blocks allow access, via phosphate controlled nucleobase elaboration, to 2',3'-cyclic pyrimidine nucleotides directly, which are known to be able to polymerize into RNA. This paper also highlights the possibility for the photo-sanitization of the pyrimidine-2',3'-cyclic phosphates.|$|E

2500|$|Cyanomethyl groups {{represent}} {{an easy way}} to protect an iminium ion during allylic vinylation of the ketone. [...] <b>Cyanamide</b> groups and analogs have been often used in the generation iminium ions. [...] They are typically installed by nucleophilic addition onto an iminium ion, generally produced by amine alkylation with formaldehyde. [...] The iminium ion is thus masked. [...] It follows that usage of a cyanomethyl group provides an efficient way to control the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction. [...] The cyanomethyl group protects the nitrogen at the 2-position during formation of the other allylic analog by logic similar to cyanide-type umpolung. [...] It then later provides a good leaving group for formation of the iminium ion, in accordance with its usage in iminium ion generation. [...] Iminium ion generation from cyanomethyl groups is normally promoted by addition of silver nitrate, although other silver and copper compounds have been used. [...] This added step allows for more precise control of iminium ion generation. [...] Importantly, these preparatory reactions must be carried out at -78°C to prevent cyanomethyl/vinyllithium interaction.
