5|$|Later, von Neumann {{suggested}} a new method of linear programming, using the homogeneous linear system of Gordan (1873), which was later popularized by Karmarkar's algorithm. Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices, with the pivoting decision {{determined by a}} nonnegative least squares subproblem with a <b>convexity</b> constraint (projecting the zero-vector onto the convex hull of the active simplex). Von Neumann's algorithm was the first interior point method of linear programming.|$|E

5|$|The curve-shortening flow, {{and many}} of the results about the curve-shortening flow, can be {{generalized}} from the Euclidean plane to any two-dimensional Riemannian manifold. In order to avoid additional types of singularity, {{it is important for the}} manifold to be convex at infinity; this is defined to mean that every compact set has a compact convex hull, as defined using geodesic <b>convexity.</b> The curve-shortening flow cannot cause a curve to depart from its convex hull, so this condition prevents parts of the curve from reaching the boundary of the manifold.|$|E

40|$|The {{productivity}} of (human) information processing {{as an economic}} activity {{is a question that}} is raising some interest. Using Marschak's evaluation framework, Radner and Stiglitz have shown that, under certain conditions, the production function of this activity has increasing marginal returns in its initial stage. This paper shows that, under slightly different conditions, this information processing function has repeated <b>convexities</b> with ongoing processing activity. Even for smooth changes in the signals' likelihoods, the function is only piecewise smooth with non-differentiable <b>convexities</b> at points of conditional changes of action. For linear likelihood functions the processing value proves to be piecewise linear with <b>convexities</b> at these levels.

5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of the}} jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter <b>convexity</b> is {{replaced}} by a concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E

We introduce two operations on a set of fractoconvexities and in a special case we show that they satisfy the laws for a distributive lattice. We establish a connection between fractoconvex sets and convex sets using the concept of independent <b>convexities,</b> based on the possibility of representing a fractoconvex set as the intersection of its convex hulls. Finally, we consider some examples of fractoconvexities on the 2 -sphere and on Z...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} surface {{structure}} investigations of TiCrN coating on carbon steel after irradiation by high-and low energy krypton ions and successive two-hour vacuum annealing {{are reported in}} the present publication. Specimens with the TiCrN coatings of the 50 ÷ 100 nm thickness were formed by vacuum arc deposition techniques. The prepared specimens were irradiated by low energy (280 keV) and high energy (125 MeV) krypton ions. Study of surface structure was done by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. X-ray diffraction and the Rutherford backscattering spectrometry were applied for determination of structure and coating thickness. After irradiation by high energy Kr ions there appear <b>convexities</b> of spherical shape with dimensions 10 ÷ 30 nm {{on the surface of}} the coating. Subsequent two-hour vacuum annealing led to decrease of <b>convexities</b> dimensions. Irradiation by low-energy Kr ions does not lead to significant changes in the structure of the coating surface. Only traces of surface sputtering are found. Explanation of the observed surface damage is proposed. <b>Convexities</b> are the traces of ions passing through coating and appear due to structural reconstruction at energy release along a trajectory of ions braking. As the projective range of high energy Kr ions exceeds coating thickness, then damage of structures is generated in the substrate and <b>convexities</b> are the traces of undersurface damages...|$|R

We also discuss the (h,φ) -generalized directional derivative and gradient, {{and explore the}} relation between this gradient and the Clarke generalized gradient. Definitions of some generalized averages {{of the values of}} a generalized convex function at n equally spaced points based on the algebraic operations are also presented and corresponding results are obtained.
