30|$|Out-of-band (OOB) {{radiation}} of the DL/UL transmitter-this {{is mostly}} {{the effect of}} sinc-like subcarrier spectrum. As {{it has been shown}} in [15], each subcarrier in the time domain can be represented by a complex sinusoid windowed using a rectangular window. However, {{there are a number of}} spectrum shaping methods designed in order to reduce OOB radiation power, e.g., [16, 17]. The simplest one is to use so-called guard subcarriers [15] by modulating subcarriers closest to the currently utilized spectrum bandwidth with zeros (i.e., subcarriers close to the PUCCH band in cell B are zeroed). Another source of OOB radiation is the high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of an OFDM transmission carried using a nonlinear front-end. However, it can be effectively reduced using PAPR minimization or predistortion techniques [18]. The method that we use in this paper to reduce OOB radiation at TX side is an Optimized Cancellation <b>Carriers</b> <b>Selection</b> (OCCS) method [16]. Out of all allocated data subcarriers, some subcarriers are reserved for, so-called, cancellation carriers (CCs). Based on a set of complex data symbols modulating a given OFDM symbol, their frequency response in the OOB region is calculated. As CCs have non-zero frequency response in the same region (sinc-like shape of each subcarrier’s spectrum), their values are adjusted using least squares approximation so that total OOB radiation power is minimal. Most importantly, in [16] an algorithm for finding optimal CCs location is proposed. Additionally, for a given OFDM symbol, the optimization is limited to a single matrix-vector multiplication where matrix is complex valued, constant for a given system configuration and vector consists of data subcarriers symbols.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Power line {{communications}} {{provide a}} convenient and cost-effective solution for data transmission, because power mains {{are the most}} popular and widely distributed medium in the world. However, the time-variant and unpredictable channel environment for communication poses a major challenge. In this regard, we propose a robust power line modem based on adaptively signal detection techniques for networked home appliances. The modulation scheme used in this research is a chirped spread spectrum with a separate matched filter based on an adaptive threshold decision technique. In addition, we propose an adaptive retransmission technique based on flexible <b>carrier</b> frequency <b>selection</b> using a ram based look-up table (LUT) for improving carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) media access protocol. The proposed power line transceiver is realized in 0. 35 um CMOS technology and verified with networked various consumer electronic devices. The results show that the proposed power line communication modem is well qualified as a communication device for home automation 1.

40|$|While data {{encryption}} is {{an effective}} means of keeping data private it does not conceal the presence of 'hidden' information, rather it serves as an indicator that such data is present. Concealing information and hiding the fact that information is hidden are both desirable traits of a confidential data exchange, especially if that exchange takes place across a public network such as the Internet. In the present paper, we describe an approach to textual steganography in which data is not only hidden, in virtue of its encoding, but the presence of hidden data is also concealed, through use of human-readable carrier texts. Information transmitted in this fashion remains confidential and its confidential nature is also concealed. The approach detailed addresses several shortcomings in previous work in this area. Specifically, we achieve a high rate of accuracy in message decoding and also produce carrier texts which are both coherent and plausible as human-readable plain text messages. These desirable features of textual steganography are accomplished through a system of sentence mapping and a genre-based approach to <b>carrier</b> text <b>selection</b> that produces contextually related content in the carrier messages...|$|R
