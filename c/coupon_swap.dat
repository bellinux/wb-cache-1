50|$|In finance, a zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swap</b> (ZCS) is an {{interest}} rate derivative (IRD). In particular it is a linear IRD, that in its specification {{is very similar to}} the much more widely traded interest rate swap (IRS).|$|E
50|$|Zero coupon swaps (ZCSs) hedged by {{the more}} {{commonly}} traded interest rate swaps (IRSs) introduce cross-gamma into an IRD portfolio. As such, and due to correlation between different instruments, ZCSs are required to have a pricing adjustment, to equate their value to IRSs under a no arbitrage principle. Otherwise this is considered rational pricing. This adjustment is referred to in literature as the zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swap</b> convexity adjustment (ZCA).|$|E

50|$|In finance, an {{interest}} rate swap (IRS) is {{an interest}} rate derivative (IRD). In particular it is a linear IRD {{and one of the}} most liquid, benchmark products. It has associations with forward rate agreements (FRAs), and with zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swaps</b> (ZCSs).|$|R
50|$|Linear IRDs {{are those}} whose net present values (PVs) are {{overwhelmingly}} (although not necessarily entirely) {{dictated by the}} one-to-one movement of the underlying interest rate index. Examples of linear IRDs are; interest rate swaps (IRSs), forward rate agreements (FRAs), zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swaps</b> (ZCSs), cross-currency basis swaps (XCSs) and single currency basis swaps (SBSs).|$|R
50|$|A Zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swap</b> (ZCS) is a {{derivative}} contract made between two parties with terms defining two 'legs' upon which each party either makes or receives payments. One leg {{is the traditional}} fixed leg, whose cashflows are determined at the outset, usually defined by an agreed fixed rate of interest. A second leg is the traditional floating leg, whose payments at the outset are forecast but subject to change and dependent upon future publication of the interest rate index upon which the leg is benchmarked. This is same description as with the more common interest rate swap (IRS). A ZCS differs from an IRS in one major respect; timings of scheduled payments. A ZCS {{takes its name from}} a zero coupon bond which has no interim coupon payments and only a single payment at maturity. A ZCS, unlike an IRS, also only has a single payment date on each leg at the maturity of the trade. The calculation methodology for determing payments is, as a result, slightly more complicated than for IRSs.|$|E

We introduce a new dependence function which allows us to capture the complete extreme dependence structure and present a nonparametric estimation procedure.

When measuring extreme risk in terms of the Value-at-Risk, the multivariate normal model with linear correlation as its natural dependence measure is by no means an ideal model.

We also present a simple nonparametric estimation procedure. To show our new method at work we apply it to a financial data set of zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swap</b> rates and estimate the extreme dependence in the data. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{there are}} two market models for {{valuation}} and risk management of interest rate derivatives, the LIBOR and swap market models. In this paper, we introduce arbitrage-free constant maturity swap (CMS) market models and generic market models featuring forward rates that span periods other than the classical LIBOR and swap periods. We develop generic expressions for the drift terms occurring in the stochastic differential equation driving the forward rates under a single pricing measure. The generic market model is particularly apt for pricing of Bermudan CMS swaptions, fixed-maturity Bermudan swaptions, and callable hybrid <b>coupon</b> <b>swaps.</b> Key words: market model, generic market models, generic drift terms, hybrid products, BGM mode...|$|R
5000|$|A modern {{variation}} on the traditional penpal arrangement {{is to have a}} keypal / epal and exchange email addresses as well as or instead of paper letters. This has the advantage of saving money and being more immediate, allowing many messages to be exchanged {{in a short period of}} time. The disadvantage is that the communication can be very ephemeral if the email messages are not routinely saved. Many people prefer to receive paper letters, gaining the satisfaction of seeing their name carefully printed on a thick envelope in the letterbox. Using postal mail, it is possible to trade <b>coupons,</b> <b>swap</b> slips, postcards, stamps and anything else light and flat enough to fit inside an envelope, often called [...] "tuck-ins". Many penpallers like to trade sheets of stickers, notecards and stationery sets.|$|R
40|$|Three {{approaches}} {{toward the}} determination of fixed swap rates are presented in this article: a swap as a portfolio of bonds with a fixed and floating <b>coupon,</b> a <b>swap</b> as a portfolio of forwards, and a swap as {{the difference between the}} cap and the floor (zero-collar). Later in the paper, credit risk is taken in consideration. The credit risk of interest-rate swaps is much lower than that of loans or corporate bonds. Empirical research is presented to support the analysis. One of the most important determinants of credit risk in a swap spread is the yield curve slope. interest-rate swap; bonds; credit risk...|$|R
40|$|The various macro {{econometrics}} {{models for}} inflation are helpless {{when it comes}} to the pricing of inflation derivatives. The only article targeting inflation option pricing, the Jarrow Yildirim model (2000), relies on non observable data. This makes the estimation of the model parameters a non trivial problem. In addition, their framework does not examine any relationship between the most liquid inflation derivatives instruments : the year to year and zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swap.</b> To fill this gap, we see how to derive a model on inflation, based on traded and liquid market instrument. Applying the same strategy as the one for a market model on interest rates, we derive no-arbitrage relationship between zero coupon and year to year swaps. We explain how to compute the convexity adjustment and what relationship the volatility surface should satisfy. Within this framework, it becomes much easier to estimate model parameters and to price inflation derivatives in a consistent way. Inflation index; forward; zero-coupon; year-on-year; volatility cube; convexity adjustment. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{inflation}} theory, focussing {{on the model}} of Jarrow & Yildirim, which is nowadays used when pricing inflation derivatives. After recalling main results about short and forward interest rate models, the dynamics of the main components of the market are derived. Then the most important inflation-indexed derivatives are explained (zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swap,</b> year-on-year, cap and floor), and their pricing proceeding is shown step by step. Calibration is explained and performed with a common method and an heuristic and non standard one. The model is enriched with credit risk, too, which allows {{to take into account the}} possibility of bankrupt of the counterparty of a contract. In this context, the general method of pricing is derived, with the introduction of defaultable zero-coupon bonds, and the Monte Carlo method is treated in detailed and used to price a concrete example of contract.

40|$|This thesis studies a multi-factor Heath-Jarrow-Morton {{model and}} a LIBOR mar- ket model on the Norwegian, European and US {{interest}} rate market. The main concerns are the low-rate environment {{and exposure to}} negative interest rates in these models. We begin by introducing financial markets and the mathematical models explaining them. Further we discuss {{the problem with the}} current low-rate environment and the historical market practice. The focuses are implementations of two multi-factor interest rate models and the presence of negative interest rates. The historical data is provided by DNB and consists of zero <b>coupon</b> <b>swap</b> rates for several maturities in the period 2000 - 2012. The volatility factors are derived from historical data using principal component analysis and covariance matrices. With today?s yield curve the probability of negative rates is highly significant in the HJM model, whereas it is zero in LMM because of lognormality. Monte Carlo is used on the models to compare prices of caps and floors. We show that the models do not produce the same price especially around strikes near the current 3 -month rates. Further we price long butterfly spreads to show the absence of arbitrage in both models...|$|E
5000|$|On a {{technical}} note, when the asset swap is initiated between coupon dates, the asset swap buyer {{does not pay}} the accrued interest explicitly. Effectively, the full price of the bond is at par. At the next coupon period the asset swap buyer receives the full coupon on the bond and likewise pays the full <b>coupon</b> on the <b>swap.</b> However, the floating side payment, which may have a different frequency and accrual basis to fixed side, is adjusted by the corresponding accrual factor. Therefore, if we are exactly half way between floating side coupons, the floating payment received is half of the Libor plus asset swap spread. This feature prevents the calculated asset swap spread from jumping {{as we move forward}} in time through coupon dates.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new credit risk model for credit {{derivatives}} is presented. The model {{is based upon}} the ‘Libor market’ modelling framework for default-free interest rates. We model effective default-free forward rates and effective forward credit spreads as lognormal diffusion processes, and recovery is modelled as a fraction of the par value of the defaulted claim. The newly introduced survival-based pricing measures are a valuable tool in the pricing of defaultable payoffs and allow a straightforward derivation of the no-arbitrage dynamics of forward rates and forward credit spreads. The model can be calibrated to the prices of defaultable <b>coupon</b> bonds, asset <b>swap</b> rates and default swap rates for which closed-form solutions are given. For options on default swaps and caps on credit spreads, approximate solutions of high accuracy exist. This pricing formula for options on default swaps is made exact in a modified modelling framework using an analogy to the swap measure, the default swap measure.

40|$|According to the macro-econometric literature, {{the impact}} of {{exogenous}} oil price shocks on Inflation have greatly increased {{in the last two}} decades throughout OECD countries while the persistence of those shocks on long-term inflation, namely core inflation, has dramatically decreased. In the meantime, the market for inflation derivatives soared, spurred by a revival of the primary inflation-linked bond market. As the contribution of core inflation to the total headline inflation volatility bottomed, most of the volatility of headline inflation should thus be explained by changes in the spread between headline and core inflation indicators: a factor closely linked to commodity markets. This economic analysis should have important financial arbitrage implications in the futures market: are exogenous shocks on oil futures markets incorporated into zero <b>coupon</b> inflation indexed <b>swap</b> prices? To investigate this issue, we propose on the one hand a four-factor model for both inflation and nominal rates, and on the other hand a two-factor model for commodities. We proceed to an empirical estimation of the model using prices of oil futures contracts and inflation breakeven rates from which we can in particular extract a synthetic core inflation forward curve. ...|$|R
40|$|A key {{measure of}} {{relative}} {{value of a}} corporate bond is its swap spread. This is the basis point spread over the interest-rate swap curve, and {{is a measure of}} the credit risk of the bond. In its simplest form, the swap spread can be measured as the difference between the yield-to-maturity of the bond and the interest rate given by a straight-line interpolation of the swap curve. In practice traders use the asset-swap spread and the Z-spread as the main measures of relative value. The government bond spread is also considered. We consider the two main spread measures in this paper. Asset-swap spread An asset swap is a package that combines an interest-rate swap with a cash bond, the effect of the combined package being to transform the interest-rate basis of the bond. Typically, a fixed-rate bond will be combined with an interest-rate swap in which the bond holder pays fixed coupon and received floating coupon. The floating-coupon will be a spread over Libor (see Choudhry et al 2001). This spread is the asset-swap spread and is a function of the credit risk of the bond over and above interbank credit risk. 1 Asset swaps may be transacted at par or at the bond’s market price, usually par. This means that the asset swap value is made up of the difference between the bond’s market price and par, as well as the difference between the bond <b>coupon</b> and the <b>swap</b> fixed rate. The zero-coupon curve is used in the asset swap valuation. This curve is derived from the swap curve, so it is the implied zero-coupon curve. The asset swap spread is the spread that equates the difference between the present value of the bond’s cashflows, calculated using the swap zero rates, and the market price of the bond. This spread is a function of the bond’s market price and yield, its cashflows and the implied zero-coupon interest rates. 2 Exhibit 1 shows the Bloomberg screen ASW for a GBP-denominated bond, GK...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays on applying state space models to tackle interesting problems in finance and economics. Simulation-based model estimation techniques are used extensively to draw statistical inference on latent state vari- ables. In the first essay, I develop {{a new type of}} Bivariate Mixture model to describe the empirical dynamics between return volatility and trading volume. The pro- posed semi-structural model allows the common and idiosyncratic components in traders’ reservation price to interact in a multiplicative way rather than an addi- tive way which is typically adopted by previous researches. The resulting Revised Bivariate Mixture (RBM) model has desirable properties that are fully consistent with empirical stylized facts, and the model also provides additional insights on price discovery process from a behavioural perspective. A multi-block Bayesian MCMC algorithm is proposed to estimate the model. The empirical results based on a sample of 8 stocks listed in the US stock market are summarized as follows. First, I find the existence of a common latent information flow process that drives the bivariate dynamics of return volatility and trading volume simultaneously, thus the empirical evidence is in favour of the Mixture of Distribution Hypothesis (MDH) of Clark [1973]. Second, the investors’ sentiment process is near unit root but the information flow process is much less persistent; this embedded two-factor structure is able to replicate the empirically observed autocorrelation functions of absolute return and trading volume. Third, the proportion of liquidity-driven trading volume is much higher in large-cap stocks than in small-cap tickers. Fourth, no statistical evidence is found to support the self-referential hypothesis in behaviour finance literature. Finally, there is strong evidence suggesting that the investors’ sentiment process might be a market-wide factor as the estimated latent sentiment processes are highly correlated within the sample of 8 stocks. In the second essay, I use the Stochastic Vector Multiplicative Error model (S-VMEM) of Hautsch [2008] to investigate on genuine multivariate intraday high-frequency dynamics between bid-ask spread, average dollar volume per trade, trade intensity and return volatility by taking into account the presence of serially correlated latent information flow. The simulation-based Maximum Likelihood with Efficient Importance Sampling (ML-EIS) technique is used to estimate the model. The main findings based on a sample of six heavily traded stocks listed in the US stock market are summarized as follows. First, the empirical evi- dence supports the Mixture of Distribution Hypothesis (MDH) even at 5 -min fre- quency by revealing the existence of unobserved serially correlated information flow. Second, a strong contemporaneous genuine dependence between return volatility and the other three transaction variables is found. Third, the impact of information flow is most significant for return volatility and trade intensity. This finding is in sharp contrast with previous studies like Blume et al. [1994], Xu and Wu [1999], Huang and Masulis [2003] and Hautsch [2008], where the authors find that it is the average trade size instead of trade intensity that is most infor- mative about the quality of news. This changing behaviour reflects that market impact becomes an increasing important concern when investors execute their trades, and consequently, they tend to break large order into many small child orders. Thus the number of trades carries more informative content about hidden market event than the average trade size does. Finally, impulse response analysis shows that the dynamics of bid-ask spread is little affected by a positive shock in the underlying news arrival process, and thus provides no evidence to support the asymmetric information market microstructure theory. In the third essay, motivated by the fact that inflation swap provides a cleaner source than government-issued inflation-linked bond to analyse inflation dynamics, I fit the no-arbitrage joint term structure of nominal interest rate and breakeven inflation rate to zero <b>coupon</b> inflation <b>swap</b> data in US, UK and EU markets. The model is estimated using the three-step regression technique outlined in Abrahams et al. [2013]. The empirical evidence suggests that the no-arbitrage joint term structure is able to describe the dynamics of breakeven inflation rate very well in all three eveloped markets, indicated by small pricing errors observed in nominal yield curve and inflation swap curve. What’s more, most variation in long-term forward BEI is attributed to the time-varying risk premium whereas the forward in- flation expectation remains stable over time. Finally, the model-implied inflation expectation outperforms the unadjusted BEI in terms of forecasting short-term realized inflation. Thus the no-arbitrage joint term structure model is potentially of considerable interest to investors and policy markers to help them make more informative macro decisions. Open Acces...|$|R
