25|$|In January 2007, the European {{parliament}} {{adopted a}} motion decreeing that all international trains must carry bicycles. In some cities, bicycles {{may also be}} carried on local trains, trams and buses {{so that they may}} be used {{at either end of the}} trip. The Rheinbahn transit company in Düsseldorf permits bicycle carriage on all its bus, tram and train services at any time of the day,. In Munich bicycles are allowed on the S-Bahn commuter trains outside of rush hours, and folding bikes are allowed on city busses. In Copenhagen, you <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> bicycle with you in the S-tog commuter trains, all times a day with no additional costs. In France, the prestigious TGV high-speed trains are even having some of their first class capacity converted to store bicycles. There have also been schemes, such as in Victoria, British Columbia, Acadia, and Canberra, Australia to provide bicycle carriage on buses using externally mounted bike carriers.|$|E

It is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 121 beats per minute. The music begins with a stuttering sounding trance-style synthesizer, right after one stanza is sung in the chorus, [...] "Ain't another woman that <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> spot my love". The word [...] "love" [...] is cut from the start. The song also includes Timbaland beatboxing and adding [...] "toy sounds", as well as Timberlake's falsetto. The track features a rap verse from rapper T.I. It also carries a slower beat, with an electro-Southern hip hop sound. The Guardian described the song as a [...] "languid love ballad, prickling with dark emotion", while MTV News described the beat as [...] "slow and saucy". Ben Williams of New York magazine wrote that it has [...] "stabbing techno riff, crunched-together mouth-popping noises, and wailing opera singer". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that the single is [...] "a twitching mass of rave synthesizers and [...] slow beats". Jacqui Swift of The Sun wrote that the song [...] "begins with a tinny percussion sound before launching into a frantic repetitive chorus".|$|E

2500|$|Island Records {{gave the}} band a choice: [...] "We're legally obliged {{to make your}} [...] but we’re not really up for it. So we either do it or do a half-arsed job of it or you <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> full record advance and leave." [...] The band took the advance {{and used it to}} build a {{recording}} studio in Watford in July 2013. A friend of the band had a lease on a few rehearsal rooms. The band initially wanted the room as a storage area for their equipment, but this soon changed into a storage and rehearsal area, then into a storage, rehearsal and recording studio. Sansom spent a week looking up studio equipment on Gumtree, which the band would drive to pick up. Two items of gear the band acquired was a tape machine and a 1980s recording console.|$|E
