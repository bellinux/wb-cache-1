For the case where the cake is a simplex (of random size) and the players share a common discount factor, we establish the existence of a unique stationary subgame perfect payoff which is efficient and characterize the conditions under which agreement is delayed. We also investigate how the equilibrium payoffs depend on the order in which the players move and on the correlation between the identity of the proposer and the <b>cake</b> <b>size.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We use a human–subjects {{experiment}} to investigate how bargaining outcomes {{are affected by}} changes in bargainers’disagreement payoffs. Subjects bargain against changing opponents, with an asymmetric disagreement outcome that varies over plays of the game. Both bargaining parties are informed of both disagreement payoffs (and the <b>cake</b> <b>size)</b> prior to bargaining. We find that bargaining outcomes do vary with the disagreement outcome, but subjects severely under–react {{to changes in the}}ir own disagreement payoff and to changes in the opponent’s disagreement payoff, relative to the risk–neutral prediction. This effect is observed in a standard Nash demand game and a related unstructured bargaining game, and for two different <b>cake</b> <b>sizes</b> varying by a factor of four. We show theoretically that standard models of expected utility maximisation are unable to account for this under–responsiveness – even when risk aversion is introduced.

40|$|Stochastic {{sequential}} bargaining games (Merlo and Wilson (1995, 1998)) {{have found}} wide applications in various fields including political economy and macroeconomics {{due to their}} flexibility in explaining delays in reaching agreement. In this paper, we present new results in nonparametric identification of such models under different scenarios of data availability. First, with complete data on players’ decisions, the sizes of the surplus to be shared (cakes) and the agreed allocations, both the mapping from states to the total surplus (i. e. the "cake function") and the players’ common discount rate are identified, if the unobservable state variable (USV) is independent of observable ones (OSV), and the total surplus is strictly increasing in the USV conditional on the OSV. Second, when the <b>cake</b> <b>size</b> is only observed under agreements and is additively separable in OSV and USV, the contribution by OSV is identified provided the USV distribution satisfies some distributional exclusion restrictions. Third, if data only report when an agreement is reached but never report the <b>cake</b> <b>sizes,</b> we propose a simple algorithm that exploits exogenously given shape restrictions on the cake function and the independence of USV from OSV to recover all rationalizable probabilities for reaching an agreement under counterfactual state transitions. Numerical examples show the set of rationalizable counterfactual outcomes so recovered can be informative.

40|$|We use a human-subjects {{experiment}} to investigate how bargaining outcomes {{are affected by}} changes in bargainers’ disagreement payoffs.

This effect is observed in a standard Nash demand game and a related unstructured bargaining game, in both early and late rounds, and is robust to moderate changes in stake sizes. We show theoretically that standard models of expected utility maximisation are unable to account for this under-responsiveness, even when generalised to allow for risk aversion. We also show that quantal-response equilibrium has, at best, mixed success in characterising our results. However, a simple model of other-regarding preferences can explain our main results...|$|R

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} develops some {{theoretical models}} which analyze {{the impact on}} wages of the financial and technological choices operated by firms. Chapter I considers the effects of technological change on efficiency-wages. We adopt Kremer's (1993) "O-Ring" production function, where technical progress can be represented through {{a change in the}} number of tasks to be performed in production. More complex production processes imply higher wage levels and higher general equilibrium unemployment. The model is extended to analyze within-group wage dispersion. In Chapter II, we adopt an alternating-calls strategic bargaining model where the incentive to reach an early agreement does not rely on time-preferences, but on intrinsic decay in the <b>cake's</b> <b>size.</b> When outside options remain positive and constant over time and the interval between calls shrinks to zero, the solution to this game converges to the Nash-solution, where the outside options take the status quo positions. This result contrasts with Rubinstein (1982), where outside options can matter only as corner- solutions. The model is extended to consider the role of market factors on wage determination. Chapter III considers the strategic role of debt in wage negotiations. Since debt provides a "credible threat" in bargaining, the entrepreneur can increase her profits by borrowing. Debt, thus, constitutes a (partial) remedy to Grout's (1984) under-investment problem. Chapter IV extends the model developed in Chapter III to analyze the implications that strategic borrowing can have on technological sophistication. We show that debt may have positive effects not only on the quantity of investment, but also on the degree of sophistication of the chosen projects. Chapter V (with G. Marini) analyses the role of foreign debt in promoting investment in Less Developed Countries that are subject to political risks. We show that, when default can trigger trade sanctions, foreign debt reduces the negative effects of political uncertainty on capital accumulation. Chapter VI (with F. Bagliano) contrasts the explanation for mark-up countercyclicality offered by the "price-war" model of Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) with the alternative explanation, based on "liquidity constraints", proposed by Chevalier and Scharfstein (1996) ...|$|R

Moreover, Muthoo presents many interesting applications of the theory, including issues such as optimal asset ownership, bribery and the control of crime, corruption in tax collection, and sovereign debt negotiations.

We study the optimal min-max cutter strategy. While the set of possible cuts is infinite (as the size of the pieces are real numbers), we show that for every (S,C) an optimal cutter move exists, and that such a move may be found efficiently. Furthermore, although making an optimal reply is NP-hard, the chooser is able to efficiently find a response achieving the game’s minmax value regardless of the cut chosen by the cutter. 1 Acknowledgments I wish to express my deep gratitude to my advisor, Prof. Uriel Feige, for his patience, help and deep insights which have repeatedly removed obstacles from my path and made complicated ideas simple. 2 Content...|$|R

Chitosan flakes were reduced in size using a cryo-milling technique. Milled powders were sieved between 45 and 125 μm aggregate sizes and characterized for particle size and distribution, morphology, and flow properties.

Lyophilization followed by milling produced irregularly shaped, polydisperse particles with a median primary particle diameter of ≈ 21 μm and a yield of ≈ 37 % of particles in the 45 to 125 μm particle size range. Flow properties of lactose and trehalose powders after lyophilization followed by milling and sieving were similar. Cryo-milling produced a small yield of particles in the desired size range (< 10 %). Lyophilization followed by milling and sieving produced particles suitable for nasal delivery with different physicochemical properties as a function of processing conditions and components of the formulation. Further optimization of particle size and morphology is required for these powders to be suitable for clinical evaluation...|$|R

The same variation is found within Slavic as well, where the relevant reading is constrained {{by the presence of}} the definite article. To account for the empirical observation, we propose that English-est and its Slavic counterpart naj- are interpreted inside definite DPs. The relevant reading requires DP-internal focus, but DP-internal-est cannot associate with DP-internal focus. Superlative nominal phrases can be indefinite in Slavic and in such cases naj- may QR out of the DP into the clause. DP-external naj- can associate with DP-internal focus, allowing the relevant reading. We conclude by discussing the significance of our findings and theory for the grammar of superlatives. 1.

In this study, flocculation followed by filtration of coal plant tailings, {{a new concept}} in tailings dewatering is investigated in detail. This paper focuses {{on the effect of}} preconditioning tailings with varying flocculants and dosages on filtration kinetics and the resultant moisture content of the filter cake. The results show that the cationic flocculant, MAGNAFLOC LT 425, requires a high dosage to produce a low moisture content filter cake and clear filtrate. Optimal sized flocs were produced with the anionic flocculant, MAGNAFLOC 5250, even though the particles are negatively charged. The kinetics of the filtration was dependent on the composition of process water as indicated by supporting sedimentation tests. The concentration of divalent alkali earth metals such as Ca(2 +) and Mg(2 +) allow for large floc growth by a bridging mechanism, which involves binding of the polymer and the negativity charged particle. Filtration and settling curves at this dosage were also supported by filter cake analysis using Darcy plots. It was found that the large floc size significantly increases the permeability of the filter <b>cake.</b> Floc <b>size</b> measurements and fractal dimension showed that while the large flocs were produced with anionic flocculant, the flocs produced with the cationic flocculant were small and weak. The results indicate that the optimum dosage and flocculant type for effective and efficient filtration of coal plant tailings is approximately 350 g/t of anionic flocculant at a 35 % solids content and 40 kPa filtration pressure.

If the proposal has some positive value to an agent {{it is not in}} his interest to veto. This poses the question what positive value means.

If the proposal yields higher value according to the preferences of an agent when compared to the status quo there will be no veto. But this refers to a {{take it or leave it}} situation. Even if one agent is better off with the proposal when compared with the status quo he might oppose to the proposal if there is a better alternative available in his view.

40|$|AbstractPulse-jet bag {{filters are}} {{frequently}} employed for particle removal from off gases. Separated solids form a layer on the permeable filter media called filter cake. The cake {{is responsible for}} increasing pressure drop. Therefore, the cake has to be detached at a predefined upper pressure drop limit or at predefined time intervals. Thus the process is intrinsically semi-continuous. The cake formation and cake detachment are interdependent and may influence {{the performance of the}} filter. Therefore, understanding formation and detachment of filter cake is important. In this regard, the filter media is the key component in the system. Needle felts are the most commonly used media in bag filters. Cake formation studies with heat treated and membrane coated needle felts in pilot scale pulse jet bag filter were carried out. The data is processed according to the procedures that were published already [Powder Technology, Volume 173, Issue 2, 19 April 2007, Pages 93 – 106]. Pressure drop evolution, cake height distribution evolution, cake patches area distribution and their characterization using fractal analysis on different needle felts are presented here. It is observed that concavity of pressure drop curve for membrane coated needle felt is principally caused by presence of inhomogeneous cake area load whereas it is inherent for heat treated media. Presence of residual cake enhances the concavity of pressure drop at the start of filtration cycle. Patchy cleaning is observed only when jet pulse pressure is too low and unable to provide the necessary force to detach the cake. The border line is very sharp. Based on experiments with limestone dust and three types of needle felts, for the jet pulse pressure above 4 bar and filtration velocity below 50 mm/s, cake is detached completely except a thin residual layer (100 – 200 μm). Uniformity and smoothness of residual cake depends on the surface characteristics of the filter media. Cake height distribution of residual cake and newly formed cake during filtration prevails. The patch size analysis and fractal analysis reveal that residual <b>cake</b> grow in <b>size</b> (latterly) following regeneration initially on the base with edges smearing out, however, the cake heights are not leveled off. Fractal dimension of cake patches boundary falls in the range of 1 – 1. 4 and depends on vertical position as well as time of filtration. Cake height measurements with Polyimide (PI) needle felts were hampered on account of its photosensitive nature...|$|R
