50|$|The {{probably}} best known way {{to select a}} channel from an input signal, is to first shift the frequency by multiplying it with a complex sinusoid, then pass the signal through a low pass filter and alternatively a decimator (rate changer).

50|$|In Digital signal processing, a <b>channelizer</b> is a {{term used}} for {{algorithms}} which select a certain frequency band from an input signal.

5000|$|An {{interesting}} way to understand/motivate {{the technique is}} to recall that decimation of sampled data in one domain (time or frequency) produces aliasing in the other, and vice versa. The xN summation is mathematically equivalent to aliasing, leading to decimation in frequency, leaving only DTFT samples least affected by spectral leakage. That is usually a priority when implementing an FFT filter-bank (<b>channelizer).</b> With a conventional window function of length L, scalloping loss would be unacceptable. So multi-block windows are created using FIR filter design tools. [...] Their frequency profile is flat at the highest point and falls off quickly at the midpoint between the remaining DTFT samples. The larger the value of parameter I the better the potential performance. We note that the same results {{can be obtained by}} computing and decimating an L-length DFT, but that is not computationally efficient.|$|E

40|$|RF and {{microwave}} multiplexers {{with a large}} number of output ports [...] called <b>channelizers</b> [...] have always posed a challenging design problem. Typical multiplexer designs use a set of channel filters connected at either a common port or through a manifold consisting of transmission lines (or waveguide) and tuning elements at the junction of, or between, separate channel filters. Nearly all modern multiplexer design methods rely on optimization of the individual channel filters and/or compensation networks used to reduce channel-to-channel interactions. Even with computer optimization, solutions for certain multiplexer topologies with more than about ten channels are often not possible, especially for units covering a wide bandwidth. The work presented here approaches the problem of designing wide bandwidth, contiguous-channel, multiplexing filters by implementing a model of the mammalian cochlea. The cochlea is an amazing channelizing filter, covering three decades of bandwidth with over 3, 000 channels in a very small physical space.

The overview makes liberal use of figures to support the underlying mathematics. A multichannel digital receiver simultaneously down-convert a set of frequency-division-multiplexed (FDM) channels residing in a single sampled data signal stream. In a similar way, a multichannel digital transmitter simultaneously up-converts a number of baseband signals to assemble a set of FDM channels in a single sampled data signal stream. The polyphase filter bank has become the architecture of choice to efficiently accomplish these tasks. This architecture uses three interacting processes to assemble or to disassemble the channelized signal set. In a receiver, these processes are an input commutator to effect spectral folding or aliasing due {{to a reduction in}} sample rate, a polyphase-path filter to time align the partitioned and resampled time series in each path, and a discrete Fourier transform to phase align and separate the multiple baseband aliases. In a transmitter, these same processes operate in a related manner to alias baseband signals to high order Nyquist zones while increasing the sample rate with the output commutator. This paper presents a sequence of simple modifications to sampled data structures based on analog prototype systems to obtain the basic polyphase structure. We further discuss ways to incorporate small modifications in the operation of the polyphase system to accommodate secondary performance requirements. MATLAB simulations of a 10 -, 40 -, and 50 -channel resampling receiver are included in the electronic version of this paper.

30|$|The {{processes}} of FBMC signal transmission and reception usually require several rate conversion operations between the multiplexed signals {{and the different}} subchannels. This is similar to what happens in MC demultiplexer/demodulators (MCDD) in satellite broadcasting [42], in cable TV <b>channelizers</b> [43], or in time-division to frequency-division multiplexing (TDM-to-FDM) [44], where several users and data streams are channelized into different subbands of the transmission bandwidth. The efficient implementation of such user and rate adaptation is done through the so-called polyphase architectures, which allow a significant reduction of the overall complexity by reordering the way down-conversion and filtering operations are carried out in traditional transceivers. Interestingly, polyphase architectures lead naturally to parallel architectures where intensive and high-rate computations are converted {{into a series of}} simple and low-rate simultaneous operations. For the case of high-rate filtering, the efficient implementation is based on the so-called filter banks, which are nothing but a bank of parallel short-length filters implementing the equivalent filtering operation at a much lower clock rate [45]. It {{is interesting to note that}} multi-rate filter bank systems are widely adopted in DVB satellite transponders [46], which can be understood in general terms as a multi-user multi-carrier system. For the case of flexible FBMC communication systems, in which a single user has actually allocated multiple carriers, the application of traditional filter bank architectures is not straightforward. The reasons are the different signal parameters, design constraints and performance metrics of these systems, and the actual impact of coherently processing several subcarriers at the signal level (e.g., the impact in terms of latency across subcarriers or the resulting mean square bandwidth, which is of interest for positioning applications). In view of this limitation, a dedicated study is required in order to come up with efficient architectures enabling FBMC communication as well as positioning systems. To this end, we will start first by briefly reviewing the basics of multi-rate digital signal processing and filter banks theory [47], and then we will proceed by presenting the proposed schemes enabling both transmit and receive architectures for FBMC communication systems.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the design, fabrication, and laboratory-demonstration {{of a novel}} dual-polarized multichroic antenna-coupled Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometer. Each pixel separates the incident millimeter radiation into two linear polarization channels {{as well as several}} frequency channels (bands). This technology enables us to realize bolometer arrays for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarimetry measurements that map the sky at multiple colors while simultaneously boosting the optical throughput over what would have been attained from arrays of single-frequency channel detectors. Observations at multiple frequency channels are important for differentiating polarized galactic foregrounds and atmospheric fluctuations from the CMB. Each pixel couples free-traveling radiation onto lithographed microstrip transmission lines prior to the bolometers using a dual-polarized broadband antenna known as a sinuous antenna. The transmission lines are integrated onto the back of the antenna arms and the antennas are in direct contact with an extended-hemispherical lens. We show measurements of scale model (4 - 12 GHz) and to-scale (80 - 240 Hz) antennas to demonstrate high antenna-gain, low cross-polarization contamination, and efficient coupling over a 1 - 2 octave bandwidth. We have developed microstrip circuits that divide the antenna's wide bandwidth into smaller channels. In one scheme, two or three frequency channels can be extracted from the antenna's received power using microstrip circuits known as diplexers and triplexers. These avoid atmospheric spectral lines and are well suited to terrestrial observations. We can also partition this bandwidth into contiguous bands using cochlear <b>channelizers</b> inspired by the physiology of the human ear; this design is most advantageous for satellite missions where there are no concerns about atmospheric contamination.

We also {{describe the}} fabrication of a broadband anti-reflection coating for the contacting lenses and demonstrate that lens-coupled sinuous pixels receive more power with the coatings than without. Finally, we remark on the last un-resolved challenge of forming symmetric beams and balun designs that may help form patterns more useful for polarimetry. This technology is a candidate for use in the Polarbear ground-based experiment. By packing more detectors into the focal-plane than can be done with monochromatic pixels, multichroic pixels will allow Polarbear to map the sky much faster. This technology is also candidate for future space-based missions as well, where multhchroic pixels will allow a less massive payload and hence a lower cost mission. Finally, we envision using arrays of similar pixels in sub-millimeter observations of high-redshift galaxy clusters as well (e. g. example Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect measurements). However, we require more sophisticated lithography and etching techniques to shrink these pixels to a size suitable for such wavelengths...|$|R
