40|$|The aim is {{to develop}} the basic {{principles}} of using current pulse annealing for control of the characteristics in the integrated strain transducers with polysilicon resistance strain gauges. The models for analysis of the parameters in the current pulse necessary for annealing and also the models of the processing taking place at annealing have been developed. The methods for determination of the grain boundary properties in the high-alloy polysilicon have been created. The values of parameters in the current pulse necessary for annealing have been determined. The change of the polysilicon resistance strain gauge and pressure transducer characteristics under action of the current annealing has been investigated.

40|$|Balancing is an {{effective}} way of reducing vibration and reaction forces in rotor’s bearings. Two main approaches of modal balancing and influence coefficients method {{have been used for}} this aim. However, by considering specific balancing procedure for each rotor and addressing and detecting many of the unbalance sources in manufacturing and assembly this reduction can be ensured in earlier stage. This thesis provides the theories and backgrounds, in addition of a step by step guidelines for rotor balancing. Then applies those theories and guidelines in order to balance a sample flexible rotor, supported by magnetic bearings, in high-speed. Possible unbalance sources are considered in the text. A simulation analysis featuring the effect of variation of the arrangement {{in a part of the}} system components is provided. The results of the study indicate that the performance of influence coefficient method was great for the magnetic bearing supported rotor.

40|$|Studies {{concerned}} with the mechanisms responsible for relative resistance or susceptibility of strains of inbred mice to Trypanosoma musculi infections are presented. Treatment with 400 rads of ionizing radiation, silica dust, or trypan blue (reticuloendothelial blocking agents) rendered C 3 H mice unable to <b>control</b> the <b>initial</b> maximum level of parasite growth, and the mice died of overwhelming infections. In contrast, similarly treated C 57 BL/ 6 (relatively resistant) mice <b>controlled</b> <b>initial</b> trypanosome growth as well as controls; however, the duration of infection, preceding eventual cure, was approximately doubled. Combined treatment with trypan blue and 400 rads of radiation resulted in much higher initial levels of infection in C 57 BL/ 6 mice, and {{about half of the}} mice died; the remaining mice eventually recovered after a prolonged course of infection. These results indicate that a nonimmunological mechanism, which <b>controls</b> <b>initial</b> infection, and an immunological mechanism cooperate to limit T. musculi infections in normal mice. We present results that suggest that both mechanisms are less effective in C 3 H than in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. The <b>initial</b> <b>control</b> of infection presumably reflects the activity of some type(s) of phagocytic effector cell; we show, however, that the <b>initial</b> <b>control</b> of infection is not an attribute of the liver Kupffer cells.

Firstly, this paper discussed the way to implement intelligence milling balance measurement system based on embedded (Open Multimedia Application Platform, OMAP), OMAP dual-core architecture could reasonably plan the general task of the balance test system according to its advantages, and used ARM subsystem to complete control function of the balance mechanical’s electrical system; DSP subsystem realized digital signal processing and calculation of unbalance. Secondly, in order to accurately extracted the characteristics of unbalanced signal from strong interference sources and effectively restrain signal interference, the software designed and completed tracking digital band pass filter based on harmonic wavelet package. Used the harmonic wavelet packet with the feature of infinite segmentation for the signal in the frequency domain to extract the characteristics of any period of weak signal. The simulation results showed that the digital band pass tracking filter based on harmonic wavelet packet can effectively restrain the nearly frequency signal interference, improve the signal-to-noise ratio, restore the <b>initial</b> <b>unbalance</b> signal characteristics. In high-speed situations (15000 RPM above), the system can achieve high efficiency, high precision and intelligence targets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a tool, based on the {{knowledge}} of technical errors, which helps to improve the teaching and learning process of the Uki Goshi technique. With this aim, we set out to determine the most frequent errors made by 44 students when performing this technique and how these mistakes relate. In order to do so, an observational analysis was carried out using the OSJUDO-UKG instrument and the data were registered using Match Vision Studio (Castellano, Perea, Alday and Hernández, 2008). The results, analyzed through descriptive statistics, show that the absence of a correct <b>initial</b> <b>unbalancing</b> movement (45, 5 %), the lack of proper right-arm pull (56, 8 %), not blocking the faller's body (Uke) against the thrower's hip -Tori- (54, 5 %) and throwing the Uke through the Tori's side are the most usual mistakes (72, 7 %). Through the sequencial analysis of T-Patterns obtained with the THÈME program (Magnusson, 1996, 2000) we have concluded that not blocking the body with the Tori's hip provokes the Uke's throw through the Tori's side during the final phase of the technique (95, 8 %), and positioning the right arm on the dorsal region of the Uke's back during the Tsukuri entails the absence of a subsequent pull of the Uke's body (73, 3 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Auto-{{balancing}} or {{active control}} balancing can be efficient solutions for high speed rotors with changing out-of-balance loads like washing machines in spin-drying mode. In the LoWash EU project, Vibratec {{is in charge}} to design, to build and to validate a balancing system for reducing the vibrations at high spin-drying speeds. The system is based on two trolleys rolling in a ring linked to the drum. The trolley shape allows a ring cross section optimization and they are equipped with a mechanism for escaping the disadvantage encountered at low speeds by similar devices. Analytical and multi-body models are first made for understanding the mechanisms, highlighting the driving parameters and drawing the final design of a first prototype which is inserted in a washing machine drum. Different tests are carried out for different <b>initial</b> <b>unbalances</b> and different rotation speeds: the residual unbalance is measured {{by means of a}} set of accelerometers mounted on the tub, while the mobile masses behaviour is observed by means of a large aperture swift camera. The test results highlight the auto-balancer high efficiency but also the sensitivity to geometrical defects which should be corrected in the next systems. According the theory, the balancing is efficient when the rotation frequency is significantly greater than the hanging frequencies. The multi-body model relevance is also demonstrated. A washer-dryer prototype including an auto-balancer second prototype and two other innovations, regarding thermal exchange efficiency and drum insulation, will be tested in operating conditions...|$|R
