40|$|Mantle pyroxenites are the <b>crystallised</b> <b>products</b> of mafic {{silicate}} melts, {{which are}} commonly invoked as metasomatic {{agents in the}} upper mantle. This study has analysed the trace elements of sulfides, with a specific focus on gold, hosted in a suite of mantle pyroxenite xenoliths from Qilin in the Cathaysia Block, southeast China. These are compared with sulfides hosted in peridotite xenoliths from the same locality to assess {{the difference in the}} abundances of Au, and a suite of siderophile and chalcophile elements between the sulfides hosted in mobile melts in the upper mantle and their host “wall” rocks. Both the peridotite- and pyroxenite-hosted sulfides show a wide spectrum of trace element contents. The pyroxenite-hosted sulfides typically have PGE and Au concentrations that are an order of magnitude or more below those measured in the peridotite-hosted sulfides (lherzolite-hosted sulfides: total PGE = 95 ± 118 ppm, Au = 1. 4 ± 2. 6 ppm; pyroxenite-hosted sulfides: total PGE = 0. 25 ± 0. 70 ppm, Au = 0. 14 ± 0. 39 ppm). Furthermore, the Ir group PGE (Ir, Os and Ru) are present in lower concentrations than the Pd-group PGE (Pd, Pt and Rh). This may lead to a distinct signature if the melts from which these sulfides crystallise interact with lherzolitic sulfides. The overall low abundances of these elements within the pyroxenites suggests that the parent melts are an inefficient medium for enriching any of these elements in the upper mantle. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{undertaken in}} this project has involved the synthesis of the carbon nitride material C 6 N 9 H 3. HCl under high pressures and temperatures in the piston cylinder apparatus. The synthesis conditions of the material have been perfected and the relatively well <b>crystallised</b> <b>products</b> have been characterised in several ways to try {{to gain a better}} understanding of the structure of the material. Characterisation techniques used include; elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, visible, ultraviolet and Fourier Transform Raman spectroscopy. The behaviour of the C 6 N 9 H 3. HCl material has also been studied further under very high pressures. Diamond anvil cell techniques and synchrotron X-ray radiation have been used to investigate the materials structural behaviour up to pressures in excess of 60 GPa. The decompression of the material has also been investigated. Investigation of the behaviour at high pressures using FTIR was also attempted. The ambient pressure characterisation, high pressure behaviour and decompression of the material have been compared in detail to computational calculations performed on the model structure proposed for the material. Interesting advances in the understanding of the ambient pressure structure and of the high pressure behaviour of the material have been made and the significant structural changes in the material at very high pressures have been explained by the comparison of the experimental and computational results. Due to the highly fluorescent nature of the material under visible Raman lasers it was not possible to obtain Raman spectra of the material in the laboratory at UCL. Therefore the material has been studied using UV and FT Raman techniques using equipment in laboratories in Lyon and Grenoble in France and in Nottingham, UK, in an attempt to obtain vibrational spectra without exciting electronic transitions and to gain more information about the structure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe telluric {{planets and}} the {{asteroid}} belt display the same internal structure with a metallic inner core and a silicate outer shell. Experimental data and petrological evidence in silicate systems show that granite can be produced by extreme igneous differentiation through various types of igneous processes. On Moon, 4. 4 - 3. 9 Ga granite clasts display dry mineral assemblages. They correspond to at least 8 discrete intrusive events. Large K/Ca enrichment and low REE abundances in granite relative to KREEP are consistent with silicate liquid immiscibility, a process observed in melt inclusions within olivine of lunar basalts and in lunar meteorites. Steep-sided domes identified by remote sensing can represent intrusive or extrusive felsic formations. On Mars, black-and-white rhythmic layers observed on the Tharsis rise along the flanks of the peripheral scarps of the Tharsis Montes giant volcanoes suggest the possible eruption of felsic pyroclastites. Though no true granites were found {{so far in the}} Martian SNC meteorites, felsic glasses and mesostases were identified and a component close to terrestrial continental (granitic) crust is inferred from trace element and isotope systematics. Venus has suffered extensive volcanic resurfacing, whereas folded and faulted areas resemble terrestrial continents. Near large shield volcanoes, with dominant basaltic compositions, steep-sided domes have been interpreted as non-degassed silicic extrusions. The hypothesis of a granitic component is "tantalising". Extra-terrestrial granite is frequently found as clasts and mesostases in asteroidal meteorites. Porphyritic textures, with alkali feldspar crystals up to several centimetres in size, were observed in silicate enclaves within iron meteorites. In the chondrite clan, polymict breccias can contain granitic clasts, whose provenance is debated. One clast from the Adzhi-Bogdo meteorite yields a 4. 53 ± 0. 03 Ga Pb-Pb age, making it the oldest known granite in the solar system. The vast majority of granitic materials recognised so far in the extra-terrestrial record are characterised by ferroan A-type compositions, characterised by high to very high K 2 O and medium CaO contents, sodic varieties being exceedingly rare. Textural evidence of graphic quartz-alkali feldspar intergrowths within <b>crystallised</b> <b>products</b> suggests that they are igneous in origin and crystallised quickly from a liquid. In water-depleted to water-free environments, fluorine and chlorine can play significant roles, as their effects on liquidus temperatures and crystallising assemblages are nearly identical to those of water. The distribution of alkalis and alkaline earths cannot be related only to extensive crystal fractionation, but is likely induced by supplementary silicate liquid immiscibility. Medium-temperature silicate liquid immiscibility is well known as a mode of differentiation in experimental petrology studies at very low pressures on systems dominated by Fe, Ti, K, and P as major elements. The ultimate question is, therefore, not whether granite (s. l.) occurs in any given planetary body, but if sufficient volumes of granitic materials could have been produced to constitute stable continental nuclei...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{detailed in}} this dissertation expands {{the field of}} knowledge {{in the area of}} numerical modelling of cooling crystallisation processes in stirred vessels. The paracetamol and ethanol solution system was chosen as the model system, which represents a typical Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) cooling crystallisation process. This solution system exhibits three competing crystallisation mechanisms of primary nucleation, secondary nucleation and crystal growth. The primary nucleation rate as a function of absolute supersaturation was successfully evaluated using two approaches, namely Meta-Stable Zone Width (MSZW) and induction time experiments. The induction time was observed to be independent of the solution temperature, a novel finding, as suggested by Kubota 2 ̆ 7 s theory. The growth kinetics of paracetamol in ethanol solutions, were evaluated by means of isothermal seeded batch experiments. The growth kinetics of paracetamol crystals were evaluated in isolation, with the growth rate assumed to be size independent, using a method previously suggested by Schöll et al. (2007 a) which was modified for cooling crystallisation processes. The technique utilises a combination of in-situ Process Analytical Technologies (PAT), ex-situ analysis methods and population balance modelling to determine growth kinetics of the solute crystals. A quantitative approach to the evaluation of the minimum seed loading was employed, to ensure negligible nucleation occurred. Initial Particle Size Distributions (PSDs) were used in conjunction with desupersaturation profiles to determine the growth rate as a function of temperature and supersaturation. The secondary nucleation kinetics were determined in a similar manner, by means of isothermal under-seeded batch experiments. In this case, insufficient seed loadings were employed, so that nucleation and growth of secondary nuclei contributed significantly to the mass of the final product. With knowledge of the primary nucleation and crystal growth kinetics, the secondary nucleation kinetics were evaluated in isolation {{for a wide range of}} experimental conditions. The Method of Moments (MOM) approach was utilised to solve the population balance equation. However, this method does not conserve the actual PSD, with a reconstruction technique required to produce the PSD from its respective moments. A recently suggested (Hutton et al. 2012) PSD reconstruction method, involving the generation of moment surfaces as a function of the distribution parameters was employed in this thesis. A wide range of conditions for supersaturation, solution temperature and cooling mode were employed to evaluate the robustness of the nucleation (both primary and secondary) and growth rate kinetics. The numerical model was subsequently employed to optimise the temperature cooling profile for certain process objectives, such as improved product PSD, with reduced fine particles. Experimental validation of optimised processes were conducted to verify simulated improvements to the final <b>crystallised</b> <b>product,</b> which served to further validate the estimated process kinetics. Finally, the MOM and Method of Classes (MOC) approaches to modelling crystallisers were compared. The outputs of the numerical model developed in this thesis were compared to a commercially available crystallisation modelling software gCRYSTAL®, which employed the MOC approach, comparing corresponding simulated concentrations, final yields and PSDs. The effects of impeller type, material and blade width on the measured secondary nucleation rate were also investigated in a qualitative manner. A significant finding from this work was the major quantifiable effects of impeller material, in particular stainless steel, on the secondary nucleation kinetics. In combination with a different mixing regime, this effect largely explained the observed differences in the secondary nucleation kinetics measured in this thesis and the available literature data. Finally, a novel method which allows for the rapid and accurate calibration of the ATR-FTIR spectral data for the prediction of dissolved solution concentration, was also outlined and verified using the paracetamol and ethanol solution system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to characterise the aerosolisation {{properties}} of salbutamol sulphate (SS) from dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations containing different carrier products. The difference in the elongation ratio (ER) of the different carriers was highlighted. Different set of carriers, namely commercial mannitol (CM), commercial lactose (CL), cooling crystallised mannitol (CCM), acetone crystallised mannitol (ACM) and ethanol crystallised mannitol (ECM) were used and inspected in terms of size, shape, density, crystal form, flowability, and in vitro aerosolisation performance using Multi Stage Liquid Impinger (MSLI) and Aerolizer inhaler device. Solid-state and morphological characterization showed that CM product was in pure β-form having particles with smaller ER (CM: ER= 1. 62 ± 0. 04) whereas ACM and ECM mannitol particles were in pure α form with higher ER (ACM: ER= 4. 83 ± 0. 18, ECM: ER= 5. 89 ± 0. 19). CCM <b>product</b> <b>crystallised</b> as mixtures of β-form and δ-form and showed the largest variability in terms of particle shape, size, and DPI performance. Linear relationships were established showing that carrier products with higher ER have smaller bulk density (D(b)), smaller tap density (D(t)), higher porosity (P), and poorer flow properties. In vitro aerosolisation assessments showed that the higher the ER of the carrier particles the greater the amounts of SS delivered to lower airway regions indicating enhanced DPI performance. Yet, DPI performance enhancement by increasing carrier ER reached a "limit" as increasing carrier ER from 4. 83 ± 0. 18 (ACM) to 5. 89 ± 0. 19 (ECM) did not significantly alter fine particle fraction (FPF) of SS. Also, carrier particles with higher ER were disadvantageous in terms of higher amounts of SS remained in inhaler device (drug loss) and deposited on throat. Linear relationship was established (r(2) = 0. 87) showing that the higher the carrier ER the lower the drug emission (EM) upon inhalation. Moreover, poorer flowability for carrier products with higher ER is disadvantageous in terms of DPI formulation dose metering and processing on handling scale. In conclusion, despite that using carrier particles with higher ER can considerably increase the amounts of drug delivered to lower airway regions; this enhancement is restricted to certain point. Also, other limitations should be taken into account including higher drug loss and poorer flowability...|$|R
40|$|Research in {{this thesis}} investigates a simple, rapid, {{reproducible}} and specific liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) method for the simultaneous detection, confirmation and quantitation of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and its metabolites beclomethasone monopropionate (BMP) and beclomethasone (BOH) which has been developed and validated. The method was validated over a concentration range from 0. 001 - 100 mg/L for BDP and 0. 01 - 10 mg/L for BOH. The calibration graphs exhibited excellent linearity with typical R 2 values for BDP of 0. 997 and for BOH of 0. 999. The analytes stability was investigated and they {{were found to be}} stable for many weeks. BDP was introduced as the first inhaled glucocorticoid for the treatment of asthma in the 1970 s and is still a major treatment for asthma nowadays. BDP is an inactive prodrug; for BDP to be effective, it needs to be activated to its active form, beclomethasone- 17 -monopropionate (17 -BMP) and beclomethasone- 21 -monopropionate (21 -BMP). The method involved in vitro metabolism of the BDP, incubated with esterase enzyme at 37 ° C for 2 hrs. The product was analysed by LC-MS. A liquid-liquid extraction procedure was used to purify the products, with four different solvents and five sequential extractions, for initial extraction steps. The extracts were analysed by LC-MS. Extraction with ether gave very good results with 99 % extraction of the required products. For the first time new methods of labelling steroids, including progesterone and testosterone, with rhenium-containing luminescent labels. For this purpose rhenium complex with 3, 3 ’-diamino- 2, 2 ’-bipyridine (complex 1) was used as a fluorescent label for various biomolecules. Preparative HPLC, LC-MS, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography have been used to identify and characterize the products formed. The timed reaction of complex 1 with progesterone was run using the newly developed chromatographic method (55 % MeCN, 0. 5 mL/min). A solution of complex 1 and progesterone in acetonitrile was heated in the dark for 3 hrs followed by a timed NMR experiment for 6 hours, collecting data at regular intervals. The sample was separated using the preparative HPLC which showed some side products and two overlapping peaks for the product isomers. The single-crystal X-ray structure of the Re-progesterone product was obtained and measurements of selected bond lengths showed a rearrangement of the double bond between C 4 and C 5 had occurred at the conjugated end of the progesterone. The refined structure further confirmed the shifting of the double bond. For the analagous product of complex 1 and testosterone attempts were made to <b>crystallise</b> the <b>product</b> both by slow evaporation and by refrigeration of an acetonitrile solution of fraction 2. To date these attempts have been unsuccessful. Finally, the research work was conducted to combine the work presented above by using enzymatic reactions to modify a biomolecule for reaction with the rheniumcontaining complex 1. Galactose oxidase catalyses the oxidations of primary alcohols to the corresponding aldehyde with the reduction of dioxygen to hydrogen peroxide. Research presented {{in this part of the}} thesis investigates different methodologies for the oxidation of methyl �-D-galactopyranoside with the help of galactose oxidase to form an aldehyde-containing sugar which will react with the diamino moieties of complex 1. The best method to work with was found to be method 2 using catalase suspension, galactose oxidase and HRP in deionised water. The reaction mixture gave a fairly pure product in good yields...|$|R

In contrast, reaction of Zn(II) acetate with 1 and salicylaldehyde led to Schiff base exchange (with loss of benzoylacetylacetone) to yield symmetric [ZnL 3] [where L 3 is N,N′-o-phenylenebis(salicyliminato) ]. Similarly, when Fe(II) chloride was substituted for metal acetate in the reaction of 1 with 5 -tert-butyl- salicylaldehyde and the initial <b>product</b> <b>crystallised</b> in the presence of dabco (as base), a related Schiff base exchange reaction occurred along with aerial oxidation of the Fe(II) to produce the neutral dinuclear [Fe III(L 4) 2 (μ-O) ] species [where L 4 is N,N′-o-phenylenebis(5 -tert-butylsalicyliminato) ] in which Fe(III) centres are linked by an oxo group to produce two 5 -coordinate Fe(III) centres; pairs of these (oxo-bridged) dinuclear complex units are further linked via elongated intermolecular Fe-Ophenolic contacts (Fe-O, 2. 44 Å) to form an unusual tetranuclear supramolecular cluster. This complex was also synthesised directly by the in situ reaction of 5 -tert-butyl-salicylaldehyde, o-phenylenediamine and Fe(II) chloride (2 : 1 : 1 mol ratio) in air. In an extension of these studies, the in situ reaction of the 1, 3 -aryl linked bis-β-diketone, 1, 1 -(1, 3 -phenylene) -bis-butane- 1, 3 -dione), o-phenylenediamine, salicylaldehyde and Ni(II) acetate in a 1 : 2 : 2 : 2 ratio yielded [Ni 2 L 5], the dinuclear analogue of the unsymmetric mononuclear Ni(II) complex 2, in which each nickel centre has a square planar environment. Reaction of the above 1, 3 -phenylene linked bis-β-diketone precursor with o-phenylenediamine in a 1 : 2 M ratio yields 1, 3 -bis(4 -methyl- 3 H- benzo[b][1, 4]diazepin- 2 -yl) benzene as its monohydrate (3 ·H 2 O) incorporating two 7 -membered diaza heterocyclic rings; thus contrasting with the 2 ̆ 7 open 2 ̆ 7 Schiff base structure observed for 1.
