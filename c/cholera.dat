40|$|The {{possible}} {{production of}} a heat-stable enterotoxin (Vc-H-ST) by Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> non-Ol serogroup Hakata was investigated, and the purified Vc-H-ST was characterized.

This sequence is quite {{similar to that of}} the heat-stable enterotoxin (NAG-ST) produced by V. <b>cholerae</b> non-Ol except for one amino acid (leucine) residue excess at the N terminus. Other characteristics, including biological activity, are compatible with those of NAG-ST. Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> non-Ol serogroup Hakata, often isolated from the environment and from imported seafood in Japan, is a new serotype of V. <b>cholerae</b> non-O 1 proposed by Shimada et al. (7).

40|$|In gram-negative organisms, high-affinity {{transport}} of iron substrates requires energy transduction to specific outer membrane receptors by the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex. Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> encodes two TonB proteins, one of which, TonB 1, recognizes only {{a subset of}} V. <b>cholerae</b> TonB-dependent receptors and does not facilitate transport through Escherichia coli receptors. To investigate the receptor specificity exhibited by V. <b>cholerae</b> TonB 1, chimeras were created between V. <b>cholerae</b> TonB 1 and E. coli TonB. The activities of the chimeric TonB proteins in iron utilization assays demonstrated that the C-terminal one-third of either TonB confers the receptor specificities associated with the full-length TonB. Single-amino-acid substitutions near the C terminus of V. <b>cholerae</b> TonB 1 were identified that allowed TonB 1 to recognize E. coli receptors {{and at least one}} V. <b>cholerae</b> TonB 2 -dependent receptor. This indicates that the very C-terminal end of V. <b>cholerae</b> TonB 1 determines receptor specificity. The regions of the TonB-dependent receptors involved in specificity for a particular TonB protein were investigated in experiments involving domain switching between V. <b>cholerae</b> and E. coli receptors exhibiting different TonB specificities. Switching the conserved TonB box heptapeptides at the N termini of these receptors did not alter their TonB specificities. However, replacing the amino acid immediately preceding the TonB box in E. coli receptors with an aromatic residue allowed these receptors to use V. <b>cholerae</b> TonB 1. Further, site-directed mutagenesis of the TonB box − 1 residue in a V. <b>cholerae</b> TonB 2 -dependent receptor demonstrated that a large hydrophobic amino acid in this position promotes recognition of V. <b>cholerae</b> TonB 1. These data suggest that the TonB box − 1 position controls productive interactions with V. <b>cholerae</b> TonB 1...|$|R

40|$|Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> O 139 synonym Bengal {{recently}} caused large epidemics of cholera-like {{disease in}} Bangladesh and India.

Ribotyping of the isolates with BglI revealed that all 29 isolates of O 139 vibrios belonged to a single ribotype, suggesting a clonal nature of the infection. However, the O 139 vibrios comprised two ctxA genotypes and carried three or more copies of the ctxA gene, and the chromosomal locations of these copies were unlike those of the El Tor or classical vibrios.
