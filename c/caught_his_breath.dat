60|$|Captain Gibbs <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{and looked}} appealingly at the mate.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Blundell <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{and gazed}} at him in {{speechless}} amaze.|$|E
60|$|The skipper <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{and tried}} to gaze at the averted face.|$|E
60|$|Half {{a minute}} later Bill cut open the {{mattress}} and began to search through the stuffing, while I struck matches and watched 'im. It wasn't a big mattress and there wasn't much stuffing, but we couldn't seem to see that money. Bill went all over it ag'in and ag'in, and then 'e stood {{up and looked at}} me and <b>caught</b> <b>'is</b> <b>breath</b> painful.|$|R
60|$|He <b>caught</b> at <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>his</b> face twitched, and {{his left}} hand sank to his side, but he wheeled the black horse with his right and left us without another word, while Grace sat looking after him with a white face and tears in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy gave tongue with {{an energy}} that amazed his {{faithful}} follower. The nightmare {{horror of the}} situation had affected him much as a sudden blow in the parts about the waistcoat might have done. But, now, as Spike would have said, he <b>caught</b> up with <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> The smirk faded slowly from the other's face as he listened. Not even in the Bowery, full as it was of candid friends, had he listened to such a trenchant summing-up of his mental and moral deficiencies.|$|R
60|$|The adjutant, {{turning to}} look, <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{suddenly}} in an exclamation of astonishment.|$|E
60|$|He {{shook his}} head, {{and with a}} deep sign as of awakening, <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|His lordship's eyes {{dropped to}} the letter again. He <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> in sudden fear.|$|E
6000|$|From which eloquent flow of {{language}} we may infer that the friendship {{between these two}} worthies was not of very old duration. Rateau would, no doubt, have protested loudly, but the fresh outer air had evidently <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> wheezy lungs, and {{for a minute or}} two he could do nothing but cough and splutter and groan, and cling to his unresponsive comrade for support. Then at last, when he had succeeded in recovering <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> he said dolefully and with a ludicrous attempt at dignified reproach: ...|$|R
60|$|A little spot {{of black}} moving {{against the white}} snow <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> sharp eyes. What was it? He leaned forward and held <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> {{as he tried to}} make sure. Ah, now he could see! Just ahead of that black thing was a long, slim fellow all in white, and that black spot was his tail. If it hadn't been for that, Happy Jack very likely wouldn't have seen him at all. It was Shadow the Weasel! He was running swiftly, first to one side and then to the other, with his nose to the snow. He was hunting. There was no doubt about that. He was hunting for his breakfast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I'm glad {{he took my}} part," [...] {{came from}} Campwell, as he arose slowly to his feet, for the fall had {{deprived}} him of <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "You took a mean advantage o' me. I've a good mind to fill ye full o' buckshot!" [...] And he <b>caught</b> hold of <b>his</b> gun threateningly.|$|R
60|$|How cold she was! How {{unattainable}} in that moment! He <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and rushed}} on.|$|E
60|$|Stephen <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> There was a {{long pause}} no one cared to start the bidding.|$|E
60|$|Erling <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> and {{the blood}} rushed to his temples as he gazed {{for a moment in}} silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I declaimed {{for five}} minutes without drawing breath, it seems to me, harping on our best chances, on the ferocity of Montero, whom I made {{out to be as}} great a beast as I have no doubt he would like to be if he had {{intelligence}} enough to conceive a systematic reign of terror. And then for another five minutes or more I poured out an impassioned appeal to their courage and manliness, with all the passion of my love for Antonia. For if ever man spoke well, it would be from a personal feeling, denouncing an enemy, defending himself, or pleading for what really may be dearer than life. My dear girl, I absolutely thundered at them. It seemed as if my voice would burst the walls asunder, and when I stopped I saw all their scared eyes looking at me dubiously. And that was all the effect I had produced! Only Don Jose's head had sunk lower and lower on his breast. I bent my ear to his withered lips, and made out his whisper, something like, 'In God's name, then, Martin, my son!' I don't know exactly. There was the name of God in it, I am certain. It seems to me I have <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> last breath--the <b>breath</b> of <b>his</b> departing soul on his lips.|$|R
6000|$|He {{had begun}} to seek for <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> with deep sighs. [...] "The blue phial," [...] said he--"in the aumry--the blue phial." [...] <b>His</b> <b>breath</b> came slower still.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bultiwell groaned under <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> <b>His</b> {{eyes met}} {{the eyes of}} his old employé.|$|R
60|$|The vagrant {{leaped to}} his feet and raised both {{trembling}} arms above his head. He <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and moaned hysterically.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night, Scaramouche," [...] she said, but so softly, so tenderly, that he <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and stood}} conning her, {{his dark eyes}} aglow.|$|E
60|$|Levasseur looked, and <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Two {{ships that}} at the {{distance}} seemed of considerable burden were heading towards them some five miles away.|$|E
60|$|Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, {{looking down}} from the top of a tall tree, held their breath. Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and his cousin, Chatterer the Red Squirrel, looking down from another tree, held their breath. Unc' Billy Possum, {{sticking}} his head out from a hollow tree, held <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Bobby Coon, looking through a hole in a hollow stump in which he was hiding, held <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Reddy Fox, lying flat down behind a heap of brush, held <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Peter Rabbit, sitting bolt upright under a thick hemlock branch, with eyes and ears wide open, held <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> And all the other little people who happened to be where they could see did the same thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't say that," [...] he {{answered}} placidly, with that appearance of saving <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> <b>his</b> restrained {{manner of speaking}} suggested.|$|R
40|$|This man tortures {{himself by}} holding <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> <b>His</b> {{nostrils}} {{and his mouth}} are stopped. He claims he can hold <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> 5 minutes. " A man sits cross-legged {{on the ground with}} a robe wrapped around him. There is a wire fence in front of him. This photograph is from an album prepared by W. K. Norton of The Pilgrims Mission, Benares [Vārānasi]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heavens! Lassiter!" [...] panted Venters, when he <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "What relief--it's only you! How--in {{the name}} of all that's wonderful--did you ever get here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Achmet Zek <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> with a muttered exclamation of incredulity and an imprecation. The {{woman was}} the {{prisoner}} {{he had thought}} safely guarded at his camp! ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Potter <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> sharply; Mr. Spriggs, who was stooping {{to get a}} {{light for}} his pipe, nearly fell into the fire. There was an {{impressive}} silence.|$|E
5000|$|Dragon Breath: An {{accompaniment to}} Smaug's themes, echoing <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Scarcely human, in fact," [...] Decoud commented under <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>his</b> head at rest {{against the}} wall, his eyes {{gazing up at}} the ceiling.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must get}} the knife," [...] he answered, under <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> <b>His</b> {{mother tried to}} stop him again, but he hurried out without another word.|$|R
60|$|At midnight Jack {{raised his}} window and sat close to it. He <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> at what he saw, though he had seen and felt it a hundred times.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dies Irae, dies illa, [...] Solvet saeclum in favilla, [...] Teste David cum Sibylla.' The Archbishop <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{and moved}} forward. The music carried on by itself a while.|$|E
60|$|She splashed his hot {{back with}} a handful of the ice-cold water from over-side. He <b>caught</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> with a gasp, and shivered. Tommy turned about to look at them.|$|E
60|$|Agravaine held <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> But all was well. The damsel bowed.|$|R
60|$|Dauncey spoke words under <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{which were}} real and blasphemous.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with eyes that were aswim with tears. He took a step towards her, a catch in <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>his</b> hand held out.|$|R
