25|$|Lighting {{designers}} sometimes select filters {{by color}} temperature, commonly to match light that is theoretically white. Since fixtures using discharge type lamps produce a {{light of a}} considerably higher color temperature than do tungsten lamps, using the two in conjunction could potentially produce a stark contrast, so sometimes fixtures with HID lamps, commonly producing light of 6000–7000K, are fitted with 3200K filters to emulate tungsten light. Fixtures with <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> features or with multiple colors, (if including 3200K) are also capable of producing tungsten-like light. Color temperature {{may also be a}} factor when selecting lamps, since each is likely to have a different color temperature.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe homomorphisms of {{oriented}} or undirected graphs, the oriented chromatic number, {{the relationship}} between acyclic coloring number and oriented chromatic number, have been recently studied. Improving and combining earlier techniques of N. Alon and T. H. Marshall (1998, J. Algebraic Combin. 8, 5 – 13) and A. Raspaud and E. Sopena (1994, Inform. Process. Lett. 51, 171 – 174) we prove here a general result about homomorphisms of <b>colored</b> <b>mixed</b> graphs which implies all these earlier results about planar graphs. We also determine the exact chromatic number of <b>colored</b> <b>mixed</b> trees. For this, we introduce the notion of <b>colored</b> homomorphism for <b>mixed</b> graphs containing both colored arcs and colored edges...|$|R
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{accommodate}} more traditional and intuitive <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> models, computer graphics pioneers at PARC and NYIT developed the HSV model in the mid-1970s, formally described by Alvy Ray Smith in the August 1978 issue of Computer Graphics. In the same issue, Joblove and Greenberg described the HSL model—whose dimensions they labeled hue, relative chroma, and intensity—and compared it to HSV (...) [...] Their model was based more upon how colors are organized and conceptualized in human vision in terms of other color-making attributes, such as hue, lightness, and chroma; as well as upon traditional <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> methods—e.g., in painting—that involve mixing brightly colored pigments with black or white to achieve lighter, darker, or less colorful colors.|$|E

2500|$|In {{additive}} <b>color</b> <b>mixing,</b> {{the total}} light present {{is simply the}} sum of individual light sources. For example, coincident blue and red spotlights on a surface will make a purple, brighter than either of the spotlights alone. Additive mixing of coincident spot lights was applied in the experiments used to derive the CIE 1931 [...] colorspace. The original monochromatic primaries of the (arbitrary) wavelengths of 435.8nm (violet), 546.1nm (green) and 700nm (red) were used in this application due to the convenience they afforded to the experimental work.|$|E

2500|$|Subtractive <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> {{describes}} overlaid partially absorbing {{materials on}} a reflecting or transparent surface. Each layer partially absorbs some wavelengths {{of light from}} the illumination spectrum while letting others pass through (combining multiplicatively), which results in a colored appearance. Overlapping layers of ink in printing mix subtractively over reflecting white paper in this way, to generate photorealistic color images. [...] The typical number of inks in such a printing process ranges from 3 to 6 (e.g., CMYK process, Pantone hexachrome). In general, using fewer inks as primaries results in more economical printing but using more achieves potentially better color reproduction.|$|E
2500|$|Most televisions, {{computer}} displays, and projectors produce colors {{by combining}} red, green, and blue light in varying intensities—the so-called RGB additive primary colors. The resulting mixtures in RGB color space can reproduce {{a wide variety}} of colors (called a gamut); however, the relationship between the constituent amounts of red, green, and blue light and the resulting color is unintuitive, especially for inexperienced users, and for users familiar with subtractive <b>color</b> <b>mixing</b> of paints or traditional artists’ models based on tints and shades (...) [...] Furthermore, neither additive nor subtractive color models define color relationships the same way the human eye does.|$|E
