5|$|The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{call for}} an end to the use of Native American mascots was only for {{non-native}} schools. In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of cultural appropriation or stereotyping. Examples include the Fighting Indians of the Haskell Indian Nations University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP), which continues to have a substantial number of native students, and <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the Lumbee tribe. The UNCP nickname is the Braves, but the mascot is a red-tailed hawk. Pembroke Middle School, which also has <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the Lumbee tribe, is nicknamed the Warriors.|$|E
5|$|Japan has <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the United States. Since Japan's defeat by the Allies in World War II, the two {{countries}} have maintained close economic and defense relations. The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and {{the primary source of}} Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, having military bases in Japan for partially that purpose.|$|E
5|$|McCain's {{personal}} {{character has}} been a dominant feature of his public image. This image includes the military service of both himself and his family, the circumstances and tensions surrounding {{the end of his}} first marriage and beginning of second, his maverick political persona, his temper, his admitted problem of occasional ill-considered remarks, and his <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> his children from both his marriages.|$|E

5|$|Even though Musial left Donora {{after high}} school, he {{retained}} <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the town {{throughout the rest}} of his life. He maintained membership in local social clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town's mayor using some for United Way fundraising. Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.|$|E
5|$|By February 2001 the Workers' Communist Party {{proposed}} making Folkvord the {{new leader}} of the Red Electoral Alliance, since Myhre would resign if {{he was elected to}} parliament. While the majority of the members wanted a female leader after the departure of Myhre, his supporters were perfectly aware that Folkvord could lose the nomination and a campaign was started to make him deputy leader. The main problem for Folkvord's opposition was his <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the Workers' Communist Party. At the convention Myhre was re-elected the party's party leader, with Folkvord and Chris Hartmann stepping in as the party's new deputy leaders. Myhre did not become a member of parliament.|$|E
5|$|Charles Smithson – {{the main}} male character. Though {{born into a}} family with <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> nobility, Smithson does not possess a title but has a sizable income and {{considerable}} education. Early in the novel he is described both as a casual naturalist and a Darwinist. Though trying to become an enlightened and forward-thinking individual, the narrator often emphasises, through commentary on Smithson's actions and situation, that his identity is strongly rooted in the traditional social system. Moreover, conflicting identification with social forces, such as science and religion, lead Smithson to an existential crisis.|$|E

5|$|Chotiner was {{slated to}} play a major role in the Eisenhower/Nixon {{re-election}} bid. However, he had represented two Atlantic City clothing manufacturers, the Kravitz brothers, who had been fined and barred from further government contracts for fraud, and on April 25, 1956, a subcommittee of the Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations, looking into military procurement, subpoenaed him to appear before it. The senators wanted to inquire why a New Jersey firm which already had six attorneys would hire a California lawyer, especially one with <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> Vice President Nixon.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{maintains}} <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> {{the industrial}} world. Many of these connections are made through Georgia Tech's cooperative education and internship programs. Georgia Tech's Division of Professional Practice (DoPP), established in 1912 as the Georgia Institute of Technology Cooperative Division, operates {{the largest and}} fourth-oldest cooperative education program in the United States, and is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Cooperative Education. The DoPP is charged with providing {{opportunities for students to}} gain real-world employment experience through four programs, each targeting a different body of students. The Undergraduate Cooperative Education Program is a five-year program in which undergraduate students alternate between semesters of formal instruction at Georgia Tech and semesters of full-time employment with their employers.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Winchester Castle on 1 October 1207. He was the eldest son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême. Little is known of Henry's early life. He was {{initially}} looked after by a wet nurse called Ellen {{in the south of}} England, away from John's itinerant court, and probably had <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> his mother. Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters – Richard, Joan, Isabella and Eleanor – and various older illegitimate siblings. In 1212 his education was entrusted to Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester; under his direction, Henry was given military training by Philip D'Aubigny and taught to ride, probably by Ralph of St Samson.|$|E

5|$|Senator McCain {{became a}} member of the Armed Services Committee, with which he had {{formerly}} done his Navy liaison work; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee. He continued to support the Native American agenda. As first a House member and then a senator– and as a lifelong gambler with <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the gambling industry– McCain was one of the main authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises. McCain was also a strong supporter of the Gramm-Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandwich}} has <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> New England, {{particularly to}} Somerville, Massachusetts, where Archibald Query invented Marshmallow Fluff, and to Lynn, Massachusetts, where Durkee-Mower has produced it for decades. Somerville holds an annual festival called What the Fluff? based around celebrating Marshmallow Fluff and Fluffernutter sandwiches. The festival incorporates music, visual art, games and a cooking contest based around Fluff and Fluffernutters. In 2011, NASA astronaut Richard Michael Linnehan, {{who was born}} in Lowell, Massachusetts, and ate a Fluffernutter while aboard the International Space Station, acted as one of the contest judges.|$|E
5|$|Following the meeting, al-Bakri conferred with al-Shahbandar, {{who agreed}} to bring Damascus into the revolt, {{although}} this initial attempt did not materialize. As al-Atrash's men headed towards Damascus to launch their attack against French forces there, al-Bakri assembled some 260 armed volunteers from various neighborhoods and villages in and around Damascus, including al-Shaghour, Bab Musalla, al-Midan, and Jaramana. Al-Bakri maintained particularly <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> Hasan al-Kharrat, the local boss (qabaday) of al-Shaghur {{and a friend of}} the al-Bakri family. In early August, upon al-Bakri's urging, al-Kharrat formed a militia, which would {{become one of the most}} effective rebel bands in the country. When the French authorities were informed of nationalist rebel plans, they began a wide-scale arrest campaign in the city on 27 August, detaining nearly all of Damascus's nationalist leaders and spokesmen, although al-Bakri, his brothers, and al-Shahbandar managed to evade arrest.|$|E

5|$|Hong Kong had two {{licensed}} terrestrial broadcasters – ATV and TVB, {{the former}} {{of which has}} now been defunct. There are three local {{and a number of}} foreign suppliers of cable and satellite services. The production of Hong Kong's soap dramas, comedy series, and variety shows reach audiences throughout the Cantonese-speaking population. Magazine and newspaper publishers in Hong Kong distribute and print in both Chinese and English, with a focus on sensationalism and celebrity gossip. The media in Hong Kong is relatively free from official interference compared to Mainland China, although the Far Eastern Economic Review pointed to signs of self-censorship by media whose owners have <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> or business interests in the People's Republic of China and states that even Western media outlets are not immune to growing Chinese economic power.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 2011, Gillard {{made her}} {{first trip to}} New Zealand, during which she met with Key and held a luncheon with {{business}} leaders in Auckland. It marked the first New Zealand visit of a prime minister since Howard visited in 2007. To conclude her two-day visit to New Zealand, Gillard travelled to Wellington on 16 February, where {{she became the first}} foreign dignitary to address the New Zealand Parliament in its history. In her speech, Gillard reflected on the countries' <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> one another, their shared defence history, and efforts to increase economic cooperation. Her second visit to New Zealand, coincided with the September 2011 gathering of the Pacific Islands Forum, held in Auckland, of which both Australia and New Zealand are members. Gillard made her final trip to New Zealand on 9 February 2013; visiting Queenstown, she and Prime Minister Key announced a deal on asylum seekers, which would see New Zealand accept 150 refugees annually from Australia, starting in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Several {{figures in}} Eisenhower's administration, {{including}} Secretary of State John Foster Dulles {{and his brother}} CIA Director Allen Dulles, had <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers {{had worked for the}} law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith would later become a director of the company, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These personal connections meant that the Eisenhower administration tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national security interests, and made it more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government. The success of the 1953 CIA operation to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower's belief in using the agency to effect political change overseas.|$|E
50|$|The presidential {{government}} of Goulart initiated in 1963 was marked politically by the administration's <b>closer</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> center-left political groups, and conflict with more conservative {{sectors of the}} society, specifically the National Democratic Union (Brazil).|$|R

5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{the only}} Jewish–Christian gospel which the Church Fathers refer to by name. The {{language}} of composition {{is thought to be}} Greek. The provenance has been associated with Egypt; it probably began circulating in Alexandria, Egypt in {{the first decades of the}} 2nd century and was used by Greek-speaking Jewish–Christian communities there. The communities to which they belonged were traditional, conservative Christians who followed the teaching of the primitive Christian church in Jerusalem, integrating their understanding of Jesus with strict observance of Jewish customs and law, which they regarded as essential to salvation. Despite this, the gospel displays no connection with other Jewish–Christian literature, nor does it appear to be based on the Gospel of Matthew or the other canonical gospels of what is now orthodox Christianity. Instead, it seems to be taken from alternative oral forms of the same underlying traditions. Some of the fragments suggest a syncretic gnostic influence, while others support <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> traditional Jewish Wisdom literature.|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt {{became a}} popular {{literary}} subject. The poet John Gower, who had <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> officials {{involved in the}} suppression of the revolt, amended his famous poem Vox Clamantis after the revolt, inserting a section condemning the rebels and likening them to wild animals. Geoffrey Chaucer, who lived in Aldgate and may have been in London during the revolt, used the rebel killing of Flemings as a metaphor for wider disorder in The Nun's Priest's Tale part of The Canterbury Tales, parodying Gower's poem. Chaucer otherwise made no reference to the revolt in his work, possibly because as he was a client of the King it would have been politically unwise to discuss it. William Langland, the author of the poem Piers Plowman, which had been widely used by the rebels, made various changes to its text after the revolt in order to distance himself from their cause.|$|E
5|$|Two men, Andrew Wylie and Matthew Brown, each {{served as}} {{president}} of both Jefferson College and Washington College. Several early presidents of Jefferson College had <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> John McMillan, including his son-in-law John Watson and his nephew William McMillan. James Dunlap was one of McMillan's early students. Other Jefferson College presidents held strong bonds with Matthew Brown, including his son Alexander Blaine Brown and his protégé and son-in-law David Hunter Riddle. James I. Brownson, who was a long-time pastor at the First Presbyterian Church, served two separate terms as president pro tempore, once for Washington College and later for Washington & Jefferson College. During World War II, Ralph Cooper Hutchison simultaneously {{served as president}} of the college and as Director of Civilian Defense for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Boyd Crumrine Patterson was the most recent Washington & Jefferson alumnus to serve as president. In 2005, Tori Haring-Smith became the first woman to serve as president.|$|E
500|$|Allmusic's Richie Unterberger {{described}} Unhalfbricking as [...] "a transitional album for {{the young}} Fairport Convention, in which the group shed its <b>closest</b> <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> its American folk-rock influences and started to edge toward a more traditional British folk-slanted sound".|$|R
