40|$|Background and aims: We report our {{experience}} of concomitant laparoscopic treatment for enterocele and stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR) for rectocele and/or rectal prolapse in patients with complex obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS). Patients and methods: From June 2005 to June 2007, we submitted 20 patients with ODS due to rectal prolapse and/or rectocele, combined with stable enterocele, to STARR and laparoscopic correction of the enterocele. Preoperative assessment included symptom evaluation with standardized questionnaires, clinical examination, colonoscopy, proctoscopy, anal sphincter ultrasonography, video-defecography with synchronous opacification of the ileal loops in all patients and <b>colpography</b> in female patients, and anorectal manometry. Follow-up was performed in the first, third, sixth, 12 th, and 24 th month after surgery. Results: Eighteen (90 %) patients were submitted to both procedures, simultaneously. One patient, previously submitted to STARR, underwent laparoscopic treatment of the enterocele. Postoperative complications occurred in two (10 %) patients: one case of postoperative rectal bleeding and one case of retropneumoperitoneum. Median (range) preoperative and postoperative Altomare's obstructed defecation score was ten (6 - 14) and two (0 - 14), respectively (p< 0. 001). Median (range) preoperative and postoperative quality of life score was 79 (39 - 109) and 109 (50 - 126), respectively (p< 0. 001). No symptom related to ODS was detected at 6 -month follow-up (19 patients) and at 24 -month follow-up (19 patients). Conclusion: The combination of STARR and laparoscopy provides a safe and effective method to treat ODS caused by rectal internal prolapse and/or rectocele combined with enterocele.
