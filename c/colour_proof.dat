50|$|Colour {{separation}} proofs {{for each}} individual colour were printed for each value, and the colours combined {{in a process that}} eventually produced a full <b>colour</b> <b>proof.</b> These proofs were produced, initially, in small units, four or so and later as full sheets. This printing took place to ensure that all colours printed correctly when combined and also registered correctly. The more common sheet proofs can be easily identified from the smaller units as the latter have white borders. The stamps printed as sheets had a design that allowed for 'bleeding' between each stamp, printing over the perforations. Each value had two separate black colours, the first was applied as detail for the butterfly and the stamp value, being common for all States. and the second for the State name, Rulers portrait and/or State coat of arms, this being the 'customising' colour for the base stamps.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND When a {{customer}} delivers a <b>colour</b> <b>proof</b> to a printer, {{they expect the}} final print to look similar to that proof. Today {{it is impossible to}} control if a match between proof and print is technically possible to reach at all. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} no information regarding the production circumstances of the proof is provided, for instance the printer does not know which proofer, RIP or ICC-profile that was used. Situations where similarity between proof and print cannot be reached and the press has to be stopped are both costly and time consuming and are therefore wished to be avoided. PURPOSE The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the possibility to form a method with the ability control if a proof is of such good quality that it is likely to produce a print that is similar to it. METHOD The basic assumption was that the quality of a proof could be decided by spectrally measuring known colour patches and compare those values to reference values representing the same patches printed at optimal press conditions. To decide which and how many patches that are required, literature and reports were studied, then a test printing and a comparison between proofing systems were performed. To be able to analyse the measurement data in an effective way a tool that analyses the difference between reference and measurement data was developed using MATLAB. RESULT The result was a suggestion for a <b>colour</b> <b>proof</b> quality verification method that consists two parts that are supposed to complement each other. The first one was called Colour proofing system evaluation and is supposed to evaluate entire proofing systems. It consists of a test page containing colour patches, grey balance fields, gradations and photographs. The second part is called <b>Colour</b> <b>proof</b> control and consists of a smaller set of colour patches that is supposed to be attached to each proof. CONCLUSIONS The method is not complete since more research regarding the difference between measurement results and visual impression is needed. To be able to obtain realistic tolerance levels for differences between measurement- and reference data, the method must be tested in every-day production. If this is done the method is thought to provide a good way of controlling the quality of colour proofs...|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Eno, {{as a member}} of Roxy Music, started {{developing}} music using synthesisers. After a long and enthusiastic conversation about the new possibilities, Anthony was inspired to make some screen prints that paralleled visually the effects that Eno produced with electronics. Working in partnership with master silkscreen printer, Kevin Harris, the suite of six images they named Roxy Bias was the produced by a complicated method of interchangeable stencils and endless <b>colour</b> <b>proofing.</b> The titles, Ringing Filter, Butterfly Echo, Inverse Echo, Erase Function, Multi-Mode Jitter, all came from the realm of electronic music. The images effectively demonstrated Benjamin’s visionary conception and Harris's patience and incredible skill. Together, they achieved a remarkable partnership. The colours and images vibrated and danced on the surfaces, a visual and joyful equivalent of music creating “maximum visual aggression”. The suite was very successful and won several major graphic prizes the first at the San Paulo Biennale in 1974.|$|R

50|$|During 1978, unannounced reprints {{for some}} state values were issued printed in {{photogravure}} by Harrison & Sons, the same printer {{that produced the}} coil stamps earlier. Some of these reprints are quite scarce, particularly the Perlis 10 cents and Sabah 20 cents values, as they were replaced by the new issue of Flowers and Animals the same year, and the new issue had not been announced by the post office. Once again, the stamps were printed in sheets of 200 in two panes of 100, 10 x 10. Unlike the Bradbury Wilkinson printings, these sheets had cylinder numbers in the bottom right margins, one for each colour and numbered 1A for the left pane and 1B for the right.These stamps can easily be separated out from the Bradbury Wilkinson printings, as photogravure produces edges with a 'fuzzy' look, caused by the photographic process when producing the printing cylinders. This can clearly {{be seen on the}} edges of the word 'Malaysia'. Bradbury Wilkinson printings have clear, straight edges. There are also differences in shade, but these are unreliable.There were two reprints, not all values being reprinted twice, and new values produced during the second printing. It is this printing that produced the scarce 10 cents value. The only proofs that have appeared to date are single full <b>colour</b> <b>proofs</b> on Harrison & Sons presentation cards, all values existing.

5000|$|The {{pressure}} of such steady production caused Crane {{to stop his}} work for a period, and Evans replaced him with Randolph Caldecott, whose magazine illustrations he had seen and liked. Initially Evans hired Caldecott to draw illustrations for nursery rhyme books, beginning with another printing of The House that Jack Built in 1877. Evans proposed to fill each page with an illustration, which were [...] "often little more than outlines" [...] to avoid the blank pages which were customary in toy books of the period. In 1878 The Diverting Story of John Gilpin was published, illustrated by Caldecott and printed by Evans. Evans supplied Caldecott with materials for the illustrations and payment based on sales quantities. Evans explained the business arrangement: I agreed to run all the risks of engraving the key blocks which he drew on wood; after he finished <b>colouring</b> a <b>proof</b> I would furnish him, on drawing paper, I would engrave the blocks to be printed in as few colours as necessary ... the key block in dark brown, then a flesh tint for the faces, hands, and wherever it would bring the other colours as nearly as possible to his painted copy, a red, a blue, a yellow and a grey.|$|R

500|$|Evans' process {{involved}} {{a number of}} steps. First, the line drawing of an illustration was photographed and printed onto block while the line drawing was engraved. Proofs of the key block were coloured by the illustrator; Evans would then [...] "determine the sequencing and register...to arrive at a close reproduction of the artist's original". Blocks were painted and engraved; one for each <b>colour.</b> A <b>proof</b> of each <b>colour</b> block was made before a final proof from the key block. [...] Ideally, the proof would be a faithful reproduction of the original drawing, but Evans believed a print was never {{as good as a}} drawing. He took care to grind and mix his inks so they closely emulated the original. Finally, each block was placed so as to allow the individual colours to print on the page exactly as intended. Aware of costs and printing efficiencies, he used as few colours as possible. Illustrations were produced with a base of black, along with one or two colours and a flesh tone for faces and hands. In some cases, Evans may have used as few as four colour blocks: likely black, flesh and two primary colours; the addition of yellow allowed him a greater range. Each colour was printed from a separately engraved block; there were often between five or ten blocks. The chief problem was to maintain correct register, achieved by placing small holes in precise positions on each block to which the paper was pinned. If done correctly, the register of colours match, although sometimes ink squash is visible along the edges of an illustration.|$|R

In this study we have tested several tablets (Apple iPad 2,Asus Transformer TF 101, Samsung Galaxy Tab 1) with different display and OS technology and tested a software which is intended for colour managed viewing of the reproduction. We have measured the colour reproduction of the tablets with the digital version of the GretagMacbeth ColorChecker card and have calculated the colour differences between the colour chart data and the displayed data. We have calibrated the Ipad 2 with the only existing colour management tool the Spyder Gallery and we have also tested the chart display with and without the colour correction of the software. We have found that there are differences in the colour reproduction of the display technologies and that the possibilities of a real colour managed workflow has yet to be resolved on the OS level of tablet and mobile device...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} of soft gluon corrections to multi-leg scattering amplitudes in a non-Abelian gauge theory by analysing the corresponding product of semi-infinite Wilson lines. We prove that diagrams exponentiate such that the colour factors in the exponent are fully connected. This completes the generalisation of the non-Abelian exponentiation theorem, previously proven {{in the case of}} a Wilson loop, to the case of multiple Wilson lines in arbitrary representations of the <b>colour</b> group. Our <b>proof</b> is based on the replica trick in conjunction with a new formalism where multiple emissions from a Wilson line are described by effective vertices, each having a connected colour factor. The exponent consists of connected graphs made out of these vertices. We show that this readily provides a general colour basis for webs. We further discuss the kinematic combinations that accompany each connected colour factor, and explicitly catalogue all three-loop examples, as necessary for a direct computation of the soft anomalous dimension at this order.

40|$|Different Degrees of Naturalness of Quantifiers and Colour Terms In his “Remarks on Colour” (1977 : III- 46), Ludwig Wittgenstein writes: “Among the colours: Kinship and Contrast. (And that is logic). ” In {{this talk}} on quantifiers, colour percepts and <b>colour</b> concepts, <b>proof</b> will be {{provided}} that Wittgenstein’s intuition about the logical nature of colour relations {{has to be taken}} literally. Relations of opposition between primary and secondary chromatic percepts will be shown algebraically to be the same as those between the three primary items (all, some, none) in the lexical class of quantifiers and their contradictories. An important area where evidence can be found for this intriguing case of homology is that of lexicalisation asymmetries between different kinds of colour terms and different types of quantifiers. On the one extreme, certain lexicalisations are nonexistent and arguably cognitively nonnatural, such as Horn’s (1989) O-corner quantifier *nall and chromatic nonce-formations such as *reen (= “reddish green”), while {{at the other end of}} the lexicalisation spectre there are items which are fully natural ordinary language terms (all, white, etc.), universally lexicalised by what will be identified as innate conceptual pressure. In between those two extremes, so it will be argued, there is a middle category with differences in lexicalisability. Items in this category, including such specialised terms as nand in logic and such nonbasic colour terms as cyan or magenta, reveal that differences in utility determine whether such items are lexicalised or not. Take the example of nand, which is an established term in the context of electronic circuits in engineering but unattested in everyday natural language. In principle, all types of logic gates (OR, AND, etc.) could be created equally as well from a network of NOR gates as from a NAND gate network. Yet the latter carried the day because the available technology made it easier to implement than a NOR gate network. It is for this extra-linguistic reason that the language of science successfully adopted the useful electronic engineering term “nand”, which has nonetheless remained equally as nonnatural in the natural logic of ordinary language as before. Thus, no natural language has structures such as (the equivalent of) *John nand Bill ate a piece of cake, meaning “either John, or Bill, or neither of them ate a piece of cake”. Let us first describe the nature of the isomorphism postulated between quantifier and colour oppositions in more detail and then distil the different degrees of naturalness of lexicalisations from the two isomorphic models, with a special focus on the in-between category where utility helps overcome cognitive nonnaturalness for usage within a more restricted domain of application. This is a distinction reminiscent of the technical vs. natural-approximative opposition between more than half and (one of the meanings of) most. The most straightforward historical starting point for a comparison of chromatic and predicate logical oppositions is the colour wheel on the one hand and the Aristotelian-Boethian logical square of oppositions on the other. Since the colour wheel and the square have different geometries, however, more converging models have to be called upon. On the logical side, the model in question is a logical hexagon based on work by Blanché (1953, 1969). This hexagon is in fact a bitriangle, which is derived by adding to an AYE-triangle of contraries (A: all; Y: some, but not all; E: no(ne)) its dual IOU (I: some or all; O: some or none; U: all or no), i. e. a triangle of subcontrary relations (Moretti 2009, 142). Algebraic definitions for the logical oppositions in this Blanché-star – i. e. for entailment (arrows), contradiction (red lines), contrariety (blue lines) and subcontrariety (green lines) – carry over to the realm of colour percepts, which can be mapped onto the same hexagon. Let us see how. In view of Thomas Young’s trichromatic theory of colour vision and its later refinements, the triangle of contraries will be shown to involve the primary colours red-green-blue. Experiential associations of blue with dark and cold (negative) versus yellow with light and warm (positive) and red with warmest, but also subject-independent asymmetries such as wavelength properties will provide arguments to link LW red with the A-corner, MW green with the Y-corner and SW blue with the negative E-corner. The other three colours in the star are secondary and composite: at the physical and perceptual level they represent the combined wavelengths – in set-theoretical terms: the union of the wavelengths – of green and red (= yellow), green and blue (= cyan) and red and blue (= magenta) respectively. As is known from the phenomenon of afterimages and from insights in Hering’s opponent process theory, the secondary triad yellow-cyan-magenta consists of complementaries of the primary colours, a type of opposition that is the colour equivalent of contradictoriness in the logical square (and hexagon) of oppositions. Thus, two quantifiers (e. g. no and some, maybe all) are contradictories if the intersection of their denotations is the null set and the union the universe; correspondingly, two colour percepts (e. g. blue and yellow) are complementaries if the intersection of the wavelengths (or activated cone types) involved is the null set – yielding a black percept – and the union is the universe of wavelengths (or cone activation), i. e. white. Returning to the issue of the different degrees of naturalness of lexicalisations, two facts stand out in the stars. First of all, the operators that resist natural single-item lexicalization in logic (O-corner not all, for which there is no natural lexicalization *nall and U-corner all or no, for which there is no *allno) have counterparts in the realm of colour terms which are not naturally lexicalized either, in casu O-corner cyan and U-corner magenta, cognitively dyadic and less natural than red, green, blue, yellow. Yet, although in both stars the occupants of the relevant corners are nonnatural, there is a marked difference. The occupants do exist as specialised terms in the colour star, whereas they are completely absent in the case of the quantifiers. This is attributable to the difference in nature between colour percepts and logical concepts. While the former are cone activation patterns reflexively generated by the vision system, the latter involve more abstract entities. That the lexicalisation difference is due to this difference is reinforced by the fact that the colour star has to be expanded to accommodate the two achromatic colours black and white. These two correspond to neither all, nor some, nor no (whose denotation is the null set) and some or all or no (the universe) respectively in the predicate logical system. While the two logical operators involved are trivial and hence useless for any contingency, the null set of cone activation in the colour system does generate a functional colour percept (black), which is not a useless or noninformative representation at all. In sum, the natural language lexicon contains at least a quantificational but probably a wider range of closed lexical fields (kinship terms, person, numerals) susceptible to a decompositional analysis in terms of the system of oppositions that characterizes colour percept discrimination. The nature of the opposition system results in a distinction between cognitively natural and nonnatural lexical items, the latter of which can only make it into specialised language, and then only in those cases where their adoption is facilitated by extra-linguistic utility.
