25|$|The cathedral was {{equipped}} with an independent central heating and a <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaning system employing a complex network of pressurized manifolds and valves. Electrical lighting employed 5 thousand light bulbs.|$|E
25|$|Several {{technological}} innovations {{were incorporated into}} the house’s design, including a state-of-the-art heating and cooling system, {{as well as a}} <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> system. The Purcell home had a telephone nook, an electric call system for the maid, and a spring-loaded pocket door to the kitchen, activated through buttons in the floor.|$|E
25|$|Certified HEPA (tested to MIL STD 282) can {{effectively}} trap 99.97% of dust at 0.3 micrometers. Not all HEPA (type/media) filters {{can effectively}} stop dust; while vacuum cleaners with HEPA (type/media) filters, water, or cyclones may filter {{more effectively than}} without, they may still exhaust millions of particles per cubic foot of air circulated. <b>Central</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaners can be effective in removing dust, {{especially if they are}} exhausted directly to the outdoors.|$|E
50|$|Today, H-P makes a {{wide range}} of vacuum systems, {{including}} Dirt Devil (<b>central</b> <b>vacuums</b> only) and Turbocat. In 1961, H-P released lightweight, inexpensive plastic tubing that reduced the overall cost of residential <b>central</b> <b>vacuums.</b> The company also manufactures automatic inlet valves and lightweight, flexible plastic hoses.|$|R

5000|$|Complete {{removal of}} allergens and noxious odors — <b>Central</b> <b>vacuums</b> {{generally}} do not recirculate exhaust air back into the space being cleaned. [...] This contrasts with the well-known acrid [...] "vacuum smell" [...] of fine dust and hot air exhausted from a portable <b>vacuum.</b> Instead, <b>central</b> <b>vacuums</b> exhaust spent air into a utility space, or directly outdoors. An external exhaust outlet can be easily concealed under a porch or behind shrubbery, {{but in any case}} is less obtrusive than a standard clothes dryer appliance vent.|$|R
2500|$|A modern air {{conditioning}} system was installed in the building, and the heating, lighting, plumbing, and telephone systems all upgraded. During the mechanical renovations, the old pneumatic tube, telautograph, <b>central</b> <b>vacuum,</b> and [...] "artificial ventilation" [...] systems were all rediscovered.|$|E
2500|$|A {{pneumatic}} {{tube system}} ran throughout the Cleveland Trust Company Building, connecting tellers to bookkeepers and each department. A telautograph was also located in each department. This device enabled a handwritten message to be reproduced at the receiving station. The building also had 76 telephones (quite a large number for the era), and two private telephone exchanges in the building to accommodate telephone traffic. The building also had a <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner system and a primitive air conditioning system known as [...] "artificial ventilation" [...] were built into the plaster-coated columns.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> systems gained {{popularity}} among {{real estate agents}} and home remodelers for the value they added to homes at resale. Allergists also {{played an important role}} in the growing popularity of <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> systems in the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{progress}} in filtration systems for <b>vacuum</b> cleaners, <b>central</b> <b>vacuums</b> that vent outdoors or into a nonliving space are preferable {{for individuals with}} allergies or asthma, because they prevent indoor emissions altogether.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Central</b> <b>vacuums</b> can be {{equipped}} with either an electrical power brush or an air-driven power brush. The air-driven (or turbine) systems frequently are less expensive because they don’t require electrical wires for power to be run to each wall inlet. Turbine-driven brushes tend to be noisier than electric brushes; the noise from either is more noticeable {{in the absence of}} the [...] "vacuum whine" [...] produced by portable vacuums. Many users find that the high suction of <b>central</b> <b>vacuums</b> is more than sufficient by itself for most casual cleaning jobs, but reserve a powered brush tool for more difficult tasks.|$|R
5000|$|Filterless <b>central</b> <b>vacuums</b> are {{completely}} immune to such failures. In addition, the best designs in either system incorporate so-called [...] "bypass cooling", using a completely separate source of ambient air {{to cool the}} motor, rather than the design expedient of using just-filtered dirty airflow for this vital function.|$|R

50|$|The chief {{disadvantage}} of central vacuums is higher initial cost. In the United States, the average <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> system has an installed cost of around $1,000. This initial expense must be weighed against the long-term {{benefits of a}} <b>central</b> <b>vacuum,</b> including the typical longer service life of the equipment, and negligible consumables cost if a filterless system is chosen.|$|E
50|$|American Home Shield administers home service {{contracts}} on major home systems, including air conditioning, heating, electrical, plumbing, water heaters, garbage disposals, instant {{hot and cold}} water dispensers, <b>central</b> <b>vacuums,</b> smoke detectors, doorbells, and ceiling fans; as well as appliances, including refrigerators, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers, ovens, free-standing ice makers, trash compactors, garage door openers, built-in food processors, and built-in microwave ovens.|$|R
5000|$|Low {{acoustic}} noise — Well-designed <b>central</b> <b>vacuums</b> are very quiet {{at the point}} of use, since the powerful motor is located remotely in a utility space. This is a benefit to the person vacuuming, as well as anybody else occupying the space being cleaned, who otherwise might be woken up or driven out by the loud whine of a portable machine.|$|R

5000|$|Durable {{equipment}} — Good-quality <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> {{systems can}} last indefinitely, perhaps requiring {{replacement of the}} motor brushes once per decade of use. Besides using heavy-duty components, central vacuums avoid {{the damage caused by}} accidental dropping or collisions of portable equipment with fixed objects. Many manufacturers give a [...] "Lifetime Limited Warranty" [...] on all permanently installed components of a <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> system.|$|E

50|$|Bakersfield {{also has}} a growing {{manufacturing}} and distribution sector. Several companies have moved to Bakersfield because of its inexpensive land {{and access to the}} rest of America, as well as international ports in both Los Angeles and Oakland. Other companies have opened regional offices and non-oil/agricultural businesses because of Bakersfield's and Kern County's business friendly policies, such as having no local utility or inventory taxes. Products manufactured in the city include: ice cream (world's largest ice cream plant), <b>central</b> <b>vacuums,</b> highway paint, and stock racing cars.|$|R
5000|$|Infrequent {{emptying}} — <b>Central</b> <b>vacuums</b> typically can accumulate up to 10 kg (22 pounds) {{or more of}} {{dirt and}} dust before requiring disposal. This is an unavoidable messy task that must be performed for any vacuum cleaner, but can be done much less frequently, perhaps a few times per year. Disposable filter bag systems are easy to empty, though {{care must be taken}} to refit the replacement bag to allow maximum airflow without leaks. Emptying the dust canister of a cyclonic vacuum is best done outdoors on a breezy day because of the fine dust cloud that can be released.|$|R

50|$|A <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner (also {{known as}} {{built-in}} or ducted) {{is a type}} of vacuum cleaner appliance, installed into a building as a semi-permanent fixture. <b>Central</b> <b>vacuum</b> systems are designed to remove dirt and debris from homes and buildings, sending dirt particles through tubing installed inside the walls to a collection container in a remote utility space. The power unit is a permanent fixture, typically installed in a basement, garage, or storage room, along with the collection container. Inlets are installed in walls throughout the building that attach to power hoses and other <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> accessories to remove dust, particles, and small debris from interior rooms. Most power hoses typically have a power switch located on the handle.|$|E

5000|$|Routing {{and design}} of vacuum tubing layout {{is very similar to}} drain-waste-vent (DWV) plumbing, with the {{exception}} that pipe pitch or gradient for drainage is not required. Vacuum system designs share with DWV designs a concern about eliminating internal roughness, ridges, burrs, sharp turns, pockets, or other obstructions to smooth flow that might cause build-up of material into pipe blockages. Tubing for <b>central</b> <b>vacuums</b> has a few peculiar constraints of its own, and a few unusual capabilities, such as the ability to run a pipe straight upwards after a sufficiently long horizontal [...] "running start". In some jurisdictions, fire code regulations require that an intumescent firestop collar be installed around the pipe when it penetrates a firewall. If a pipe runs through an unheated space, it may require external pipe insulation to prevent water vapor from condensing inside. These and other installation details are described in installation manuals available from manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|Bag {{breakage}} is {{an issue}} that arises with filtered <b>central</b> <b>vacuums.</b> In a portable vacuum, if the filter bag fails, this condition becomes immediately obvious as a cloud of dust and dirt blows into the room. Although it creates a mess, at least the problem can be immediately brought under control by shutting off the appliance. By contrast, if the filter bag in a central unit should fail, little change may be noticed by the remote operator. In fact, the only perceivable change may be an increase in suction power as a clogged but broken bag is completely bypassed. If the filtered air is also used to cool the motor (a very typical design), the first clue that something is amiss may be when the motor completely seizes up due to dirt accumulating in the motor brushes, windings, or bearings. Such a failure can require complete replacement of the expensive central unit.|$|R
5000|$|Ability {{to handle}} [...] "difficult" [...] debris — <b>Central</b> <b>vacuums,</b> {{especially}} filterless models, can efficiently remove difficult dry substances, such as plaster dust, spilled flour, laser printer toner, metal knockout slugs and wire clippings from electrical work, or even small pieces and slivers of broken glass. This ability {{may depend on}} the ability of the filter bag to resist clogging or breakage; filterless models are capable of removing the widest range of materials. [...] "Wet vacuum interceptor" [...] accessories are available for some systems; these operate by separating liquids from the dirty airstream prior to passage into the in-wall tubing and central unit. These [...] "wet vac" [...] units are subject to the same limitations as [...] "wet-or-dry shop vacuums", and must be washed out and dried after use to prevent unpleasant odors and mold growth. However, toxic materials, such as asbestos should never be cleaned up with anything but specialized equipment made expressly for the purpose.|$|R

50|$|A <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> {{system is}} {{generally}} considered by building owners to be a permanent fixture of the building where it is installed, similar to plumbing or electrical fixtures. A short-term renter would most likely lose any investment made in improving the property, unless a prior agreement were made with the property owner. Installation of a quality <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> increases the property value of a residence or commercial property.|$|E

50|$|Named {{after the}} Slovak capital Bratislava {{in honour of}} the Russo-Slovak friendship, the station is a pillar bi-span. The station's main theme is {{designed}} accordingly (architects A.Orlov and A.Nekrasov). The station's length is interrupted with a <b>central</b> square <b>vacuum</b> space that was {{to serve as a}} future transfer for the large ring beginning from the Kakhovskaya Line. However the large ring programme has been redesigned and as a result the future transfer will take place at Pechatniki. It is expected that this vaulted space will be covered up {{as the rest of the}} station is.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} asymptotically Warped AdS 3 {{black holes}} in Topologically Massive Gravity. We study their thermodynamic stability {{and show the}} existence of a Hawking-Page phase transition between the black hole and thermal background phases. At zero angular potential, the latter is shown to occur at the self-dual point of the dual Warped Conformal Field Theory partition function, in analogy with the phase transition for BTZ black holes in AdS 3 /CFT 2. We also discuss how the <b>central</b> and <b>vacuum</b> charges can be obtained from inner horizon mechanics {{in the presence of a}} gravitational anomaly.
