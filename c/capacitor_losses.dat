It is practical to analyze the <b>loss</b> of a <b>capacitor</b> using a capacitor series equivalent circuit model in this pulsed power application. The <b>capacitor</b> <b>loss</b> {{is directly related to}} the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the capacitor. In the paper, the formula to estimate the <b>capacitor</b> <b>loss</b> is presented. It is proportional to the energy per pulse, rep-rate, and capacitor dissipation factor (tanδ) at the certain energy transfer frequency of the circuit. The charging and discharging frequencies of the capacitor might be different. Both of them will produce losses, and contribute to the total <b>capacitor</b> <b>loss.</b> The analysis of a capacitor bank with capacitors in parallel or in series is presented as well. Also in this work, the parameters of different types of capacitors were measured, including film capacitors and high voltage ceramic capacitors, using a Agilent 4285 A Precision LCR Meter up to 13 MHz. The influence of temperature on capacitance and dissipation factor was investigated by sinking the capacitor in oil under controlled temperatures.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the design}} of a {{parallel}} resonant induction heating system, choosing a proper capacitance for the resonant circuit is quite important. The capacitance affects the resonant frequency, output power, Q-factor, heating efficiency and power factor. In this paper, the important role of equivalent series resistance (ESR) in the choice of capacitance is recognized. Without the effort of reducing temperature rise of the capacitor, the life time of capacitor tends to decrease rapidly. This paper, therefore, presents a method of finding an optimal value of the capacitor under voltage constraint for maximizing the output power of an induction heater, while minimizing the power loss of the capacitor at the same time. Based on the equivalent circuit model of an induction heating system, the output power, and the <b>capacitor</b> <b>losses</b> are calculated. The voltage constraint comes from the voltage ratings of the capacitor bank and the switching devices of the inverter.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of hybrid powertrains {{has made it}} possible to utilise unconventional engines as primary power units in vehicles. The free-piston energy converter (FPEC) is such an engine. It is a combination of a free-piston combustion engine and a linear electrical machine. The main features of this configuration are high efficiency and a rapid transient response. In this thesis the free-piston energy converter as part of a hybrid powertrain is studied. One issue of the FPEC is the generation of pulsating power due to the reciprocating motion of the translator. These pulsations affect the components in the powertrain. However, it is shown that these pulsations can be handled by a normal sized DC-link capacitor bank. In addition, two approaches to reduce these pulsations are suggested: the first approach is using generator force control and the second approach is based on phase-shifted operation of two FPEC units. The latter approach results in higher frequency and lower amplitude of the pulsations, which reduce the <b>capacitor</b> <b>losses.</b> The FPEC start-up requirements are analysed and by choosing the correct amplitude of the generator force during start-up the energy consumption can be minimised. The performance gain of utilising the FPEC in a medium sized series hybrid electric vehicle (SHEV) is also studied. An FPEC model suitable for vehicle simulation is developed and a series hybrid powertrain, with the same performance as the Toyota Prius, is dimensioned and modelled. Optimisation is utilised to find a lower limit on the SHEV's fuel consumption for a given drivecycle. In addition, three power management control strategies for the FPEC system are investigated: two load-following strategies using one and two FPEC units respectively and one strategy based on the ideas of an equivalent consumption minimisation (ECM) proposed earlier in the literature. The results show a significant decrease in fuel consumption, compared to a diesel-generator powered SHEV, just by replacing the diesel-generator with an FPEC. This result is improved even more by using two FPEC units to generate the propulsion power, as this increases the efficiency at low loads. The ECM control strategy does not reduce the fuel consumption compared to the load-following strategies but gives a better utilisation of the available power sources. QC 2010111...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The paper {{presents}} a novel concept for moni-toring and managing the DC link electrolytic capacitors of PWM converters, especially for drive applications. The unit performs on-line {{identification of the}} equivalent series resis-tance (ESR) of the capacitor in order to detect the end-of-life cycle to permit a preventive maintenance of the conver-ter prior to a capacitor failure. The ESR detection scheme {{is based on the}} determination of the <b>capacitor</b> AC <b>losses</b> calculated from voltage/current measurements using a simple single-chip microcontroller. The unit is designed as a small printed circuit board located between the capacitors screw terminals and the converter busbars. This also opens the possibility to easily detect the capacitor's operating temperature which is important for the evaluation of the identified ESR values. The intention is, furthermore, that the monitoring unit operates without a separate power supply and draws its supply current out of the power capacitor. The measurement results of the individual con-verter capacitors are gathered by an opto-isolated three-wire bus. Finally, besides the ESR detection the monitoring unit further allows an energy efficient capacitor voltage balan-cing in case a series array of capacitors is used. As opposed to conventional resistor voltage divider networks this method reduces the balancing losses to a very large extent by avoiding high quiescent currents.

40|$|Three-level diode-clamped {{inverter}} {{is being}} widely used these days. Extensive {{research has been}} carried out on pulse width modulation (PWM) strategies for a three-level inverter. The most widely used PWM strategies are sine-triangle pulse width modulation (SPWM) and centered space vector pulse width modulation (CSVPWM). The influence of these PWM strategies on the DC-link capacitor current and voltage ripple is studied in this thesis. The sizing of the DC capacitor depends on value of the maximum RMS current flowing through it. In this work, an analytical expression for capacitor RMS current is derived as a function of operating conditions like modulation index, power factor angle of the load and peak load current. The worst case current stress on the capacitor is evaluated using the analytical expression. The capacitor RMS current is found to be the same in SPWM and CSVPWM schemes. The analytical expression is validated through simulations and experiments on a 3 kVA MOSFET based three-level inverter. Harmonic analysis of the capacitor current is helpful in better evaluation of <b>capacitor</b> power <b>loss.</b> Therefore, harmonic analysis of the capacitor current is carried out, using the techniques of geometric wall model and double Fourier integral for SPWM and CSVPWM schemes. The theoretical predictions are validated through experiments. The capacitor RMS current is divided into low-frequency RMS current (where low frequency component is defined as a component whose frequency is less than half the switching frequency) and high-frequency RMS current. The capacitor voltage ripple is estimated analytically for SPWM and CSVPWM schemes, using the low-frequency and high-frequency capacitor RMS current.
