5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} {{were introduced in}} Sweden as a demonstration test in 1994, when three Ford Taurus were imported to show the technology existed. Because of the existing interest, a project was started in 1995 with 50 Ford Taurus E85 flexifuel {{in different parts of}} Sweden: Umeå, Örnsköldsvik, Härnösand, Stockholm, Karlstad, Linköping, and Växjö. From 1997 to 1998 an additional 300 Taurus were imported, and the number of E85 fueling grew to 40. Then in 1998 the city of Stockholm placed an order for 2,000 of FFVs for any <b>car</b> <b>manufacturer</b> willing to produce them. The objective was to jump-start the FFV industry in Sweden. The two domestic car makers Volvo Group and Saab AB refused to participate arguing there were not in place any ethanol filling stations. However, Ford Motor Company took the offer and began importing the flexifuel version of its Focus model, delivering the first cars in 2001, and selling more than 15,000 FFV Focus by 2005, then representing an 80% market share of the flexifuel market.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{diversity}} of engine technologies for Low Emission Vehicles (LEVs) that are developed by <b>car</b> <b>manufacturers</b> in order to substitute for the conventional internal combustion engine vehicle. Our purpose is to analyse the competition between the various technologies for LEVs {{as well as the}} innovative strategy of <b>car</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> We first propose to define and to represent these technological trajectories in order to compare their performances and to identify their strength and weaknesses. The technological bottlenecks, the barriers to the adoption of these alternative engine technologies as well as the features of this technological competition are underlined. We then use a patent data analysis to study the patent portfolios of the main <b>car</b> <b>manufacturers</b> in these technologies on the period from 1990 to 2005. The dynamics of patents applied by <b>car</b> <b>manufacturers</b> gives insight on the competition among technologies and on the strategy of firms. This analysis emphasises the progressive diversification of firms patent portfolios over the whole set of engine technologies and the differentiated strategic positioning of <b>car</b> <b>manufacturers</b> according to countries.
