5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, wisely researched, and {{honestly}} told. Critics admired the wit and humour. The book reviewer for The Globe and Mail admitted he grew impatient with the grand and repetitive statements about the changing global food system and the authors' hyperbole regarding their modest culinary discoveries. Compared to Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, The 100-Mile Diet {{was found to be}} more <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> easier to read, with Smith and MacKinnon more relatable and sympathetic than Kingsolver.|$|E
5|$|Though Povenmire {{started on}} Rocko simply to occupy his {{downtime}} from The Simpsons, {{he found the}} greater creative freedom he enjoyed on his temporary job <b>compelling,</b> <b>and</b> quit The Simpsons to work on Rocko full-time. There, he reunited with Jeff Marsh, this time as a writing partner; Marsh claimed the crew hoped Povenmire's neatness would offset his own sloppy storyboarding. The pair developed a distinctive style characterized by characteristic musical numbers and chase scenes. Povenmire and Marsh won an Environmental Achievement Award for a 1996 Rocko episode they had written.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} and graphics received positive reviews. Although IGN {{felt that the}} in-depth character traits in Final Fantasy IX could be generally found in other Final Fantasy games, it still found the characters to be engaging and sympathetic. GameSpot found the characters, up to their dialogue and traits, amusing and full of humor. IGN {{also noted that the}} Active Time Event system helps to expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they question many ideas and emotions. Their semi-deformed appearance, which also covers monsters of every size, contain detailed animation and design. They gave praise to the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the careful attention given to the artwork, movement in animations and character interactivity. The movies are seen as emotive and <b>compelling,</b> <b>and</b> the seamless transition and incorporation to the in-game graphics helped to move the plot well.|$|E

5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar looked through {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} lyrics that Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidental—Farrar simply chose lyrics that he found <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> Nora pointed out that they came from a relatively brief period of her father's life when he lived in Los Angeles. He also {{made a conscious decision}} to write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E
25|$|The {{murder of}} Mona Tinsley was a prime case study cited in English law as {{leading to the}} {{abolition}} of the no body, no murder principle. This principle was abolished in 1954. As such, a murder conviction can now be obtained based on circumstantial evidence, should this evidence be sufficiently <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> convincing.|$|E
25|$|Pre-existing {{disadvantage}} {{asks whether}} there was a pre-existing disadvantage or vulnerability experienced by the claimant. In Corbiere v. Canada McLachlin described this factor to be the most <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> suggestive of discrimination if proven. However, the absence of a pre-existing disadvantage does not necessarily preclude a claimant from succeeding as seen in Trociuk v. British Columbia.|$|E
5000|$|Musical {{critics have}} praised Fedorova’s {{signature}} “sweet modesty and wild expression,” which rendered listeners “completely taken by surprise, <b>compelled</b> <b>and</b> astonished.” Fedorova says about her playing, [...] "You can really paint with music.

25|$|Tomb figurines in the Tang dynasty {{were made}} to be {{visually}} <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> it is especially obvious when they are seen in an entire set, or when compared with figurines of other dynasties. The intricate details of each figurine’s craftsmanship imbue them with {{a great sense of}} physical presence and identity. Their personalised facial expressions and postures distinguish each figurine in an imaginable time and space.|$|E
25|$|Though López García {{is devoted}} to the mundane—he depicts humble people, buildings, plants, and {{cluttered}} interiors—his portrayal of these subjects is <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> beautiful. Starkly lit studies of his studio, bathroom, and the red brick wall in his backyard underscore an interest in prosaic subject matter. His deftness brings attention to these simple forms, encouraging the viewer to re-examine the presence of ordinary objects.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1880s {{agriculture}} employed {{more people than}} industry and trade combined. However, Germany was fast becoming an industrialized state with increased rural exodus to the cities. After Bismarck resigned in 1890 and Leo von Caprivi became chancellor, the demands of industry were much more <b>compelling,</b> <b>and</b> the free trade treaties with Russia and Austria as well as legislation favorable to industry {{was seen as a}} threat to agriculture.|$|E
50|$|In short, the Beautiful, {{according}} to Burke, {{is what is}} well-formed and aesthetically pleasing, whereas the Sublime is what {{has the power to}} <b>compel</b> <b>and</b> destroy us. The preference for the Sublime over the Beautiful was to mark the transition from the Neoclassical to the Romantic era.|$|R

25|$|The {{world would}} be a breathtakingly {{beautiful}} place filled with waterfalls, mountains, dense forests, populated with <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> convincing characters with real personality, people who actually reacted to what you did. We wanted to give the player control of a hero who would adapt to the way they played, who would age, become scarred in battle, who could get tattoos, wear dreadlocks and a dress if the player was so inclined. We wanted each and every person who played our game to have a unique experience, to have their own stories to tell. And we called it Thingy.|$|E
25|$|Each car {{featured}} {{a selection of}} political pamphlets, posters, and newspapers for distribution, and a small library. Trains also included a mobile darkroom {{for the development of}} photographs. A key element of the trains was a special film exhibition car, in which politically-oriented movies could be shown. This represented for many peasants their first exposure to the medium of film and the experience could be <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> effective, reaching a large audience with the simple message to support the new revolutionary government. During its first of operation the agit-train October Revolution conducted 430 free film showings, reaching an audience estimated in the hundreds of thousands.|$|E
25|$|A Folk Tale {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point the archetypal dilemma of the folk ballad, {{the transition from}} one home to another {{in the context of}} a wedding, where both men and women run the risk of getting into difficulties. The men might be lured under a spell by elves and the women might be carried off by disguised nixes and it always happens in an outdoor, natural environment, which is both <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> mysterious. Both the elves and the nixes exert a demonic and erotic power over the victims and in most cases have a fateful impact on them - many end in the grave.|$|E

25|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} {{the rest of the}} opinion by the Chief Justice, therefore, those parts of the opinion did not command a majority. In this Plurality Opinion, Roberts wrote that the Schools at issue contend that a racially diverse {{environment}} is beneficial for education and they submit this as the reason why they consider race alone in their school assignments. However, Roberts considers that this interest is not <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> that the use of race for this goal is not narrowly tailored, it is instead used for racial balancing, which is unconstitutional. The schools base their numbers in demographics, therefore making this goal a means to achieve a numerical quota to achieve racial balancing. Roberts concludes that racial balancing cannot be a compelling state interest.|$|E
25|$|Skinny Puppy {{formed in}} 1982 {{as a side}} project for Kevin Crompton in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Crompton was {{dissatisfied}} with the pop direction of his then-current band Images in Vogue, and began Skinny Puppy {{with the intention of}} doing something more <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> experimental. Images in Vogue had become a popular act in Vancouver, achieving several radio hits and opening for groups such as Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, and Roxy Music. Initially Crompton had planned Skinny Puppy to be a side project while he continued his work in Images in Vogue; however, when Images in Vogue later relocated to Toronto, Crompton made Skinny Puppy his full-time project. Crompton had already created the name for the project and recorded several songs when he asked Kevin Graham Ogilvie to join. Ogilvie had been a roommate of Images in Vogue member Gary Blair Smith and had met Crompton at a party in late 1982. To avoid the confusion of having two people named Kevin in one band, the pair created stage names, with Crompton becoming cEvin Key and Ogilvie becoming Nivek Ogre.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} book, Morality: An Introduction to Ethics (1972), Williams wrote that whereas [...] "most moral {{philosophy}} at most times has been empty and boring... ontemporary moral philosophy has found an original {{way of being}} boring, which is by not discussing moral issues at all." [...] He argued {{that the study of}} ethics should be vital, <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> difficult, and he sought an approach that was accountable to psychology and history.|$|E
500|$|... "Episode 3" [...] {{was first}} {{broadcast}} on April 26, 1990, and was viewed by approximately 18 {{percent of the}} available audience in its initial airing. The episode received positive reviews from critics, with its mix of comedy and tragedy seen as a highlight, and Miguel Ferrer's character Albert Rosenfield singled out as a particularly successful example of this. The episode also drew praise from The New York Times for its <b>compelling</b> <b>and</b> unusual cast of characters.|$|E
500|$|The novel had a {{strongly}} positive critical reception.

[...] Kirkus Reviews stated that the [...] "ending was a little tidy", but that the story was <b>compelling,</b> <b>and</b> [...] "getting-there that provides this offering’s greatest reward".|$|E
