50|$|A ball {{tube mill}} may be {{described}} as a cylinder made of steel plates having separate heads or trunions attached to the ends with each trunion resting on suitable bearings for supporting the machine. The trunions are hollow to allow for the introduction of discharge of the materials undergoing reduction in size. The mill shell is lined with chilled iron, carbon steel, manganese steel, or high chrome liners attached to shell body with <b>counter</b> <b>sunk</b> bolts. These liners are made in different shapes so that the counter inside surface of the mill is suited for requirement of a particular application.|$|E
50|$|Hammered coins were {{produced}} {{by placing a}} blank piece of metal (a planchet or flan) of the correct weight between two dies, and then striking the upper die with a hammer to produce the required image on both sides. The planchet was usually cast from a mold. The bottom die (sometimes called the anvil die) was usually <b>counter</b> <b>sunk</b> in a log or other sturdy surface and was called a pile. One of the minters held the die {{for the other side}} (called the trussel), in his hand while it was struck either by himself or an assistant.|$|E
5000|$|The same 10-round {{detachable}} magazine {{fits the}} MAS-44, MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 rifles. The earlier MAS-40 (1940) rifle had a 5-round magazine within the receiver, {{as on the}} bolt action MAS-36 rifle. Lastly, the MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 are equipped with a rail {{on the left side}} of the receiver. It allows for the immediate installation of a [...] "Modele 1953" [...] APX L806 (SOM) telescopic sight by sliding it into place and then locking it in with a small pressure lever. The MAS-49 and MAS49/56 are capable of consistently hitting individual man-size targets up to 400 meters with the adjustable peep sight and up to 800 meters with the APX 806L telescopic sight. The bore is <b>counter</b> <b>sunk</b> at the muzzle to protect the rifling and preserve accuracy. The barrel is freely floating.|$|E
5000|$|At {{a central}} {{location}} near the areas being riveted, a furnace was set up. Rivets {{were placed in}} the furnace and heated to glowing hot (often to white hot) so that they were more plastic and easily deformed. The rivet warmer or [...] "cook" [...] used tongs to remove individual rivets and throw them to a catcher stationed near the joints to be riveted. The catcher (usually) caught the rivet in a leather or wooden bucket with an ash-lined bottom. He placed the rivet into the hole to be riveted, then quickly turned to catch the next rivet. The [...] "holder up or holder on" [...] would hold a heavy rivet set or dolly or another (larger) pneumatic jack against the round head of the rivet, while the riveter (sometimes two riveters) applied a hammer or pneumatic rivet hammer to the unformed head, making it mushroom tightly against the joint in its final domed shape. Alternatively the buck is hammered more or less flush with the structure in a <b>counter</b> <b>sunk</b> hole. Before the use of pneumatic hammers, e.g. in the construction of RMS Titanic, the man who hammered the rivet was known as the [...] "basher". Upon cooling, the rivet contracted and exerted further force, tightening the joint.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 5 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) held at the Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, May 1, 2009. Research completed at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, College of EngineeringThe adhesively bonded layered aluminum is used in aircraft structures to avoid knife edge situations when flush head fasteners are used with minimum gage skins. A 3 -D finite element model was used to estimate the location and magnitude of stress concentration under remote tension for aforementioned. The influence of the countersunk depth and adhesive properties on the stress concentration was investigated for a <b>counter</b> <b>sunk</b> angle of 100 º. The stress concentration {{was found to be}} maximum at the countersink edge for Eadh/Eal > 0. 1 whereas it is slightly below the countersink edge in straight shank portion for Eadh/Eal < 0. 1. Stress concentration was found to be minimum when the adhesive is positioned in the countersunk section...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. The adhesively bonded layered {{aluminum}} {{is used in}} aircraft {{structures to}} avoid knife edge situations when flush head fasteners are used with minimum gage skins. Due to the countersunk hole and adhesive bonding, stress flow becomes more complicated. Extensive knowledge of the different parameters that affect {{the behavior of the}} bonded joints with countersunk holes is essential for dependable and effective design. A 3 -D finite element model was used to estimate the location and magnitude of stress concentration under remote tension for the aforementioned problem. The influence of the various parameters on stress concentration was investigated for a <b>counter</b> <b>sunk</b> angle of 100 º. Different parameters such as ratio of young‟s modulus of adhesive to aluminum, position of adhesive layer, countersunk sunk depths, ratio of thickness to radius and ratio of width to radius have been addressed in this study. The stress flow varies significantly when the plates are filled with fasteners of different pre-tension loads. Also the effects of pre-tension loading were compared for the cases of open hole and fastener filled hole without pre-tension for bonded, monolithic and straight shank hole. The results obtained from the finite element analysis for the monolithic cases have been validated against those reported in literature...|$|E
