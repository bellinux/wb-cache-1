50|$|A <b>crush</b> fetish is a fetish and a {{paraphilia}} {{in which}} one is sexually aroused when someone <b>crushes</b> objects, food, and sometimes small animals (frequently insects) with their body, usually under their foot, or when <b>crushed</b> oneself.

The preference could be barefoot, high-heels, flip flops, socks, sandals and so on, depending on the fetishist. Most soft <b>crush</b> fetishists prefer to distinguish themselves from hard <b>crush</b> fetishists, believing that <b>crush</b> films with larger animals give the entire group a bad label.|$|R

This created controversy between couples who listed other users as <b>crushes</b> as well as people getting ex-crushes when they felt they should have gotten public <b>crushes,</b> and much ethics debating. Finally a small PERL script was written and distributed to poison the database. Faced with attempts to poison the database from many different IP addresses, the project was shut down.|$|R

5|$|In 1977 Barsbold {{suggested}} that oviraptorids fed on molluscs, but Longrich and colleagues {{rejected the idea}} that they practised shell-crushing altogether, since such animals tend to have teeth with broad <b>crushing</b> surfaces. Instead, the shape of the dentary bones in the lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp-edged beak used for shearing tough food, not for cracking hard food items such as bivalves or eggs. The symphyseal shelf {{at the front of the}} dentary may have given some ability for <b>crushing,</b> but as this was a relatively small area, it was probably not the main function of the jaws. The fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted as having been xeric and arid or semi-arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs, as it is unlikely there would have been enough of these items under such conditions to support them.|$|E
