He became famous for his {{rebellion}} against the Ferme générale, the tax <b>collecting</b> <b>agency</b> of the French ancien régime (royal government). In his time, government taxes were levied on salt (the gabelle), tobacco, and farming. The tax collectors, called fermiers, or (tax) farmers, were in charge of collecting all taxes for the king, but the total amount of the tax to be paid by the population was not specified; the tax collectors needed to pay only the pre-agreed amount to the king, but could exact unspecified sums themselves. Many of them were greedy and became wealthy and powerful through their exactions from the poor. The tax collectors were therefore hated by the people.|$|E

50|$|SIAE bans its {{associates}} {{from using}} Creative Commons Licenses. On 23 December 2008, a mixed legal working group, composed of both SIAE and Creative Commons Italia members was announced. The {{aim of the}} group was to allow the authors to choose free and easy-to-use licenses, keeping the commercial use to themselves, and relying on SIAE only for distribution and collection of revenues, but nothing came of it. The first example of Creative Commons license integrated with a copyright <b>collecting</b> <b>agency</b> {{was born in the}} Netherlands and paved the way to more flexible licenses, leaving authors free to use and advertise their works. This choice depended on the new frontiers of computer science, that allowed the authors to publish their works online, which would have been a sort of theft according to previous rules. The only solution for those who wanted to distribute their works online for free, was Creative Commons licence that was able to protect them from plagiarism for commercial purposes, thanks to its “non commercial” clause. Thus the artist was {{able to take advantage of}} Internet speed to advertise his work, making profit from merchandising and live performances. Therefore, the artists are now able to release a work under a “non commercial” Creative Commons licence in order to protect and distribute it and have the chance to make commercial use of it while Buma/Stemra, the Netherland equivalent of SIAE, is responsible for collecting and distributing the revenues.|$|E
