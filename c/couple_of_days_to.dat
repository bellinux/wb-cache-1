The mouse cage should be cleaned every <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> prevent odor and disinfected properly every 2 weeks to prevent infection and disease. In the wild, mice are able to co-exist with other small rodent species. Compared with larger mammals, the mouse's small body {{makes it difficult to}} regulate body temperature effectively. Thus, drafts and large fluctuations in temperature can adversely affect the health of mice.|$|E

500|$|Beneath a Steel Sky was {{published}} in March 1994 by Virgin Interactive on floppy disks and CD-ROM. It came on 15 floppy disks, as opposed to Lure of The Temptress, which came on four. Because of the Amiga restrictions, a few animations had to be left out, as not all Amiga owners had a hard drive.

According to Revolution in-house artist Adam Tween, it took a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> [...] "touch up" [...] the screens.

500|$|At {{one point}} in the episode, the Springfield {{residents}} try to set the record for largest human pyramid, which fails when the pyramid collapses, causing the people to roll into a giant ball. According to director Kirkland, the scene, which the staff members refer to as the [...] "people ball", was very difficult to animate, and it [...] "almost gave [...] a migraine" [...] determining how to implement it in the episode. While {{trying to figure out how}} to animate the [...] "people ball", Kirkland spray-painted a globe with white primer and assigned layout artist Paul Wee to draw the Springfield citizens on it with black ink. Normally, the Simpsons animators each draw ten scenes per week, but because he drew the [...] "people ball", Wee was excused from these duties. Since drawing the [...] "people ball" [...] by hand would have [...] "murdered" [...] the animators, they soon decided to photograph it for each frame of the scene. The photographs were taken in Kirkland's garage and were then photocopied using a Xerox photocopier. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean stated that the technique for animating the [...] "people ball" [...] was [...] "extremely interesting", [...] although it has never been used again in the series. The [...] "master drawing" [...] of the human pyramid, which Kirkland also stated was very complicated, took animator Matthew Schofield a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> draw. The drawing then became a reference for the other animators to use when animating the scene.|$|E

2500|$|... "Countdown", which samples [...] "Uhh Ahh" [...] {{performed}} by American group Boyz II Men, {{was considered to}} be [...] "everywhere on the genre map" [...] by Consequence of Sound's Chris Coplan. It is an upbeat R song, displaying elements of funk music, hip hop music, Latin pop music, world music, reggae as well as dancehall influences. [...] "Countdown" [...] is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 84 beats per minute. The song is scored in the key of D minor, and has the sequence Dm–Gm–F–C. Beyoncé's voice in the song ranges from D3 to F5. [...] "Countdown" [...] makes heavy use of staccato horns, and rides a [...] "disjointed military rhythm", containing an [...] "agitated" [...] Afrobeat heavy brass riff which, according to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, bears resemblance to that of [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] (2011). Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone attributed the bristling brass arrangement to the fact that Beyoncé's collaborated with the band from Fela! for a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> gain inspiration from the play's subject, Nigerian multi-instrumentalist musician and composer, Fela Kuti. Additional instrumentation on the song includes a keyboard, synthesizers, a plucky guitar, 180 BPM steel drums, and trumpets. Built on a stepping beat, [...] "Countdown" [...] features video-game bleeps reminiscent of Knowles' previous alter ego, Sasha Fierce, as stated by Jocelyn Vena of MTV News. Priya Elan of NME noted that it also consists of [...] "some nicely disorientating" [...] chord changes.|$|E
2500|$|Iñárritu {{contacted}} {{friend and}} jazz drummer Antonio Sánchez in January 2013, inviting him to compose the {{score for the}} film. His reaction to writing a soundtrack using only drums was similar to Lubezki's thoughts of shooting the movie like a single shot: [...] "It was a scary proposition because I had no point of reference of how to achieve this. There's no other movie I know that has a score like this." [...] Sánchez had also not worked on a film before, nevertheless, after receiving the script, he composed [...] "rhythmic themes" [...] {{for each of the}} characters. Iñárritu was looking for the opposite approach however, preferring spontaneity and improvisation. Sánchez then waited until production moved to New York before composing more, where he visited the set for a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> get a better idea of the film. Following this, a week before principal photography, he and Iñárritu went to a studio to record some demos. During these sessions the director would first talk him through the scene, then while Sánchez was improvising guide him by raising his hand to indicate an event such as a character opening a door or by describing the rhythm with verbal sounds. They recorded around seventy demos, which Iñárritu used to inform the pacing of the scenes on set, and once filming was complete, spliced them into the rough cut. Sánchez summarized the process by saying [...] "The movie fed on the drums and the drums fed on the imagery." [...] The official soundtrack was released as a CD (77 min) in October 2014, and as an LP (69 min) in April 2015.|$|E
