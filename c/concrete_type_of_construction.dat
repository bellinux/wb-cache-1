40|$|Material {{is devoted}} to the phenomenon, rather new to the Russian economy, – to {{outsourcing}} in construction branch. Widely applied in foreign economic practice he acts at the same time both a micro, and macroeconomic factor. A conclusion of non basic assets from structure of real estate development company (especially – large) and transfer of function on their management to other organizations, specializing in these services, allows to solve a number of problems. The tasks in construction solved by means of outsourcing, concerning preparation of necessary initial and allowing documents and control of work progress are considered in more detail. The company can concentrate on performance of the main functions, without being distracted by the organization of the accompanying processes. As a result outsourcing not only makes for it additional profit, but also increases its competitiveness. Also other advantages, and also shortcomings are considered. Outsourcing can be presented in different types and take various forms. In article the most widespread of them are considered: full, partial and advanced outsourcing. At external similarity of outsourcing and a subcontract are two various economic events. The main differences proceed from the purposes of their application and a procedure of control, and also consist in division of powers of the parties. There is also some other differences. The carried-out analysis shows advantages of the first before the second. Outsourcing in <b>concrete</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> activity is considered on the example of outsourcing of personnel. The Russian construction business gradually comes to understanding that outsourcing is a way of minimization of cumulative expenses, improvement of quality and reductions of time of execution of works...|$|R
50|$|The form of {{the bridge}} was simple, and it looked similar to many highway bridges {{carrying}} traffic on US highways today. The bridge deck was supported by thirteen concrete girders, each spanning 160 ft. These girders were prestressed by post-tensioning four wire cables embedded in the <b>concrete.</b> Although this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> {{had been used in}} Europe for quite some time, the Walnut Lane Memorial Bridge was innovative in the United States and led to the successful application of this technology in this country. The material-saving bridge cost about $700,000 to construct, about 30 percent cheaper than a regular concrete arch design.|$|R
50|$|The low-lying, {{rectangular}} and gable-roofed structures {{behind the}} Old Windmill Tower conceal Brisbane's first inground service reservoirs. The earlier smaller structure {{has a single}} gable roof, while the larger, later one is double-gabled. Excavated deep into {{the crest of the}} hill, the disused reservoirs comprise two box-form structures divided into compartments by high arched baffle walls, cast-iron inlet and outlet, valve chambers and pits, and main, outlet and scour pipes. Built of brick before the age <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> was necessary to withstand external pressure, while the inside walls were rendered to obviate ground water infiltration. The corrugated iron roofs with ample ventilation right along the raised ridges, timber-louvered gables and doorways to descending iron ladders were added later, and evidently painted in contrasting coloured stripes as was the fashion. The service reservoirs, which were built to store water from the Enoggera Dam and improve pressure within the city, played a most important role in Brisbane's first reticulated gravity supply system for the best part of a century.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Howard Van Doren Shaw to be a fireproof design of poured reinforced concrete columns and an open-shell concrete floor. Although considered to be expensive {{by the standards of}} that time, T.E. Donnelley agreed that the support would be needed for the many tons of paper they used and large presses they operated. Supported by 4,675 steel-reinforced <b>concrete</b> columns, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> not only served the Donnelly well, it also provided the perfect infrastructure for future tenants. To further the building’s support structure, reinforcing bars, normally laid perpendicular, were laid at various angles enabling the floors to bear loads of at least 250 pounds per square foot.|$|R
5000|$|Granolithic screed, {{also known}} as granolithic paving and granolithic <b>concrete,</b> is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> {{material}} composed <b>of</b> cement and fine aggregate such as granite or other hard-wearing rock. It is generally used as flooring, or as paving (such as for sidewalks). It has a similar appearance to concrete, and is used to provide a durable surface where texture and appearance are usually not important (such as outdoor pathways or factory floors). It is commonly laid as a screed. Screeds are a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> flooring laid {{on top of the}} structural element (like reinforced concrete) to provide a level surface on which the [...] "wearing flooring" [...] (the flooring which people see and walk on) is laid. A screed can also be laid bare, as it provides a long-lasting surface.|$|R
50|$|Built on the North Fork River, Norfork Dam {{was one of}} the six largest {{concrete}} dams in {{the country}} at the time <b>of</b> its <b>construction.</b> All preliminary investigation, the final design of the structure, and the preparation <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> plans and specs was carried out under the supervision of Lieutenant Colonel Stanley L. Scott. Much work had to be done before construction could begin on the massive structure. First, a suitable location had to be found before any other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> work could begin. Because of the large number of caves in the region foundation exploration, using diamond tipped drills, was carried out for nearly a year before plans were completed. Once a site was selected, a nearby source of sufficient materials for construction had to be located. Since the site was acceptable for either an earth or <b>concrete</b> dam, the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> materials and their locations would be the deciding factor in determining what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> dam would be built. The decision to build a concrete dam was made because sufficient quantities of concrete aggregate could be located near the construction site, while there was insufficient material for an earth dam. The detailed design <b>of</b> the dam, <b>construction</b> plans and specifications were prepared by the design section of the engineering division under Mr. G.R. Schneider.|$|R
40|$|Construction with {{reinforced}} <b>concrete</b> is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> {{the most}} widely used because in addition to easily bring in materials, also does not require special equipment in its implementation. Effectively reinforced concrete used in construction with span beam which is not so long that for reinforced concrete structures and building construction becomes the right choice. Grid structure of the field is typically composed of rigid linear elements such as beam length or truss, which rods top and bottom edges parallel. Planning for the beam-dimensional grid using (b / h) = 200 / 350 mm. Main beam longitudinal and transverse directions both used dimension (b / h) = 400 / 700 mm, for column using the dimension (b / h) = 700 / 700 mm and to use a thickness of 100 mm plate. The calculation of the structure for the roof and floor plate using a diameter of 100 8 − φ, for roof beams used reinforcement grid 16 4 φ for the pedestal and 3 16 φ for the field, for the beam reinforced with a grid floor used 16 5 φ for the pedestal and 3 16 φ for the field. In planning the main beam edge using a reinforcement 7 D 25 for the pedestal and 3 D 25 for the field.

40|$|<b>Concrete</b> is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> {{material}} in which cement, aggregate, and admixture materials are mixed. When cement is produced, {{large amounts of}} substances that impact the environment are emitted during limestone extraction and clinker manufacturing. Additionally, the extraction of natural aggregate causes soil erosion and ecosystem destruction. Furthermore, {{in the process of}} transporting raw materials such as cement and aggregate to a concrete production company, and producing concrete in a batch plant, substances with an environmental impact are emitted into the air and water system due to energy use. Considering the fact that the process of producing concrete causes various environmental impacts, an assessment of various environmental impact categories is needed. This study used a life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of concrete in terms of its global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, ozone depletion potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, and abiotic depletion potential (GWP, AP, EP, ODP, POCP, ADP). The tendency was that the higher the strength of concrete, the higher the GWP, POCP, and ADP indices became, whereas the AP and EP indices became slightly lower. As the admixture mixing ratio of concrete increased, the GWP, AP, ODP, ADP, and POCP decreased, but EP index showed a tendency to increase slightly. Moreover, as the recycled aggregate mixing ratio of concrete increased, the AP, EP, ODP, and ADP decreased, while GWP and POCP increased. The GWP and POCP per unit compressed strength (1 MPa) of high strength concrete were found to be about 13 % lower than that for its normal strength concrete counterpart. Furthermore, in the case of AP, EP, ODP, and ADP per unit compressed strength (1 MPa), high-strength concrete was found to be about 10 %~ 25 % lower than its normal strength counterpart. Among all the environmental impact categories, ordinary cement was found to have the greatest impact on GWP, POCP, and ADP, while aggregate had the most impact on AP, EP, and ODP...|$|R
