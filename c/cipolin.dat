25|$|The basilican nave is wide, {{with narrow}} aisles. On each side, {{monolithic}} columns of grey oriental granite (except one, {{which is of}} <b>cipolin</b> marble) support eight pointed arches much stilted. The capitals of these (mainly Corinthian) are also of the classical period. There is no triforium, but a high clerestory with wide two-light windows, with simple tracery {{like those in the}} nave-aisles and throughout the church, which give sufficient light.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the cathedral is on the Latin cross plan, divided into a nave and two aisles by arcades of antique columns: fourteen in pink granite and two in <b>cipolin.</b> The bases and capitals are from the 2nd century AD. Two large capitals supporting the triumphal arch of the nave were probably made by an Apulian workshop in the mid-12th century.The roof of the nave was lowered, {{as can be seen}} from the exterior of the building. The transept is higher than both the nave and aisles. While parts of the building are barrel-vaulted and parts have an open timber roof, the presbytery has a ribbed vault of stone.|$|E
50|$|Various {{elements}} of the château de l'Hers attest to the occupation of this strategically important location as a control point for river traffic, since late Antiquity at the latest. Several tombs with saddleback roofs form a small 6th-7th necropolis {{not far from the}} first known chapel of the château, dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian. An excavation of this ruined church found lithic industries, and sherds from antiquity and the Iron Age, fragments of Tegula tiles and a <b>cipolin</b> cladding probably dating to Antiquity were re-used in the masonry. A large number of weapons, coins and medals were found in the area. The tollgate on the Rhône was put in place in 79 AD under Vespasian, according to V. Millet (1864).|$|E
40|$|The Sasa Pb-Zn deposit {{has been}} {{localized}} in northeastern {{parts of the}} Republic of Macedonia or within the Serbo-Macedonian metallogenetic province. It formation is related with intrusion of Tertiary volcanics (27 - 24 Ма) into the crystalline fundament (Precambrian gneisses and Paleozoic schists) of the Serbo- Macedonian massif. Pb-Zn mineralization metasomathicaly is deposited into <b>cipolins</b> intercalated into the series of quartz-graphite schist. Genesis and spatial displacement of the Pb-Zn mineralization in the Sasa deposits represents a complex polyphase and timely lasting process directly related with {{the evolution of the}} Neogene magmatism and hydrothermal solutions in the deposits and its adjacent vicinit...|$|R
50|$|In some districts hornfelsed rocks occur {{that have}} {{acquired}} a schistose structure through shearing, and these form transitions to schists and gneisses that contain the same minerals as the hornfels, {{but have a}} schistose instead of a hornfels structure. Among these may be mentioned cordierite and sillimanite gneisses, andalusite and kyanite mica-schists, and those schistose calcite-silicate rocks that are known as <b>cipolins.</b> That these are sediments that have undergone thermal alteration is generally admitted, but the exact conditions under which they were formed are not always clear. The essential features of hornfelsing are ascribed to the action of heat, pressure and permeating vapors, regenerating a rock mass without the production of fusion (at least on a large scale). It has been argued, however, that often there is extensive chemical change owing {{to the introduction of}} matter from the granite into the rocks surrounding it. The formation of new feldspar in the hornfelses is pointed out as evidence of this. While this felspathization may have occurred in a few localities, it seems conspicuously absent from others. Most authorities at the present time regard the changes as being purely of a physical and not of a chemical nature.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Although most of {{the ancient}} monuments found in Ruspina Roman town {{situated}} {{near the town of}} Monastir in the Sahil region of Tunisia were built with local materials, the Roman baths in this site were mainly decorated with imported marbles from Greece, Asia, Numidia, Italy and Algeria, indicating the important trade relationships between Ruspina and the other Mediterranean Roman towns. Among the seven types of marbles used in the decoration of Ruspina’s Roman baths, four have been characterized in previous studies: white Proconnesian from Asia, Penthelic and green <b>cipolin</b> from Greece, and Antique yellow from Simitthus in Tunisia. To characterize and identify the other three types, series of analytical methods had to be applied: minero-petrographic analysis of thin sections, chemical analysis, and isotopic analysis of oxygen and carbon. Used together, the methods enabled to identify the marbles studied: the white fine-grained marble corresponds to Carrara white marble from Italy, and the spotted dull grey and greco scritto came from Cap de Garde quarries in Algeria. With the exception on one type (antique yellow), the other six types were imported marbles...|$|E
