Nearly 80% of residences are owner occupied, 3% are vacant and a further 3% are second homes. The borough has around 25,000 cars: an average of 1.21 per household. Christchurch, in common with the rest of Dorset, has lower <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> than average for the UK.

5|$|In the 1970s {{job losses}} due to {{industrial}} restructuring caused New York City, including Manhattan, {{to suffer from}} economic problems and rising <b>crime</b> <b>rates.</b> While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through the decade and into {{the beginning of the}} 1990s.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought {{to drive out}} foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.|$|E

5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low <b>crime</b> <b>rates,</b> minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be equated with peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, for example, mayor Robert Wagner {{ordered an}} {{increase}} in the New York City Transit Police force from 1,219 to 3,100 officers. During the hours at which crimes most frequently occurred (between 8:00p.m. and 4:00a.m.), the officers went on patrol in all stations and trains. In response, <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> decreased, as extensively reported by the press. In July 1985, however, the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City published a study showing riders abandoning the subway, fearing the frequent robberies and generally bad circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Parts of New Labour's {{political}} philosophy linked crime with social exclusion and pursued policies to encourage partnerships between social and police authorities to lower <b>crime</b> <b>rates.</b> Other areas of New Labour's policy maintained a traditional approach to crime; {{the prison population}} in 2005 rose to over 76,000, mostly owing to the increasing length of sentences. Following the September 11 attacks, the Labour government attempted to emphasise counter-terrorism measures. From 2002, the government followed policies aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour; in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, Labour introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs).|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, Southeast D.C. {{has been}} synonymous with crime and violence, and {{has one of}} the highest <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> in the District of Columbia (albeit not the highest rates in all {{categories}} of crimes). Concern about crime at the Anacostia, Congress Heights, and Southern Avenue stations has existed for many years, although statistics only partially support these concerns. Fear of crime was one of the reasons why, in 1991, Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes that would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia Station.|$|E
5|$|As a major {{industrial}} city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses and unemployment because of dramatic restructuring of the railroads and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent <b>crime</b> <b>rates,</b> which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s <b>crime</b> <b>rates</b> {{started to}} drop {{dramatically}} due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic {{and its associated}} drug-related violence came under greater control. The outflow of population turned around, as the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel {{the growth of the}} real estate market. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in Manhattan's economy.|$|E

Unemployment levels are very low, at 1.9 percent in July 2011, compared to the United Kingdom average of 7.7 percent. The most common religious identity in Weymouth and Portland is Christianity, at 61.0 percent, which is slightly above the England and Wales average of 59.3 percent.

5|$|Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's {{government}} of doing little {{to stem the}} HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive. Mandela later {{admitted that he had}} personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex in South Africa, and that he had instead left the issue for Mbeki to deal with. Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa had one of the world's highest <b>crime</b> <b>rates,</b> and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade. Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed {{to deal with the problem}} of corruption.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} Internet censorship and <b>crime</b> <b>rate.</b> Classical views of censorship suggest that filtering contents that are per- ceived as negative such as violence and pornography can {{have a negative impact}} on <b>crime</b> <b>rate.</b> However, there is no evidence to suggest any causal relationship between censorship and <b>crime</b> <b>rate.</b> The Internet has made it easier for individuals to access any information they want, and hence Internet Censorship is applied to filter contents that are deemed negative. We discussed several approaches that may be used to estimate the relationship between Internet Censorship and <b>Crime</b> <b>Rate,</b> and we decided to use OLS. We found that Conflict Internet Censorship is the only type of Internet censorship that has a significant negative impact on <b>Crime</b> <b>Rate.</b> Furthermore, it only significantly affects <b>Crime</b> <b>Rate</b> for highly educated countries...|$|R
