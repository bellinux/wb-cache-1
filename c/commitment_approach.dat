The “assembly of governments” would issue permits {{in the amount of}} the global target and all upstream fossil-fuel providers would be forced to buy these permits. All permits would be auctioned by the assembly which would also negotiate how to distribute the revenues. Such a set of commitments, if kept, would form a true quantity-based carbon pricing policy, and result in an efficient uniform global carbon price. However, this would not necessarily be the correct price, which would depend on the chosen global emission target. How the revenues would be distributed would undoubtedly prove to be a contentious problem.|$|E

Automation is achieved by reducing the WEB-refinement proof obligation to a formula in the logic of Counter arithmetic with Lambda expressions and Uninterpreted functions (CLU). We use UCLID to transform the resulting CLU formula into a CNF formula, which is then checked with a SAT solver. We define several XScale-like models with out of order completion, including models with precise exceptions, branch prediction, and interrupts. We use two types of refinement maps. In one, flushing is used to map pipelined machine states to instruction set architecture states; in the other, we use the <b>commitment</b> <b>approach,</b> which is the dual of flushing, since partially completed instructions are invalidated.

40|$|The {{contributions}} {{of this research}} are a scalable formulation and solution method for decentralized unit commitment, experimental results comparing decentralized unit commitment solution times to conventional unit commitment methods, {{a demonstration of the}} benefits of faster unit commitment computation time, and extensions of decentralized unit commitment to handle system network security constraints. We begin with a discussion motivating the shift from centralized power system control architectures to decentralized architectures and describe the characteristics of such an architecture. We then develop a formulation and solution method to solve decentralized unit commitment by adapting an existing approach for separable convex optimization problems to the nonconvex domain of unit commitment. The potential computational speed benefits of the novel decentralized unit <b>commitment</b> <b>approach</b> are then further investigated through a rolling-horizon framework that represents how system operators make decisions and adjustments online as new information is revealed. Finally, the decentralized unit <b>commitment</b> <b>approach</b> is extended to include network contingency constraints, a crucial function for the maintenance of system security. The results indicate decentralized unit commitment holds promise as a way of coordinating system operations in a future decentralized grid and also may provide a way to leverage parallel computing resources to solve large-scale unit commitment problems with greater speed and model fidelity than is possible with conventional methods.

Fairness in an e-tendering is of utmost importance. Current proposals and implementations do not provide fairness and thus, are vulnerable to collusion and favourism.

40|$|This paper reviews three {{distinct}} strategies in recent economics {{for using the}} concept of social identity in the explanation of individual behavior: Akerlof and Kranton 2 ̆ 019 s neoclassical approach, Sen 2 ̆ 019 s <b>commitment</b> <b>approach,</b> and Kirman et al. 2 ̆ 019 s complexity approach. The primary focus is the multiple selves problem and the difficulties associated with failing to explain social identity and personal identity together.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} unit {{commitment}} model for studying the impact of large-scale wind integration in power systems with transmission constraints and system component failures. The model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program with uncertain wind production in various locations of the network as well as generator and transmission line failures. We present a scenario selection algorithm for selecting and weighing wind power production scenarios and composite element failures, and we provide a parallel dual decomposition algorithm for solving the resulting mixed-integer program. We validate the proposed scenario selection algorithm by demonstrating that it outperforms alternative reserve <b>commitment</b> <b>approaches</b> in a 225 bus model of California with 130 generators and 375 transmission lines. We use our model to quantify day-ahead generator capacity commitment, operating cost impacts, and renewable energy utilization levels for various degrees of wind power integration.

An overview of functional contextualism as the philosophical foundation for RFT is provided before coverage of RFT. Critical distinctions between functional contextualism and mechanism can be clarified by summarizing the two positions on the following philosophical issues: the nature of ‘truth’, and the view of behaviour and its causes.

40|$|Abstract—The {{impact of}} wind power {{forecasting}} on unit commitment and dispatch is investigated in this paper. We present two unit commitment methods {{to address the}} variability and intermittency of wind power. The uncertainty in wind power forecasting is captured {{by a number of}} scenarios in the stochastic unit <b>commitment</b> <b>approach,</b> while a point forecast of wind power output is used in the deterministic alternative. Several cases with different wind power forecasts and reserve requirements are simulated. The preliminary results show that the quality of wind power forecasting has a great impact on unit commitment and dispatch. The stochastic method shows its value in terms of relatively lower dispatch cost. However, the dispatch results are also sensitive to the level of reserve requirement. Our results so far indicate that a deterministic method combined with an increased reserve requirement can produce results that are comparable to the stochastic case.
