The first working title was 'Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi,' and Shantanu (Moitra, the music director) told him. So he said, 'Munnabhai to theek hai, yeh Mahatma Gandhi kaun hai?' ('Munnabhai is fine, but who is this Mahatma Gandhi?') So this is the sad state of affairs today. I was shocked. And it's not just the chai-wallah. A few days ago on TV a lot of {{politicians}} were asked India-related questions on the news channels, and I can't believe a lot of them don't know 2 October is Gandhiji's birthday! Many didn't know his first name. They kept saying, 'what's in a name, we respect his ideals,' but come on! How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> know his name? ...|$|E

[...] Gilbert suggested an opera based on a theatrical company, which Sullivan rejected (though a version of it would be resurrected in 1896 as The Grand Duke), but he accepted an idea [...] "connected with Venice and Venetian life, and this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> develop this with something we can both go into with warmth and enthusiasm and thus give me a subject in which (like the Mikado and Patience) we can both be interested....?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Crediting Andrea Martin {{with her}} broad and {{confident}} initial portrayal of Ishka, Adams commented on {{how easy it}} was to play a character so well delineated. [...] Adams also infused Ishka with some of the stories Shimerman told of his own mother. [...] In an interview with , Adams said of Ishka: [...] "I love and adore her. [...] How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not?</b> [...] She just doesn't care what anybody thinks; she's so committed to what she thinks is right, and everyone else be damned. [...] But she has a heart of gold, and she's very strong. [...] To be a female as strong as she was, in the kind of world she came from, was wonderful, I think." [...] Lauding the character, Adams says that it's Ishka's backbone that helps her grow as an actress and as a person. [...] Adams has appeared at several Star Trek conventions with her [...] "Ferengi family" [...] and relishes meeting fans who express how much they love the character of Ishka.|$|E
2500|$|When {{she first}} {{looked at a}} student's score, she often commented on its {{relation}} {{to the work of}} a variety of composers: [...] "hese measures have the same harmonic progressions as Bach's F major prelude and Chopin's F major Ballade. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> come up with something more interesting?" [...] Virgil Thomson found this process frustrating: [...] "Anyone who allowed her in any piece to tell him what to do next would see that piece ruined before his eyes by the application of routine recipes and bromides from standard repertory." [...] Copland recalled that [...] "she had but one all-embracing principle...the creation of what she called la grande ligne - the long line in music." [...] She disapproved of innovation for innovation's sake: [...] "When you are writing music of your own, never strain to avoid the obvious." [...] She said, [...] "You need an established language and then, within that established language, the liberty to be yourself. It's always necessary to be yourself – that is a mark of genius in itself." ...|$|E

Lu Su had all along regarded Lü Meng with contempt, but someone told him, [...] "General Lü's fame and glory are increasing day by day. You shouldn't view him in the same light now as you did in the past. You should visit him soon." [...] Lu Su then headed to Lü Meng's camp. After some drinks, Lü Meng asked Lu Su, [...] "You've received an important appointment and you're going to be stationed near Guan Yu. Have you made any contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances?" [...] Lu Su lackadaisically replied, [...] "I'll adapt to the situation when the time comes." [...] Lü Meng then said, [...] "The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is nonetheless a person with the might of bears and tigers. How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> make preparations beforehand?" [...] Lü Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su {{on how to deal with}} Guan Yu. Lu Su left his seat, came closer to Lü Meng, placed his hand on his shoulder and said, [...] "Lü Ziming, I never knew you had such insights until I came here." [...] He also visited Lü Meng's mother and left after befriending Lü Meng.|$|E

2500|$|In 737, Emperor Xuanzong's {{favorite}} concubine Consort Wu, {{trying to}} have her son Li Mao (李瑁) the Prince of Shou made crown prince, made false accusations against Li Ying the Crown Prince, {{as well as two}} other princes, Li Yao (李瑤) the Prince of E and Li Ju (李琚) the Prince of Guang. [...] Li Ying, Li Yao, and Li Ju were deposed and then forced to commit suicide. [...] Consort Wu died later that year, but Li Linfu, who was then chancellor and who was allied with her, continued to lobby on Li Mao's behalf. [...] Instead, Emperor Xuanzong was considering an older son, Li Yu the Prince of Zhong, but could not decide quickly, and was depressed over the matter as well as his killing of three of his own sons. [...] He could not sleep well or eat well. [...] Gao asked him the reason, and he responded, [...] "You are my old servant. [...] <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> tell?" [...] Gao responded, [...] "Is it that the position of young master [...] has not been decided?" [...] He responded, [...] "Yes." [...] Gao responded, [...] "You do not need to trouble your heart.
