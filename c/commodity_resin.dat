The preparation was facilitated {{in the case of}} the composites based on oxidized fibers. During the process, the front displacement of injected resin was more regular, more homogeneous, and faster in the case of oxidized fibers. The morphology, thermal and mechanical properties of the resultant composites were characterized by SEM, DSC, DMA, as well as three-point bending and Charpy impact tests. An elevated reinforcing capability of the oxidized fibers as compared to their unmodified counterparts was demonstrated, particularly by a high strain test in the glassy state. This confirmed the enhanced filler/matrix interface observed in such materials during the process and in the final composite as analyzed by SEM. No significant difference in reinforcing capability of the two kinds of filler was observed in the DMA analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{forecast}} the market shares that the commodity plastic resins (e. g., low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride) would have for the years 1980, 1985, 1990, and 2000. The means used to make the forecast was the Delphi method; therefore, the input information was generated by a group of plastic industry experts and represents a concensus opinion. ^ The need for the study arises because of the low energy requirements of production of plastic composited goods as compared to goods manufactured of other materials. This low energy demand requirement for goods made from plastic is the basis for demand forecasts that call for commodity plastic resin production in excess of 225 billion pounds by the year 2000. Actual demand from year to year and decade to decade will vary with the ups and downs of the business cycle, but is is clear that a very large investment must be made in <b>commodity</b> <b>resin</b> manufacturing facilities if the higher levels of demand are to be satisfied at reasonable material costs. ^ This study looks at market shares as a useful means of comparing the market relationships among the commodity resins. Shares can be converted easily to production capacity requirements both existing and needed to meet future demand. ^ Twenty five experts from the commodity plastic resin industry participated in making the Delphi forecast. All of these experts are employed by plastic resin manufacturing companies that belong to The Society of the Plastic Industry Inc., the major plastic industry trade organization. ^ The study includes 62 tables that show 1976 production capacities and those required to meet projected demand both in pounds and dollars. Also shown by the same tables are the statistical comparisons of the two intermediate Delphi forecasts that show the gathering concensus of the experts. There are also eight exhibits and six graphs that support the findings. ^ The result of the study is a Delphi forecast for commodity resins that covers the period of 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995 and the year 2000. ^...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the technical and economic viability of using waste plastics and scrap rubber for non-structural highway products in Ontario. Information was gathered {{from a variety of sources}} via a computer literature survey, a mail survey, and interviews. Approximately 4, 600 tomes of waste plastics per year (mostly from commerciaVindustria 1 sources) in the Greater Metro Toronto region are currently not recycled. The technology for recycling and reprocessing waste plastics and rubber is well developed and widely available. However, the technology for production of plastic lumber is yet to be developed. Current production methods are felatively slow, especially when compared to high-speed timber processing systems. The study concludes that waste plastics based on the four major <b>commodity</b> <b>resins</b> (polyethylene PE, polypropylene PP, polystyrene PS, and polyvinyl chloride PVC) and on scrap rubber would be suitable for certain non-structural highway products.

40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cells}} (PEMFCs) exhibit encouraging potential as an enabling {{technology for the}} Hydrogen Economy. Currently an important barrier to commercialization is the cost associated with existing PEMFC materials; this projectâ€™s goal was to investigate alternative materials for PEMFC bipolar plates. Conductive thermoplastic materials offer the promise of low density, low cost processing, and inexpensive resins, and were the focus of material development for PEMFC bipolar plate applications. In order to develop a thermoplastic bipolar plate this study utilized {{the combination of a}} low cost injection moldable <b>commodity</b> polymer <b>resin,</b> and low cost carbon materials as conductive fillers. The materials selected and tested included; a polypropylene copolymer; acetylene carbon black; Vulcan carbon black; and short carbon fiber. The components were combined in a twin screw extruder and injection molded into samples for testing. The result was a spectrum of composite samples with a range of filler loadings from 0 to 60 wt% and varying filler type ratios. Synergy between the different carbon types was achieved which led to better physical properties, specifically conductivity. The novel blends produced were tested for electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, rheology, microscopy, and actual plates were made and tested in a single cell PEMFC. These trials enabled discussion around the feasibility of the materials with respect to processability, cost, and performance (both in the fuel cell and in potential applications). The most significant results were measured using a composite blend with 54 wt% filler loading and a 1 : 1 : 1 filler ratio. Mechanical results achieved 68 % and 100 % of the industry targets for tensile and flexural strength, respectively. Tensile strength attained 27. 7 MPa and flexural strength measured 82. 8 MPa. Electrical conductivity results for the same samples varied between the two methods of measurement used. Using a fuel cell industry recommended procedure 2. 2 S/cm was achieved and using a four point ASTM measurement technique 12. 0 S/cm was reported. These values represent 3 % to 12 % of the industry target. Actual 16 cm 2 fuel cell plates were produced, fuel cell hardware constructed and assembled, and the power output was found to be 51 % relative to graphite plates. Thermoplastic bipolar plates for PEMFCs made of composite materials is promising, but optimum filler loading that balances all properties is still required in order to achieve conductivity targets. Nevertheless this study has demonstrated that conductive thermoplastic bipolar plates can be produced via injection molding...|$|R

Since most of these industrial processes use slurry or gas-phase reactors, soluble single-site catalysts must be supported on adequate carriers that ensure not only high activity, but also the formation of polymer particles with the proper morphology and bulk densities. Metallocene catalysts have been supported on a variety of carriers, but supporting late transition metal catalysts has not been investigated in detail, despite their very interesting properties such as tolerance to polar comonomers and impurities, activity in the absence of MAO, and the formation of short chain branches by the chain walking mechanism. The research work of this PhD thesis intends to fill this gap, by developing supported late transition metal catalysts with high catalyst activities towards ethylene polymerization and good polymer particle morphology. The effects of catalyst structure and polymerization conditions on silica-supported nickel diimine catalysts are discussed in Chapter 3. Compared with the equivalent homogeneous catalysts, the covalently-attached supported catalysts had high activities, produced spherical polyethylene particles with good morphologies, and polyethylene with higher melting temperatures, higher molecular weight averages, and broader molecular weight distributions. Borates used as internal activators during the synthesis of these supported catalysts successfully activated the nickel diimine complexes. In Chapter 4, MgCl 2 /alcohol adducts are recrystallized with alkylaluminum compounds and used as catalysts supports for nickel diimine complexes functionalized with amine groups. Polymerization results were compared with those of the equivalent SiO 2 -supported nickel diimine catalysts. MgCl 2 -based supported nickel diimine catalysts had high catalyst activity without the use of activators, and it was possible to control polymer molecular weight averages by changing the support composition. Although linear low density polyethylene made with metallocenes offers superior mechanical properties such as excellent toughness, impact strength and clarity, it suffers from poor processability. To overcome some of these disadvantages, Chapter 5 introduces methods to produce bimodal polyethylene resins using supported hybrid early and late transition metal catalyst systems. The presence of short chain branches in the higher molecular weight component is attributable to the incorporation of alpha-olefin molecules by the metallocene sites, while the nickel diimine catalyst sites produce chains with a distribution of short chain branch sizes through the chain walking mechanism. Finally, in Chapter 6 supporting a nickel diimine catalyst onto organo-modified montmorillonite (MMT) to prepare polyethylene/clay nanocomposites through in-situ polymerization is described. The thermal properties and crystallinity of the nanocomposites could be controlled by varying the fraction of MMT in the nanocomposite, and the dispersion of the MMT layers in the polymer matrix were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ...|$|R
