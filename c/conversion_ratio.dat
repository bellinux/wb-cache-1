5|$|The kukersite {{oil shale}} of Ordovician age in Estonia {{is part of}} the Baltic oil shale basin and was {{deposited}} in shallow marine basins. The deposit is one of the world’s highest-grade deposits with more than 40% organic content and 66% <b>conversion</b> <b>ratio</b> into shale oil and gas. The oil shale is located in a single calcareous layer 2.5–3meters in thickness and is buried at depths from 7 to 100m. The total area of the basin is about 3,000km2. Oil yield from Kukersite is 30 to 47%. Most of the organic matter is derived from the fossil green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca, which has affinities to the modern cyanobacterium, Entophysalis major, an extant species that forms algal mats in inter-tidal to very shallow subtidal waters. Matrix minerals include low-magnesium calcite, dolomite, and siliciclastic minerals. It is not enriched in heavy metals.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the strategic behavior exhibited by entrepreneurs {{in the context}} of convertible preferred stocks contracts where the venture capitalists are protected by an antidilution clause.

We show that the degree to which earnings is reported truthfully is heavily influenced by the particular <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> selected by the venture capitalists. Nevertheless, adjusting the <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> to encourage entrepreneurs to report truthfully may dampen the effect of antidilution clauses in motivating the entrepreneurs to exert greater effort...|$|R

40|$|Background: Opioid {{switching}} or rotation {{is reported}} to be a common practice in palliative care. Published tables of opioid <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> have been found to vary in their recommendations, potentially leading to significant differences in clinical practice. Aims: To identify common practices in the calculation of opioid equianalgesia by specialist palliative medicine practitioners and trainees. Method: An anonymous, cross-sectional, online survey completed by 85 Australian palliative care specialists or advanced trainees. Questions focused on <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> used in switching between oral and parenteral opioid doses; <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> used when switching from other opioids to oral morphine; and practice of commencing methadone. Results: The majority of respondents calculated equianalgesic doses for morphine, oxycodone and hydromorphone using the same <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios.</b> Methadone was used almost equally as either the sole opioid or as a 2 ̆ 7 co-opioid 2 ̆ 7. The majority surveyed converted slow-release hydromorphone differently to the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations. Conclusion: Further discussion among Australian palliative care specialist organisations is recommended in order to produce uniform conversion guidelines to improve consistency and safety in the prescribing of opioids...|$|R
500|$|During the Han dynasty, {{the power}} a {{government}} official exercised was determined by his annual salary-rank, measured in grain units known as dan ( [...] , a unit of volume, approximately [...] ). However, approximately half an official's salary in grain was made in payments of cash coins, the standard of which, after 119 BC, was the wushu (五銖) coin measuring 3.2 g (0.11oz). The other half of an official's salary consisted of unhusked grain and husked grain measured in hu (觳, approximately 20 L / 676 oz); since one hu of unhusked grain was equal to 100 coins and one hu of husked grain was equal to 160 coins, the <b>conversion</b> <b>ratio</b> for unhusked grain to husked grain was 10 to 6 (see table below). The most senior officials in central government earned a 10,000-dan salary. The officials who oversaw nine specialized ministries each earned the Fully 2,000-dan rank, while the magistrate of a county earned a 600-dan rank. Occasionally, emperors bestowed luxurious gifts of wine, foodstuffs, and silk clothes upon high officials. These gifts, in some generous cases, could equal {{as much as half}} the value of the officials' standard annual salary. Aged officials were often retired from service and given a pension.

2500|$|<b>Conversion</b> <b>ratio</b> (also called [...] "rectification ratio", and confusingly, [...] "efficiency") η {{is defined}} as the ratio of DC output power to the input power from the AC supply. [...] Even with ideal rectifiers, the ratio is less than 100% because some of the output power is AC power rather than DC which manifests as ripple {{superimposed}} on the DC waveform. [...] The ratio can be improved with the use of smoothing circuits which reduce the ripple and hence reduce the AC content of the output. <b>Conversion</b> <b>ratio</b> is reduced by losses in transformer windings and power dissipation in the rectifier element itself. This ratio is of little practical significance because a rectifier is almost always followed by a filter to increase DC voltage and reduce ripple.

40|$|Software {{estimation}} is {{an important}} aspect in software development projects because poor estimations can lead to late delivery, cost overruns, and possibly project failure. Backfiring is a popular technique for sizing and predicting the volume of source code by converting the function point metric into source lines of code mathematically using <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios.</b> While this technique is popular and useful, {{there is a high}} margin of error in backfiring. This research introduces a new method to reduce that margin of error. Neural networks and fuzzy logic in software prediction models have been demonstrated in the past to have improved performance over traditional techniques.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fully integrated capacitive DC-DC converter {{with a wide}} input voltage range. The folding Dickson converter is used to implement four discrete voltage <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios,</b> capable of operating over a wide input voltage range.

Implementing this additional converter at the end of the Dickson cascade reduces the complexity of driving the extra power train switches. This improved folding Dickson converter achieves an average efficiency above 70 % at maximum output power, and operates over an input voltage range of 2. 5 - 8 V for an output voltage of 1. 2 V.

2500|$|In {{intensive}} broiler sheds, the air {{can become}} highly polluted with ammonia from the droppings. In {{this case a}} farmer must run more fans {{to bring in more}} clean fresh air. If not this can damage the chickens' eyes and respiratory systems and can cause painful burns on their legs (called hock burns) and blisters on their feet. Broilers bred for fast growth have a high rate of leg deformities because the large breast muscles causes distortions of the developing legs and pelvis, and the birds cannot support their increased body weight. In cases where the chickens become crippled and can't walk farmers have to go in and pull them out. Because they cannot move easily, the chickens are not able to adjust their environment to avoid heat, cold or dirt as they would in natural conditions. [...] The added weight and overcrowding also puts a strain on their hearts and lungs and Ascites can develop. In the UK, up to 19 million broilers die in their sheds from heart failure each year.
