40|$|<b>Cushing</b> <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> in {{pregnant}} women is rare {{and difficult to}} be diagnosed because of the syndrome's association with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea and the changes in cortisol metabolism during normal pregnancy. Cushing syndrome in pregnancy is usually confused with complicated pregnancy, such as preeclampsia or gestational diabetes, and its rarity leads to a low degree of clinical suspicion, often delaying diagnosis. We experienced a case of <b>Cushing</b> <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> in pregnancy, which had been considered as the severe preeclampsia and gestational diabetes due to uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia. The pregnancy was terminated with an emergency cesarean operation at 30 weeks of gestation because of severe preeclampsia.

40|$|CORTICOTROPIC AXIS: The {{nycthemeral}} {{pattern of}} cortisol {{is a good}} marker of the circadian clock. Cortisol levels fluctuate between a peak level, observed {{in the early hours}} of the morning, and a minimal level around midnight. This variability is considerably reduced or even abolished in <b>Cushing</b> <b>s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> THYREOTROPIC AXIS: The nycthemeral pattern of TSH secretion is dependent on both the circadian clock and sleep (which inhibits hormone secretion). The moment of the evening rise is a reliable marker of the circadian rhythmicity. SOMATOTROPIC AXIS: Growth hormone is essentially pulsatile. GH levels are often undetectable between pulses. The circadian rhythmicity plays only a minor role in the regulation of growth hormone secretion. LACTOTROPIC AXIS: Nycthemeral variations in prolactin secretion are mainly regulated by wake-sleep cycles; peak levels occur in the middle of the night. Prolactin secretion is also modulated by the circadian rhythmicity. GONADOTROPIC AXIS: Gonadotropins are secreted in pulses, following the pulses of GnRH secretion. In adult women, nycthemeral variations in LH are strongly modulated by the menstrual cycle. MELATONIN: The nychtemeral pattern of melatonin is an excellent marker of the circadian clock. Diurnal concentrations are low and vary little whereas peak levels are observed in the middle of the night. Melatonin rhythmicity is not influenced by sleep, but is dependent on exposure to light and darkness. English AbstractJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tResearch Support, U. S.

40|$|Objective Establishing {{the cause}} of Cushing's {{syndrome}} can be a considerable challenge, in particular in ectopic ACTH syndrome, and often requires a combination of biochemical tests and imaging procedures. Subject A 27 -year-old man presented with signs of Cushing's syndrome. P-ACTH levels were 3 times above the ULN and free urinary cortisol {{in the order of}} 1900 nmol/ 24 h. The work-up showed remarkable results. Results A 2 -day low-dose dexamethasone suppression test demonstrated paradoxical increases in cortisol. Sampling from the inferior petrosal sinuses (BIPSS) showed a central to peripheral ACTH ratio of 4. 7 after CRH stimulation, i. e. indicated pituitary disease, but MRI of the pituitary was normal and baseline P-CRH < 1. 0 (ref. < 5) pmol/L. CT scan of the lungs showed 2 oval-shaped masses, 1. 3 x 1. 8 and 1. 3 x 2 cm, in the middle lobe. Both were positive at somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, compatible with tumors or inflammatory lesions. Subsequently, 11 C- 5 -hydroxytryptophan-PET showed distinct uptake in the tumors but not elsewhere. Two carcinoids situated 3 cm apart, both staining for ACTH, were removed at surgery. Conclusion This unusual case with dual bronchial carcinoids inducing hypercortisolism illustrates the problems with identifying the source of ACTH in <b>Cushing</b> <b>s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Possibly, the false positive result at BIPSS reflects an unusual sensitivity of the pituitary corticotrophs to CRH in this patient since ectopic CRH secretion and/or eucortisolism {{at the time of the}} procedure could be ruled out. The work-up illustrates the great value of 11 C- 5 -hydroxytryptophan-PET as a diagnostic procedure when other investigations have produced ambiguous results...|$|E

40|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} (CAH) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder affecting adrenal steroid synthesis. More than 95 % of CAH cases {{are caused by}} reduced 21 -hydroxylase function leading to variable extent of cortisol and aldosterone deficiency in addition to androgen excess. The foundation of CAH treatment {{is the use of}} glucocorticoids. However, overtreatment leads to <b>Cushing</b> <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> and undertreatment to hyperandrogenism and Addisonian crisis. The aims of this thesis has been to evaluate the impact of CAH and its treatment on some factors {{that could lead to a}} reduced quality of life and increased morbidity or mortality during adult life. In total 93 patients (32 males) with CAH and 93 (32 males) age- and sex-matched controls were studied. Subgroups of different ages (< 30 years or older), phenotypes and the three most common genotype groups (null, I 2 splice and I 172 N) were studied. Focus was on cardiovascular and metabolic risk, bone health in females and fertility in males. Cardiovascular and metabolic risk: Younger female and male patients and controls had similar waist/hip ratio, lean and fat mass and insulin values. Older females had higher waist/hip ratio, lean mass and insulin values than controls. Fat mass was similar to controls but higher than in younger patients. Lipid profiles were slightly more favourable in older patients than in controls. Gestational diabetes was more common in patients. Few older female patients had hypertension, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Despite moderate glucocorticoid doses, most patients had suppressed androgens. Serum liver enzymes were elevated in patients compared to controls. In patients, liver enzymes were correlated with waist circumference and with total body and trunk fat. Liver enzymes were increased even in non-obese patients mainly attributed to the patients ≥ 30 years who also demonstrated elevated insulin levels and HOMA-indices. In older males, waist/hip ratio, fat mass, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were higher and heart rate faster than in controls. Insulin levels were increased during oral glucose tolerance test in all and older patients. Homocysteine was lower in all and in younger male patients which may be cardioprotective. Adverse cardiovascular profiles were mainly found in the mild genotype I 172 N. This group had normal urinary epinephrine concentrations whereas the more severe genotypes null and I 2 splice had low levels. Few old male patients had cardiovascular disease and no patient had diabetes. Bone health in females: Patients had lower bone mineral density (BMD) than controls at all measured sites. In patients ≥ 30 years old 73 % were osteopenic or osteoporotic vs 21 % in controls. BMD was similar in the two classic forms and had no obvious relationship to genotypes. More fractures were reported in patients than controls. Fertility in males: Compared to national data the fertility was impaired in CAH males. The lifetime number of partners was smaller in all patients, in older patients and in the null group. Testicular tumours (TARTs) were found in 86 % and 47 % had pathological semen. Those with pathological semen had increased total and truncal fat mass, fat/lean mass ratio and heart rate. FSH was elevated and correlated negatively with sperm count and concentration. Conclusions: Adult CAH females and males have a number of issues due to the disease and to corticoid supplementation. However, the findings in this thesis are more positive than many of the previous reports on CAH. Many parameters studied in our CAH individuals < 30 years were not different from age- and sex-matched controls. This is likely to reflect improvements in management...|$|E
40|$|The {{zebrafish}} (Danio rerio), {{a tropical}} {{fresh water fish}} originally found in the rivers of India and Bangladesh has become a popular vertebrate model system over the last decade. The rapid sequencing of the zebrafish genome together with the latest advances in forward and reverse genetics has made this model organism more fascinating {{as it can be}} used to decipher the genetic mechanisms involved in the vertebrate development. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) regulates the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress. Alteration in the production of CRH can lead to <b>Cushing</b> <b>s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> anxiety-related disorders and other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers s disease, Parkinson s dementia and Huntington s disease. In mammals it was reported that a POU class III gene by name Brn- 2 is essential for the development of specific neuroendocrine cell types. Brn- 2 can also regulate the transcription of corticotropinreleasing hormone by binding to its promoter. Corroborating the above fact, knockout studies in mice have shown that deletion of Brn- 2 affects the development of corticotropinreleasing hormone producing neurons in addition to oxytocin and vasopressin synthesizing neurons. In order to understand the genetic mechanisms involved in the development of zebrafish neuroendocrine hypothalamus, we attempted to characterize the developmental expression profile of brn 1. 2 and crh in zebrafish. Zebrafish crh gene has not been characterized before and only a partial sequence of brn 1. 2 was reported earlier. We screened the zebrafish EST database for brn 1. 2 and crh through a blast search and identified EST s for crh and brn 1. 2 that contained their full ORF. We used non-quantitative RT-PCR to analyze embryonic and post-embryonic expression pattern of crh. Expression of crh mRNA was detected from 1 dpf and it remained stable through 5 dpf. RT-PCR analysis of the tissues revealed strong expression of crh mRNA in the brain, eye, gills and weak expression in the testis. Spatial expression pattern of both the genes were analyzed by whole mount in situ hybridization. Expression of crh was detected in different parts of the embryonic brain including telencephalon, hypothalamus, posterior tuberculum, thalamus, preoptic area, epiphysis, midbrain tegmentum, hindbrain and in the retina. Localization of CRH transcripts in the preoptic area is consistent with its role as a hypophysiotropin in zebrafish. Zebrafish POU class III genes include brn 1. 2, zp 47, zp 12, zp 23 and zp 50. zp 47 and brn 1. 2 are found to be the direct homologs of the mammalian Brn- 2 gene. Expression of brn 1. 2 begins at tailbud stage. From 5 -somite stage on, brn 1. 2 is detected in the midbrain, hindbrain and weakly in the spinal cord. At 24 hpf brn 1. 2 is widely expressed in the diencephalon, midbrain and hindbrain but not detected in the telencephalon. At later stages of development brn 1. 2 transcripts were found in the hypothalamus, preoptic area, ventral thalamus, dorsal thalamus, pretectum, tectum, cerebellum and hindbrain. Additionally, brn 1. 2 was also detected in the otic vesicle at 48 hpf. In this study we have described the developmental expression pattern of brn 1. 2 and crh. Future studies will include a complete analysis of the function of brn 1. 2 in the specification of the hypothalamic neurons and also identification of other candidate genes that are required for the development these neurons...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome {{is a collection}} of associated disorders, affected by lifestyle, genetic predisposition and environment, and emerges {{as a consequence of the}} Western society lifestyle. It describes a variety of cardiovascular and atherosclerotic risk factors including insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia and arterial hypertension. The connection between insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus type 2 has been well established, and the major abnormalities are peripheral insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction and increased endogenous glucose production. Glucocorticoids have received considerable interest among the many factors that play a role in the {{metabolic syndrome}}. Excess glucocorticoid levels cause glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, as demonstrated by the clinical picture of <b>Cushing</b> <b>s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which closely resembles the metabolic syndrome. A further understanding of the disease mechanisms behind the metabolic syndrome is essential to diminish its increasing impact on health of the Western population. Novel pharmacological treatment strategies based on modulation of glucocorticoid function is a feasible approach to combat this metabolic disease. Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that belong to the superfamily of ligand-activated nuclear receptors. An emerging concept describes tissue-specific metabolic reactions that many hormones undergo, including steroids, resulting in a pre-receptor control mechanism. The OH/keto group on the C 11 -position in glucocorticoids determines if the steroid can activate its receptor or is inert. The enzyme responsible for this conversion of glucocorticoids is 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD). Two different isozymes of 11 beta-HSD (11 beta-HSD 1 and 11 beta-HSD 2) are described. Their functions are to activate and inactivate glucocorticoids in a tissue-dependent manner. 11 beta-HSD 1 mediates activation of the glucocorticoid precursor cortisone (in humans) to the active glucocorticoid receptor ligand cortisol. It is widely expressed in central and peripheral tissues involved in glucose and carbohydrate metabolism, including liver and adipose tissue. Because of the beneficial effects of reduced tissue glucocorticoid levels in the metabolic syndrome and related disorders, 11 beta-HSD 1 is a pursued target of pharmacological intervention. The aims of the study were to investigate structure-function relationships and functional effects of 11 beta-HSD 1. The results show that the hydrophobic enzyme 11 beta-HSD 1 can be expressed with high activity as a full length, membrane bound enzyme in the yeast system Pichia pastoris and can be purified as a soluble, N-terminally truncated form expressed in E. coli, by using metal-chelate chromatography. The full-length and truncated enzymes have equivalent enzymatic properties in regard to glucocorticoid metabolism. 11 beta-HSD 1 orthologs from human, rat, mouse and guinea pig show considerable inter-species variations as inferred by primary structure determinations and inhibitor characterization. A 11 beta-HSD 1 selective arylsulfonamidothiazole inhibitor class was investigated and is currently developed as a promising tool for the treatment of insulinresistance. Several derivatives were analyzed and show a high degree of species selectivity, with different inhibitor mechanisms and low nM affinities towards the human enzyme. 11 beta-HSD 1 mediates glucocorticoid-activation in pancreatic islets of Langerhans, and thereby regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Whereas glucocorticoids suppress insulin secretion in the insulin resistant ob/ob mouse model, they increase insulin release in lean mice. Hence it is postulated that the known beneficial effects of 11 beta-HSD 1 -inhibition in the pharmacological treatment of diabetes mellitus can be extended to include improved insulin release in diabetic mice. Glucocorticoid-activation in lean mice may at an early phase lead to increased insulin secretion and priming of the â-cells to stress-adaptation, whereas long-term exposure leads to a decrease in insulin secretion. A novel role of 11 beta-HSD 1 in 7 -oxosterol metabolism was discovered and investigated using recombinant 11 beta-HSD 1 orthologs. The enzymatic origin of endogenous 7 beta-OH-cholesterol in humans is assigned to 11 beta- HSD 1, possibly pointing to an involvement in atherosclerosis. Species differences in 7 -oxysterol metabolism can be explained on the basis of 11 beta-HSD 1 specificities...|$|E

In particular, the aim was to ascertain whether a concurrent task (digit span) would affect the kinematics of goal directed movements, and whether patients with Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> would exhibit abnormal functional asymmetries compared with their matched controls. Methods-Twelve patients with Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> and their matched controls performed 12 vertical zig zag movements, with both left and right hands (with and without the concurrent task), to large or small targets over long or short extents. Results-With short strokes, controls showed the predicted right hand superiority in movement time more strongly than patients with Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> who instead showed greater hand symmetry with short strokes. The right hand of controls was less force efficient with long strokes and more force efficient with short strokes, whereas either hand of patients with Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> was equally force efficient, irrespective of stroke length, with an overall performance profile similar to but better than that of the controls 2 ̆ 7 left hand. The concurrent task, however, increased the force efficiency of the right hand in patients with Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> and the left hand in controls.

Accumulating {{evidence shows that}} widespread neurogenesis impairment is {{a major determinant of}} abnormal brain development and, hence, of intellectual disability in Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This defect is worsened by dendritic hypotrophy and connectivity alterations. Most of the pharmacotherapies designed to improve cognitive performance in Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> have been attempted in Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> mouse models during adult life stages. Yet, as neurogenesis is mainly a prenatal event, treatments aimed at correcting neurogenesis failure in Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> should be administered during pregnancy. Correction of neurogenesis during the very first stages of brain formation may, in turn, rescue improper brain wiring. The aim of our study was to establish whether it is possible to rescue the neurodevelopmental alterations that characterize the trisomic brain with a prenatal pharmacotherapy with fluoxetine, a drug that is able to restore post-natal hippocampal neurogenesis in the Ts 65 Dn mouse model of Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Pregnant Ts 65 Dn females were treated with fluoxetine from embryonic Day 10 until delivery. On post-natal Day 2 the pups received an injection of 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine and were sacrificed after either 2 h or after 43 days (at the age of 45 days). Untreated 2 -day-old Ts 65 Dn mice exhibited a severe neurogenesis reduction and hypocellularity throughout the forebrain (subventricular zone, subgranular zone, neocortex, striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus), midbrain (mesencephalon) and hindbrain (cerebellum and pons). In embryonically treated 2 -day-old Ts 65 Dn mice, precursor proliferation and cellularity were fully restored throughout all brain regions. The recovery of proliferation potency and cellularity was still present in treated Ts 65 Dn 45 -day-old mice. Moreover, embryonic treatment restored dendritic development, cortical and hippocampal synapse development and brain volume. Importantly, these effects were accompanied by recovery of behavioural performance. The cognitive deficits caused by Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> have long been considered irreversible. The current study provides novel evidence that a pharmacotherapy with fluoxetine during embryonic development is able to fully rescue the abnormal brain development and behavioural deficits that are typical of Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> If the positive effects of fluoxetine on the brain of a mouse model are replicated in foetuses with Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> fluoxetine, a drug usable in humans, may represent a breakthrough for the therapy of intellectual disability in Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R

Despite the increasing numbers of students being diagnosed with Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (Safran, 2002), many teachers have limited understanding of the condition, or of appropriate strategies for the successful inclusion of students with this diagnosis (Williams, 2001). This paper examines aspects of secondary school that are particularly challenging for students with Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> and describes ways in which these issues were addressed by teachers who approached these challenges with flexibility and ingenuity...|$|R

40|$|Stabilisation of {{a severe}} case of P. O. E. M. <b>S.</b> <b>syndrome</b> after {{tamoxifen}} administration. Sir: In {{the absence of}} consistently effective treatment for plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrin-opathy, M protein, and skin changes (P. O. E. M. <b>S.</b> <b>syndrome),</b> it seemed of interest to report a possible response to tamoxifen therapy. A 56 year old man had been treated since 1982 for a sensorimotor neuropathy with oedema of the lower limbs. Since 1980 he had suffered from impotence, testicular atrophy, hypertrichosis and gynaecomastia. Nerve biopsy showed moderate decrease ofmyelin...|$|R
40|$|Leigh脳症 80 例について, ミトコンドリアDNA変異を検討した。 11 例はこれまでにも報告の多い 8993 番での変異を有した。それに加えて, 3 例でわが国ではまだ報告のない 9176 番でのT→C変異を認めた。この 9176 変異はこれまでに米国から家族性両側線状体壊死症の 1 兄弟例ならびにスペインからLeigh脳症 1 例の報告があるのみである。今回 3 例で本変異が検出されたことより, 8993 変異と同様にLeigh脳症の一因として位置づけることができると考えられた。Among 80 {{patients}} with the clinical characteristics of Leigh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> 11 patients had a well-known mutation at nucleotide position (nt) 8993 in mitochondrial DNA. In addition, three patients had a T-to-C mutation at nt 9176 which had been described previously in only two brothers with bilateral striatal necrosis and one patient with Leigh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In our three patients, one had the typical clinical characteristics of Leigh syndrome from early infancy, and two later onset of neurological deficits. All had slowly progressive course and abnormal neuroimaging in the basal ganglia. Because nt 8993 and 9176 {{are located in the}} ATPase 6 coding region, altered ATPase function may be one of enzyme abnormalities for Leigh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> and the similar condition of bilateral striatal necrosis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-J-Hypothalamic-pituitary {{function}} was studied {{by means of}} several dynamic endocrine tests in 19 patients with alcoholic Korsakoff <b>s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> 17 non-amnesic alcoholics and 21 non-alcoholic controls. The responses of thyroid stimulating hormone, prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone to a combined thyrotropin releasing hormone and gonadolibenn stimulation test did not differ significantly. For the dexamethasone suppression test, the Korsakoff patients had significantly higher basal serum cortisol and 08 : 00 hr post-dexamethasone cortisol levels than non-alcoholic controls. These findings raise the possibility that chronically elevated cortisol levels may contribute to cognitive impairment in alcoholic Korsakoff <b>s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> &apos...|$|R

However, {{the exact nature}} {{and the implications of}} this link is far from clear as yet. The challenge of diagnosis, genetics and the differences in clinical presentations of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s Disease in relation to the Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> are reviewed here. Promising areas of research are pointed out and importance of relevant family history is emphasized. A current knowledge in the subject through various studies is presented...|$|R
