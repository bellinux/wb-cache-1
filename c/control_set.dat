25|$|The F-15 Multistage Improvement Program (MSIP) was {{initiated}} in February 1983 {{with the first}} production MSIP F-15C produced in 1985. Improvements included an upgraded central computer; a Programmable Armament <b>Control</b> <b>Set,</b> allowing for advanced versions of the AIM-7, AIM-9, and AIM-120A missiles; and an expanded Tactical Electronic Warfare System that provides improvements to the ALR-56C radar warning receiver and ALQ-135 countermeasure set. The final 43 F-15Cs included the Hughes APG-70 radar developed for the F-15E; these are sometimes referred as Enhanced Eagles. Earlier MSIP F-15Cs with the APG-63 were upgraded to the APG-63(V)1 to improve maintainability and to perform similar to the APG-70. Existing F-15s were retrofitted with these improvements.|$|E
25|$|The real Mission Control Center {{consisted}} of two control rooms located on {{the second and third}} floors of Building 30 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. NASA offered the use of the control room for filming, but Howard declined, opting instead to make his own replica from scratch. Production designer Michael Corenblith and set decorator Merideth Boswell were in charge of the construction of the Mission <b>Control</b> <b>set</b> at Universal Studios. The set was equipped with giant rear-screen projection capabilities and a complex set of computers with individual video feeds to all the flight controller stations. The actors playing the flight controllers were able {{to communicate with each other}} on a private audio loop. The Mission Control room built for the film was on the ground floor. One NASA employee, who was a consultant for the film, said that the set was so realistic that he would leave at the end of the day and look for the elevator before remembering he was not in Mission Control. By the time the film was made, the USS Iwo Jima had been scrapped, so her sister ship, the USS New Orleans, was used as the recovery ship instead.|$|E

500|$|The {{reviewers for}} Famitsu were {{united in their}} opinion that, while not a revolutionary title within the series, it was a {{high-quality}} game. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed regularly noted its similarity to previous entries in the series, praising the atmosphere and gameplay, while criticizing the control scheme and its negative effect on combat and navigation. In {{a preview of the}} game, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised the game's multiple storylines and settings, but was mixed about its familiar gameplay and again criticized the controls. In closing, he generally cited it as a good entry in the series. Matthew Blundon of Nintendo Life, echoing the criticism of the controls, said that it would please hardcore horror game players. Albert Lichi of Cubed3 again faulted the <b>control</b> <b>set</b> up. In most other respects he was highly positive, praising the story, combat and graphics, calling it a [...] "labor of love" [...] {{on the part of the}} development team. In its import review, Edge Magazine generally enjoyed the unsettling atmosphere that the developers had succeeded in creating by using the dark settings and close-set camera angle. The reviewer also defended the often-criticized control scheme, saying that it added to the feeling of fear. In closing, the reviewer said that the subtlety of the game showed the flaws other horror franchises such as Silent Hill.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{singular}} simplicial set Sing(X) {{of a space}} X completely captures its weak homotopy type. We {{introduce a}} category of <b>controlled</b> <b>sets,</b> yielding simplicial <b>controlled</b> <b>sets,</b> such that one can functorially produce a singular simplicial <b>controlled</b> <b>set</b> CSing(MaxCtl(X)) from a locally compact X. We then argue that this CSing(MaxCtl(X)) captures the (weak) proper homotopy type of X. Moreover, our techniques strictly generalize the classical simplicial situation: e. g., one obtains, in a unified way, singular homology with compact supports and (Borel–Moore) singular homology with locally finite supports, {{as well as the}} corresponding cohomologies. 1...|$|R

40|$|A salient item usually captures our {{attention}} in visual search. When a distractor is salient, it should help observers {{to find a}} target that was overlapping it. However, in Jingling and Tseng (in press Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance doi: 10. 1037 /a 0027325), a target overlapping with a salient distractor took longer to discriminate than that which was non-overlapped, if the salient distractor was grouped by collinearity. One {{of the reasons for}} prolonged responses in overlapping targets is that the collinear distractor was not contingent on the attentional <b>control</b> <b>setting</b> of task requirements. More specifically, the target was a broken bar, which might induce an attentional <b>control</b> <b>setting</b> on searching for discontinuity. Meanwhile, the distractor was grouped continuously, which was against the attentional <b>control</b> <b>setting</b> and generated interference to the overlapping target. In this study, we modified the definition of the target and tested whether the interference was preserved when the attentional <b>control</b> <b>setting</b> was not on discontinuity. The target was either a diamond or a square, and was either overlapping or not with the collinear salient distractor. Participants discriminated the shape of the target. The results replicated our previous study in that overlapping targets were harder to find.

However, {{the complexity of}} the explicit controller will depend on {{the complexity of the}} <b>controlled</b> contractive <b>set.</b> The ability to design a low complexity <b>controlled</b> contractive <b>set</b> is therefore desirable. Most methods for finding <b>controlled</b> contractive <b>sets</b> either assume the use of a constant linear state feedback, or is based on reachable set computations. In the first case, the assumption of a constant linear state feedback is restrictive (as MPC controllers for linear systems are typically piecewise affine), and in the second case the complexity of the <b>controlled</b> contractive <b>set</b> may be very high. Initial results on the construction of low complexity <b>controlled</b> contractive <b>sets</b> without assuming linear state feedback were reported at the IFAC World Congress in 2014.
