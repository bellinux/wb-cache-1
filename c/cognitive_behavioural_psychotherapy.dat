40|$|This {{introductory}} {{review article}} aims {{to provide the}} interested reader with an outline of the fundamentals of metacognitive therapy. Metacognitive therapy (MCT) is an evidence based <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> approach with a very solid theoretical background in understanding and explaining the mechanisms by which any psychological disorder persists. MCT provides a new perspective {{for the treatment of}} psychological disorders by underlining the significance of how a person thinks, rather than simply focusing on the content of his cognitions. The case formulation and specific techniques of MCT are the main distinctive features of this therapy approach, which places it in a unique position among other CBT approaches. These distinctive features are defined throughout the article. A short introduction to the metacognitive model of psychological disorder, the core features of this therapy, and the specific techniques of MCT are also summarized. A brief list of clinical scales and treatment plans as well as the order of application of MCT techniques are also given. This review article aims to underline the theoretical background of MCT, and hopes to provide a glimpse into the introductory level principles of the application of this therapy approac...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissemination}} and uptake {{of cognitive}} behavioural interventions {{is central to}} the evidence-based mental health agenda in Britain. However, some policy and related literature, in and of itself social constructed, tends to display discursive naïvety in assuming a rational basis for the dissemination and organizational integration of cognitive behavioural approaches. Rational constructions fail to acknowledge that the practice settings of key stakeholders in the process are likely to be socially constructed fields of multiple meanings. Within these, the importance of evidence-based interventions may be variously contested or reworked. To illustrate this, a case example from the first author will discuss the hypothetical introduction of a cognitive behavioural group for voice hearers in a forensic mental health unit. This will highlight contradictions and local organizational problems around the effective utilization of postgraduate cognitive behavioural knowledge and skills. A synthesis of social constructionist with organizational theory will be used to make better sense of these actual and anticipated difficulties. From this basis, specific ways in which nurses and supportive stakeholders could move the implementation of <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> agenda forward within a postmodern leadership context will be proposed...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{history of}} {{short-term}} group psychotherapy {{dates back to}} the late 1950 -ies. From then to present day, this psychotherapeutic method has been used in various forms, from dynamic-oriented to <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>psychotherapies.</b> Although it has always been considered rather controversial, due its cost-effectiveness, it has been capturing more and more popularity. This paper presents the specificities of first session short-term psychotherapy psychodrama group through session work with two examined groups: a group of 20 adult women who suffer from mild or moderate forms of unipolar depression and a group of 20 students of the School of Medicine in Zagreb without any psychiatric symptomatology. The results indicate the high importance of having structure in first psychodrama session, of relating it with the previously thoroughly conducted, initial, clinical, interviews, and of the clarity and focus in terms of determining the goals of therapy, especially in a clinical context. This study also confirmed assumptions regarding the need for different approaches of warming-up in psychodrama, both in the clinical and in non-clinical samples. A psychodrama psychotherapist should have good time managing skills and capability to convert the time available into an opportunity for directly boosting the group energy and work on therapeutic alliance...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{syndrome}} of apotemnophilia, body integrity or amputee identity disorder, {{is defined}} as the desire for amputation of a healthy limb, and may be accompanied by behaviour of pretending to be an amputee and sometimes, but not necessarily, by sexual arousal. Sampling and Methods: A case history is presented of a 35 -year-old man who was referred because of his desire for amputation of his left leg, without sexual connotations. The course of a combined <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> with SSRI treatment is described. Results: Symptoms showed considerable similarity with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and some similarity with body dysmorphic disorder according to DSM-IV, but the core symptom seemed to be strongly connected with a sense of identity. Treatment with a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor decreased levels of distress only. The effects of cognitive restructuring of the psychotherapy were limited, whereas the behavioural elements substantially reduced the behaviour of pretending to be an amputee. Conclusions: The rare syndrome of apotemnophilia raises unresolved questions of classification. Psychotic disorders should be ruled out carefully. The model designed in the current cognitive behavioural approach may serve {{as a starting point for}} further development of intervention protocols for this rare disorder. Copyright (c) 2006 S.

40|$|Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose: The IAPT {{programme}} {{has been}} rolled out across England {{in the last}} ten years. Although undoubtedly many people have benefited from having greater access to psychological therapy there are several issues with the practicalities of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) and also with its ideology. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This is a personal reflection of working within the IAPT system for several years. Significant statements heard or interpretations of what has been said are presented alongside an analysis of the implications. Findings: A number of important concerns are presented. The overarching concept of the "McDonaldization" process is discussed as a way of encapsulating the IAPT experience; with its theoretical reliance on the medical model and the real world impact of tendering for services in the modern NHS. The impact of IAPT on <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> is also highlighted. Originality/value: A lot has been written in the press and online about IAPT Many of the criticisms seem to derive from people outside of the IAPT system, many of whom have their own personal or professional agenda for attacking IAPT and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT); often the criticisms are uninformed. This paper is a reflection of working within the IAPT system and not just an uninformed critique of CBT. Several concerns are raised that without remedy may seriously hold back the progress that psychological therapy has made in recent years...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study {{examines}} pre and post outcome measures following {{a course of}} Compassionate Mind Training (CMT). Participants were students enrolled on a Post Graduate Diploma in <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Psychotherapy</b> (CBP). The {{aim of the research}} was to explore whether CMT would increase self-compassion, compassion for others, dispositional empathy and reduce self-critical judgement. Method: Twenty-one participants who had enrolled on the CBP programme took part in the study. Data were collected using the Self-Compassion Scale, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, and the Compassion for Others Scale. Findings: Results reveal an overall statistically significant increase in self-compassion scores and statistically significant reduction in self-critical judgement scores post training. There was no statistically significant difference post training on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index or the Compassion for Others Scale. Research limitations/implications: CMT training may help students develop healthy coping strategies, which they can use to balance their affect regulation systems when faced with organisational, placement, client, academic, personal and supervision demands. Further research and longitudinal studies, using larger sample sizes are needed to explore if cultivating compassion whilst on psychotherapy training helps students build resilience and provide a barrier against empathic distress fatigue, compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout. Practical Implications: Incorporating CMT into a CBP programme may bring changes in student levels of self-compassion and self-critical judgement. Originality/value of the paper: This inaugural {{study examines}} whether incorporating CMT into a CBP programme impacts on students levels of compassion, dispositional empathy and self-critical judgement. The findings from this preliminary study suggest the potential benefits of training students in compassion focused practices...|$|E

40|$|Rational {{emotional}} behaviour therapy (REBT) is a <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> approach to <b>psychotherapy</b> that pays {{particular attention to}} the role that thinking and behaviour play in the development and maintenance of emotional problems. It is a relatively simple approach that is difficult to practice well. In this fully revised second edition of this handbook, Windy Dryden and Rhena Branch recreate the atmosphere of an REBT training course. They alert trainees to the areas of difficulty that they are likely to experience whilst training in REBT, and demonstrate how to deal constructively with such problems. Verbatim transcript material between trainee and trainer is extensively used in order to highlight trainee difficulties and trainers′ responses. In addition, this innovative training manual makes use of actual and constructed dialogue between therapist and client, and of peer counselling dialogues. Key topics covered include: - how to present and explain ′ABC′s of REBT to clients - helping clients to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy emotions - assessing meta–emotional problems - goal–setting - disputing irrational beliefs - negotiating and reviewing homework assignment...|$|R
40|$|Mindfulness {{refers to}} paying {{attention}} to present moment experiences with a non-judgmental attitude and acceptance. This particular way of {{paying attention to}} the unfolding of present moment has become recognized as an effective psychotherapeutic tool. During the past 25 years, mindfulness-based interventions have been successfully integrated into <b>cognitive,</b> <b>behavioural</b> and humanistic <b>psychotherapy</b> approaches. Today, mindfulness-based psychotherapy interventions are used across many psychological problems including depression, anxiety, eating disorders, addictive disorders, stress related to chronic medical illnesses and borderline personality disorder. Although, mindfulness as a therapeutic intervention has many implications in the field of psychotherapy, the concept is less known for clinicians practicing in our country. Therefore, the purpose of present review is to give a brief presentation of mindfulness and mindfulness-based therapies. In the first section of the paper, literature regarding mindfulness as psychological construct is reviewed and different aspects of mindfulness are presented. Later, a brief overview of mindfulness and acceptance-based psychotherapy approaches are given. Finally, we conclude that research studies on mindfulness are reaching an explanatory stage and mindfulness as a therapeutic intervention may offer new perspectives to clinicians in the field.

40|$|Background: Anxiety {{disorders}} {{are among the}} most prevalent psychiatric conditions, and are associated with poor quality of life and substantial economic burden. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy is an effective treatment to reduce anxiety symptoms, but is also costly and labour intensive. Cost-effectiveness could possibly be improved by delivering <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy in a blended format, where face-to-face sessions are partially replaced by online sessions. The aim of this trial is to determine the cost-effectiveness of blended <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy for adults with anxiety disorders, i. e. panic disorder, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder, in specialized mental health care settings compared to face-to-face <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy. In this paper, we present the study protocol. It is hypothesized that blended <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy for anxiety disorders is clinically as effective as face-to-face <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy, but that intervention costs may be reduced. We thus hypothesize that blended <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy is more cost-effective than face-to-face <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy. Methods/design: In a randomised controlled equivalence trial 156 patients will be included (n = 78 in blended <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy, n = 78 in face-to-face <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy) based on a power of 0. 80, calculated by using a formula to estimate the power of a cost-effectiveness analysis: n = 2 (...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} a {{narrative}} review of the theoretical standing and empirical evidence for the <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> model of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) in general and for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in particular. A literature search of Medline and Psychinfo from 1966 {{to the present day}} was conducted using MUS and related terms as search terms. All relevant articles were reviewed. The search was then limited in stages, by <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy (CBT), condition, treatment and type of trial. Evidence was found for genetic, neurological, psychophysiological, immunological, personality, attentional, attributional, affective, behavioural, social and inter-personal factors in the onset and maintenance of MUS. The evidence for the contribution of individual factors, and their autopoietic interaction in MUS (as hypothesised by the <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> model) is examined. The evidence from the treatment trials of <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy for MUS, CFS and IBS is reviewed as an experimental test of the <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> models. We conclude that a broadly conceptualized <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> model of MUS suggests a novel and plausible mechanism of symptom generation and has heuristic value.

40|$|The {{literature}} suggests that individuals who experience a generalised anxiety disorder present a limited {{quality of life and}} diminished occupational performance levels, a term embedded within occupational therapy theory. As generalised anxiety disorder {{is considered one of the}} more common mental health conditions within the UK, one would expect a vast amount of research to be available on the topic. However, this is not the case. The {{literature suggests}} that <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy is widely associated with the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder and many occupational therapists do implement this approach, although, there is limited research identified. The literature also identifies that the principles of <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy and the principles of occupational therapy resonate each other. This paper therefore seeks to explore the benefits of occupational therapists using <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy with patients who experience a generalised anxiety disorder. Attention will be paid to the relationship between occupational therapy and generalised anxiety disorder, the effectiveness of occupational therapy intervention, the relationship between <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy and occupational therapy and the effectiveness of <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy with patients who experience a generalised anxiety disorder. Due to the lack of quantitative research available in relation to the topic, a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design is proposed to address the research topic. This involves dividing the participants into an intervention group (were participants will receive <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy) and a control group (were participants will not receive <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy). The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale will be used to measure the occupational performance levels and anxiety levels post cognitive behavioral therapy intervention. This will therefore enable the author to assess the benefits of occupational therapists using <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy with patients who experience a generalised anxiety disorder...|$|R

40|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} {{share the}} feature of excessive fear, anxiety and related behavioural disturbances. Fear {{is defined as}} the emotional response to a real or a perceived imminent threat and anxiety is the anticipation of a future threat. The anxiety disorders covered in this thesis are panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> treatment protocols are typically designed to target one specific disorder and falls under the definition of disorder-specific <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy. It is however unclear if this is the most optimal approach in regards to the high comorbidity between anxiety disorders and depressive disorders. Internet-based <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy has in the past generally been disorder-specific and from above mentioned predicament two alternative treatment approaches emerged, the tailored and the transdiagnostic approach that aims to simultaneously treat both principal and comorbid disorders. Previous trials on internet-based <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy have targeted adults in general and relatively few target adolescents, young adults and older adults. The aims of this thesis were to further develop and test the effects of tailored internet-based <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy on the basis of age, for adolescents, young adults and older adults. Specifically by developing and testing the effects of individually tailored internet-based <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy for adolescents with anxiety and comorbid depressive symptoms and by adapting and testing the effects of individually tailored internet-based <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy for young adults and older adults with anxiety and comorbid depressive symptoms. These aims were tested in two pilot effectiveness studies (Paper I and III) and two efficacy randomised controlled trials (Paper II and IV). The results from these four trials showed significant results across all outcome measures with overall moderate to large effect sizes. The tentative conclusion based on these results is that tailoring internet-based <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy can be a feasible approach in the treatment of anxiety symptoms and comorbid depressive symptoms for adolescents, young adults and older adults.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of classroom based <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy with attention control and usual school provision for adolescents {{at high risk of}} depression. Design: Three arm parallel cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting: Eight UK secondary schools. Participants: Adolescents (n= 5030) aged 12 - 16 years in school year groups 8 - 11. Year groups were randomly assigned on a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy, attention control, or usual school provision. Allocation was balanced by school, year, number of students and classes, frequency of lessons, and timetabling. Participants were not blinded to treatment allocation. Interventions: <b>Cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy, attention control, and usual school provision provided in classes to all eligible participants. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were collected by self completed questionnaire administered by researchers. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression assessed at 12 months by the short mood and feelings questionnaire among those identified at baseline as being at high risk of depression. Secondary outcomes included negative thinking, self worth, and anxiety. Analyses were undertaken on an intention to treat basis and accounted for the clustered nature of the design. Results: 1064 (21. 2 %) adolescents were identified at high risk of depression: 392 in the classroom based <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy arm, 374 in the attention control arm, and 298 in the usual school provision arm. At 12 months adjusted mean scores on the short mood and feelings questionnaire did not differ for <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy versus attention control (- 0. 63, 95 % confidence interval - 1. 85 to 0. 58, P= 0. 41) or for <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy versus usual school provision (0. 97, - 0. 20 to 2. 15, P= 0. 12). Conclusion: In adolescents with depressive symptoms, outcomes were similar for attention control, usual school provision, and <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> therapy.
