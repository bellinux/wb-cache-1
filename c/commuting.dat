40|$|In this paper, in {{the spirit}} of a tour-based frame of analysis, we examine the <b>commute</b> mode choice and the number of non-work stops during the <b>commute.</b> Under- {{standing}} the mode and activity stop dimensions of weekday <b>commute</b> travel is impor- tant since the highest level of weekday traffic congestion in urban areas occurs during the <b>commute</b> periods. The paper employs a copula-based joint multinomial logit – ordered modeling framework in which <b>commute</b> mode choice is modeled using a multinomial logit formulation and the number of <b>commute</b> stops is modeled using an ordered response formulation. The data used in this study are drawn from the “Time use” multipurpose survey conducted between 2002 and 2003 by the Turin Town Council and the Italian Na- tional Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) in the Greater Turin metropolitan area of Italy. The re- sults highlight the importance of accommodating the inter-relationship between <b>commute</b> mode choice and <b>commute</b> stops behavior. The results also point to the stronger effect of household responsibilities and demographic characteristics in the Italian context compared to the US context...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} model which predicts {{that students with}} a longer <b>commute</b> time (i) visit the university less often, but (ii) conditional on visiting on a given day, they stay longer. Perhaps more surprisingly, this model also predicts that (iii) the weekly hours present {{does not depend on}} <b>commute</b> time, while (iv) academic achievement falls with <b>commute</b> time. We show that these predictions are true for Dutch university students. To be specific, it appears that an additional hour of one-way <b>commute</b> time induces students to reduce their presence by 0. 65. days per week. When present, students with an additional hour of <b>commute</b> time stay 52. min longer. The total time present per week therefore hardly depends on <b>commute</b> time. Our results consistently show that students with long <b>commute</b> times have less good average grades.
