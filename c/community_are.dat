5|$|Armenians from Lebanon, {{where they}} had {{effectively}} established an active <b>community,</b> <b>are</b> more politicized, while Turkish Armenians are mostly connected with the Armenian Apostolic Church. About 1/3 of all Turkish Armenians in America are self-employed. A group of Armenian Americans from Istanbul founded the Organization of Istanbul Armenians (OIA) in 1976, which claimed over 1,000 members in Southern California as of 2011. Iranian Armenians are known for fast integration into American society; for example, only 31% of Armenian Americans born in Iran claim not to speak English well.|$|E
5|$|At all levels, Scouts {{are governed}} by an {{executive}} of trustees, known as executive committees – these could be volunteers from the local community who have had ties with the association, either themselves or through their children. An executive normally consists of a chairman, secretary, treasurer, {{and a number of}} other officers. In Group Executive Committees, Group Scout Leaders and Section Leaders also form part of the committee. Their role is to ensure that the best interests of the young people and the <b>community</b> <b>are</b> served by the group, district, county, or national levels of the association.|$|E
5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a <b>community</b> <b>are</b> linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E

5|$|Many {{immigrants}} have established themselves in Brabrand, Hasle and Viby, where {{the percentage of}} inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by 66% since the year 2000. This has resulted in several 'especially vulnerable residential areas' (a.k.a. ghettos), with Gellerup as the most notable neighbourhood. In Brabrand and Gellerup, two-thirds of the population now have a non-Danish ethnic background. The international cultures present in the <b>community</b> <b>are</b> an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life and contribute many cultural flavours hitherto uncommon for the Nordic countries, including Bazar Vest, a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.|$|E
5|$|Past {{studies have}} {{reported}} other social organizations in ruffed lemurs including monogamous pair bonding. This {{may have been due}} to the use of short-term, seasonal field studies instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration the effects that changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a <b>community</b> <b>are</b> significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.|$|E
5|$|The Old Priory, {{which was}} a hotel and restaurant, dates from the early to mid 17th century.

40|$|Within China six Early Viséan rugose coral <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> recognized, {{they are}} : 1) the Siphonophyllia {{community}}, 2) the cool water Gangamophyllum community, 3) the Thysanophyllum community, 4) the Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites community, 5) the island Humboldtia community and 6) {{the cold water}} Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma community. In northwest China, the Siphonophyllia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> distributed along the northern margin of the Tarim-Qaidam Oldland. The Gangamophyllum <b>community</b> <b>was</b> widespread north of the region occupied by the Siphonophyllia community, including north Tianshan, central Tianshan and east Junggar. In South China there were three rugose coral communities. The Thysanophyllum community occurs on {{the margin of the}} Upper Yangtze Oldland. The Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites <b>community</b> <b>was</b> confined to the southern and western part of the region occupied by the Thysanophyllum community. These two communities merge into each other without a distinct boundary. The Humboldtia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> found only in the Baoshan area. The Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma <b>community</b> <b>is</b> found in Xainza and Himalaya of Tibet. The distribution of the six Early Viséan rugose coral <b>communities</b> <b>was</b> controlled by the palaeogeographical background. The Gangamophyllum community occurs along the southern margin of the Siberia Oldland, while the Siphonophyllia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> distributed along the northern margin of Tarim-Qaidam Oldland. The Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma <b>community</b> <b>is</b> confined to the northern margin of the Gondwana Oldland. In the wide southern and western margin of Yangtze Oldland the distribution of the Thysanophyllum and the Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites <b>communities</b> <b>was</b> controlled by the bathymetry. The Humboldtia community probably lived in island seas far from the Yangtze Oldland...|$|R
5|$|The Shia {{community}} of the Eastern province have a separate legal tradition. Although they follow Sharia, they apply the Shia Jafari school of jurisprudence to it. In 1913, when Abdul Aziz conquered the area, he granted the Shias a separate judiciary for dealing with religious and family law cases: one judge in Qatif, and one in Al-Hasa. This remained the position, with the two judges ministering to a population of around two million, until 2005 {{when the number of}} judges was increased to seven. For all other areas of law, the Shia <b>community</b> <b>are</b> {{under the jurisdiction of the}} regular Sunni courts.|$|E
5|$|The {{adults in}} the <b>community</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} semi-speakers as they have a passive understanding of Wagiman and generally only know a few basic words.

Apart from Mayali, Kriol, a creole language based on the vocabulary of English, is the lingua franca of the area. All members of the Wagiman ethnic group, {{as well as all}} other ethnic groups represented in the area, are native speakers of a moderate grade of Kriol.|$|E
5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine <b>community</b> <b>are</b> the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} the area {{currently}} classified a World Heritage Site was under restricted access and protection during the imperial era and has been under some form of legal recognition and protection since French colonization, having been incorporated into the Colony Domains Service in 1897 and the National Inventory in 1939. It has since benefited from legal municipal protection and two national laws (passed in 1982 and 1983) protecting sites of historical and national interest. The Office of the Cultural Site of Ambohimanga (OSCAR), created by the Ministry of Culture, has managed the site and its entrance fees and state subventions since 2006, when a five-year management plan was developed for implementation by the group's 30 employees. These management and conservation activities are conducted {{in cooperation with the}} local population within the Rural Commune of Ambohimanga Rova. The Village Committee, comprising representatives of all the adjacent quarters and the local <b>community,</b> <b>are</b> also involved in the protection of the site. Conservation of Ambohimanga is further supported by a private association, Mamelomaso, which has also been active in campaigning for awareness and protection of cultural heritage and has contributed to the preservation of numerous other sites of cultural and historic significance in the highlands. In addition to helping replant the Ambohimanga woodlands, Mamelomaso has contributed to the restoration of the stones around the source of the spring, erected informational plaques around the hill, and paved a number of footpaths within the site. UNESCO contributed special financial support to restore historic structures at Ambohimanga threatened by exceptionally heavy rainfall and landslides.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, the Blue Cross Foundation {{found that}} there are four types of <b>communities</b> that can <b>be</b> {{identified}} based on their risk of uninsurance: entrenched-risk, unexpected-risk, resilient, and low-risk. Entrenched-risk <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> that have {{a high concentration of}} foreign-born denizens, and therefore {{are less likely to be}} eligible for Medicare. Unexpected-risk communities have high uninsurance but were not expected to based on their geographical locations, like Cape Cod or Boston. Resilient <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> that <b>were</b> expected to have high uninsurance but did not, like Worcester and north and south of Boston.
