25|$|In 1895, The Daily Telegraph, Standard, Daily Graphic and Daily Mail {{newspapers}} ran {{a campaign}} to reintroduce mixed bathing in all resorts, pointing out that its prohibition split up families and encouraged them to take their holidays abroad. Commercial pressure defeated the moral pressures. Sea bathing had ceased {{to be done for}} health reasons, and was done overwhelmingly for pleasure. As the segregated beaches in town disappeared, bathing costumes for men became part of the <b>commercial</b> <b>package,</b> and nude bathing ceased. Nude bathing continued to be practised outside resorts on isolated pieces of coast; a very few of these known beaches and coves later got local authority recognition as nude beaches.|$|E

The purpose of the PRI is to construct a simple label that would indicate the "greenness" of <b>commercial</b> <b>packaging</b> by considering total thermodynamic throughput. Building on the work of Frederick (1995) this work attempts to correct societal misunderstandings about product usage by looking at entropy rather than price as a measure of efficiency.
