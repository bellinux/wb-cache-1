25|$|In {{standard}} {{molecular cloning}} experiments, the cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves seven steps: (1) Choice of host organism and <b>cloning</b> <b>vector,</b> (2) Preparation of vector DNA, (3) Preparation of DNA to be cloned, (4) Creation of recombinant DNA, (5) Introduction of recombinant DNA into host organism, (6) Selection of organisms containing recombinant DNA, (7) Screening for clones with desired DNA inserts and biological properties.|$|E
25|$|Although a {{very large}} number of host organisms and {{molecular}} cloning vectors are in use, the great majority of molecular cloning experiments begin with a laboratory strain of the bacterium E. coli (Escherichia coli) and a plasmid <b>cloning</b> <b>vector.</b> E. coli and plasmid vectors are in common use because they are technically sophisticated, versatile, widely available, and offer rapid growth of recombinant organisms with minimal equipment. If the DNA to be cloned is exceptionally large (hundreds of thousands to millions of base pairs), then a bacterial artificial chromosome or yeast artificial chromosome vector is often chosen.|$|E

2500|$|Restriction Endonuclease enzymes {{play a very}} {{important}} role in modern molecular cloning techniques. Because of their unique recognition/cut sites, restriction enzymes can be used to precisely cut DNA in specific locations in a controllable manner. Once cut, scientist can then insert the desired DNA fragment possessing [...] "sticky ends" [...] into a circular DNA molecule, and ligate them together to create an engineered <b>cloning</b> <b>vector.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the notable}} of the inventions from Hood's lab was the {{automated}} DNA sequencer. It made possible high-speed sequencing {{of the structure}} of DNA, including the human genome. It automated many of the tasks that researchers had previously done by hand. Researchers Jane Z. Sanders and Lloyd M. Smith developed a way to color code the basic nucleotide units of DNA with fluorescent tags, green for adenine (A), yellow-green for guanine (G), orange for cytosine (C) and red for thymine (T). Four differently colored fluorophores, each one specific to a reaction with one of the bases, are covalently attached to the oligonucleotide primer for the enzymatic DNA sequence analysis. [...] During the analysis, fragments are passed downwards through a gel tube, the smallest and lightest fragments passing through the gel tube first. A laser light passed through a filter wheel causes the bases to fluoresce. The resulting fluorescent colors are detected by a photomultiplier and recorded by a computer. The first DNA fragment to be sequenced was a common <b>cloning</b> <b>vector,</b> M13.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>cloning</b> <b>vector</b> {{is treated}} with a {{restriction}} endonuclease to cleave the DNA at the site where foreign DNA will be inserted. The restriction enzyme is chosen to generate a configuration at the cleavage site that {{is compatible with the}} ends of the foreign DNA (see DNA end). Typically, this is done by cleaving the vector DNA and foreign DNA with the same restriction enzyme, for example EcoRI. Most modern vectors contain a variety of convenient cleavage sites that are unique within the vector molecule (so that the vector can only be cleaved at a single site) and are located within a gene (frequently beta-galactosidase) whose inactivation can be used to distinguish recombinant from non-recombinant organisms at a later step in the process. To improve the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant organisms, the cleaved vector may be {{treated with a}}n enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) that dephosphorylates the vector ends. [...] Vector molecules with dephosphorylated ends are unable to replicate, and replication can only be restored if foreign DNA is integrated into the cleavage site.|$|E
50|$|Plasmids are {{autonomously}} replicating circular extra-chromosomal DNA. They are {{the standard}} <b>cloning</b> <b>vectors</b> {{and the ones}} most commonly used. Most general plasmids {{may be used to}} clone DNA insert of up to 15 kb in size. One of the earliest commonly used <b>cloning</b> <b>vectors</b> is the pBR322 plasmid. Other <b>cloning</b> <b>vectors</b> include the pUC series of plasmids, and a large number of different <b>cloning</b> plasmid <b>vectors</b> are available. Many plasmids have high copy number, for example pUC19 which has a copy number of 500-700 copies per cell, and high copy number is useful as it produces greater yield of recombinant plasmid for subsequent manipulation. However low-copy-number plasmids may be preferably used in certain circumstances, for example, when the protein from the cloned gene is toxic to the cells.|$|R

50|$|A {{large number}} of cloning vectors are available, and {{choosing}} the vector may depend a number of factors, such as {{the size of the}} insert, copy number and cloning method.

50|$|All {{commonly}} used <b>cloning</b> <b>vectors</b> in molecular biology have key features necessary for their function, {{such as a}} suitable cloning site and selectable marker. Others may have additional features specific to their use. For reason of ease and convenience, cloning is often performed using E. coli. Thus, the <b>cloning</b> <b>vectors</b> used often have elements necessary for their propagation and maintenance in E. coli, such as a functional origin of replication (ori).

40|$|The genome {{information}} is offering opportunities to manipulate genes, polygenic characters and multiple traits in plants. Although {{a number of}} approaches {{have been developed to}} manipulate traits in plants, technical hurdles make the process difficult. Gene <b>cloning</b> <b>vectors</b> that facilitate the fusion, overexpression or down regulation of genes in plant cells are being used with various degree of success. In this study, we modified gateway MultiSite <b>cloning</b> <b>vectors</b> and developed a hybrid cloning strategy which combines advantages of both traditional cloning and gateway recombination cloning. We developed Gateway entry (pGATE) vectors containing attL sites flanking multiple cloning sites and plant expression vector (pKM 12 GW) with specific recombination sites carrying different plant and bacterial selection markers. We constructed a plant expression vector carrying a reporter gene (GUS), two Bt cry genes in a predetermined pattern by a single round of LR recombination reaction after restriction endonuclease-mediated cloning of target genes into pGATE vectors. All the three transgenes were co-expressed in Arabidopsis as evidenced by gene expression, histochemical assay and insect bioassay. The pGATE vectors can be used as simple <b>cloning</b> <b>vectors</b> as there are rare restriction endonuclease sites inserted in the vector. The modified multisite vector system developed is ideal for stacking genes and pathway engineering in plants. Â© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
