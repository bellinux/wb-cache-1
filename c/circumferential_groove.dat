40|$|The current paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of steady and unsteady flow effects of <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> casing treatment in a transonic compressor rotor. <b>Circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> casing treatment is used mainly to increase stall margin in axial compressors with a relatively small decrease in aerodynamic efficiency. It is widely believed that flow mechanisms of <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> casing treatment near stall conditions are not yet well understood even though this treatment has been used widely in real engines. Numerical analysis based on steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) has been the primary tool used to understand flow mechanism for <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> casing treatment. Although steady RANS explains some flow effects of <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> casing treatment, it does not calculate all the measured changes in the compressor characteristics. Therefore, design optimization of <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> with steady RANS has not been very successful. As a compressor operates toward the stall condition, the flow field becomes transient. Major sources of self-generated flow unsteadiness are shock oscillation and interaction between the passage shock and the tip leakage vortex. In the present paper, an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) approach is applied to {{study the effects of}} <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> in a transonic compressor. The results from URANS are compared with the results from RANS and measured data. The current investigation shows that there are significant unsteady flow effects on the performance of the <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> casing treatment. For the currently investigated rotor, the unsteady effects are of the same magnitude as the steady effects in terms of extending the compressor stall margin...|$|R

Accurate prediction {{of the flow}} field is fundamental in producing robust and efficient designs. To validate {{the capabilities of the}} computational fluid dynamics FLUENT for incompressible fluid seal flow, comparisons of velocity parameters are made to the published experimental results and other CFD code for a <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooved</b> liquid seal.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} casing treatments in a one-stage transonic compressor is presented. The reference case {{consists of a}} radially staggered blisk and six <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves.</b> Speedlines show that this axisymmetric treatment already provided {{a substantial increase in}} operating range with relatively small losses in efficiency. Since the onset of rotating stall in tip-critical high-speed compressors is always linked to the tip-leakage flow and the built-up of blockage within the blade passage, high-resolution measurement techniques have been employed to investigate the corresponding effects. Results with Particle Image Velocimetry show that the interaction between the tip leakage vortex and the shock front cause a blockage area. When throttled further, the blockage increases. The shock structure changes similar to the phenomena of vortex breakdown described by different researchers in the past, but a stagnation point is not present. Before reaching the stability limit, the interface line between the incoming flow and the blocked area moves towards the inlet plane of the rotor indicating spike-type stall inception. Wall pressure measurements confirmed this theory for the smooth wall, but with <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> applied, a part span stall cell develops prior to the stability limit. In order to assess the performance of <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves,</b> two additional configurations are presented. The corresponding measurements addressed the questions whether <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> also provide an operating range extension when applied to an optimized rotor design with higher initial stall margin. Therefore, an identical casing treatment is applied to a forward swept rotor. The second question is, how <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> perform in direct comparison to a non-axisymmetric endwall structure. Axial slots have been applied to the radially staggered rotor. While the stall margin exceeds all other configurations, detrimential effects in efficiency are observed. A detailed anaylsis of probe data shows the changes of the radial profile at the rotor outlet which allows recommendations for more efficient CT designs. Parameters allowing to evaluate the CT influence are presented...|$|R
50|$|The cams {{at the end}} of each lever on {{the female}} end align with a <b>circumferential</b> <b>groove</b> on the male end. When the levers are rotated to the locked position, they pull the male end into the female socket, {{creating}} a tight seal up against a gasket. The arms lock into position using an over-center arrangement, preventing accidental decoupling. Because the groove is cut all the way around the male end, there is no specific alignment necessary to couple as there would be with threaded connectors, and there is no opportunity for cross-threading. This results in an error-resistant, faster coupling operation. Because the compression between the two fittings is limited by the size of the cams on the end of the levers and the rotation of the levers themselves, there is also no possibility of over- or under-tightening the fitting; the pressure against the sealing gasket is effectively constant from one coupling operation to the next, reducing possibility of leaks.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOn {{the base}} of an assumed steady inlet {{circumferential}} total pressure distortion, three-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations are conducted on an axial flow subsonic compressor rotor. The performances and flow fields of a compressor rotor, either casing treated or untreated, are investigated in detail either with or without inlet pressure distortion. Results show that the <b>circumferential</b> <b>groove</b> casing treatment can expand the operating range of the compressor rotor either with or without inlet pressure distortion {{at the expense of}} a drop in peak isentropic efficiency. The casing treatment is capable of weakening or even removing the tip leakage vortex effectively either with or without inlet distortion. In clean inlet circumstances, the enhancement and forward movement of tip leakage vortex cause the untreated compressor rotor to stall. By contrast, with <b>circumferential</b> <b>groove</b> casing, the serious flow separation on the suction surface leads to aerodynamic stalling eventually. In the presence of inlet pressure distortion, the blade loading changes from passage to passage as the distorted inflow sector is traversed. Similar to the clean inlet circumstances, with a smooth wall casing, the enhancement and forward movement of tip leakage vortex are still the main factors which lead to the compressor rotor stalling eventually. When the rotor works under near stall conditions, the blockage resulting from the tip leakage vortex in all the passages is very serious. Especially in several passages, flow-spillage is observed. Compared to the clean inlet circumstances, <b>circumferential</b> <b>groove</b> casing treatment can also eliminate the low energy zone in the outer end wall region effectively...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown in many cases that a notable {{aerodynamic}} stability enhancement can be achieved using <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> on transonic compressors. This advantage, however, often involves degradation in efficiency at design point conditions. In order to analyze the correlations between efficiency, surge margin and other flow quantities {{on the one hand and}} the geometric parameters related to <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> on the other, an automated multi objective geometry optimization of <b>circumferential</b> <b>grooves</b> for a transonic compressor has been performed. For the surge point determination an iterative approach was used to change the static back pressure until the numerical surge limit was determined with a sufficiently small uncertainty. As a result of the optimization two different types of grooves have been identified. The first type is comparatively small and located only little downstream the leading edge of the rotor. It is capable of increasing the surge margin, while only slightly decreasing efficiency. The second groove type is located more towards the trailing edge and significantly bigger in cross sectional size. It can improve the efficiency of the rotor, but at the same time blockage is generated. Combining the two groove types, also the effects combine, resulting in an increased surge margin and increased efficiency. Applying more than one groove of type one further increases the surge margin compared to a single groove, however the gain is limited. Important groove parameters of optimized grooves are further studied, regarding their sensitivity. The working principles and flow phenomena of the grooves increasing the surge margin are analyzed in detail...|$|R
