25|$|The Open Trusted Technology Provider™ Standard (O-TTPS) (Mitigating Maliciously Tainted and Counterfeit Products) is a {{standard}} of The Open Group that has also been approved for publication as an Information Technology standard by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission through ISO/IEC JTC 1 and is now also known as ISO/IEC 20243:2015. The standard consists {{of a set of}} guidelines, requirements, and recommendations that align with best practices for global supply <b>chain</b> <b>security</b> and the integrity of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information and communication technology (ICT) products. It is currently in version 1.1. A Chinese translation has also been published.|$|E
2500|$|The Open Group's Trusted Technology Forum (OTTF) is a vendor-neutral {{international}} forum {{that uses a}} formal consensus based process for collaboration and decision making about the creation of standards and certification programs for information technology, including the O-TTPS. In the forum, ICT providers, integrators and distributors work with organizations and governments to develop standards that specify secure engineering and manufacturing methods along with supply <b>chain</b> <b>security</b> practices.|$|E
2500|$|The O-TTPS was {{developed}} {{in response to a}} changing landscape and the increased sophistication of cybersecurity attacks worldwide. [...] The intent is to help providers build products with integrity and to enable their customers to have more confidence in the technology products they buy. Private and public sector organizations rely largely on COTS ICT products to run their operations. These products are often produced globally, with development and manufacturing taking place at different sites in multiple countries. The O-TTPS is designed to mitigate the risk of counterfeit and tainted components and to help assure product integrity and supply <b>chain</b> <b>security</b> throughout the lifecycle of the product.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSoftware-defined {{networks}} {{provide new}} facilities for deploying security mechanisms dynamically. In particular, {{it is possible}} to build and adjust <b>security</b> <b>chains</b> to protect the infrastructures, by combining different security functions, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and services for preventing data leakage. It is important to ensure that these <b>security</b> <b>chains,</b> in view of their complexity and dynamics, are consistent and do not include security violations. We propose in this paper an automated strategy for supporting the verification of <b>security</b> <b>chains</b> in software-defined networks. It relies on an architecture integrating formal verification methods for checking both the control and data planes of these chains, before their deployment. We describe algorithms for translating specifications of <b>security</b> <b>chains</b> into formal models that can then be verified by Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving or model checking. Our solution is prototyped as a package, named Synaptic, built {{as an extension of the}} Frenetic family of SDN programming languages.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the {{materials}} and distribution management has developed into a broader strategic approach known as electronic supply chain management by means of information technology. This paper attempts to visibly describe supply <b>chain</b> management information <b>security</b> concepts which are necessary for managers to know about. So, the depth of information {{presented in this paper}} is calibrated for managers, not technical security employees or agents. Global supply chains are exposed to diverse types of risks that rise along with increasing globalization. Electronic supply chains will be more vulnerable from information security (IS) aspect among other types of supply chains. The current paper reviews <b>security</b> and supply <b>chain</b> literatures and then investigates framework of information technology in supply chain management. Areas of supply <b>chain</b> which need <b>security</b> attention are then proposed in e-supply <b>chain</b> information <b>security</b> framework and this will be considered as a guideline for managers to find out if their e-supply chain network is secure enough...|$|R
