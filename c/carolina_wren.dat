5|$|In 1930, the South Carolina Federated Women's club {{adopted the}} <b>Carolina</b> <b>wren</b> as the {{unofficial}} state bird over the eastern mourning dove and pushed for its official state adoption until 1939, when the South Carolina Legislature named the northern mockingbird {{as the state}} bird. In 1948, the legislature repealed their previous decision, and the wren became the official state bird.|$|E
5|$|Among the top predators {{of adult}} <b>Carolina</b> <b>wrens</b> are {{domestic}} cats, and snakes {{such as the}} timber rattlesnake. Raccoons and black rat snakes also feed on wren eggs and nestlings.|$|R
500|$|<b>Carolina</b> <b>wrens</b> {{are both}} genetically and {{socially}} monogamous and will usually mate for life. [...] Mate changing is rare, {{and there has}} been one possible instance of polygamy. During the winter season, males are more responsible for guarding the territory. Females vary in succeeding to maintain winter territories without a mate. It has been suggested that the possibility of desertion and decline in care-taking from males along with the need for security in resources year-round prevent extra pair copulations from females, as the mortality rate for <b>Carolina</b> <b>wrens</b> peaks during the winter. Along with thermoregulatory benefits, roosting is thought to reinforce pair-bonding and prevent divorce between mates.|$|R

5|$|The easiest {{species to}} confuse with the <b>Carolina</b> <b>wren</b> is Bewick's wren, which differs in being smaller {{but with a}} longer tail, grayer-brown above and whiter below. The Carolina and white-browed wrens differ from the house wren in being larger, with a decidedly longer bill and hind toe; their culmen has a notch behind the tip.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} by brown-headed cowbirds is common, {{with up to}} 25% of <b>Carolina</b> <b>wren</b> nests {{being affected}} in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama. Cowbird parasitism peaks in April at 41%, and is as low as 8% and 0% in July and August, respectively. Female cowbirds sometimes eject <b>Carolina</b> <b>wren</b> eggs before laying their own, and even if host eggs are retained, the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs. As a result, cowbirds may {{have a significant impact}} on the reproductive success of wrens. The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates, and some have been raised to independence. This also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings. A rare instance of brood-parasitism by a house finch has been recorded. The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations. Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings. Fellow species of wren such as Bewick's wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Carolina</b> <b>wren</b> (Thryothorus ludovicianus) is {{a common}} species of wren that is a {{resident}} in {{the eastern half of}} the United States of America, the extreme south of Ontario, Canada, and the extreme northeast of Mexico. Severe winters restrict the northern limits of their range while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their breeding range. Their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forests, farm edges and suburban areas. This wren is the state bird of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Female <b>Carolina</b> <b>wrens</b> possess song control {{regions that}} {{would appear to}} make them capable of singing with {{repertoires}} like the male. Due to vocalizations that they occasionally make with the male, {{it has been suggested}} that song perception plays a role and is of behavioral relevance.|$|R
5|$|<b>Carolina</b> <b>wrens</b> {{adapt to}} various {{habitats}}. Natural habitats include {{various types of}} woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine woodlands, ash and elmwoods, hickory-oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth. The preferred habitats are riparian forests, brushy edges, swamps, overgrown farmlands, and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs and trees, and parks. It has an affinity for dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in man-made areas. Subspecies burleighi and neophilus inhabit slash pine and palmettos.|$|R

500|$|Although {{many species}} of bird imitate the vocalizations of other birds, the {{northern}} mockingbird is the best known in North America for doing so. Among the species and vocalizations imitated are <b>Carolina</b> <b>wren,</b> northern cardinal, tufted titmouse, eastern towhee, house sparrow, wood thrush and eastern bluebird songs, calls of the northern flicker and great crested flycatcher, jeers and pumphandles of the blue jay, and alarm, chups, and chirrs [...] of the American robin. It imitates not only birds, but also other animals such as cats, dogs, frogs, crickets and sounds from artificial items such as unoiled wheels and even car alarms. As convincing as these imitations may be to humans, they often fail to fool other birds, such as the Florida scrub-jay.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carolina</b> <b>wrens</b> {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey.

Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|R
5|$|There {{are seven}} {{recognized}} subspecies across {{the range of}} these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance.

40|$|Populations of shrub-breeding {{birds are}} declining in eastern North America, {{and loss of}} habitat has been implicated in these declines. Seasonal use of habitat by shrub-breeding birds in the southeastern US remains understudied {{despite the fact that}} it is well {{documented}} that species resident within a region can shift habitat use dramatically between seasons. To better understand year-round habitat occupancy by shrub-breeding birds, we conducted bird counts and vegetation surveys during summer and winter 2008 â€“ 2009 within Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama. We used multi-season occupancy models to examine use of habitat and to contrast seasonal occupancy patterns of four species of resident shrub-breeding birdsâ€”Brown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum), Eastern Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and <b>Carolina</b> <b>Wrens</b> (Thryothorus ludovicianus). Brown Thrashers and Eastern Towhees are partially migratoryâ€”meaning some populations have separate breeding and wintering areasâ€”whereas <b>Carolina</b> <b>Wrens</b> and Northern Cardinals are non-migratory. All four species showed seasonal changes in use of habitat between summer and winter, and all species were associated with both vegetation structure and certain types of cover. Further, partially migratory shrub-breeding species had greater site-turnover and increases in occupancy between summer and winter than non-migratory species. Our results suggest that: (1) management actions based on breeding habitat requirements will likely not create suitable winter habitat, and (2) management of resident shrub-breeding birds will require not only the creation and maintenance of certain types of cover, but also certain structural aspects of vegetation within habitats...|$|R
5|$|In Virginia, some <b>Carolina</b> <b>wrens</b> populations show {{high levels}} of mercury in their blood and this is {{acquired}} from feeding all-year-round on spiders. Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury (through biomagnification) than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood. Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content. Exposure, and prolonged periods of cold, ice, and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations, respectively. Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season.|$|R
500|$|<b>Carolina</b> <b>wrens</b> are wary, and {{are more}} often heard than seen. When on the ground, they move in jerky hops pillaging through various objects, whether {{man-made}} or natural. While moving abruptly, they pause momentarily for chattering or singing. [...] When stationary, they move in twitched motions, jerking their breast around. They also sun- or sand-bathe. The wrens also displays a skittish behavior when encountered by humans, {{as they can be}} seen thrusting off into cover slowly if approaching is detected. However, they occasionally seek out humans that are near, so long as there is no movement from them. Other movements involve being capable of crawling like a creeper and hanging upside-down like a nuthatch.|$|R

5|$|These {{birds are}} largely resident, and will only {{disperse}} beyond their range after mild winters. <b>Carolina</b> <b>wrens</b> sporadically breed {{as far north}} as Maine and Quebec after mild winters. In certain parts of their range, such as most of Iowa, prolonged periods of snow can curtail potential expansion. Permanent breeding locations range from eastern Nebraska, southern Michigan, southeast Ontario and the New England states to Mexican states such as Coahuila, Nuevo LeÃ³n, San Luis PotosÃ­ and Tamaulipas and the Gulf Coast of the United States. Local occurrences with infrequent and likely breeding locations include southeast South Dakota, central Kansas, eastern Colorado, western Oklahoma and Texas as far as Maine and New Brunswick. There have been occasional vagrants spotted in Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.|$|R
5|$|<b>Carolina</b> <b>wrens</b> sing {{year round}} and {{at any point}} during the daytime, with the {{exception}} of performing during the most harsh weather conditions. The birds are also the only species in the Certhiidae family that neither sings in duet nor has their song control regions affect repertoire size. Males alone sing, and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average, thirty two. One of these patterns is repeated for several minutes, and although the male's song can be repeated up to twelve times, the general amount of songs range from three to five times in repetition. While singing, the tail of the birds is pointed downward. Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle-teakettle-teakettle and cheery-cheery-cheery. Various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee-udel, whee-udel, whee-udel, che-wortel, che-wortel and tÃºrtee-tÃºrtee-tÃºrtee and familiar names and phrases such as sweet heart, sweet heart, come to me, come to me, sweet William, and Richelieu, Richelieu.|$|R
