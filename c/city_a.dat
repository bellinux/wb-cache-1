First, as <b>a</b> <b>city</b> changes from <b>an</b> industrial <b>city</b> to <b>a</b> knowledge <b>city,</b> does the breadth of open innovation increase? That is, among the patent applications of <b>a</b> <b>city,</b> is the ratio of joint patent applications against single patent applications increasing? Second, as <b>a</b> <b>city</b> changes from <b>an</b> industrial <b>city</b> to <b>a</b> knowledge <b>city,</b> does the depth of open innovation increase? Is the number of patent applicants on each patent in <b>a</b> <b>city</b> increasing? Third, as <b>a</b> <b>city</b> changes from <b>an</b> industrial <b>city</b> to <b>a</b> knowledge <b>city,</b> do the long tail phenomenon, and the power law phenomenon, strengthen open innovation of any city? If possible, we want to answer an additional question, is the long tail phenomenon, rather than the power law phenomenon, strengthened for open innovation, or not.|$|R

5|$|Alexios was {{replaced}} as commander by John Tarchaneiotes, first cousin of Andronikos II, and {{disappeared from the}} scene for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, Patriarch Jesaias urged Andronikos to recall the aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324. Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia, which had been long under siege {{and was ready to}} fall. He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, the mere news of Alexios's approach, and the respect in which the Turks held him, was enough for the siege to be lifted. Alexios was appointed governor of the <b>city,</b> <b>a</b> position he retained until 1327.|$|E

5|$|Both Schicchi and Buoso Donati were {{historical}} characters. Dante's verses, and the opera, {{are based}} on an actual incident {{that took place in}} 13th century Florence. Dante had several reasons for his harsh treatment of Schicchi: Dante's wife, Gemma, was of the Donati family; the poet himself was of pure Florentine descent. He despised members of the peasant class such as Schicchi. Dante's class prejudice displays itself in several episodes in the Inferno: in one, three noble Florentines, who have died and gone to Hell, ask Dante for news of their home <b>city.</b> <b>A</b> disgusted Dante tells them that the city is now dominated by the nouveau riche.|$|E
