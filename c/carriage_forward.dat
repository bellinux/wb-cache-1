5|$|Mechanical theater (driven by {{carriage}} wheels): The inventors of {{the field}} mill mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the <b>carriage</b> <b>forward).</b> From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-Jie emperor Shi Hu (334–349). The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6m (20ft) long carriage that was about 3m (10ft) wide. On it rested a large golden Buddha statue with a Daoist statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand. The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing incense into a censer. Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed faucets which spouted water. Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when the carriage halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and spouting faucets.|$|E

The Blakely 7-inch 100-pounder was found beside its pivot carriage, atop the forward starboard boiler; {{this was the first}} cannon recovered from Alabama. The 68-pounder smoothbore was located aft, at the stern, immediately outside the starboard hull structure; {{it is possible that the}} remains of its truck and pivot carriage lie underneath the gun tube. Both heavy cannon were recovered in 1994.|$|E

50|$|On {{the night}} of the hold up, Biggs told his wife he was off logging with Reynolds in Wiltshire. The gang then stopped the mail train from Glasgow to London {{in the early hours of}} 8 August 1963, which was Biggs's 34th birthday. Stan Agate was unable to operate the main line {{diesel-electric}} locomotive because he had only driven shunting locomotives on the Southern Region. Therefore, driver of the intercepted train, Jack Mills, was coshed with an iron bar and forced to move the engine and mail <b>carriages</b> <b>forward</b> to a nearby bridge over a roadway, which had been chosen as the unloading point. Biggs' main task had been to get Agate to move the train and when it became obvious that the two were useless in that regard, they were banished to a waiting vehicle while the train was looted.|$|R

5000|$|The derailed {{engine and}} first two {{carriages}} passed the bridge. The first carriage broke {{free from the}} other carriages. Carriage one was torn open when it collided with a severed mast beside the track, killing eight passengers. The remaining carriages {{ground to a halt}} with the second carriage clear of the bridge. The rear half of the third <b>carriage,</b> and <b>forward</b> half of the fourth carriage, came to rest under the weakened bridge, whose weight was estimated at 570 t. Within seconds, with all its supports demolished, the bridge and several motor cars on top of it crashed onto the carriages, crushing them and the passengers inside.|$|R

50|$|The Pekin is a True bantam, a {{breed of}} {{miniature}} chicken {{which has no}} large fowl counterpart. They are rather round-shaped, and their <b>carriage</b> tilts <b>forward,</b> with the head slightly closer to the ground than their elaborate tail feathers. This 'tilt' is a key characteristic of the Pekin. The bird on the whole, though the tail especially, should be abundantly feathered, and well rounded. The cockerels often have longer feathers that protrude outwards from their feet. The range of Pekin colours is extensive, and the list is continually growing. Colours include black, blue, buff, cuckoo, mottled, barred, Columbian, lavender, partridge, white, birchen, and silver partridge Rarer colours are in great demand, and many breeders spend much time perfecting new lines of colours in their birds. Frizzled Pekins are common.|$|R

50|$|The {{issue was}} finally {{resolved}} with the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act. Among its provisions, the act mandated that distributors must carry local stations {{who make their}} signal available for free, but must also get retransmission consent before a signal can be retransmitted. Mandatory retransmission consent gave broadcasters the ability to seek compensation from distributors and established the basis for <b>carriage</b> disputes going <b>forward.</b> At first, the larger broadcasters negotiated not for higher fees, but for inclusion of their newer, lesser known, non-terrestrial channels. Fox, for example, obtained distribution for FX; NBC for CNBC. The practice has complicated carriage disputes by making bundled tiers not just a marketing choice, but a contractual obligation.|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} {{impossible}} for me to describe these Beast People in detail; my eye has had no training in details, and unhappily I cannot sketch. Most striking, perhaps, in their general appearance was the disproportion between the legs of these creatures and the length of their bodies; and yet--so relative is our idea of grace--my eye became habituated to their forms, and at last I even fell in with their persuasion that my own long thighs were ungainly. Another point was the <b>forward</b> <b>carriage</b> of the head and the clumsy and inhuman curvature of the spine. Even the Ape-man lacked that inward sinuous curve of the back which makes the human figure so graceful. Most had their shoulders hunched clumsily, and their short forearms hung weakly at their sides. Few of them were conspicuously hairy, at least until the end of my time upon the island.|$|R
50|$|While {{riding up}} {{the slope of the}} Weesp station towards the bridge over the Merwedekanaal the dike sagged over a length of 95 metres. This was caused by the {{extensive}} rain in the preceding time and the poor state of repair of the railway dike. At the moment of the sagging the locomotive already was on the bridge and was entangled in the ironworks of the bridge construction. The locomotive and tender flipped to the right. The tender lay on the bridgehead, a luggage wagon next to it came to a standstill against the bridgehead. The following three carriages slid off the slope and shoved into each other. The wooden upperside was largely splintered, causing the most deaths and injured. The third carriage was also engulfed by the luggage carriage on the rear and a postal carriage, which because of the speed partially ended up next to the <b>forward</b> <b>carriages.</b> The carriage behind the postal carriage ended up skewed down from the slope, but was barely damaged. The rear carriages of the train derailed but remained on the tracks.|$|R
60|$|The {{road was}} smooth; it led {{up and over}} and down a continual {{succession}} of hills; but it was narrow, the horses were used to it, and could not well {{get out of it}} anyhow; so why shouldn't the drivers entertain themselves and us? The noses of our horses projected sociably into the rear of the <b>forward</b> <b>carriage,</b> and as we toiled up the long hills our driver stood up and talked to his friend, and his friend stood up and talked back to him, with his rear to the scenery. When the top was reached and we went flying down the other side, there was no change in the program. I carry in my memory yet the picture of that forward driver, on his knees on his high seat, resting his elbows on its back, and beaming down on his passengers, with happy eye, and flying hair, and jolly red face, and offering his card to the old German gentleman while he praised his hack and horses, and both teams were whizzing down a long hill with nobody in a position to tell whether we were bound to destruction or an undeserved safety.|$|R

The thesis further provides the interpretation of the breach of obligations under the contract of carriage and of liability {{on the part of the}} carrier, and/or the sender, as a result of breaching the duties under the contract of carriage. The rigorous thesis also presents the obligation to pay damages on the part of an international road carrier, proviso and complaints under the CMR, special statute of limitation under the CMR, and resolutions of disputes in relation to a contract of carriage in the international carriage by [...] ...|$|R
40|$|PRISMATIC HULL TESTS IN REGULAR WAVES IN DIN TOWING TANK Begovic Ermina, Boccadamo Guido, Bove Andrea, Caldarella Sebastiano Department of Naval Architecture, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy 1. Introduction Dipartimento di Ingegneria Navale (DIN) of Università degli studi di Napoli Federico II has a {{towing tank}} of 137. 2 m length, {{equipped}} with towing <b>carriage</b> with maximum <b>forward</b> speed of 10 m/s {{to perform the}} model tests for ship resistance prediction. This dimension of towing tank and carriage maximum speed allow relatively huge models and very good tank-sea correlation. Resistance and powering characteristics have been conducted both for conventional ship and for fast planning hulls. Furthermore, multi hull configurations like catamaran, trimaran and pentamaran ship models have been subject of research during last years. State of the art in naval architecture indicates that the significant improvements in ship resistance characteristics were obtained using the optimised hull forms and consequently the cruising speed was increased. On the other hand, increasing speed and security of vessels calls for {{a better understanding of}} the seakeeping so ship behaviour in rough water become one of the principal interests of scientific community both as development of numerical prediction method and as experimental determination of ship responses. Considering seakeeping of ships means practically to constrain the attention mainly at vertical accelerations, relative vertical motions between ship and waves, slamming, water on deck and wave bending moments and shear forces. Vertical motions and accelerations result in loads on structures, cargo and equipment and are the main reason for seasickness. It is evident that this aspect will be the most important for the passenger ships in order to increase the comfort on board. Relative vertical motions are used to evaluate the possibility and damage due to slamming and water on deck and therefore are important to be improved the safety of ship. As regard the exciting loads (i. e. wave bending moments and shear forces) generated in the interaction of ship advancing at “constant” speed in confused sea it is of paramount importance for the structure to be dimensioned appropriately. Within the frame of the Competence Regional Centre “Transport”, a project financed by the Campania Region (Mesure 3. 16 POR Campania 2000 - 2006), started in November 2002, to develop a research structure equipped with some technological laboratories and capable to integrate the competences of Universities and Research Corporations, acting in the Campania Region, DIN was one of Departments of University of Naples Federico II selected to get financial resources for technological development and improvement of laboratory facilities. At towing tank new electric feeding system has been installed and new acquisition system has been developed. Recently, a wave maker designed by Edinburgh Designs Ltd, chosen in open bid, has been installed at DIN towing tank with the aim to extend the tank possibilities also to seakeeping tests. In this work, the first seakeeping tests conducted at DIN towing tank equipped with new wavemaker for the prismatic hull form, typical for the planning ships are presented. The idea for the project demonstrator was to highlight the possibility of towing tank – towing carriage – wavemaker for the prediction of high speed craft behaviour in rough sea, as it is considered one of the most important subject of scientific research. For the validation of ship performance in rough sea, the vertical motions i. e. heave and pitch have been considered as the most influencing for comfort on board. The tests are relative to 28 m length high speed craft cruising at speed of 30 knots in regular waves...|$|R
