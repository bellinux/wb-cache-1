This study illustrates that current ADs predominately come from the ranks of former coaches, compliance officers, business managers and fund raisers, while few were formerly SIDs. In addition, this study sought to determine whether the SID develops skills and experience most closely related with ADs. The variables examined in this study include the SIDs 2 ̆ 7 perception of themselves and their desire to move into the director 2 ̆ 7 s role, and their perception of skills and characteristics required to be an AD. Variables to be considered include the number of ADs who have been SIDs, the number of SIDs who have interviewed for <b>AD</b> <b>positions</b> and who express interest in developing skills associated with <b>AD</b> <b>positions.</b> A survey instrument was constructed to determine if SIDs perceive themselves as qualified to be ADs and to measure their interest in the position. In addition to providing self evaluations of their ability and interest in serving as ADs, SIDs were asked questions regarding the background experience of their supervisors and the hiring history of their institutions, which should provide a sufficient picture of hiring practices for <b>AD</b> <b>positions.</b> Data collected for this study reinforces the findings in the literature review that the majority of communications professionals are content with technician roles, even in advanced stages of their careers. Results indicate that SIDs perceive that they are toiling in an underrated profession and that, for the majority, their personality and training can be tailored for the AD job. However, the significant lack of interest by SIDs in pursuing <b>AD</b> <b>positions</b> was a surprising result of the investigation.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Search-based {{advertising}} allows the advertisers to run special campaigns targeted to {{different groups of}} potential consumers at low costs. Google, Yahoo and Microsoft advertising programs allow the advertisers to bid for an <b>ad</b> <b>position</b> on the result page of a user's query when the user searches for a keyword that the advertiser relates to its products or services. The expected revenue generated by the ad depends on the <b>ad</b> <b>position,</b> and the <b>ad</b> <b>positions</b> of the advertisers are concurrently determined after an instantaneous auction based on the bids of the advertisers. The advertisers are charged only when their ads are clicked by the users. To avoid excessive ad expenditures due to sudden surges in the keyword-search activities, each advertiser reserves a fixed finite daily budget, and the ads are not shown {{in the remainder of}} the day when the budget is depleted. Arrival times of keyword-search instances, <b>ad</b> <b>positions,</b> <b>ad</b> selections, and sales generated by the ads are random. Therefore, an advertiser faces a dynamic stochastic total net revenue optimization problem subject to a strict budget constraint. Here we formulate and solve this problem using dynamic programming. We show that there is always an optimal dynamic bidding policy. We describe an iterative numerical approximation algorithm that uniformly converges to the optimal solution at an exponential rate of the number of iterations. We illustrate the algorithm on numerical examples. Because dynamic programing calculations of the optimal bidding policies are computationally demanding, we also propose both static and dynamic alternative bidding policies. We numerically compare the performances of optimal and alternative bidding policies by systematically changing each input parameter. The relative percentage total net revenue losses of the alternative bidding policies increases with the budget loading, but were never more than 3. 5 % of maximum expected total net revenue. The best alternative to the optimal bidding policy {{turned out to be a}} static greedy bidding policy. Finally, statistical estimation of the model parameters is visited...|$|R

40|$|Sponsored search {{advertising}} has grown rapidly {{since the last}} decade and is now a significant revenue source for search engines. To ameliorate revenues, search engines often set fixed or variable reserve price to in influence advertisers' bidding. This paper studies and compares two pricing mechanisms: the generalized second-price auction (GSP) where the winner at the last <b>ad</b> <b>position</b> pays the larger value between the highest losing bid and reserve price, and the GSP with a posted reserve price (APR) where the winner at the last position pays the reserve price. We show that if advertisers' per-click value has an increasing generalized failure rate, the search engine's revenue rate is quasi-concave and hence there exists an optimal reserve price under both mechanisms. While the number of advertisers and the number of <b>ad</b> <b>positions</b> have no effect on the selection of reserve price in GSP, the optimal reserve price is affected by both factors in APR and it should be set higher than GSP...|$|R
