50|$|In 1969, Bishop William G. Connare {{began to}} develop {{plans to build a}} new, modern high school that would serve {{students}} from Northern Fayette and South-Central Westmoreland Counties. The Rev. Henry Geibel, former priest of the nearby Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Parish, where classes were held previously, until the school enrollment over-exceeded its <b>capacity,</b> <b>purchased</b> property on which the school would be built in the Hillcrest section of Connellsville Township. Ground was broken on March 6, 1963. The facility cost $1.2 Million to construct and was completed for the start of classes in the winter of 1964. Unfortunately Rev. Geibel died before the school was completed. The school was named in his honor, the Father Geibel Memorial High School. A football field was added in 2004. The Middle School Concept, adding grades 7 and 8, was completed {{for the start of the}} 2006-07 school term. The current school name is Geibel Catholic Middle-High School.|$|E
40|$|Current {{public cloud}} offerings sell {{capacity}} {{in the form of}} pre-defined virtual machine (VM) configurations to their tenants. Typically this means that tenants must purchase individual VM configurations based on the peak demands of the applications, or be restricted to only scale-out applications that can share a pool of VMs. This diminishes the value proposition of moving to a public cloud as compared to server consolidation in a private virtualized datacenter, where one gets the benefits of statistical multiplexing between VMs belonging to the same or different applications. Ideally one would like to enable a cloud tenant to buy capacity in bulk and benefit from statistical multiplexing among its workloads. This requires the purchased capacity to be dynamically and transparently allocated among the tenant's VMs that may be running on different servers, even across datacenters. In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms called BPX and DBS that are able to provide the cloud customer with the abstraction of buying bulk capacity. These algorithms dynamically allocate the bulk <b>capacity</b> <b>purchased</b> by a customer between its VMs based on their individual demands and user-set importance. Our algorithms are highly scalable and are designed to work in a large-scale distributed environment. We implemented a prototype of BPX as part of VMware's management software and showed that BPX is able to closely mimic the behavior of a centralized allocator in a distributed manner...|$|E

Three similar sizes of combined cycle gas turbine power projects up to 200 Megawatt of independent power producers in Pakistan were selected in-order to develop and drive the basic assumptions for the inputs of the models in view of prevailing Government of Pakistan’s two components of electricity purchasing tariff that is energy <b>purchase</b> price and <b>capacity</b> <b>purchase</b> price at higher voltage grid station terminal from independent power producers. The levelized electricity purchasing tariff over life of plant on gaseous fuel at 60 percent plant load factor was 6. 47 cent per kilowatt hour with energy <b>purchase</b> price and <b>capacity</b> <b>purchase</b> prices of 3. 54 and 2. 93 cents per kilowatt hour respectively. The outcome of technical models of gas turbine, steam turbine and combined cycle gas turbine power were found in close agreement with the projects under consideration and provides opportunity of evaluation of technical and financial aspects of combined cycle power plant in a more simplified manner with relatively accurate results. At 105 Celsius exit temperature of heat recovery steam generator flue gases the net efficiency of combined cycle gas turbine was 48. 8 percent whereas at 125 Celsius exit temperature of heat recovery steam generator flue gases it was 48. 0 percent.
