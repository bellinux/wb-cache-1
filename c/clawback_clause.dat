2500|$|In September 2016, Wells Fargo {{was issued}} a {{combined}} total of $185 {{million in fines}} for creating over 1.5 million checking and savings accounts and 500,000 credit cards that its customers never authorized. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued $100 million in fines, {{the largest in the}} agency's five-year history, along with $50 million in fines from the City and County of Los Angeles, and $35 million in fines from the Office of Comptroller of the Currency. The scandal was caused by an incentive-compensation program for employees to create new accounts. It led to the firing of nearly 5,300 employees and $5 million being set aside for customer refunds on fees for accounts the customers never wanted. Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the department, retired in July 2016 and received $124.6 million in stock, options, and restricted Wells Fargo shares as a retirement package. On October 12, 2016, John Stumpf, the then Chairman and CEO, announced that he would be retiring amidst the controversies involving his company. It was announced by Wells Fargo that President and Chief Operating Officer Timothy J. Sloan would succeed, effective immediately. [...] Following the scandal, applications for credit cards and checking accounts at the bank plummeted dramatically. [...] In response to the event, the Better Business Bureau dropped accreditation of the bank, S Global Ratings lowered its outlook for Wells Fargo to negative from stable, and several states and cities across the US ended business relations with the company. [...] An investigation by the Wells Fargo board of directors, the report of which was released in April 2017, primarily blamed Stumpf, whom it said had not responded to evidence of wrongdoing in the consumer services division, and Tolstedt, who was said to have knowingly set impossible sales goals and refused to respond when subordinates disagreed with them. The board chose to use a <b>clawback</b> <b>clause</b> in the retirement contracts of Stumpf and Tolstedt to recover $75 million worth of cash and stock from the former executives.|$|E
50|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the effect of}} a deal-by-deal waterfall and to make it more attractive to LPs, private equity funds using an American waterfall may include a <b>clawback</b> <b>clause</b> in their LPAs.|$|E
5000|$|When liquidating the fund, if the LPs were {{distributed}} {{less than the}} agreed preferred return, they claw back the missing amount from the carried interest distributed to the GP. [...] The <b>clawback</b> <b>clause</b> is triggered {{at the very end}} of the fund, at a time where the General Partner may have already put the clawback amount to other use.|$|E
40|$|High-profile {{scandals in}} the sports world, {{exemplified}} by Lance Armstrong and Tiger Woods, expose endorsement companies to financial and reputational risks. Endorsement contracts today rely on morality clauses to mitigate this risk of exposure, which unduly restricts a company’s response to an athlete’s misconduct. <b>Clawback</b> <b>clauses,</b> on the other hand, provide companies with a mechanism to fully protect their investment in the employee or sponsored athlete. This Note discusses the practicality of introducing <b>clawback</b> <b>clauses</b> into athletic endorsement contracts. Although many factors inhibit endorsement companies from implementing <b>clawback</b> <b>clauses</b> into endorsement contracts, more beneficial alternatives exist that companies can pursue to better protect themselves rather than relying solely on morality clauses. This Note argues that the most practical alternative to the morality clause includes adopting specific contracting techniques {{in contrast to the}} untried clawback provision...|$|R
40|$|The current post-crisis era in most world {{countries}} motivates business entities {{to focus on}} improving of risk governance functions. It is mostly concerned to banks because of risky nature of their business. Before global financial crisis the executive compensation in most banks was excessive, that, in turn, led to systemic risk growth. According to transaction cost theory corporate governance is focused at effective performance of banking transactions. In connection with the above-stated thesis the important task at the time is improving the system of executive remuneration {{in order to ensure}} the moderate bank risk level. With this aim in 2008 Swiss bank UBS has implemented new compensation system that assumes the <b>clawback</b> provision. This <b>clause</b> concerning the deferred awards of senior managers’ remuneration was included to increase their accountability for loss-creating or fraud behavior. The paper investigates the aftermath of clawback of executive compensation implementation in the biggest European banks and discusses the specific features of the reformed remuneration system amongst financial institutions. Furthermore, after implementation of the clawback provision in leading banks of Europe similar practice has been started in financial institutions of USA, features of which is researched in the paper...|$|R
