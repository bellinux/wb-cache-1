Cumulative scores of sexual intercourse and failure to use condoms were compared between intervention and control groups. The results indicate that cumulatively over the three-year period, intervention youth reported significantly lower rates of failure to use a condom.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the paper is {{assessing}} the possibilities of protecting the titles of works. One possibility is the protection by means of registered or unregistered trademarks. This route presents difficulties because of the distinctiveness perspective. In this sense, the European case-law has recently developed a constant practice and outlined a series of criteria that {{should be taken into}} consideration when examining a trademark consisting of a title. Another possibility is protecting the title under the provisions of the copyright law. From this respect, the practice has not yet determined a constant practice. However, the dominant opinion is that the originality criterion should be taken into consideration when assessing the protection of a tile. Finally, brief conclusion are made, including short remarks on the <b>cumulative</b> <b>protection</b> of titles, both as trademarks and under the copyright law...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical models {{suggest that}} many diverse psychosocial factors {{contribute}} to the etiology of substance use among youth. It {{has been suggested that}} substance use {{is a function of the}} total number of etiologic factors, rather than a specific type or set of factors. This study examined whether cumulative psychosocial risk and protection measured in the 7 th grade predicted alcohol use in the 9 th grade across ethnically diverse samples of adolescents. Participants consisted of black (n 775) and Hispanic (n 467) inner-city youth and white suburban youth (n 708). Prevalence rates for alcohol use and risk/protection varied more widely based on ethnic group compared to gender. Black youth reported the fewest risk factors and lowest levels of alcohol use, white youth reported the most risk factors and highest levels of alcohol use, and Hispanic youth reported the fewest protective factors and intermediate levels of alcohol use. Despite these differences, structural equation modeling indicated that a latent factor consisting of <b>cumulative</b> risk, <b>protection,</b> and their interaction significantly predicted later alcohol use for the combined sample as well as for each ethnic/ gender subgroup. However, the proportion of variance explained in alcohol use varied across subgroups, and moderator analyses indicated that protection significantly buffered the effect...|$|R
40|$|Objective Cyclophosphamide (CYC) {{therapy for}} {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease predominantly affecting women of childbearing age, causes an unacceptably high incidence of irreversible premature ovarian failure (POF). This study was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of depot leuprolide acetate, a synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRH-a), for protection against POF during CYC therapy. Methods Young women with severe SLE treated in a standardized protocol of monthly intravenous bolus CYC were offered treatment with GnRH-a (depot leuprolide acetate; a 3. 75 -mg monthly injection during the standard CYC regimen). Patients treated with GnRH-a were compared with controls individually matched by age (± 5 years) and by cumulative CYC dose (± 5 gm). Reproductive status was determined after a minimum followup of 3 years after CYC therapy. The primary outcome was time to POF. Paired summary statistical analyses, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, and Cox regression analyses were performed to assess differences in outcome between groups. Results POF developed in 1 of 20 women treated with GnRH-a (5 %) compared with 6 of 20 controls (30 %) matched by age and cumulative CYC dose (matched odds ratio 0. 09, P < 0. 05). Kaplan-Meier estimates demonstrated improved <b>cumulative</b> ovarian <b>protection</b> over time in the GnRH-a–treated group (P = 0. 04). Conclusion Treatment with GnRH-a during CYC therapy was associated with a significant reduction of POF in young women with severe SLE...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{antiemetic}} efficacy and tol-erability of ondansetron plus metopimazine with ondan-setron plus metopimazine plus prednisolone during nine cycles of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: A total of 221 women with stage I or II {{breast cancer and}} no prior chemotherapy who were scheduled to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil and methotrexate or cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil given every 3 weeks were included in a double-blind parallel trial. Patients were randomized to 3 days of oral treatment with ondansetron plus metopimazine, or ondansetron plus metopimazine plus prednisolone. Ondansetron was administered as 8 mg bid, metopimazine as 30 mg qid, and prednisolone as 50 mg qd. Results: In all, 216 patients (97. 7 %) were assess-able for efficacy during a total of 1, 462 cycles. In cycle 1, complete protection from emetic episodes/nausea day 1, days 2 through 5, and days 1 through 5 was achieved in 84. 4 %/ 51. 4 %, 82. 6 %/ 41. 3 %, and 79. 8 %/ 34. 9 % with ondansetron plus metopimazine and in 84. 1 %/ 57. 0 %, 86. 8 %/ 53. 8 %, and 79. 4 %/ 43. 0 % with ondansetron plus metopimazine plus prednisolone, re-spectively. In cycle 1, the three-drug combination was superior only {{in the treatment of}} nausea on days 2 through 5 (P 5. 0497). The <b>cumulative</b> emetic <b>protection</b> rate after nine cycles was 0. 52 with ondansetron plus metopimazine and 0. 75 with ondansetron plus metopimazine plus prednisolone. Side effects were generally few and mild with both treatments. Constipa-tion was the only adverse event significantly more frequent with the three-drug combination (P 5. 029). Conclusion: Ondansetron plus metopimazine plus prednisolone is highly effective and superior to ondan-setron plus metopimazine during nine cycles of moder-ately emetogenic chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Previous {{research}} suggests that {{alcohol and drug use}} among youth may be a function {{of the total number of}} etiologic factors present, rather than a specific type of factor. Furthermore, a growing num-ber of studies have found that psychosocial protective factors are impor-tant in countering the effects of psychosocial risk. The present study evaluated the buffering effect of <b>cumulative</b> <b>protection</b> on adolescent alco-hol use in the presence of high and moderate cumulative risk. A sample of 4, 851 7 th graders from 37 inner-city schools participated. Students with high scores on the cumulative risk factor index engaged in more alcohol use compared to those with low scores; those with high scores on the cu-mulative protective factor index engaged in less alcohol use relative to those with low scores. For participants at low risk, level of protection did not affect most measures of alcohol use. However, for both moderate and high risk groups, adolescents with high protection engaged in less alcoho...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{bivalent}} killed oral cholera vaccine (OCV) provides 65 % <b>cumulative</b> <b>protection</b> {{over five}} years. It remains unknown whether a boosting regimen can maintain protection in previous-ly immunized populations. This study examines the immunogenicity {{and safety of}} an OCV regimen given five years following initial dosing. Methodology/Principal Findings An open label controlled trial was conducted in 426 healthy Indian participants previously enrolled in a large efficacy trial. To assess whether an OCV regimen given after five years can elicit an antibody response {{equal to that of}} a primary series, we compared vibriocidal antibody titers in previously immunized participants receiving a two dose booster regimen to participants receiving a primary two dose immunization series. Among participants re-ceiving a two dose primary series of OCV (n = 186), 69 % (95 % CI 62 %- 76 %) serocon-verted. In the intervention arm (n = 184), 66 % (95 % CI 59 %- 73 %) seroconverted following a two dose boosting schedule given five years following the initial series. Following a singl...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{contemplate}} resilience in vulnerable children {{as a form of}} emotional giftedness. By foregrounding relevant segments of six ongoing studies and focusing on ways in which vulnerable children in communities in South Africa cope with the impact of HV&AIDS. The concepts of protective factors, processes and <b>cumulative</b> <b>protection</b> shape our understanding of vulnerable children’s coping in terms of resilience as a signature form of (emotional) giftedness. In our studies we use a qualitative case study research design with groups of children in the six participating communities. We rely on dimensions of resilience to extract evidence of vulnerable children’s resilient coping. The results of the study indicate that traces of resilient coping amongst the participating group of children do exist, and that these traces are closely related to the manifestation of emotional intelligence. Themes indicative of children’s resilient coping include a sense of self-worth (based on added responsibility and related to education), the presence of hope and optimism, a sense of security, comfort and belonging (based on knowledge of future caregivers and remaining in a familiar community), as well as selfregulation capacity. We conclude by debating these resilient coping strategies as a form of emotional giftedness...|$|E
40|$|The DARPA Information Assurance Program has {{the aim of}} {{developing}} and executing experiments that test specific hypotheses about defense in depth and dynamic defense capabilities. This paper describes the development and execution of an experiment in layering. The basic hypothesis was that layers of defense, when added in a careful and systematic way to a base system, lead to increased protection against attacks on the system. For the particular experiment, a mission and broad policy were defined and a base system was developed to support the mission and the policy. The boundary controller for the system was designed and developed {{as a series of}} layers; these elements became the main focus of experimentation on layering. The results tended to confirm the experimental hypothesis that layers have a <b>cumulative</b> effect on <b>protection</b> against outside attacks. However, there are often other opportunities for attackers to go around the layers or avoid them altogether. A broader methodological result was that the entire process {{of developing}} experiments needs to be carefully thought through. In addition, the experimental data resulting from this experiment provide only a limited corroboration for the given experimental hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Pro-inflammatory cytokines like {{macrophage}} migration inhibitory factor (MIF), IL- 1 b and TNF-a predominate in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and TNBS colitis. Increased {{levels of}} serine proteases activating protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR- 2) {{are found in}} the lumen and colonic tissue of IBD patients. PAR- 2 activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines impair epithelial barrier, facilitating the uptake of luminal aggressors that perpetuate inflammation and visceral pain. Soy extracts contain phytoestrogens (isoflavones) and serine protease inhibitors namely Bowman-Birk Inhibitors (BBI). Since estrogens exhibit anti-inflammatory and epithelial barrier enhancing properties, and that a BBI concentrate improves ulcerative colitis, we aimed to evaluate if a fermented soy germ extract (FSG) with standardized isoflavone profile and stable BBI content exert <b>cumulative</b> or synergistic <b>protection</b> based on protease inhibition and estrogen receptor (ER) -ligand activity in colitic rats. Female rats received orally for 15 d either vehicle or FSG with or without an ER antagonist ICI 182. 780 before TNBS intracolonic instillation. Macroscopic and microscopic damages, myeloperoxidase activity, cytokine levels, intestinal paracellular permeability, visceral sensitivity, faecal proteolytic activity and PAR- 2 expression were assessed 24 h, 3 d and 5 d post-TNBS. FSG treatment improved the severity of colitis, by decreasing the TNBS-induced rise in gut permeability, visceral sensitivity, faecal proteolytic activity and PAR- 2 expression at all post-TNBS points. All FSG effects were reversed by the ICI 182. 780 except the decrease in faecal proteolytic activity and PAR- 2 expression. In conclusion, the anti...|$|R
40|$|A 2 -year {{field study}} on kennelled stray dogs {{living in a}} highly endemic area of {{leishmaniasis}} was designed to evaluate whether deltamethrin-impregnated collars (Scalibor) Protector Band) could confer protection against leishmaniasis in this peculiar setting, and to assess differences in clinical outcomes between collared and uncollared dogs. A cohort of 120 clinically healthy and Leishmania-seronegative dogs was enrolled, 50 % of which were collared before the 2003 transmission season, and then re-collared before the subsequent season. Collared and uncollared animals were allowed to live with infected dogs in same groups within the kennel. Follow-up included serological (IFAT) assessment twice a year with parasitological Leishmania confirmation, and clinical evaluation performed every 3 months on seroconverted dogs from both groups. Collar losses during the two seasons were high (35 %). About 50 % of enrolled dogs were lost at follow-up because of death or they were moved to other locations. After the 2003 season, cross-sectional serological examinations tested positive in 5 out of 44 collared animals (11. 4 %) and in 14 out of 34 controls (41. 2 %), with 72. 3 % estimated protection (P< 0. 005). After the 2004 season, 7 / 31 seronegative collared dogs seroconverted (22. 6 %) compared with 7 / 17 seronegative controls (41. 2 %), with 45. 1 % protection (P= 0. 15). At {{the end of the}} study, the <b>cumulative</b> rate of <b>protection</b> was 50. 8 % (P= 0. 005). At the clinical evaluation of 21 seroconverted dogs from both groups, canine leishmaniasis signs were significantly more frequent (90 % versus 36 %, P= 0. 017) and rapidly progressive in uncollared than in collared dogs. Reasons for such partial clinical protection in collared dogs may be found in the vector anti-feeding effect of protector bands, resulting in a lower number of infectious bites and, probably, in the reduction of antigenic stimuli necessary to shift toward a non-protective immune response...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to locate children’s own voices within the {{discourse}} of ‘disadvantaged children’. I commence by proposing that foregrounding vulnerable children’s knowledge of protective factors may enable resiliency in similar scenarios. After that, from a positive psychology framework, I explicate the conceptual framework integrating constructs from resilience theory, featuring protective in a systemic model. Next I describe the action research design of a partnership study 1 in 78 schools in an impoverished rural province – focusing on the computer-based random sampling of 10 percent of the participants (n= 2391), the development, piloting and translation of a mixed method questionnaire and the framework analysis of collected data. Then I introduce the emerged themes in terms of protective factors, locating most protection in the (disadvantaged) community, with the child as the central system negotiating adaptation. Subsequently I interpret the themes from my conceptual framework. I submit that the presence of <b>cumulative</b> <b>protection</b> will most probably enhance personal capacity. I also surmise that health-promoting schools may function as replacement safe spaces when safe family systems are lacking, whereas at-risk schools may aggravate the experience and consequences of unsafe family systems. I suggest that perceived capacity in the community system be built on to further support vulnerable children to be resilient. I conclude by suggesting some strategies for future research and intervention endeavours...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{medication}} use after {{coronary bypass}} surgery in patients with renal dysfunction: A national Veterans Administration study. BackgroundChronic kidney disease is now recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. We sought to determine if cardiovascular medications were utilized less in patients with renal dysfunction following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and if the association of decreased medication use was independent of comorbid conditions. We also examined associations between cardiovascular medication use and mortality at 6 months. MethodsData from the National Veterans Adminstration (VA) Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program were merged with the national VA pharmacy database. Prescription rates within 6 months of discharge for CABG were obtained for four classes of medicines: beta blockers, lipid-lowering agents, antiplatelet agents, and angiotensin antagonists. Utilization of medications in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 60 to 90, 30 to 60, and 90. ResultsIn a retrospective analysis of 19, 411 patients, the frequency of nonprescription increased with declining GFR. Decreased utilization for patients with GFR 30 to 60 and < 30 remained highly significant after adjustment for age, race, hypertension, diabetes, and prior myocardial infarction. In patients with more advanced renal dysfunction (GFR < 60), cardiovascular medication use for all medication classes was associated with survival at 6 months after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>protection</b> was seen with use of medication from each additional class. ConclusionIn a large VA population undergoing CABG, renal disease is associated with highly significant decreases in utilization of cardiovascular medications.

40|$|The {{present study}} sought to advance our {{understanding}} of resilience by examining the timing and continuity of multiple domains of protective factors (i. e., psychosocial, cognitive, physiological) measured in early childhood and the transition to adolescence as they related to low antisocial behavior in adolescence among an ethnically diverse cohort of 310 low-income boys. While antisocial behavior was the main outcome of interest, given its huge societal and personal costs (Kazdin, 1996), {{the study also examined}} positive functioning across domains (i. e., internalizing, school achievement) to address issues of cross-domain adjustment. Although the entire sample could be considered at high risk due to low socioeconomic status, levels of risk were further differentiated by investigating the accumulation of other risk factors (e. g., single parent status, neighborhood disadvantage, overcrowding in the home) as they related to outcomes across domains. Furthermore, in addition to more ubiquitously researched psychosocial and cognitive protective factors such as child IQ and parenting, this study also included measures of physiological variables (i. e., vagal tone, sleep, testosterone). In line with hypotheses, several parenting protective factors, as well as child IQ and sleep, were significantly associated with low antisocial behavior at ages 15 and 17. With the exception of vagal tone, the relations between protective factors and antisocial behavior did not vary across levels of cumulative risk. Hypotheses regarding the importance of continuity and timing of protective factors were generally not supported, in that it was equally helpful to have a protective factor present at one or two time periods, in either early childhood or the transition to adolescence. Finally, in line with hypotheses, there did appear to be some fluctuation across positive outcomes; while youth who had low antisocial behavior at ages 15 and 17 were more likely than youth high on antisocial behavior to being doing well in school, they were not more likely to have low internalizing symptoms. Both cumulative risk and cumulative protective factors were related to the number of positive outcomes that youth had across domains. Results highlight the importance of both <b>cumulative</b> risk and <b>protection</b> in the development of positive adaptation...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{intellectual}} property protection has been expanded continuously. New technologies were found eligible for patent protection. New types of marks {{have been recognized}} in trademark law. Copyright law is no longer confined to the cultural domain. In parallel, the exclusive rights of IP owners have been broadened. The TRIPS Agreement provides for a comprehensive portfolio of patent minimum rights. The WIPO Copyright Treaty added new layers of protection to the standard reached under the Berne Convention. As a result of protection against dilution, trademark rights have become instruments for the exploitation of brand image. Enhanced protection, however, {{gives rise to the}} question of appropriate counterbalances. Flexible rights are likely to require flexible limitations for at least two reasons. On the one hand, flexible limitations facilitate the task of maintaining a proper balance between protection and competing freedoms within individual protection regimes. On the other hand, flexible limitations can be employed to safeguard breathing space for unauthorized use when it comes to overlaps between different forms of IP protection. If an intellectual creation enjoys <b>cumulative</b> <b>protection</b> in different IP protection systems, a network of corresponding, flexible limitations ensures that the freedom offered in one system is not eroded through protection granted in another system. The flexibility required within and across IP protection regimes may be provided by open-ended fair use provisions that allow the courts to develop and adjust IP limitations case-by-case on the basis of abstract criteria. Against this background, the paper explores the notion of fair use and identifies factors indicating a need for fair use solutions before embarking on a discussion of the situation in copyright, patent and trademark law. Drawing conclusions, protection overlaps will be considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{protection}} of trade dress restricts {{the ability of}} competitors to compete by imitation. It may also interfere with the public’s ability to copy product features that have been disclosed in expired utility and design patents. These concerns about the anticompetitive potential of trade dress claims have prompted the Supreme Court to tighten the requirements for protecting product configurations under the Lanham Act. To be protectable, the design under consideration should have already acquired secondary meaning. Furthermore, the functionality doctrine may bar protection {{even though there are}} enough alternative product configurations at the disposal of competitors so as to market substitutable goods. The conventional approach to the optimal scope of trade dress rights could be challenged by a reassessment of the effect of their protection on competition. This Paper conducts an economic analysis of trade dress protection based on the theory of product differentiation. In economic terms, the choice of trade dress amounts to a business decision to differentiate by product design. Differentiation allows the exercise of market power within the market niche consisting of the consumers that have a preference for a specific product design. Despite this price, premium consumer welfare increases overall because the existence of product variety allows for the satisfaction of diverse consumer preferences. Competition becomes more dynamic as firms seek to market products that come closer to the taste of the targeted consumer group. The main implication for trademark and unfair competition theory is that the intangible value of goodwill created by product differentiation should be protected against free-riding. Such protection is not simply intended to favor the trademark holder, but rather to promote dynamic competition with differentiated products. In view of the principle of complementarity between intellectual property rights and competition law, this Paper analyzes how trademark and unfair competition law could regulate imitative activity in the marketplace so as to foster the effectiveness of competition. On the other hand, trade dress protection might lead to monopolization of submarkets and suppress locational competition in product space. These anticompetitive effects could be effectively addressed by an application of the functionality doctrine. The submarket analysis links the limits of trade dress rights to the valuations of the Sherman Act. This Paper also examines the phenomenon of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>protection</b> of trade dress through copyright, patent and trademark law. In this context, it also addresses the problem of determining the circumstances under which trade dress becomes the practical equivalent of an expired patent, a question left open by the Supreme Court in Traffix...|$|E
