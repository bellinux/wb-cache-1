25|$|Underground coal {{gasification}} is an industrial gasification process, which {{is carried out}} in non-mined coal seams using injection of a gaseous oxidizing agent, usually oxygen or air, and bringing the resulting product gas to surface through production wells drilled from the surface. The product gas could {{to be used as}} a <b>chemical</b> <b>feedstock</b> or as fuel for power generation. The technique can be applied to resources that are otherwise not economical to extract and also offers an alternative to conventional coal mining methods for some resources. Compared to traditional coal mining and gasification, UCG has less environmental and social impact, though some concerns including potential for aquifer contamination are known.|$|E
25|$|Furfural is an {{important}} renewable, non-petroleum based, <b>chemical</b> <b>feedstock.</b> Hydrogenation of furfural provides furfuryl alcohol (FA) which is a useful chemical intermediate in for example the manufacture of furan resin prepolymers exploited in thermoset polymer matrix composites, cements, adhesives, casting resins and coatings. Further hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol leads to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) which {{is used as a}} nonhazardous solvent in agricultural formulations and as an adjuvant to help herbicides penetrate the leaf structure. Furfural is used to make other furan chemicals, such as furoic acid, via oxidation, and furan itself via palladium catalyzed vapor phase decarbonylation. Furfural is also {{an important}} chemical solvent.|$|E

As such, biofuels and <b>chemical</b> <b>feedstocks</b> generated from renewable sources {{are becoming increasingly}} important. Although previous efforts led to great success in bio-ethanol production, higher alcohols, fatty acid derivatives including biodiesels, alkanes, and alkenes offer additional advantages because of their compatibility with existing infrastructure. In addition, some of these compounds are useful <b>chemical</b> <b>feedstocks.</b> Since native organisms do not naturally produce these compounds in high quantities, metabolic engineering becomes essential in constructing producing organisms.

40|$|Fast {{pyrolysis}} of lignocellulosic biomass {{produces a}} renewable liquid fuel called pyrolysis oil {{that is the}} cheapest liquid fuel produced from biomass today. Here we show that pyrolysis oils can be converted into industrial commodity <b>chemical</b> <b>feedstocks</b> using an integrated catalytic approach that combines hydroprocessing with zeolite catalysis. The hydroprocessing increases the intrinsic hydrogen content of the pyrolysis oil, producing polyols and alcohols. The zeolite catalyst then converts these hydrogenated products into light olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons in a yield as much as three times higher than that produced with the pure pyrolysis oil. The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons and light olefins from the biomass conversion over zeolite {{is proportional to the}} intrinsic amount of hydrogen added to the biomass feedstock during hydroprocessing. The total product yield can be adjusted depending on market values of the <b>chemical</b> <b>feedstocks</b> and the relative prices of the hydrogen and biomass...|$|R
