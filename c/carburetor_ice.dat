50|$|While {{it applies}} to all <b>carburetors,</b> <b>carburetor</b> <b>icing</b> is of {{particular}} concern in association with piston-powered aircraft, especially small, single-engine, light aircraft.

50|$|Temperature {{drops of}} 20°C (36°F) or more are often {{encountered}} within the <b>carburetor,</b> so <b>ice</b> can build up {{even when the}} outside air temperature is well above freezing. Perhaps surprisingly, cold winter weather is less prone to icing, since cold air contains much less moisture. A warm day with high humidity is considered the most likely scenario for <b>carburetor</b> <b>icing.</b> Since there is less air acceleration through the carburetor at full-throttle operation, icing is usually not a problem then.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, icing {{conditions}} are those atmospheric conditions {{that can lead}} to the formation of water ice on the surfaces of an aircraft, or within the engine as <b>carburetor</b> <b>icing.</b> Inlet icing is another engine-related danger, often occurring in jet aircraft.

50|$|Carburetor, {{carburettor}}, carburator, {{carburettor heat}} (usually abbreviated to 'carb heat') {{is a system}} used in automobile and piston-powered light aircraft engines to prevent or clear <b>carburetor</b> <b>icing.</b> It consists of a moveable flap which draws hot air into the engine intake. The air is drawn from the heat stove, a metal plate around the (very hot) exhaust manifold.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Carburetor</b> <b>icing</b> {{occurs when}} there is humid air, and the {{temperature}} drop in the venturi causes the water vapor to freeze. The venturi effect can drop the ambient air temperature by 30-40 degrees F, therefore <b>carburetor</b> <b>icing</b> often occurs when the outside air temperature is in the 60-70 degree F range. Unfortunately, the warm air temperature often causes pilots to overlook the possibility of carb icing. The ice will form on the surfaces of the carburetor throat, further restricting it. This may increase the Venturi effect initially, but eventually restricts airflow, perhaps even causing a complete blockage of air to the carburetor. The engine begins to run more rich as ice formation increases. Without intervention (carb heat or leaning) this can only continue {{until the mixture is}} outside of the [...] "chemically correct" [...] range for combustion. Icing may also cause jamming of the mechanical parts of the carburetor, such as the throttle, typically a butterfly valve.|$|R

After Lockheed performed a series of tests and associated engineering adjustments, Kelsey took the prototype across the country on a record-breaking speed flight in February 1939. Just short of his goal, as he was directed into the landing pattern at Mitchel Field behind three slow trainer aircraft, his prototype's <b>carburetors</b> <b>iced</b> up and the engines would not respond—they continued to idle and would not increase in power.

5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air.

2500|$|But {{from first}} to last, the Commando {{remained}} a headache. It could be kept flying {{only at the}} cost of thousands of extra man-hours for maintenance and modification.

In the experienced hands of Eastern Air Lines and along a route that provided more favorable flying conditions than were confronted by military crews in Africa and on the Hump route into China, the plane did well enough.

50|$|The biggest design {{difference}} between the Morris-designed C-Series and the Austin-penned A- and B-Series engines was {{the position of the}} camshaft - on the right-hand side of the block (as viewed from within the car) rather than the left, although all three engines had their inlet and exhaust ports on the left. This meant that the C-Series didn't require the compound ports of the Austin engines, which were partly required to provide space in the cylinder head for the pushrods. This should, theoretically, have provided the C-Series with superior 'breathing' and efficiency than the smaller engines since it still used the same highly-effective heart-shaped Combustion chamber design by Harry Weslake. However this was undermined by the carburettor arrangements; instead of a dedicated intake manifold the C-Series was designed with an intake gallery cast into the cylinder head, with the carburettor(s) attached directly to the intake(s). This design was chosen for ease of construction and to allow different carburettor arrangements to be easily accommodated and the design also eliminated <b>carburetor</b> <b>icing.</b> Each cylinder had a generous-sized intake port from the gallery but the restrictive shape of the gallery and the carburettor port(s) severely limited the engine's maximum power output and speed, as did the four-bearing crankshaft. There appear to have been plans for a twin cam variant of the C-Series, using the same basic head and valve design as the DOHC B-Series in the MGA Twin Cam for use in Rileys and Wolseleys. This explains the relatively unadventurous design of the standard engine. However the reliability problems of the twin-cam B-Series and the mixed reception of the Riley Pathfinder discouraged BMC from pursuing this development and work stopped in 1955.|$|R
5000|$|A {{carburetor}} is used {{to provide}} the air-fuel mixture. Carbureted engines are susceptible to <b>carburetor</b> <b>icing,</b> a condition most {{likely to occur in}} conditions of a low 11 °C (20 °F) difference between the outside air temperature and dew point (the [...] "dew point spread"), as well as visible signs of moisture in the atmosphere. Icing can lead to loss of engine power and, if not corrected, total shutdown of the engine. A carburetor heat control {{is used to}} supply heated air to the carburetor; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture. The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the collective pitch control lever. Pulling the control up slides a gate valve near the carburetor that admits warm air from a scoop on the exhaust system. The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature gauge, marked to indicate temperatures conducive to icing. The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a [...] "carburetor heat assist" [...] which automatically applies carburetor heat when the collective is lowered below a certain point. When icing conditions are present, carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point. As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below 18 in of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below 18 in of manifold pressure. A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{details of}} the University of Colorado (CU) "Pilatus" unmanned research aircraft, assembled to provide measurements of aerosols, radiation and thermodynamics in the lower troposphere. This aircraft has a wingspan of 3. 2 m and a maximum take-off weight of 25 kg, and it is powered by an electric motor to reduce engine exhaust and concerns about <b>carburetor</b> <b>icing.</b> It carries instrumentation to make measurements of broadband up- and downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation, aerosol particle size distribution, atmospheric temperature, relative humidity and pressure and to collect video of flights for subsequent analysis of atmospheric conditions during flight. In {{order to make the}} shortwave radiation measurements, care was taken to carefully position a high-quality compact inertial measurement unit (IMU) and characterize the attitude of the aircraft and its orientation to the upward-looking radiation sensor. Using measurements from both of these sensors, a correction is applied to the raw radiometer measurements to correct for aircraft attitude and sensor tilt relative to the sun. The data acquisition system was designed from scratch based on a set of key driving requirements to accommodate the variety of sensors deployed. Initial test flights completed in Colorado provide promising results with measurements from the radiation sensors agreeing with those from a nearby surface site. Additionally, estimates of surface albedo from onboard sensors were consistent with local surface conditions, including melting snow and bright runway surface. Aerosol size distributions collected are internally consistent and have previously been shown to agree well with larger, surface-based instrumentation. Finally the atmospheric state measurements evolve as expected, with the near-surface atmosphere warming over time as the day goes on, and the atmospheric relative humidity decreasing with increased temperature. No directional bias on measured temperature, as might be expected due to uneven heating of the sensor housing {{over the course of a}} racetrack pattern, was detected.

5000|$|Icing {{occurs when}} the {{atmospheric}} air contains significant levels of water vapor; as the air is drawn into the engine through a carburetor it is cooled sufficiently to cause that vapor to condense out and freeze on the butterfly valve. This cooling has two causes: the air pressure drops due to the expansion caused by engine suction {{and the increase in}} speed through the butterfly valve (in part-throttle operation) which drops the air temperature; and the liquid gasoline being introduced into the airstream must evaporate, and the heat of evaporation is extracted from the airstream, cooling it. The temperature in the carburetor can drop below the freezing point of water, and if the air is humid, ice can form inside the <b>carburetor.</b> As the <b>ice</b> builds up, less air can pass through the carburetor, causing a drop in power and, in severe cases, the engine will eventually stall.|$|R
