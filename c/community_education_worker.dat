40|$|Actively {{seeking the}} {{consumer}} view {{is more and}} more frequently relevant to health care organisations. Dr Chris Brook, Director of Acute Care, Department of Human Services says “… evidence suggests that increased community participation in systems planning and delivery can lead to improvements in the quality, safety and accessibility of health care …”. Consumer Participation can be defined as the process of involving health consumers in decision-making about their own health care, health service planning, policy development, setting priorities and quality improvement in the delivery of health services. (Draper, 1997) In June 2001 Southern Health received BSEP funding for a 12 month consumer participation project, to establish effective and sustainable consumer participation for Southern Health breast services. Since the project status ended, breast services consumer support has been provided by the Monash BreastScreen Senior <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> <b>worker.</b> A final year RMIT social work student reviewed the status of consumer participation in Southern Health breast services. The initial project aims provided the baseline for measuring progress. Project aims: • To establish a productive role for consumers in Southern Health breast services practice review and policy planning activities. • To effect an environment whereby breast health professionals at Southern Health accept and welcome consumer input. • To establish a consumer reference group for Southern Health breast services which is knowledgeable about breast matters, and has the capacity to contribute effectively at a range of levels, from service delivery to policy planning...|$|E

In effect this brought {{together for the first time}} two traditions. The former group of occupations - adult educators, youth <b>workers</b> and <b>community</b> <b>education</b> <b>workers</b> had tended to focus upon the provision of informal education support for individuals and groups within communities. They had always seen their work as being educational. The latter group - community workers, community development workers and development educators had tended to focus upon the socio-economic and environmental development of those communities. Both sets of occupations recognised that they shared very similar values, knowledge base and skill sets and that what brought them together was a common commitment to supporting {{learning and}} social action.|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{outcomes}} for Aboriginal Australians are poorer {{when compared with}} cancer {{outcomes for}} non-Aboriginal Australians despite overall improvements in cancer outcomes. One concept used to examine inequities in health outcomes between groups is health literacy. Recent research and advocacy have pointed {{to the importance of}} increasing health literacy as it relates to cancer among Aboriginal people. This study examined individual, social and cultural aspects of health literacy relevant to cancer among Aboriginal patients, carers and their health workers in New South Wales. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 22 Aboriginal people who had been diagnosed with cancer, 18 people who were carers of Aboriginal people with cancer and 16 healthcare workers (eight Aboriginal and eight non-Aboriginal health workers). Awareness, knowledge and experience of cancer were largely absent from people's lives and experiences until they were diagnosed, illustrating the need for cancer awareness raising among Aboriginal people, communities and services. Some beliefs about cancer (particularly equating cancer to death) differed from mainstream Western biomedical views of the body and cancer and this served to silence discussion on cancer. As such, these beliefs can be used to inform communication and help illuminate how beliefs can shape responses to cancer. Participants proposed some practical strategies that could work to fill absences in knowledge and build on beliefs about cancer. These results were characterised by a silence about cancer, an absence of discussions of cancer and an acknowledgement of an already full health agenda for Aboriginal communities. To promote health literacy in relation to cancer would require a multi-layered programme of work involving grass-roots <b>community</b> <b>education,</b> <b>workers</b> and Board members of Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations and speciality cancer services, with a particular focus on programmes to bridge community-based primary care and tertiary level cancer services...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of horticultural therapy program based on Reasoner’s building self-esteem for juveniles. Fourteen middle school students were recommended by <b>Community</b> <b>education</b> specialist (social <b>worker).</b> Seven experimental group members received a horticultural therapy program and 7 control group members did not during this study performed from April 2009 to July 2009. As the results, the total self-esteem level of the experimental group increased significantly after horticultural therapy (p= 0. 046 *), while control group decreased (p= 0. 610). In the sub-field of self-esteem, social-peer self-esteem level of the experimental group increased significantly (p= 0. 018 *), while significant difference was not detected for the control group. Therefore horticultural therapy program based on Reasoner’s building self-esteem could be utilized as appropriate tools for improvement of self-esteem in juveniles in future clinical studies...|$|R

The workshops were facilitated by internationally renowned speakers Mr Gerard Cleveland and Professor Gregory Saville. Professor Saville, a world renowned authority on <b>education</b> and Aboriginal <b>community</b> development, completed his PhD research with the Indigenous people of Northern Canada and is adjunct professor at the University of New Haven. Mr Cleveland, a lecturer at the UNDA Fremantle Campus Law School, has spoken internationally on issues in public education and training. The pair focused the workshop on a wide range of topics including Aboriginal Education, effective communication for Aboriginal parents and inter-agency cooperation in remote regions, giving special attention to Indigenous issues. Twenty-eight people attended from a range of organisations including Broome Senior High School and the Department of Child Protection. Vocational Education and Training lecturer, Cathy Borthwick said having people with the knowledge and experience of Professor Saville and Mr Cleveland had benefited those who attended. Workshop participant, Dorothy Nannup, believed the seminar would help her in her role with the Kimberley District Education Office. “I can now expect that changes can be made. It’s not impossible,” she said. The workshop was made possible through funding from the Department of Education Services through the Western Australian Aboriginal Education and Training Council and the Commonwealth Government.

40|$|The {{concepts}} used {{to refer}} to the common Nordic tradition of adult education, if there is such, vary between the different Nordic countries. In Denmark and Norway the term in use is folkoplysning, in Sweden folkbildning and in Finland fritt bildningsarbete (the Swedish translation of vapaa sivistystystyö). Depending on which of the central aspects or dimensions of the Nordic tradition focused and brought forward, these concepts have been translated to the Anglo-American context using terms such as folk enlightenment, popular <b>education,</b> <b>workers</b> <b>education,</b> <b>community</b> <b>education</b> and liberal education. The aim of this conceptual paper is to explore and discuss the at least common elements in the concepts, which are enlightenment and bildung, people (folk) and freedom, especially {{from the point of view}} of the Finnish tradition.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} attitudes and opinions of Indiana Public School superintendent:; toward selected components of <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> in public schools. Review of literature traced development of t) -h philosophy of <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> from a "one-room schoolhouse" to a multiplicity of components involving all aspects of community life. Studies related to attitudes and perceptions of educational leaders toward <b>Community</b> <b>Education,</b> especially those of superintendents were reported. A questionnaire was mailed to all 286 superintendents of Indiana school corporations. Two hundred forty-four (85. 3 percent) superintendents responded and constituted the population of the study. The questionnaire was designed to determine the attitudes of superintendents toward: (1) programs and activities, (2) formal cooperative agreements with organizations and agencies, (3) selected <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> concepts, (4) availability of school resources to the community, and (5) perceived inhibitors to the development/expansion of <b>Community</b> <b>Education.</b> A majority of superintendents strongly agreed or agreed that eighteen of twenty-one selected-programs or activities should be offered in their school systems. Superintendents strongly agreed or agreed to entering into formal cooperative agreements with twelve of thirteen selected organizations and agencies. Superintendents expressed a positive attitude toward six of seven <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> concepts. A majority of respondents indicated a positive attitude toward making all school resources included inthe thirteen questionnaire items available to the community on a totally, partially, or no cost basis. Nearly 75 percent of the superintendents indicated lack of finance was an inhibitor to the development of <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> in their school corporations. Approximately 30 percent of respondents cited lack of expressed community interest as an inhibitor to development of <b>Community</b> <b>Education.</b> Other leading inhibitors to development of <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> were: lack of trained <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> staff; lack of time by the superintendent or staff to conduct Community Education; lack of knowledge/understanding by the community; and lack of facilities. The following conclusions were made: 1. Indiana superintendents favored the concept of <b>Community</b> <b>Education,</b> but have left leadership for <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> to other organizations and agencies. 2. Adequate financial resources were not available to Indiana school corporations for <b>Community</b> <b>Education.</b> 3. Neither educational leaders nor the general public were sufficiently knowledgeable about <b>Community</b> <b>Education.</b> 4. More trained <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> personnel were needed to staff developing Indiana <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> programs. 5. In general, Indiana superintendents favored the use of school resources on a basis where cost sharing was directly related to maintenance costs of the resources. 6. Indiana superintendents favored formal cooperative agreements with other public institutions or agencies more than they favored such agreements with private, fraternal, or religious groups. 7. Indiana superintendents favored usual or traditional programs and activities more than atypical or experimental programs. 8. Lack of financial resources was the most frequently cited inhibitor to <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> development. Other noted inhibitors of <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> varied widely from community to community. 9.

40|$|From 1965 {{through the}} 1980 's, <b>community</b> <b>education</b> was {{endorsed}} and promoted in Indiana by the C. S. Mott Foundation of Flint, Michigan. The Mott Foundation issued nearly $ 2 million in grant {{money to the}} Institute for <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> Development (ICED) at Ball State University to encourage local communities in Indiana and a four-state region to develop <b>community</b> <b>education</b> programs and processes. This money was granted to Ball State University and the ICED for several purposes: 1) to promote the concept of <b>Community</b> <b>Education,</b> 2) to provide and manage seed money incentive grants made to local public school corporations who adopted the concept, 3) to provide training and academic programs to local program leaders, and 4) to support the development of <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> in the state through consultant services and other appropriate forms of assistance. After twenty-two years of activity and investment, the Mott Foundation-focused development of <b>community</b> <b>education</b> in Indiana through the Institute for <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> Development (ICED) was phased out. This research was conducted using an Oral History methodology in which a thorough literature review was completed, ICED yearly reports and other literature provided background and triangulation, and eight interviewees were interviewed and audio-recorded {{for a total of}} twenty-one interviews. Recordings were each transcribed and stored by the principle investigator. Participants were interviewed a total of one to three times each, dependent upon the information obtained during each interview.
