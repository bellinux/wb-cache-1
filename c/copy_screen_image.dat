5000|$|Probably the {{thinnest}} clients (sometimes called [...] "Ultra Thin") are remote desktop applications, {{for example the}} X Window System, Citrix products and Microsoft's Terminal Services, which effectively allow applications to run on a centrally-hosted virtual PC and <b>copy</b> keystrokes and <b>screen</b> <b>images</b> between the local PC and the virtual PC.

5000|$|TurboVNC is an {{offshoot}} of TightVNC that accelerates the Tight and JPEG encoding paths of the latter, in part {{by taking advantage of}} libjpeg-turbo, a SIMD-accelerated version of libjpeg. On 100 Megabit Ethernet networks, TurboVNC is capable of displaying more than 50 Megapixels/second with perceptually lossless image quality. TurboVNC includes further optimizations that allow it to display 10-12 Megapixels/second over a 5 Megabit broadband link, with noticeably less but usable image quality. TurboVNC also extends TightVNC to include client-side double buffering and other features targeted at 3D applications, such as the ability to send a lossless <b>copy</b> of the <b>screen</b> <b>image</b> during periods of inactivity. [...] TurboVNC and VirtualGL are used by the Texas Advanced Computing Center at University of Texas at Austin to allow users of TeraGrid to remotely access the 3D rendering capabilities of the Stampede Visualization Cluster.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, a {{weighted}} value wrinkle detection method is suggested {{based on the}} analysis on the entire facial features such as face contour, face size, eyes and ears. Firstly, the main facial elements are detected with AAM method entirely from the input <b>screen</b> <b>images.</b> Such elements {{are mainly composed of}} shape-based and appearance methods. These are used for learning the facial model and for matching the face from new <b>screen</b> <b>images</b> based on the learned models. Secondly, the face and background are separated in the <b>screen</b> <b>image.</b> Four points with the biggest possibilities for wrinkling are selected from the face and high wrinkle weighted values are assigned to them. Finally, the wrinkles are detected by applying Canny edge algorithm for the interested points of weighted value. The suggested algorithm adopts various <b>screen</b> <b>images</b> for experiment. The experiments display the excellent results of face and wrinkle detection in the most of the <b>screen</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a simple and}} {{effective}} scheme for <b>screen</b> <b>image</b> scaling, targeting at real-time applications like remote desktop and screen sharing. To balance visual quality and complexity, we build our scheme upon bilinear interpolation and devise a content adaptive post-processing method. Our scheme keeps the text/graphics regions of <b>screen</b> <b>images</b> as sharp as the original while avoiding magnifying noise and artifacts in the picture regions. Further, the involved operations are quite suitable for hardware acceleration. When implemented on commodity GPUs, our scheme achieves a frame rate more than 300 fps, which is fast enough for practical use. Index Terms — <b>Screen</b> <b>image,</b> image scaling, GPU 1...|$|R

The quality requirement of compound image coding is because users cannot accept the quality if text different from general image coding is not clear enough to recognize. This paper proposes an algorithm to classify and compress the compound images as text, image and background blocks. Active contour algorithm first segments a computer <b>screen</b> <b>images</b> image into text block, back ground block and image block, and.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{efficient}} content adaptive <b>screen</b> <b>image</b> scaling scheme for the real-time screen applications like remote desktop and screen sharing. In the proposed screen scaling scheme, a screen content classification step is first introduced to classify the <b>screen</b> <b>image</b> into text and pictorial regions. Afterward, we propose an adaptive shift linear interpolation algorithm {{to predict the}} new pixel values with the shift offset adapted to the content type of each pixel. The shift offset for each screen content type is offline optimized by minimizing the theoretical interpolation error based on the training samples respectively. The proposed content adaptive <b>screen</b> <b>image</b> scaling scheme can achieve good visual quality and also keep the low complexity for real-time applications. Comment: ICIP 201...|$|R

40|$|Software {{documentation}} for {{the novice}} user typically {{must try to}} achieve at least three goals: to support basic knowledge and skills development; to prevent or support the handling of mistakes, and to support the joint handling of manual, input device and screen. This paper concentrates on the latter goal. Novice users often experience split-attention problem due {{to the need to}} (almost) simultaneously attend to different media. Existing research indicates that split-attention problems can be prevented or reduced by the presence of <b>screen</b> <b>images</b> in the manual. Research is yet unclear about the optimal design of these pictures. This study examines three design styles. Forty-eight novice users received one of the three manual based on these styles. The manuals were an introduction to Windows 95. The users of the most successful manual needed 25 % less training time and had a 60 % better retention. The most important characteristics of the design style of this manual were its use of full <b>screen</b> <b>images</b> (instead of partial ones) and a two-column lay-out in which the instructions and <b>screen</b> <b>images</b> were presented side-by-side in a left-to-right reading order.
