40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate cases of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and analyze the risk factors for a painful hip at skeletal maturity after Perthes disease. We hypothesized that FAI occurs as a sequela of Perthes disease and that coxa plana and triple osteotomy of the pelvis (TOP) may be risk factors. MethodsNinety-five hips were included from 1981 to 2011, 56 of which were operated on with TOP (53) or shelf acetabuloplasty (3). The results were evaluated at a mean 13 years of follow-up (range, 2 – 23 years) with Oxford score and hip radiograph analysis including the Stulberg grade, <b>coxometry,</b> and presence of a femoral bump. FAI was characterized by positional hip pain with preserved joint space and aspherical/nonspherical femoral head. ResultsThe Oxford score was optimal (12) in 79  hips (75 %) and 20 or above in nine hips (9. 5 %). Seventeen hips were rated Stulberg I (18 %), 36 Stulberg II (38 %), 27 Stulberg III (28 %), and 15 Stulberg IV or V (16 %). The average acetabular angle was 10 ° (range, − 4 to 25), VCE 41. 5 ° (range, 18 – 80), and VCA 38. 5 ° (range, 13 – 70). A femoral bump was noted in 31 hips (33 %). Five cases of FAI were managed operatively with at least pain relief. Hip pain at the latest follow-up correlated with coxa plana (P= 0. 0003) and femoral bump (P= 0. 007). No significant correlation was found with a history of hip surgery or <b>coxometry</b> parameters. ConclusionPerthes hips bear risk for later FAI. Risk factors include coxa plana and femoral bump. In case of TOP, it is advocated to avoid excessive tilt, which may cause FAI. Level of evidenceIV...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{assessment}} of the radio clinical results of sixty one total hip arthroplasties was performed among young and active patients, with follow-up for ankylosing spondylitis, in order to evaluate the effect of surgery {{on the quality of}} life of these patients. Methods: For the functional improvement of the patients, we relied on the scores of Devane, Harris and that of Postel Merle d’Aubeigné. The radiological analysis was based on the <b>coxometry.</b> Results: The study confirms the notable functional gain and consequently the improvement of {{the quality of life of}} the patients. However, the longevity of the implants remains difficult to envisage due to our limited and insuffi-cient hindsight. Conclusion: The total hip arthroplasty transforms the life of the young patients’ carriers of the disabling coxitis on the stiffening spondylarthritis, by getting them the laziness and the mobility wished for...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe authors {{report an}} {{isolated}} case of right sacrospinous ligament ossification causing sciatic pain because of compression of the proximal sciatic nerve. The initial conservative treatment of injections {{in the conflict}} zone and the intervertebral joints was insufficient. Surgical exploration was undertaken via a posterior approach, demonstrating {{the conflict between the}} nerve and the ossified ligament. Resection of the ossified ligament eliminated the symptoms at the cost of transitory buttock hypesthesia. The anatomic and pathologic exam identified simple osseous metaplasia. Lumbar-pelvic <b>coxometry</b> analysis showed sagittalization of the acetabular roofs, excessive bilateral femoral torsion, and a step-off attenuation at the anterior cervicocephalic junction (low anterior cervico-cephalic femoral offset). In addition, reduced lumbar lordosis and accentuated sacral slope were noted, factors that could be related to modifications in the static balance of the lumbar-pelvic complex. This imbalance could be correlated to an increase in the forces applied to the pelvic ligament layers. The etiological hypothesis retained was that this osseous metaplasia was a reaction to excessive stresses on the sacrospinous ligament...|$|E
40|$|In the 20 - 50 -year age group, hip pain usually {{indicates}} dysplasia. Chronic mechanical pain is {{the usual}} pattern, although acute pain caused by avulsion or degeneration of the labrum may occur. The morphological characteristics of the dysplastic hip should be evaluated, and {{the link between the}} dysplasia and the osteoarthritis should be confirmed. Three factors indicate a favorable prognosis: joint space preservation, age younger than 40 years, and correctable femoral and acetabular abnormalities. Reconstruction is highly desirable, as it delays the need for joint replacement by 20 years. After 15 years, good outcomes are seen in 87 % of patients after shelf arthroplasty and 85 % after femoral varus osteotomy with or without shelf arthroplasty. Chiari acetabular osteotomy can be performed in patients with osteoarthritis but is followed by prolonged limping. Periacetabular osteotomy should be reserved for patients with moderate dysplasia and no evidence of osteoarthritis. Shelf arthroplasty and femoral osteotomy require 5 - 8 months off work (compared to 5 months after hip replacement surgery) but subsequently permits a far more active lifestyle. Hip replacement, which is required 20 years or more after biologic reconstruction, carries the same prognosis as first-line hip replacement (good results in 80 % of patients after 15 years). Acute sharp pain related to anterior hip derangement also occurs in primary femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). The most common pattern is cam impingement, which is due to a decrease in head-neck offset and manifests as pain during flexion and adduction of the hip. Cam impingement can be corrected by anterolateral osteoplasty, which is often performed arthroscopically. Pincer-type impingement is contact between the anterior acetabular rim and the femoral neck due to retroversion of the proximal acetabulum. The imaging study strategy is discussed. <b>Coxometry,</b> computed tomography, and arthrography can be used. Primary FAI, which occurs as a result of geometric abnormalities, should be distinguished from secondary impingement. Causes of secondary impingement include exaggerated lumbar lordosis with pelvic tilt and to hip osteophytosis (sports or posterior hip osteoarthritis). Osteoplasty is rarely appropriate in patients with secondary impingement. The features of acute anterior hip derangement are now better defined. They can be used to guide palliative treatment, which is effective, in the medium term at least. Experience acquired {{over the last two decades}} has established the efficacy of surgery for hip dysplasia...|$|E
