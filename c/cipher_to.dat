25|$|Before {{a client}} and server {{can begin to}} {{exchange}} information protected by TLS, they must securely exchange or agree upon an encryption key and a <b>cipher</b> <b>to</b> use when encrypting data (see Cipher). Among {{the methods used for}} key exchange/agreement are: public and private keys generated with RSA (denoted TLS_RSA in the TLS handshake protocol), Diffie-Hellman (TLS_DH), ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (TLS_DHE), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (TLS_ECDH), ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (TLS_ECDHE), anonymous Diffie-Hellman (TLS_DH_anon), pre-shared key (TLS_PSK) and Secure Remote Password (TLS_SRP).|$|E

50|$|A cipher is an {{encryption}} algorithm. Combining {{the use of}} a {{symmetric cipher}} and asymmetric cipher is called a hybrid <b>cipher.</b> Ways <b>to</b> attack <b>ciphers</b> and <b>to</b> get around some encryption methods are shown and described in the book.|$|R
25|$|Although {{frequency}} analysis {{can be a}} powerful and general technique against many ciphers, encryption has still often been effective in practice, as many a would-be cryptanalyst was unaware of the technique. Breaking a message without using {{frequency analysis}} essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved, thus making espionage, bribery, burglary, defection, etc., more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed. It was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher's algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security; in fact, it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme (including ciphers) should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself. Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good <b>cipher</b> <b>to</b> maintain confidentiality under an attack. This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by Auguste Kerckhoffs and is generally called Kerckhoffs's Principle; alternatively and more bluntly, it was restated by Claude Shannon, the inventor of information theory and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography, as Shannon's Maxim—'the enemy knows the system'.|$|E

2500|$|In 1863 Friedrich Kasiski was {{the first}} to publish a {{successful}} general attack on the Vigenère cipher.

[...] Though Kasiski {{was the first}} to publish an account of the attack, it is clear that there were others who were aware of it. [...] In 1854, Charles Babbage was goaded into breaking the Vigenère cipher when John Hall Brock Thwaites submitted a [...] "new" [...] <b>cipher</b> <b>to</b> the Journal of the Society of the Arts. [...] When Babbage showed that Thwaites' cipher was essentially just another recreation of the Vigenère cipher, Thwaites challenged Babbage to break his cipher encoded twice, with keys of different length. Babbage succeeded in decrypting a sample, {{which turned out to be}} the poem [...] "The Vision of Sin", by Alfred Tennyson, encrypted according to the keyword [...] "Emily", the first name of Tennyson's wife. Babbage never explained the method he used. [...] Studies of Babbage's notes reveal that he had used the method later published by Kasiski, and suggest that he had been using the method as early as 1846.|$|E
