40|$|Opinion 1 / 09 of the Advocate General, Juliane Kokott, 2 July 2010. The Advocate General of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) {{has found}} that the EU {{centralized}} patent litigation system recently proposed by the Council of the European Union does not comply with EU law. In her opinion, among the various incompatibilities, she stressed that the proposed linguistic system would violate the rights of defence. This opinion constitutes a blow to the efforts to finally reach the long-awaited EU patent litigation scheme (as envisaged in the Draft Agreement on the European and <b>Community</b> <b>Patents</b> Court). This blow will be even stronger, should the ECJ confirm her opinion...|$|R

5000|$|Although not {{formally}} part of European Union law, several closely related treaties have been signed outside {{the framework of}} the EU and its predecessors between the member states because the EU lacked authority to act in the field. After the EU obtained such autonomy, the conventions were gradually replaced by EU instruments. Examples are the Naples Convention of 1967 (on customs cooperation, replaced by a new Convention in 1997 which has been ratified by all member states), Brussels Convention of 1968 (on jurisdiction in civil matters, replaced by the Brussels I Regulation in 2001), the Rome Convention on Contractual Obligations of 1980 (on choice of law in contractual matters, replaced by the Rome I Regulation in 2008 except in Denmark), and the Dublin Convention of 1990 (on asylum seekers, replaced by the Dublin II Regulation in 2003). Additionally, the Convention on the Mutual Recognition of Companies and Bodies Corporate was signed in 1968, but while 5 of the 6 then member states ratified it, it never entered into force due to the Netherlands' refusal to ratify the treaty. [...] Likewise, the Convention for the European patent for the common market of 1975, and the Agreement relating to <b>Community</b> <b>patents</b> of 1989, which amended the 1975 Convention, were signed by all member states but never entered into force due to lack of ratification by all states.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that the {{regulation}} of Intellectual Property (IP) protection should go beyond the traditional regulatory models and follow a more flexible regulatory framework. Considering the range of industrial needs and developments, the article develops a differentiated Community IP protection model that could stimulate growth and innovation, alter the behavior of patent users, and {{improve the quality of}} patents through spontaneous harmonization and convergence. To explain the model better, we distinguish two key elements: differentiated framework directives and epistemic <b>patent</b> <b>communities.</b> Differentiated framework directives dictate the establishment of general patentability standards at the EU level but allow national patent systems to set up stricter patent standards for particular subject matters at the national level. In this way, differentiated framework directives should lead to an appropriate balance between the principles of the IP protection regime and the ideals of economic integration. However, given the current diversity in innovation developments and industrial operations, we recognize the risk that not all IP stakeholders would agree to a differentiated Community IP protection model. To overcome the risk of deadlock within model negotiations, and to encourage the integration of countries that want to move forward and advance certain innovation developments, we propose the creation of epistemic <b>patent</b> <b>communities.</b> In this article, epistemic <b>patent</b> <b>communities</b> are perceived as strong mechanisms for establishing an inclusive patent protection environment that encourages various stakeholders to agree on certain patentability principles and to acquire better IP protection at the EU level...|$|R
50|$|The role of {{the patent}} {{examiner}} in Peer To Patent remains the same as with traditional applications, except that Peer to Patent applications move {{to the head of}} the queue, to reward patent applicants who participate, and the patent examiner is forwarded the ten highest rated submissions of prior art from the Peer To <b>Patent</b> <b>community</b> to aid in their examination.|$|R
40|$|Different {{elements}} in the <b>patent</b> <b>community</b> speak of inventions and the criteria through which property rights may be granted or withheld from them {{in ways that are}} often incongruent. In large part this is due to disagreements about the functional, if not normative legitimacy, of many patentability standards. This paper examines how the European Patent Office’s (EPO) practice Examination Guidelines designed to be a prosaic guide to legal standards, transforms contested inventive matter and methods into patent claims. In doing so these Guidelines manage and manipulate the legitimate expectations of the <b>patent</b> <b>community.</b> The analysis makes the broader conceptual point that patent law standards are shaped by a version of ‘textualisation’ that relies on linguistic and rhetorical structures to cumulatively entrench meanings, and manage the acceptance of the EPO’s legal positions by those who are governed by them. The scale of textualised outcomes in patent law is a threat to coherence but also explains the EPO’s ascendancy in the regulatory sphere...|$|R

40|$|Patent {{documents}} are important intellectual resources of protecting interests of individuals, organizations and companies. These patent documents have great research values, {{beneficial to the}} industry, business, law, and policy-making <b>communities.</b> <b>Patent</b> mining aims at assisting patent analysts in investigating, processing, and analyzing patent documents, which has attracted increasing interest in academia and industry. However, despite recent advances in patent mining, several critical issues in current patent mining systems have not been well explored in previous studies. These issues include: 1) the query retrieval problem that assists patent analysts finding all relevant patent documents for a given patent application; 2) the patent documents comparative summarization problem that facilitates patent analysts in quickly reviewing any given patent documents pairs; and 3) the key patent documents discovery problem that helps patent analysts to quickly grasp the linkage between different technologies {{in order to better}} understand the technical trend from a collection of patent documents. This dissertation follows the stream of research that covers the aforementioned issues of existing patent analysis and mining systems. In this work, we delve into three interleaved aspects of patent mining techniques, including (1) PatSearch, a framework of automatically generating the search query from a given patent application and retrieving relevant patents to user; (2) PatCom, a framework for investigating the relationship in terms of commonality and difference between patent documents pairs, and (3) PatDom, a framework for integrating multiple types of patent information to identify important patents from a large volume of patent documents. In summary, the increasing amount and textual complexity of patent repository lead to a series of challenges that are not well addressed in the current generation systems. My work proposed reasonable solutions to these challenges and provided insights on how to address these challenges using a simple yet effective integrated patent mining framework...|$|R
