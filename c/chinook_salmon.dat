5|$|The river {{supported}} species including <b>chinook</b> <b>salmon,</b> coho salmon, and sockeye salmon, {{as well as}} steelhead, white sturgeon, and Pacific lamprey. It {{is known}} that before the construction of dams on the river, there were three major <b>chinook</b> <b>salmon</b> runs in the Snake River; in the spring, summer and fall, totaling about 120,000fish, and the sockeye salmon run was about 150,000. The historical barrier to fish migration on the Snake River was Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that occurs as the Snake River passes through the Snake River Plain.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} fish inhabiting the river include <b>Chinook</b> <b>salmon,</b> {{threatened}} coho salmon, and rainbow trout. Fish populations are declining, however, due to low {{water quality and}} barriers such as dams and culverts.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{low water}} quality, the Little Applegate {{watershed}} supports populations of coho and <b>Chinook</b> <b>salmon,</b> along with 138 known and 134 suspected species of other vertebrates. Sixty-four {{percent of the}} watershed is forested, although its health is slowly declining due to fire suppression.|$|E
5000|$|The name Tatshenshini {{is derived}} from a Tlingit phrase, the meaning of which was not recorded. [...] However, the {{original}} phrase {{appears to have been}} t’áchán shahéeni, a compound Tlingit noun meaning river with stinking <b>chinook</b> (king) <b>salmon</b> at its headwaters (t’á <b>chinook</b> or king <b>salmon</b> + chán stink + sha head of + héen river + i noun suffix [...] ).|$|R
5000|$|For fishermen, Lake Huron has salmon, trout, pickerel, and whitefish. The Chantry <b>Chinook</b> Classic <b>Salmon</b> Derby is {{held each}} year, usually from about mid July {{to the second}} week of August.|$|R
50|$|The Beckler River {{supports}} <b>chinook</b> and coho <b>salmon.</b> <b>Chinook</b> spawning takes places {{mainly in}} the Beckler and lower Rapid River. Coho use shallower side channels of the Beckler River and a few small tributaries. Adult salmon benefit from a trap-and-haul operation that transports them over a barrier on the lower South Fork Skykomish River.|$|R
5|$|Fishing {{is limited}} to the lower reaches of the river. Hatchery <b>Chinook</b> <b>salmon</b> and summer and winter steelhead are {{sometimes}} caught near the confluence with the Sandy River, and catch and release fishing for wild trout is allowed {{from the mouth of the}} river to the edge of the Bull Run watershed reserve.|$|E
5|$|Sport {{fishing is}} also popular on the Klamath River, with steelhead trout {{being the most}} popular, though <b>Chinook</b> <b>salmon</b> are also highly sought after when low salmon returns do not prevent fishing. A fly fishing guide said that the Klamath {{was one of the}} most {{productive}} steelhead rivers on the West Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecosystem}} of the RNSP preserves {{a number}} of threatened animal species such as the tidewater goby, <b>Chinook</b> <b>salmon,</b> northern spotted owl, and Steller's sea lion. In recognition of the rare ecosystem and cultural history found in the parks, the United Nations designated them a World Heritage Site on September 5, 1980 {{and part of the}} California Coast Ranges International Biosphere Reserve on June 30, 1983.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the species}} of {{salmonids}} migrating routinely through the ladder at the Chittenden Locks are <b>Chinook</b> (king) <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Coho (silver) salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Sockeye (red) salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss).|$|R
25|$|Early 20th century: Salmon {{species are}} {{introduced}} to New Zealand as sport fish, but only the <b>Chinook,</b> or king <b>salmon</b> adapts to the environment.|$|R
5|$|Large {{populations of}} salmon {{inhabited}} the creek before urban construction altered the watershed and the stream channel, {{and in the}} 21stcentury, the creek and its tributaries still provide habitat for smaller numbers of <b>chinook</b> and coho <b>salmon,</b> steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. Steelhead populations in Johnson Creek are within the Lower Columbia River steelhead distinct population segment and listed as threatened (2011). <b>Chinook</b> and coho <b>salmon</b> are listed as threatened {{as part of the}} Lower Columbia River Evolutionary Significant Unit (2011).|$|R
5|$|There are 26 {{species of}} native and {{introduced}} {{fish in the}} lower Central Valley portion of the river, including Sacramento sucker, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and carp. Anadromous fish species found in the lower river are <b>chinook</b> <b>salmon,</b> Pacific lamprey and striped bass. The upper section of the river, defined as the stretch from Lake McClure to the headwaters, has 11 species of fish. Historically, the range of anadromous fish extended to the waterfalls {{at the head of}} Yosemite Valley, but dams have blocked their migration since the early 1900s, and diversions frequently dewater their remaining spawning habitat in {{the lower part of the}} river. Environmental measures enacted in the late 20th century have had some success in boosting <b>chinook</b> <b>salmon</b> populations, from a record low of 500 fish during several years in the 1950s, to a high of 30,000 in 1984. Since the 1970s, the annual chinook run has averaged about 5,300.|$|E
5|$|Mammals in {{this area}} include bison, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, beavers, and prairie dogs, while {{reptiles}} include the snapping turtle, the box turtle, and various types of snakes. The prairie rattlesnake is South Dakota's only venomous snake. Rivers and lakes of the grasslands support populations of walleye, carp, pike, and bass, along with other species. The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic paddlefish, and <b>chinook</b> <b>salmon,</b> native to the Pacific Northwest, have been successfully introduced in Lake Oahe.|$|E
5|$|The Trinity River {{was once}} {{known for its}} {{prolific}} anadromous fish (salmon, steelhead and sturgeon) runs. The actual number of fish returning to the river each year to spawn, prior to European settlement, is uncertain {{due to the lack}} of records. During the first half of the 20th century, before damming, the fall <b>chinook</b> <b>salmon</b> run was estimated at anywhere between 19,000 and 75,500. The spring chinook and coho salmon runs were about 10,000 each and the annual steelhead run was about 50,000.|$|E
50|$|Today, Port Clements and {{the nearby}} mouth of the Yakoun River attract {{visitors}} intending to fish for steelheads, <b>chinook</b> and other <b>salmon</b> or to go kayaking.|$|R
50|$|The Hoh River {{supports}} {{a variety of}} salmonid fish, including spring and fall <b>chinook,</b> coho <b>salmon,</b> winter and summer steelhead, and sea-run coastal cutthroat trout. There are also smaller numbers of chum and sockeye salmon. The Hoh River fishery is managed by the Hoh tribe {{in cooperation with the}} Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife http://wdfw.wa.gov/.|$|R
50|$|The river {{supports}} {{populations of}} <b>chinook</b> and coho <b>salmon,</b> shad, steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. Since public river-bank access is limited, fishing is often done by boat.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} of bull trout and other native {{species of fish}} in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, {{with the introduction of}} non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while <b>chinook</b> <b>salmon,</b> White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.|$|E
5|$|While some of {{the symbols}} are unique to Oregon, others are used by {{multiple}} states. For example, the western meadowlark, Oregon's state bird, is also an official symbol for Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and Wyoming. The North American beaver is also the state animal of New York, and the <b>Chinook</b> <b>salmon</b> (sometimes known as the king salmon) is also the state fish of Alaska. The square dance and milk are commonly used state dances and state beverages, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. Rainbow trout, <b>chinook</b> <b>salmon,</b> westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's salmonids. The forest's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. Sockeye salmon are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or <b>chinook</b> <b>salmon</b> and Lake Cascade is stocked with coho salmon and steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout.|$|E
5000|$|The river {{supports}} {{populations of}} <b>Chinook</b> and coho <b>salmon,</b> steelhead, cutthroat trout, and lamprey. Fishing in Oregon, a sportfishing guide, describes the river as [...] "a beautiful wild trout stream".|$|R
50|$|Several Pacific <b>salmon</b> (<b>Chinook,</b> coho and Steelhead) {{have been}} {{introduced}} into the US Great Lakes, and have become potamodromous, migrating between their natal waters to feeding grounds entirely within fresh water.|$|R
5000|$|The Tlingit phrase t’áchán shahéeni {{describes}} the present-day Blanchard River (pre-1891 Tatshenshini River). <b>Chinook</b> (king) <b>salmon</b> {{run up the}} present-day Tatshenshini River to the Blanchard River and, thence, up the Blanchard River. [...] At the headwaters (shahéen) of the Blanchard River, the salmon (t’á) die, and their carcasses stink (chán).These headwaters were on the old Tlingit trail and trade route between Haines, Alaska and Lake Kusawa, Yukon.|$|R
5|$|As of 2010, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) {{operates}} the Cole M. Rivers Hatchery {{near the base}} of the dam at Lost Creek Lake, slightly upstream of the former Rogue–Elk Hatchery built by Hume. It raises rainbow trout (steelhead), Coho salmon, spring and fall <b>Chinook</b> <b>salmon,</b> and summer and winter steelhead. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the hatchery in 1973 to offset the loss of fish habitat and spawning grounds in areas blocked by construction of the Lost Creek Dam on the main stem and the Applegate and Elk Creek dams on Rogue tributaries. It is the third-largest salmon and steelhead hatchery in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{and hunting}} are popular outdoor {{activities}} in South Dakota. Fishing contributes over $224million to South Dakota's economy, and hunting contributes over $303million. In 2007, over 275,000 hunting licences and 175,000 fishing licences {{were sold in}} the state; around half of the hunting licences and over two-thirds of the fishing licences were purchased by South Dakotans. Popular species of game include pheasants, white-tailed deer, mule deer, and turkeys, as well as waterfowl such as Canada geese, snow geese, and mallards. Targets of anglers include walleye in the eastern glacial lakes and Missouri River reservoirs, <b>Chinook</b> <b>salmon</b> in Lake Oahe, and trout in the Black Hills.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the United States {{government}} {{listed the}} southern resident community as an endangered population under the Endangered Species Act. This community comprises three pods which live {{mostly in the}} Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in {{the population in the}} past ten years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in <b>Chinook</b> <b>salmon.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Alsea River {{supports}} runs of <b>chinook</b> and coho <b>salmon,</b> {{as well as}} steelhead {{and coastal}} cutthroat trout. The Alsea River Fish Hatchery is along one of its tributaries, the North Fork Alsea River.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other {{proposed}} reservoir {{projects in}} California, Sites would not directly affect fish migration {{because it is}} not located on a major river, and could be a source of additional cold water for fall-run <b>chinook</b> and coho <b>salmon.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Alaskan {{economical}} salmonoid {{fish species}} (Oncorhynchus) are main {{food for the}} Yup'ik: Sockeye or Red salmon (sayak), Chum or Dog <b>salmon</b> (kangitneq), <b>Chinook</b> or King <b>salmon</b> (taryaqvak), Coho or Silver salmon (qakiiyaq), Pink or Humpback salmon (amaqaayak).|$|R
5|$|Species {{diversity}} is greatest along the lower river and its tributaries. Threatened, endangered, or sensitive species include spring <b>Chinook</b> <b>salmon,</b> winter steelhead, chum salmon, Coho salmon and Oregon chub. In the central valley, several {{projects have been}} done to restore and protect wetlands {{in order to provide}} habitat for bald eagles, Fender's blue butterfly (of which 6,000 remain), Oregon chub, Bradshaw's desert parsley, a variety of Willamette fleabane, and Kincaid's lupine. In the early 21stcentury, osprey populations are increasing along the river, possibly because of a ban on the pesticide DDT and on the birds' ability to use power poles for nesting. Beaver populations, presumed to be much lower than historic levels, are increasing throughout the basin.|$|E
5|$|Irrigation {{with water}} from the Merced River {{continued}} to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the river, some , was under cultivation. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley was {{to such an extent}} that many of the rivers ran dry in sections. Upriver of the Merced River confluence with the San Joaquin, the latter river was usually dry, only regaining flow where the Merced River enters. In the mid-20th century, the flow in the Merced River diminished to such a degree that very few salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced River. In 1991, a fish hatchery, the Merced River Hatchery, was built beside the Merced River just downstream of the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, the lowermost Merced River dam. Fall <b>chinook</b> <b>salmon</b> travel up a fish ladder into the hatchery's pools, which are supplied with water diverted from the Merced River.|$|E
5|$|The John Day River, which {{passes through}} the Sheep Rock Unit, is the longest undammed {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, although two Columbia River dams below the John Day River mouth impede migratory fish travel to some degree. <b>Chinook</b> <b>salmon</b> and steelhead pass through the monument {{on their way to}} and from upstream spawning beds and the Pacific Ocean. Species observed at the Sheep Rock Unit also include those able to tolerate warm summer river temperatures: bridgelip suckers, northern pikeminnow, redside shiners, and smallmouth bass. From October through June, when the water is cooler, Columbia River redband trout and sculpin are among species that move downriver through the park. The Park Service has removed or replaced irrigation diversions along the river or Rock Creek that formerly impeded fish movement, and it is restoring riparian vegetation such as black cottonwood trees that shade the water in summer and provide habitat for aquatic insects.|$|E
50|$|Efforts {{are being}} made to restore the river and to prevent the {{extinction}} of its <b>Chinook</b> and Coho <b>salmon</b> run. The Nature Conservancy has purchased two ranches in the watershed in hope of restoring riparian habitat for anadromous fish.|$|R
50|$|The East Fork {{supports}} {{populations of}} cutthroat trout, steelhead, and <b>Chinook</b> and coho <b>salmon.</b> Frona Park has a steelhead acclimation pond along Hantz Creek. Only finclipped steelhead may be caught and kept, {{and the river}} is closed to coho fishing.|$|R
