500|$|Cicuta, {{commonly}} known as water hemlock, is a small genus of four species of highly poisonous plants in the family Apiaceae. They are perennial herbaceous plants which grow up to [...] tall, having distinctive small green or white flowers arranged in an umbrella shape (umbel). Plants in this genus may also {{be referred to as}} <b>cowbane</b> or poison parsnip. Cicuta is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, mainly North America and Europe, typically growing in wet meadows, along streambanks and other wet and marshy areas. These plants bear a close resemblance to other members in the family Apiaceae and may be confused with a number of other edible and poisonous plants. The common name hemlock may also be confused with poison hemlock (Conium maculatum).|$|E
50|$|Oxypolis rigidior, {{also known}} as <b>cowbane,</b> pig-potato, or stiff <b>cowbane,</b> is a {{poisonous}} species of flowering plant in the celery, carrot, or parsley family native to eastern North America. <b>Cowbane</b> is a perennial wildflower found in wet habitats.|$|E

5000|$|The {{variable}} leaf shape {{may make}} identification challenging. Water hemlock, a related very poisonous species, which sometimes even shares the common name [...] "cowbane", is similar, {{as is the}} closely related Savanna <b>cowbane</b> (Oxypolis ternata).|$|E
50|$|Kestrel, Reed Bunting, Water Rail, Robin, Starling, Snipe, Mallard, and Swans {{have been}} {{recorded}} here. Rare species are Carex aquatilis, Brown edge (Carex disticha), <b>Cowbane</b> (Cicuta virosa), White water lily (Nymphaea alba), Ivy-leaved water crowfoot (Ranunculus hederaceus), and Bay willow (salix pentandra).|$|E
50|$|Oxypolis filiformis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the carrot family known by the common names water <b>cowbane</b> and water dropwort. It grows in swamps, freshwater wetlands, and along the borders of ponds in the southeastern United States, {{as far north as}} Delaware, as well as the northern Bahamian pineyards of the Bahamas.|$|E
50|$|The red-listed Myrica gale, {{which is}} on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species, grows on the pond embankments. Other plants that grow here, {{including}} some protected species, are the: white water-lily, downy birch, water soldier, woody nightshade, flatleaf bladderwort, small bur-reed, tufted loosestrife, sneezewort, branched bur-reed, <b>cowbane</b> (very poisonous), six-stamened waterwort, yellow flag, Eupatorium.|$|E
50|$|The flora is also diverse, {{and more}} than 160 plant species are known in the area. The {{dominant}} plant on the islands between the main flow and branches is reeds, forming extensive reed beds. Other typical plants from the area include Rumex aquaticus, yellow iris, celery-leaved buttercup, sweet flag, <b>cowbane,</b> common bulrush, willow, and common aspen.|$|E
50|$|Herbivory:  It {{well-known}} that caterpillars feed on plants, {{flowers and}} fruits. However, many noctuids {{have a particular}} interest for toxic plants because {{they are able to}} withstand the chemical defenses of plants, {{as in the case of}} the Splendid brocade (Lacanobia splendens) which is capable of feeding on <b>Cowbane</b> (Cicuta virosa), one of the most poisonous plant on the world.|$|E
50|$|Loch Libo is {{the best}} example of a {{eutrophic}} in East Renfrewshire with aquatic and emergent vegetation. Significant plants include the Nationally Scarce <b>cowbane</b> Cicuta virosa and the locally uncommon greater tussock sedge Carex paniculata and lesser pond sedge Carex acutiformis. The nationally uncommon species lesser tussock sedge Carex diandra, water sedge Carex aquatilis, slender tufted sedge Carex acuta and water parsnip Berula erecta are also present.|$|E
50|$|Nearly 400 {{vascular}} {{plants have}} been recorded at the Reserve, which is around 25% of the species found in Britain. There are also a number of rare plants found at the Reserve, including elongated sedge, six-stamened waterwort, <b>cowbane,</b> summer snowflake and mudwort. More details about {{the flora and fauna}} of Loch Lomond NNR can be found in SNH's Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve Story.|$|E
50|$|The loch is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) since 1975 {{and many}} {{interesting}} plant species, including Greater Bladderwort, Lesser Pond Sedge, Tufted Loosestrife, and the nationally rare <b>Cowbane</b> have been recorded. Breeding birds include Snipe, Water Rail, Grasshopper Warbler, and Reed Bunting. The countryside around Ashgrove Loch is amongst the richest in the area; the fields attract flocks of Chaffinch, Reed Bunting, Yellowhammer, and Tree Sparrow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cowbane</b> Prairie Natural Area Preserve is a 63 acre Natural Area Preserve {{located in}} Augusta County, Virginia, {{along the western}} slope of the Blue Ridge in the Shenandoah Valley. It {{preserves}} both mesic and wet prairie habitats, {{as well as a}} calcareous spring-fed marsh; these areas contain eleven regionally rare rare plants such as queen-of-the-prairie, blueflag iris, and marsh-speedwell. Although common in the Midwest, these plants occur only at a handful of sites in Virginia.|$|E
50|$|Oxypolis canbyi is a {{rare species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the carrot family known by the common names Canby's dropwort and Canby's <b>cowbane.</b> It is native to the southeastern United States, where it occurs on the Atlantic coastal plain from North Carolina to Georgia, {{as well as the}} Chesapeake Bay area. It is threatened by the loss of the wetland habitat in which it grows. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.|$|E
50|$|In nutrient-poor to {{moderately}} nutrient-rich, acidic waterbodies, floating mats {{form out of}} peat mosses, (feathery bogmoss Sphagnum cuspidatum, {{species of}} the complex Sphagnum recurvum s.l.) or brown mosses (Scorpidium scorpioides). Furthermore, floating mats are colonised by characteristic species of the small sedges such as the bog sedge (Carex limosa), (Carex rostrata), beak sedge (Rhynchospora ssp.), Rannoch-rush (Scheuchzeria palustris) and marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris). The edges of nutrient-rich waterbodies are colonised by reeds (Phragmites australis), bulrushes (Typha ssp.), hop sedge (Carex pseudocyperus) and <b>cowbane</b> (Circuta virosa). Floating mats are habitats for shelly amoeba such as Amphitrema sp. and lake fly larvae.|$|E
50|$|Oxypolis occidentalis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the carrot family known by the common name western <b>cowbane.</b> It is native to sections of western North America, where it grows in forests and other habitat. It is a perennial herb growing from tubers and producing erect, branching stems up to 1.5 meters tall. The leaf has a blade up to 30 centimeters long which is divided into many toothed, lobed, or deeply cut leaflets. The blade is borne on a long petiole, with upper leaves having larger petioles than basal. The inflorescence is a dense compound umbel of many small white flowers.|$|E
50|$|The rushing water carves out small {{depressions}} where soil accumulates, forming micro-islands {{that play}} host to plants that thrive {{with low levels of}} nutrients and shallow root structures. Typical species include Sphagnum moss; carnivorous plants such as round-leaf sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea and S. jonesii), and horned bladderwort (Utricularia cornuta); several orchid species such as common grass pink (Calopogon tuberosus), small green wood-orchid (Platanthera clavellata), rose pogonia (Pogonia ophioglossoides), and nodding ladies’-tresses (Spiranthes cernua). Other plants found in cataract bogs are limeseep grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia grandifolia), Indian paint brush (Castilleja coccinea), stiff <b>cowbane</b> (Oxypolis rigidior), Appalachian bluet (Houstonia serpyllifolia) and northern sundrops (Oenothera tetragona).|$|E

50|$|She {{lives in}} the village of Carsely, but her detective agency Raisin Investigations and the police {{headquarters}} where Bill Wong is based are in the nearby town of Mircester. Even though Carsely and Mircester are fictional, they are based on true places; she does, however frequent Evesham, Moreton-in-Marsh, Stow-on-the-Wold, Chipping Campden and other nearby villages quite often. Agatha's first case came when she first moved to Carsely and heard about a quiche competition. She promptly bought a spinach quiche in London from a famous quiche shop and entered it as her own. She was outraged she did not win but later the judge, Reg Cummings-Browne, took another slice and died from <b>cowbane</b> poisoning. Frustrated, Agatha set out to find the poisoner and clear her own name.|$|E
50|$|Cicuta maculata is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the carrot family known by several common names, including spotted water hemlock, spotted parsley, spotted <b>cowbane,</b> and the suicide root by the Iroquois. It is native to nearly all of North America, from northern Canada to southern Mexico. This is a rhizomatous perennial herb producing a hollow erect stem to a maximum height between 1 and 1.5 meters. The long leaves {{are made up of}} several lance-shaped, pointed, serrated leaflets. Each shiny green leaflet is 2 to 10 centimeters long and the entire leaf may be up to 40 centimeters long. The inflorescence of white flowers is similar in appearance to many other species in the carrot family. It is a compound umbel with many clusters of flowers. The dry tan-brown fruit is a few millimeters long.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site is a}} {{designated}} Local Wildlife Site following a survey in 1981 by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and others. The survey recorded that the site is a Phragmites dominated area with open water. The surveyors record that [...] "The loch is surrounded {{to a great extent}} by bed of reed canary grass with a dense zone of the sedge Carex aquatilis. There is a good admixture of marsh species, and an admixture of willow (Salix) species in the north-east section. In the surrounding fields there is an interesting interaction between the field ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) and the marsh ragwort (Senecio aquaticus), giving rise to a substantial amount of the hybrid Senecio x osterfeldii. There is a good floristic structure at the site and it is also of real importance due to the presence of the very rare <b>Cowbane</b> (Cicuta virosa).|$|E
50|$|Cicuta virosa (<b>cowbane</b> or {{northern}} water hemlock) is {{a species}} of Cicuta, native to northern and central Europe, northern Asia and northwestern North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant which grows up to 1-2 m tall. The stems are smooth, branching, swollen at the base, purple-striped, and hollow except for partitions at the junction of the leaves and stem. In cross section the stems have one flat side and the other sides are rounded. The leaves are alternate, tripinnate, only coarsely toothed, unlike the ferny, lacy leaves found in many {{other members of the}} family Apiaceae. The flowers are small, white and clustered in umbrella shaped inflorescences typical of the family. The many flowered umbellets have unequal pedicels that range from 5 to 11 cm long during fruiting. An oily, yellow liquid oozes from cuts to the stems and roots. This liquid has a rank smell resembling that of parsnips or carrots. The plant may be mistaken for parsnip due to its clusters of white tuberous roots.|$|E
50|$|The water parsnip (swamp parsnip, Sium suave), western water hemlock (Cicuta douglasii, poison hemlock) {{and spotted}} water hemlock (Cicuta maculata, spotted parsley, spotted <b>cowbane)</b> all have white flowers in large {{compound}} umbels, {{which can lead}} to misidentification. All water hemlock and poison hemlock are highly poisonous, but water parsnip is not. Both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Water parsnip has leaves only once compound, and water hemlock has leaves which are three times compound. Water hemlock has a large swelling at the stem base, and has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster, not {{at the base of the}} main flower head. The Water parsnip has small bracts at the base of flowers and main flower head as well. Yarrow from the Asteraceae family (Achillea millefolium) also has many small white flowers in a cluster. However the yarrow has feathery looking leaves which are pinnately separated into small narrow segments. The cow parsnips (Heracleum lanatum, Heracleum maximum) are also confused in this group with similar flower groupings. However, the cow parsnips have large, broad leaves, and an unpleasant odour.|$|E
5000|$|The National Audubon Society {{considers}} Lewis Ocean Bay Heritage Preserve [...] "a {{place of}} birding significance." [...] It includes black bears, red-cockaded woodpeckers, and orchids. It {{is one of}} the few places to find Venus flytrap growing naturally, and Coastal Carolina University biology professor James Luken predicted that in South Carolina, where the species once was found in four counties, the Venus flytrap could soon be found only in the preserve. In the bays themselves, which dry up in the summer, are blueberry, huckleberry, fetterbush and zenobia, along with sweetbay, catbriar, gallberry, titi. pinweed, <b>cowbane,</b> bearded grass pink, buckeye, and balduina. Surrounding the bays are shrub bogs called pocosins with pond pine and loblolly pine. [...] Other plants include mulberry bushes, wax myrtle bushes, and the pitcher plant. Other animal life includes bald eagles, raccoons, foxes, squirrels, and quail. Longleaf pine savannas can be found between the bays, though slash pine has been planted. Dwarf live oak and turkey oak are also found. Pottery provides evidence of Native American campsites. Biologist Steve Bennett said the people who camped here hunted deer, which are still hunted today.|$|E
40|$|The irequent {{poisoning}} {{from eating}} {{the root of}} <b>Cowbane</b> (CicIda maeulata, L) are not infrequent {{in the state of}} Iowa and elsewhere. It affects man, cattle and horses. Every now and then, there are accounts of poisoning from “wild parsnips” in our papers. The writer has at various times received communications with specimens of “wild parsnips. ” The subject is of considerable interest and especially so because the plant is widely distributed in Iowa and {{a large number of people}} are not aware of the poisonous nature of the root.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the content of Ni in {{fractions}} of 1. 0 – 0. 2 mm, 0. 2 – 0. 1 mm, 0. 1 – 0. 063 mm, 0. 063 – 0. 02 mm, and Typha latifolia), yellow water lilies (Nuphar lutea), and <b>cowbane</b> (Cicuta virosa). Nickel content in bottom sediment was slightly higher than the geochemical background. The largest amounts of Ni were associated with the finest fraction, while the smallest with the thickest fraction. The highest content of this element was recorded at the point Ełk Barany, which was connected with developing industry in the city of Ełk. All of the tested plants showed greater Ni contents than the amount naturally occurring in plants. In most cases, most of Ni was associated with plant roots, and the least with leaves. It has been proven that aquatic plants can be good indicators of the aquatic environment status...|$|E
40|$|During {{the year}} the Department of Botany {{receives}} a great many requests {{for information on the}} subject of weeds. These requests come {{from all parts of the}} state. Many different kinds of plants are sent in. Some of course, more frequently than others. The writer at different times has given accounts of weeds in the Experiment Station Bulletins. Most of these bulletins are now out of print. It seems advisable, therefore, to re-issue a limited edition to supply the demand for information on this topic. In addition to this we have given a somewhat comprehensive account of the migration of weeds and the dissemination of plants. We have likewise included an account of some poisonous plants, inasmuch as several cases of poisoning from <b>Cowbane</b> occurred during the present spring season. It is our purpose later to publish a more extended account of weeds, especially on many points pertaining to the vitality of weed seeds, their extermination, distribution, etc. In order to answer some of the many queries this bulletin is published...|$|E
