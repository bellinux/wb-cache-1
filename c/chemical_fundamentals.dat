30|$|The PE-CVD process uses {{hydrogen}} and methane as reaction gases as is typically done in thermal CVD {{process for the}} deposition of Graphene as well as diamond. The <b>chemical</b> <b>fundamentals</b> of the synthesis of Graphene {{are based on a}} physisorption process of {{hydrogen and}} a consecutive chemisorption process of methane (Zhang et al. 2011). Physically adsorbed H 2 molecules decompose due to the high temperature on the copper surface. Consecutively chemisorption of methane molecules results in carbon species bonded to the top layered copper atoms, which become successively dehydrogenized and eventually building the graphene’s honeycomb pattern. Due to the catalytic influence of copper and the minor solubility of carbon in copper, this leads to the growth of monolayer graphene. The graphene growth process is self-limiting and therefore basically stops after the growth of a monolayer (Li et al. 2009).|$|E

40|$|Dr. Will Lynch, a Professor of Chemistry at Armstrong Atlantic State University, {{presented}} a lecture at the Nano@Tech Meeting on February 9, 2009 at 12 noon in room 102 of the MiRC building. Runtime: 48 : 29 minutesChemistry occupies a unique {{place in the}} university curriculum and is required by {{a wide variety of}} other disciplines because of its general utility. Unfortunately, the laboratory portion of the course does not always reflect the diversity and excitement of new research in and interesting applications of chemistry since the laboratory experience is designed to help the student master fundamental concepts. At Armstrong Atlantic State University (AASU) we are attacking this problem with the implementation of two series of nanotechnology based “vertical threads” throughout our chemistry curriculum. The vertical threads begin in the freshman year and provide continuity {{throughout the rest of the}} curriculum. Experiments direct the student’s attention towards modern applications of chemical technology while providing <b>chemical</b> <b>fundamentals</b> expected in traditional laboratory exercises. By seeing these recurring threads at ever increasing levels of complexity, students build upon knowledge gained about nanotechnology with each additional laboratory course. We have concentrated our efforts in two areas: magnetite nanoparticles and chalcogenide nanoparticles. Magnetite nanoparticles are prepared by freshmen students while more advanced students modify these nanoparticles for real-world applications. Chalcogenide nanoparticles are synthesized by junior and senior level students and their spectroscopic properties are studied. Senior and undergraduate research students are involved in green synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles as well as the use of ZnS, CdS and ceria nanoparticles for photocatalysis applications. The upper division students learn numerous instrumental techniques within the context of nanotechnology. All students are presented with pre-laboratory and background materials that address the needs for new materials, new techniques for biomedical analysis and drug delivery, as well as the environmental impacts of nanotechnology...|$|E

40|$|The {{efforts for}} a {{reduction}} of the CO 2 exhaust und the development and enhancement of technologies, which are not state-of-the-art for the power plant industry of today, is a challenge not only for plant operators and planners, but also for developers of software tools used for planning, design and supervision of power plants. Using {{the example of the}} power plant simulation system „Ebsilon Professional“, which is established in the market for 15 years, it is demonstrated which requirements are applied to such a program and how Ebsilon is meeting these requirements. We had to consider two aspects: Firstly, standard components were developed to allow modelling cycles in the familiar simple way. Additionally, a platform for the integration of actual results of research and for experiments with the software is needed. This was implemented by a graduated concept from user-adaptable macros up to freely programmable components. 1. Why Cycle Calculations? The different approaches for a CO 2 reduction are based on the integration of new technologies and standard technologies where much experience is available. To evaluate the benefit of such a plant {{it is important to consider}} the total performance of all components together. With a reliable cycle calculation, it is possible to examine the influence of different topological variations and different parameters like temperatures and pressures on physical quantities and performance factors. Even though the CO 2 reduction is the major target, it is reasonable to perform an optimization with regard to efficiencies and costs as well. 2. Demands on Simulation Tools for New Technologies A simulation tool must be able to emulate the phenomenological behaviour of all components in order to achieve results which are close to the behaviour of the real plant. Even if the detailed component behaviour is not already known, the simulation tool is able to consider physical (and <b>chemical)</b> <b>fundamentals</b> like...|$|E

40|$|Research and {{development}} {{in the field of}} superconductivity and superconducting materials {{is an essential part of}} our activities and covers the range from the physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>fundamentals</b> of superconductivity to the materials development for applications in the area of electrical engineering and contact-less magnetically levitated transport systems as well as the construction of demonstrators in these fields, providing substantial contributions in the forefront of these research directions. The search for new classes of superconducting compounds and for unconventional forms of superconductivity is still a highly topical subject of research internationally. It turned out that several recently found superconductors, in particular the borocarbides and MgB 2, are in the clean limit putting a major task on theory in the IFW to develop the Eliashberg theory for the clean limit. This very demanding and versatile task is based on the density functional theory of the electronic structure. For the recently discovered superconductor MgCNi 3 we could prove the presence of both strong electron-phonon coupling and a considerable pair breaking by specific heat measurements and electronic structure calculations. New aspects of the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism of borocarbides were found due to the ability to prepare both high-quality single crystals by a floating zone growth technique with optical heating and thin films by PLD. Further compounds investigated both by experiments and theory were NaxCoO 2 * y H 2 O and PuCoGa 5. For the latter system, it seems to be reasonable to speculate that an unconventional pairing mechanism is responsible for superconductivity. Aiming at different fields of applications, we continued the development of MgB 2 tapes, BSCCO/Ag tapes, YBCO tapes and melt-textured YBCO bulk material. MgB 2 powder was prepared by mechanical alloying from the elements and used as precursor material for compacted bulk samples and tapes. The latter showed high critical currents up to 35 kA/cm 2 at 4. 2 K and 7. 5 T. The work on YBCO CC (coated conductors) concentrated on the RABiTS approach where a biaxially textured metal tape is used as a substrate for the epitaxial growth of buffer layers and YBCO films. Achievements were made in optimizing and understanding the materials science of the textured substrates. Usin...|$|E

40|$|Sweeping {{globalization}} {{has resulted in}} unparalleled economic growth, including increased international trade of hazardous <b>chemicals.</b> <b>Fundamental</b> differences between nations trading these materials, including language, literacy rates, cultural values, and technical and governmental infrastructures has created an urgent need for a common system of risk communication to reduce the occurrence of deaths and serious injuries that result from unintended chemical exposures. To accomplish this goal, the United Nations (UN) created the Globally Harmonized System for the Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) in 1992. Unfortunately, there was no requirement for testing of the GHS labeling components, including pictograms intended to depict specific hazards, before their deployment. In Experiment 1, twenty GHS hazard pictograms were subjected to comprehension testing in two non-student samples from the U. S. and Brazil, respectively. In Experiment 2, alternatives for five of the GHS pictograms that were least well understood were created and then re-tested for comprehension. Several of the new pictograms outperformed their “original ” GHS counterparts in terms of comprehension and participant preference. Overall, the results of testing showed {{that only a small}} portion of the original GHS hazard pictograms reached acceptable levels of comprehension. Therefore, additional systematic work is needed to develop GHS pictogram alternatives that effectively convey safety hazards to a global audience...|$|R
