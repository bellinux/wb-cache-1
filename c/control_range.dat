2500|$|Mark III (Referred to as [...] "All New War" [...] by Privateer Press) {{is another}} {{reworking}} of the game. As with MK II all models and point levels of army lists have been updated.

Also guidelines for terrain have been changed and Privateer Press has begun the Community Integrated Development or CID process to involve players {{in the development of}} errata, new releases, and theme forces as a quality control mechanism in what they are calling a [...] "continuous development" [...] goal. The idea of this process is to avoid new version releases following Mark 3. As a result, all model cards and the base rules set are available on the Privateer Press website.|$|E

Coupled with other aerodynamic moments associated with lift/drag and thrust/weight coupling, the aircraft pitched down and remained in a nose low attitude. The aircraft then commenced a roll to the left most likely due to the asymmetric drag effects of the different propeller pitch angles. The left propeller then went to full reverse whilst the right propeller remained in positive pitch within the ground <b>control</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E

40|$|IEEE 802. 15. 4 a Ultra Wideband Impulse Radio (UWB-IR) {{measures}} the distance using the time-of-arrival (TOA) {{of the leading}} path signal. Multipath propagation in indoor environments can adversely affect the {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) resulting errors in leading path detection. In this paper, the multipath effects mitigation is in focus and method for bilateral transmitter power control. Measurements for SNR status of the 802. 15. 4 a UWB-IR propagation in indoor buildings are reported. Relevant aspects of power control are discussed on practical issues, using an automatic control framework, which is integrated into the symmetric double-sided two-way (SDS-TW) ranging protocol. We evaluate the resulting performance and compare with existing non-power control techniques in Line-of-Sight (LOS) condition. Experimental results show that, with power <b>control,</b> <b>ranging</b> error below sub 10 cm occurs in more than 90 % of the 4800 measurements from 2. 5 m to 30 m; without power <b>control,</b> <b>ranging</b> error below sub 10 cm occurs in less than 20 %. The use of transmitter power <b>controlled</b> <b>ranging</b> method is capable of mitigating the uncertain multipath effects, improving the ranging accuracy and stability in indoor multipath environments...|$|R
50|$|During {{his fight}} with Ryan Bader, Joe Rogan {{mentioned}} that Machida's karate style meant his fighting distance and range {{is at least}} a foot farther than a typical boxer or Muay Thai fighter.
