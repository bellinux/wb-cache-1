When hydrogen pressure-confinement vessel is taken into account, an advantage in energy storage by weight can also be realized. The volumetric energy density of methanol is considerably higher than liquid hydrogen, {{in part because of}} the low density of liquid hydrogen of 71 grams/litre. Hence there is actually more hydrogen in a litre of methanol (99 grams/litre) than in a litre of liquid hydrogen, and methanol needs no <b>cryogenic</b> <b>container</b> maintained at a temperature of -253 °C [...]|$|E

40|$|The work {{presents}} {{issues with}} the structure and thermal calculations of mobile tank for transport and storage of LNG. A modern design of <b>cryogenic</b> tank <b>container</b> and stationery <b>cryogenic</b> tank {{is presented in the}} paper. Mobile <b>cryogenics</b> <b>container</b> tank has been designed for transportation of LNG as well as other liquefied cryogenic gases with the temperature down to – 196 °C. The analysis included two types of logistics solutions: one involving the transport full container, which is removable from the vehicle and left in the workplace, and the second solution with reloading from mobile tank into simplified container tank or other mobile tank located in the workplace. Simplified container tank and mobile tank have been designed to storage some cryogenics gases as well as mobile container but without transportation of them. Modern and effective insulation materials were applied in the tank structure. Therefore, the liquefied cryogenic gases can be stored for a long time periods. Presented are selected depending on the extent of heat exchange in cryogenic conditions, as well as a model for FEM calculations of thermal insulation inside the tank and supports. Simulation results show the long storage times obtained for a simplified container which are close to the times obtained by stationary tanks, however a lot easier to transport without charge. Presented solutions and results of simulations may indicate, that depending on the requirements and considering manufacturing costs and operational conditions, the proper variant of the tank can be chosen...|$|R

The seeds were stored in <b>cryogenic</b> <b>containers</b> filled with liquid and vaporized nitrogen. Evaluation parameters were the seed germination and the plantlet vigor 14 days after sowing.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the incidence of fungi in stored seeds of Jatropha curcas. The research was carried out at Cryogenic/UFCG, Sanity/UFPB and Cotton/Embrapa. The material for analysis showed an 8 % water level, and 200 seeds were stored for treatment in <b>cryogenic</b> <b>containers</b> with nitrogen in the vapor and liquid phases. Four periods of crioconservation (0, 30, 60 and 90 days), were employed. After each period, the seeds were tested for sanity (Blotter test) and germination. Superficial disinfestation, was carried out and seeds were distributed in Petri dishes, for incubation at 25 ± 2 ºC, {{over a period of}} 7 days. The evaluation of the incidence of fungi was carried out in a stereoscopic microscope with observation of fungal structures, and values were expressed as percentages of seeds with fungus. The statistical experiment was completely randomized with temperature x days of storage. Analysis of variance was conducted and the means were compared by Tukey’s test at 5 %. After 30 days of cryogenic storage, a greater incidence of Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp. and Fusarium sp. was detected.

50|$|However, {{since these}} methods of {{hydrogen}} production are often energy and space intensive, {{it is often}} more convenient to use the chemicals directly in the fuel cell.

Although DMFC's are not very efficient (~25%), they are energy dense {{which means that they}} are quite suitable for portable power applications. Another advantage over gaseous fuels, as in the H2-O2 cells, is that liquids are much easier to handle, transport, pump and often have higher specific energies allowing for greater power extraction.

40|$|Liquid {{hydrogen}} and oxygen are used as the oxidizer and fuel for liquid rocket engines. Liquefied natural gas, {{which is based on}} methane, is seen as a promising motor fuel for internal combustion engines. One of the technical problems arising from the use of said cryogenic liquid is to provide containers for storage, transport and use in the propulsion system. In the design and operation of such vessels it is necessary to have reliable information about their temperature condition, on which depend the loss of cryogenic fluids due to evaporation and the stress-strain state of the structural elements of the containers. Uneven temperature distribution along the generatrix of the cylindrical thin-walled shell of rocket cryogenic tanks, in a localized zone of cryogenic liquid level leads to a curvature of the shell and reduce the permissible axle load in a hazard shell buckling in the preparation {{for the start of the}} missile in flight with an increasing acceleration. Moving the level of the cryogenic liquid during filling or emptying the tank at a certain combination of parameters results in an increase of the local temperature distribution nonuniformity. Along with experimental study of the shell temperature state of the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>container,</b> methods of mathematical modeling allow to have information needed for designing and testing the construction of cryogenic tanks. In this study a mathematical model is built taking into account features of heat transfer in a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>container,</b> including the boiling cryogenic liquid in the inner surface of the container. This mathematical model describes the temperature state of the thin-walled shell of cylindrical cryogenic tank during filling and emptying. The work also presents a quantitative analysis of this model in case of fixed liquid level, its movement at a constant speed, and harmonic oscillations relative to a middle position. The quantitative analysis of this model has allowed to find the limit options for quasi-stationary temperature distribution along the shell generatrix in the moving coordinate system with an increase in the rate of filling or emptying the tank. Solution of a non-stationary heat conduction problem in moving coordinate system for unwetted part of the shell containers by the integral Laplace transform method is used to estimate the time required to define a quasi-stationary temperature distribution in this part of the shell. </p...|$|E

40|$|Basic {{research}} on advanced plasma-based propulsion systems is routinely focused on plasmadynamics, performance, and efficiency aspects while relegating {{the development of}} critical enabling technologies, such as flight-weight magnets, to follow-on development work. Unfortunately, the low technology readiness levels (TRLs) associated with critical enabling technologies tend {{to be perceived as}} an indicator of high technical risk, and this, in turn, hampers the acceptance of advanced system architectures for flight development. Consequently, there is growing recognition that applied {{research on}} the critical enabling technologies needs to be conducted hand in hand with basic research activities. The development of flight-weight magnet technology, for example, is one area of applied research having broad crosscutting applications to a number of advanced propulsion system architectures. Therefore, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Louisiana State University (LSU), and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) have initiated an applied research project aimed at advancing the TRL of flight-weight magnets. This Technical Publication reports on the group's initial effort to demonstrate the feasibility of cryogenic high-purity aluminum magnet technology and describes the design, construction, and testing of a 6 -in-diameter by 12 -in-long aluminum solenoid magnet. The coil was constructed in the machine shop of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at LSU and testing was conducted in NHMFL facilities at Florida State University and at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
