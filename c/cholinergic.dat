5|$|The oldest, {{on which}} most {{currently}} available drug therapies are based, is the <b>cholinergic</b> hypothesis, which proposes that AD {{is caused by}} reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The <b>cholinergic</b> hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other <b>cholinergic</b> effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid, leading to generalised neuroinflammation.|$|E
5|$|Fly agarics {{are known}} for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount {{ingested}} per body weight, effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, <b>cholinergic</b> crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the <b>cholinergic</b> neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of <b>cholinergic</b> neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to <b>cholinergic</b> excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E
5|$|Below and {{in front}} of the {{striatum}} are a number of basal forebrain structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major <b>cholinergic</b> output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{some plants}} use fatty acid derivates, amino acids and even {{peptides}} as defenses. The <b>cholinergic</b> toxine, cicutoxin of water hemlock, is a polyyne {{derived from the}} fatty acid metabolism. β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid as simple amino acid {{is used by the}} sweet pea which leads also to intoxication in humans. The synthesis of fluoroacetate in several plants {{is an example of the}} use of small molecules to disrupt the metabolism of herbivores, in this case the citric acid cycle.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers project {{directly}} to the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei. Climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals {{directly to}} the deep nuclei. The mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and <b>cholinergic</b> inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had central nervous system manifestations and <b>cholinergic</b> symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, <b>cholinergic</b> agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphous light {{eruption}} (PMLE) is {{the easiest}} disease to mistake for solar urticaria because {{the locations of the}} lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. Lupus erythematosus has been mistaken for SU; however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have erythropoietic protoporphyria. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, <b>cholinergic</b> urticaria, or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} nervous system nicotinic <b>cholinergic</b> signals are {{extended}} throughout the system, where the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) {{plays a key}} role in activating ligand-gated ion channels. The <b>cholinergic</b> system is a vital nervous pathway, where <b>cholinergic</b> neurons synthesize, store and release the neurotransmitter ACh. The main receptors that convert the ACh messages are the <b>cholinergic</b> muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, neuronal and muscular nAChRs. When looking back at evolutionary history, ACh is considered to be the oldest transmitter molecule and became present before the nervous cell. In the nervous system <b>cholinergic</b> stimulation mediated through nAChRs controls pathways such as release of transmitters and cell sensitivity, which can influence physiological activity including sleep, anxiety, processing of pain and cognitive functions.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been shown that, while {{stimulating}} muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> receptors in cultured pheochromocytoma cells increases HCN production, in a living organism (in vivo) muscarinic <b>cholinergic</b> stimulation actually decreases HCN production.|$|E
25|$|Acetylcholine is {{synthesized}} {{in certain}} neurons by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase from the compounds choline and acetyl-CoA. <b>Cholinergic</b> neurons {{are capable of}} producing ACh. An example of a central <b>cholinergic</b> area is the nucleus basalis of Meynert in the basal forebrain.|$|E
25|$|Androgen might (indirectly) block {{melatonin}} receptors, {{possibly by}} mean of vasodilation, and cause <b>cholinergic</b> abnormalities in some cases of Kleine–Levin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Bethanechol {{can also}} be used to treat {{megacolon}} by means of its direct <b>cholinergic</b> action and its stimulation of muscarinic receptors which bring about a parasympathetic like effect.|$|E
25|$|Schizophrenia: Intractable {{schizophrenic}} {{patients have}} a significant increase (> 60%) {{in the number of}} PPN neurons and dysfunction of NO signaling involved in modulating <b>cholinergic</b> output of the ARAS.|$|E
25|$|Vulpian-Heidenhain-Sherrington phenomenon: Associated with Rudolf Peter Heinrich Heidenhain, Edmé Félix Alfred Vulpian, and Charles Scott Sherrington. Describes {{the slow}} {{contraction}} of denervated skeletal muscle by stimulating autonomic <b>cholinergic</b> fibres innervating its blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|Catalpol and a {{combination}} of acetyl-carnitine and propionyl-carnitine on 1:1 ratio also improves endogenous DHEA production and release due to direct <b>cholinergic</b> stimulation of CRH release and an increase of IGF-1 expression respectively.|$|E
25|$|Damage to the <b>cholinergic</b> (acetylcholine-producing) {{system in}} the brain {{has been shown to}} be {{associated}} with the memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease. ACh has also been shown to promote REM sleep.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{reserpine}} has {{a peripheral}} action {{in many parts}} of the body, resulting in a preponderance of the effects of the <b>cholinergic</b> part of the autonomous nervous system on the GI tract, smooth muscles, blood vessels, etc.|$|E
25|$|Choline and its {{metabolites}} {{are needed}} for three main physiological purposes: structural integrity and signaling roles for cell membranes, <b>cholinergic</b> neurotransmission (acetylcholine synthesis), and a major source for methyl groups via its metabolite, trimethylglycine (betaine), which participates in the S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) synthesis pathways.|$|E
25|$|Doses {{in excess}} of 3mg daily often {{required}} use of an anticholinergic drug to combat excessive <b>cholinergic</b> activity {{in many parts of}} the body as well as parkinsonism. For adjunctive treatment, doses are typically kept at or below 0.25mg twice a day.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine, {{like other}} xanthines, also {{acts as a}} {{phosphodiesterase}} inhibitor. As a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caffeine raises intracellular cAMP, activates protein kinase A, inhibits TNF-alpha and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. Caffeine also affects the <b>cholinergic</b> system where it inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.|$|E
25|$|Damage to {{the left}} {{hemisphere}} in patients results in a marked increase in depression. Valence asymmetry {{may be due to}} more <b>cholinergic</b> and dopaminergic on the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere being more noradrenergic. Patients with right hemisphere damage had reduced arousal response to painful stimuli.|$|E
25|$|A {{dysfunction}} of glutamatergic neurotransmission, manifested as neuronal excitotoxicity, is {{hypothesized to}} be involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Targeting the glutamatergic system, specifically NMDA receptors, offers a novel approach to treatment in view of the limited efficacy of existing drugs targeting the <b>cholinergic</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} {{may occur}} during gradual or particularly abrupt withdrawal of tricyclic antidepressant drugs. Possible symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, insomnia, headache, nervousness, anxiety, dizziness and worsening of psychiatric status. Differentiating between {{the return of}} the original psychiatric disorder and clomipramine withdrawal symptoms is important. Clomipramine withdrawal can be severe. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur in neonates when clomipramine is used during pregnancy. A major mechanism of withdrawal from tricyclic antidepressants is believed to be due to a rebound effect of excessive <b>cholinergic</b> activity due to neuroadaptations as a result of chronic inhibition of <b>cholinergic</b> receptors by tricyclic antidepressants. Restarting the antidepressant and slow tapering is the treatment of choice for tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal. Some withdrawal symptoms may respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} uses of carbon-11 choline in PET imaging was with Alzheimer's disease patients. Choline is the {{precursor}} to neurotransmitter acetylcholine whose <b>cholinergic</b> activity is impaired in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s. While there was uptake of the tracer in the brain, no pharmacokinetic pattern was found.|$|E
25|$|Abrupt {{withdrawal}} {{may lead}} to <b>cholinergic</b> rebound effects, severe movement disorders as well as severe psychotic decompensation. It has been recommended that patients, families, and caregivers {{are aware of the}} symptoms and risks of abrupt withdrawal of clozapine. When discontinuing clozapine, gradual dose reduction is recommended to reduce the intensity of withdrawal effects.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{atropine}} {{is used as}} a cycloplegic, {{to temporarily}} paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic mydriatic, whereas tropicamide (a shorter-acting <b>cholinergic</b> antagonist) or phenylephrine (an α-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to ophthalmic examination.|$|E
25|$|These toxins attack <b>cholinergic</b> neurons (those {{that use}} ACh as a transmitter) by {{destroying}} acetylcholinesterase (AChE). ACh therefore cannot {{be broken down}} and stays in the receptor. This causes tetany (involuntary muscle contraction), {{which can lead to}} death. The toxins have been called fasciculins since after injection into mice, they cause severe, generalized and long-lasting (5-7 h) fasciculations (rapid muscle contractions).|$|E
25|$|Biochemical {{mechanisms}} {{suggested as}} causative include increased serotonin, particularly affecting 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors; decreased dopamine; decreased norepinephrine; blockade of <b>cholinergic</b> and α1adrenergic receptors; inhibition of nitric oxide synthetase; and elevation of prolactin levels. Mirtazapine {{is reported to}} have fewer sexual side-effects, most likely because it antagonizes 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors and may, in some cases, reverse sexual dysfunction induced by SSRIs by the same mechanism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cholinergic</b> neurons—acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is {{released}} from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft. It {{acts as a}} ligand for both ligand-gated ion channels and metabotropic (GPCRs) muscarinic receptors. Nicotinic receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine. Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of Na+ depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} and distinctive clinical features of the disease is hypersensitivity to neuroleptic and antiemetic medications that affect dopaminergic and <b>cholinergic</b> systems. In the worst cases, a patient treated with these medications could become catatonic, lose cognitive function, or develop life-threatening muscle rigidity. Some commonly used medications that should be used with great caution, if at all, for people with DLB, are chlorpromazine, haloperidol, or thioridazine.|$|E
25|$|The {{ascending}} reticular activating system (ARAS), {{also known}} as the extrathalamic control modulatory system or simply the reticular activating system (RAS), is a set of connected nuclei in the brains of vertebrates that is responsible for regulating wakefulness and sleep-wake transitions. The ARAS {{is a part of the}} reticular formation and is mostly composed of various nuclei in the thalamus and a number of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, and <b>cholinergic</b> brain nuclei.|$|E
25|$|The human reticular {{formation}} {{is composed of}} almost 100 brain nuclei and contains many projections into the forebrain, brainstem, and cerebellum, among other regions. It includes the reticular nuclei, reticulothalamic projection fibers, diffuse thalamo-cortical projections, ascending <b>cholinergic</b> projections, descending non-cholinergic projections, and descending reticulospinal projections. The {{reticular formation}} also contains two major neural subsystems, the ascending reticular activating system and descending reticulospinal tracts, which mediate distinct cognitive and physiological proceses. It has been functionally cleaved both sagittally and coronally.|$|E
25|$|Acetylcholine (ACh) is {{an organic}} {{chemical}} that {{functions in the}} brain and body of many types of animals, including humans, as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other cells. Its name is derived from its chemical structure: it is an ester of acetic acid and choline. Parts in the body that use or are affected by acetylcholine are referred to as <b>cholinergic.</b> Substances that interfere with acetylcholine activity are called anticholinergics.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} {{will depend}} on the cause of memory loss, but various drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease have been suggested in recent years. There are four drugs currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, and they all act on the <b>cholinergic</b> system: Donepezil, Galantamine, Rivastigmine, and Tacrine. Although these medications are not the cure for Alzheimer’s, symptoms may be reduced for up to eighteen months for mild or moderate dementia. These drugs do not forestall the ultimate decline to full Alzheimer's.|$|E
