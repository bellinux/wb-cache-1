5|$|At the {{transport}} layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission <b>Control</b> <b>Protocol</b> (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is used {{when it is}} essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Congestion {{control for}} {{streamed}} media traffic over Internet {{is a challenge}} due to the sensitivity of such traffic towards oscillations {{in the rate of}} streaming.

This paper presents a discussion for the congestion <b>control</b> <b>protocols</b> categorization characteristics, elaborates the TCP-friendliness concept then a state-of-the-art for the unicast congestion <b>control</b> <b>protocols</b> designed for media traffic is presented.

25|$|Real-time {{multimedia}} streaming applications require timely {{delivery of}} information and often can tolerate some packet loss to achieve this goal.

The Transmission <b>Control</b> <b>Protocol</b> (TCP), although standardized for RTP use, is not normally used in RTP applications because TCP favors reliability over timeliness.
