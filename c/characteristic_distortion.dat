40|$|High-speed {{wireless}} communication systems have {{attracted much attention}} in recent years. To achieve a high-speed {{wireless communication}} system that utilizes an ultra-wide-frequency band, a broad-band antenna is required. However, {{it is difficult to}} abtain an antenna that has uniform characteristics in a broad frequency band. Moreover, propagation characteristics are distorted in a multi-path environment. Thus, the communication quality tends to degrade due to the distortion in the frequency characteristics of the wideband communication system. This paper proposes a quasi-inverse filter(QIF) to improve the compensation effect for the transmitter antenna. Furthermore, we propose a method that employs the newly developed QIF that compensates for frequency <b>characteristic</b> <b>distortion.</b> We evaluate different configurations for the compensation system employing a pre-filter and post-filter in the wideband communication system.

However, some subjects exhibit a velum-opening reflex which may affect results. We performed forced oscillation measurements at frequencies (8 - 256 Hz) that include the first antiresonance, comparing the noseclip with a cotton wool nose plug to eliminate upper airway contribution. Three sets of measurements were made in 18 adults: with and without noseclip, and with cotton wool. Velum opening during noseclip measurements was monitored using a nasal pressure transducer. A significantly greater proportion of subjects produced a <b>characteristic</b> <b>distortion</b> to the first antiresonance with the noseclip than with either no noseclip or with cotton wool. Distortion of the spectrum coincided with the transmission of oscillations into the nasal cavity.

40|$|The hump-backed plateau of {{the single}} {{inclusive}} distribution of hadrons inside a jet provides a standard test of the interplay between probabilistic parton splitting and quantum coherence in QCD. The medium-induced modification of this QCD radiation physics is expected to give access to {{the properties of the}} dense medium produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Here, we introduce a formulation of medium-induced parton energy loss, which treats all leading and subleading parton branchings equally, and which - for showering in the vacuum - accounts for the observed distribution of soft jet fragments. We show that the strong suppression of single inclusive hadron spectra measured in Au-Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) implies a <b>characteristic</b> <b>distortion</b> of the hump-backed plateau; we determine, as a function of jet energy, to what extent the soft jet fragments can be measured above some momentum cut.
