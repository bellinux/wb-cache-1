5|$|In June 2012, Deputy Lamar McIntyre {{was charged}} with having <b>coitus</b> with a woman that was in custody at the county courthouse. In 2014, He pleaded guilty {{and was sentenced to}} three years in custody, with all but one-year suspended. He was {{mandated}} to be required to submit to eighteen months of supervised probation.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} method (also {{known as}} <b>coitus</b> interruptus) is {{the practice of}} ending intercourse ("pulling out") before ejaculation. The main risk of the withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner. First-year failure rates vary from 4% with perfect usage to 22% with typical usage. It is not considered birth control by some medical professionals.|$|E
5|$|Other divinities also employ {{surrogate}}s to {{meet their}} own needs. In the Puranas, Sati commits suicide by immolating herself when Shiva is insulted and is reborn as Parvati and becomes Shiva's consort again. In a later Sanskrit text, Sati creates a surrogate who burns herself, while the real Sati is reborn as Parvati. In the Mahabharata, the goddess Svaha assumes the form of six of the wives of the Saptarishi (seven great sages), with whom Agni is in love with, and has <b>coitus</b> with him. Later, Svaha marries Agni.|$|E
5|$|Various texts relate {{that in the}} forest, Kalmashapada {{encounters}} a young Brahmin couple engaged in <b>coitus.</b> Kalmashapada disturbs the act before climax and captures the Brahmin youth. His wife pleads that her husband has not impregnated her yet, {{and that it is}} improper to kill a Brahmin. However, Kalmashapada devours the youth. The chaste Brahmin widow wails and curses Kalmashapada that he will die if he touches any woman with amorous intent. The wife cremates her husband and commits sati by jumping into his funeral pyre.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Europe, {{any effort}} to halt {{pregnancy}} was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church, although {{it is believed that}} women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as <b>coitus</b> interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina. Women in the Middle Ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy. The oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of Dudley Castle in England, and are dated back to 1640. They were made of animal gut, and were most likely used {{to prevent the spread of}} sexually transmitted diseases during the English Civil War. Casanova, living in 18th century Italy, described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy; however, condoms only became widely available in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates {{that when}} Kali (Satyavati) was {{ferrying}} the rishi (sage) Parashara {{across the river}} Yamuna, the sage wanted Kali to satisfy his lust and held her right hand. She tried to dissuade Parashara, saying that a learned Brahmin of his stature should not desire a woman who stinks of fish. She finally gave in, realizing the desperation and persistence of the sage and fearing {{that if she did}} not heed to his request, he might topple the boat midstream. Kali agreed, and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank. On reaching the other side the sage grabbed her again, but she declared that her body stank and <b>coitus</b> should be delightful to them both. At these words, Matsyagandha was transformed (by the powers of the sage) into Yojanagandha ("she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a yojana"). She now smelled of musk, and so was called Kasturi-gandhi ("musk-fragrant"). When Parashara, tormented with desire, approached her again she insisted that the act was not appropriate in broad daylight, as her father and others would see them in sex from the other bank; they should wait till night. The sage, with his powers, shrouded the entire area in fog. Before Parashara could enjoy her, Satyavati again interrupted him to say that he would enjoy her and depart, robbing her of her virginity and leaving her shamed in society. The sage then blessed her with virgo intacta. She asked Parashara to promise her that the <b>coitus</b> would be a secret and her virginity intact; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage; and her fragrance and youth would be eternal. Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati. After the act, the sage bathed in the river and left, never to meet her again. The Mahabharata abridges the story, noting only two wishes for Satyavati: her virgo intacta and everlasting sweet fragrance.|$|E
5|$|The other version, {{from the}} Pranatoshini Tantra and {{attributed}} to Svatantra Tantra, is narrated by Shiva. He recounts that his consort Chandika (identified with Parvati) was engrossed in <b>coitus</b> {{with him in}} reverse posture, but became enraged at his seminal emission. Her attendants Dakini and Varnini rose from her body. The rest of the tale {{is similar to the}} earlier version, although the river is called Pushpabhadra, the day of Chhinnamasta's birth is called Viraratri, and upon seeing the pale Parvati, Shiva becomes infuriated and assumes the form of Krodha Bhairava. This version is retold in the Shaktisamgama Tantra (c. 16th century), in which Chinnamasta forms a triad with Kali and Tara.|$|E
25|$|Olfactory stimuli are {{important}} for sexual reproduction and neuroendocrine function in many species. For instance if a pregnant mouse is exposed to the urine of a 'strange' male during a critical period after <b>coitus</b> then the pregnancy fails (the Bruce effect). Thus, during <b>coitus,</b> a female mouse forms a precise 'olfactory memory' of her partner that persists for several days.|$|E

25|$|The medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} rape, though sinful, {{was much less}} sinful than {{masturbation}} or <b>coitus</b> interruptus, because it fulfilled the procreative function of sex, while the other acts violated the purpose of sex.|$|E
25|$|Drinking of panchagavya {{and feeding}} of twenty-five Brahmins is {{prescribed}} with the rite. God {{is believed to}} possess the sadhaka for a fortnight after the ritual. He should stay away from material pleasures like <b>coitus,</b> dance and music in this period.|$|E
25|$|The biblical {{story of}} Onan (Gen. 38) is {{traditionally}} linked to referring to masturbation and condemnation thereof, but the sexual act described by {{this story is}} <b>coitus</b> interruptus, not masturbation.}} There is no explicit claim in the Bible that masturbation is sinful.|$|E
25|$|In medieval western Europe, any {{efforts to}} halt or prevent {{pregnancy}} were deemed immoral by the Catholic Church.

25|$|Leonardo studied {{internal}} organs, {{being the}} first to draw the human appendix and the lungs, mesentery, urinary tract, reproductive organs, {{the muscles of the}} cervix and a detailed cross-section of <b>coitus.</b> He {{was one of the first}} to draw a scientific representation of the fetus in the intrautero.|$|E
25|$|In 1745 Denis Diderot adapted or {{reproduced}} the Inquiry concerning Virtue in {{what was}} afterwards known as his Essai sur le Mérite et la Vertu. In 1769 a French translation of the whole of Shaftesbury's works, including the Letters, was published at Geneva. Translations of separate treatises into German began {{to be made in}} 1738, and in 1776–1779 there appeared a complete German translation of the Characteristics. Hermann Hettner says that not only Leibniz, Voltaire and Diderot, but Lessing, Mendelssohn, Wieland and Herder, drew the most stimulating nutriment from Shaftesbury. His charms, he adds, are ever fresh. A new-born Hellenism, or divine <b>coitus</b> of beauty presented itself before his inspired soul.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{transmissible}} venereal {{tumors are}} histiocytic tumors {{that may be}} transmitted among dogs through <b>coitus,</b> licking, biting and sniffing tumor affected areas. The concept that the tumor is naturally transmissible as an allograft came from three important observations. First, CTVTs can only be experimentally induced by transplanting living tumor cells, and not by killed cells or cell filtrates. Second, the tumor karyotype is aneuploid but has characteristic marker chromosomes in all tumors collected in different geographic regions. Third, a {{long interspersed nuclear element}} (LINE-1) insertion near c-myc has been found in all tumors examined so far and {{can be used as a}} diagnostic marker to confirm that a tumor is a CTVT.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 9th to early 10th century, the Persian {{physician}} Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi documented <b>coitus</b> interruptus, preventing ejaculation {{and the use}} of pessaries to block the cervix as birth control methods. He described a number of pessaries, including elephant dung, cabbages and pitch, used alone or in combination. During the same period Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi documented the use of pessaries made of rock salt for women for whom pregnancy may be dangerous. In the early 10th century the Persian Polymath Abu Ali al-Hussain ibn Abdallah ibn Sina, known in Europe as Avicenna, included a chapter on birth control in his medical encyclopedia The Canon of Medicine, listing 20 different methods of preventing conception.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin {{secretion}} {{in response}} to suckling or vagino-cervical stimulation is mediated by some of these pathways; vasopressin secretion {{in response to}} cardiovascular stimuli arising from chemoreceptors in the carotid body and aortic arch, and from low-pressure atrial volume receptors, is mediated by others. In the rat, stimulation of the vagina also causes prolactin secretion, and this results in pseudo-pregnancy following an infertile mating. In the rabbit, <b>coitus</b> elicits reflex ovulation. In the sheep, cervical stimulation {{in the presence of}} high levels of estrogen can induce maternal behavior in a virgin ewe. These effects are all mediated by the hypothalamus, and the information is carried mainly by spinal pathways that relay in the brainstem. Stimulation of the nipples stimulates release of oxytocin and prolactin and suppresses the release of LH and FSH.|$|E
25|$|From {{very early}} times various methods of {{contraception}} have been practiced in Islam, and Muslim jurists {{of the two}} major sects of Islam, Sunni and Shia, generally agree that contraception and family planning are not forbidden by Sharia; the use of contraceptive devices is permitted if the marital partners agree. All the Islamic schools of law from the tenth to the nineteenth century gave contraception their serious consideration. They dealt principally with <b>coitus</b> interruptus, the most common method, and unanimously agreed that it was licit provided the free wife gave her permission, because she had rights to children and to sexual fulfilment which withdrawal was believed to diminish. From the writings of the jurists it emerges that other methods of birth control – mostly intravaginal tampons – were also used by premodern women and the commonest view was that these should only be employed if the husband also agreed.|$|E
25|$|The {{physiological}} function of KLK3 is {{the dissolution of}} the coagulum, the sperm entrapping gel composed of semenogelins and fibronectin. Its proteolytic action is effective in liquefying the coagulum so that the sperm can be liberated. The activity of PSA is well regulated. In the prostate it is present as an inactive pro-form which is activated through the action of KLK2, another kallikrein-related peptidase. In the prostate, zinc ion concentrations are ten times higher than in other bodily fluids. Zinc ions have a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of PSA and on that of KLK2, so that PSA is totally inactive. Further regulation is achieved through pH variations. Although its activity is increased by higher pH, the inhibitory effect of zinc also increases. The pH of semen is slightly alkaline and the concentrations of zinc are high. On ejaculation, semen is exposed to the acidic pH of the vagina, due to the presence of lactic acid. In fertile couples, the final vaginal pH after <b>coitus</b> approaches the 6-7 levels, which coincides well with reduced zinc inhibition of PSA. At these pH levels, the reduced PSA activity is countered by a decrease in zinc inhibition. Thus, the coagulum is slowly liquefied, releasing the sperm in a well regulated manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} and {{improvement of quality}} of life during the menopausal period {{is at the core}} of estrogen and progestin-based hormone therapy. Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) have been shown to enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties. ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which deterioration are associated with the onset of menopause. Dyspareunia (due to vaginal dryness) appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT. It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity. Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, fantasies, and frequency of <b>coitus</b> and orgasm have also been noted. However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use. A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone. Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called tibolone— a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties— suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, and somatic symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed. However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.|$|E

500|$|The {{exterior}} {{surfaces of}} the temples are entirely covered with sculptures in three vertical layers. Here, there are horizontal ribbons carved with images, which shine bright in the sun light, providing rhythmic architectural features. Among the images of gods and heavenly beings, Agni, the god of fire is prominent. They are niches where erotic sculptures are fitted all round which are a major attraction among visitors. Some of these erotic sculptures are very finely carved and are in mithuna (<b>coitus)</b> postures with maidens flanking the couple, which is a frequently noted motif. There is also a [...] "male figure suspended upside" [...] in <b>coitus</b> posture, a kind of yogic pose, down on his head. The niches also have sculptures of Saptamatrikas, the septad of mother goddesses along with the gods Ganesha and Virabhadra. The seven fearful protector goddesses include: Brahmi seated on a swan of Brahma; Maheshwari with three eyes seated on Shiva's bull Nandi; Kumari; [...] Vaishnavi mounted on Garuda; the boar-headed Varahi; the lion-headed Narasimhi and Chamunda, the slayer of demons Chanda and Munda.|$|E
500|$|In India, {{the ancient}} texts of Ayurveda (Sanskrit आयुर्वेद) include cubeb in various remedies.

Unani physicians use a paste of the cubeb berries externally on male and female genitals to intensify sexual pleasure during <b>coitus.</b> Due to this attributed property, cubeb was called [...] "Habb-ul-Uruus".|$|E
500|$|In III.2 Shaun re-appears as [...] "Jaunty Jaun" [...] and {{delivers}} a lengthy and sexually suggestive sermon {{to his sister}} Issy, and her twenty-eight schoolmates from St. Brigid's School. Throughout this book Shaun is continually regressing, changing from an old man to an overgrown baby lying on his back, and eventually, in III.3, into a vessel through which the voice of HCE speaks again {{by means of a}} spiritual medium. This leads to HCE's defence of his life in the passage [...] "Haveth Childers Everywhere". Part III ends in the bedroom of Mr. and Mrs. Porter as they attempt to copulate while their children, Jerry, Kevin and Isobel Porter, are sleeping upstairs and the dawn is rising outside (III.4). Jerry awakes from a nightmare of a scary father figure, and Mrs. Porter interrupts the <b>coitus</b> to go comfort him with the words [...] "You were dreamend, dear. The pawdrag? The fawthrig? Shoe!

500|$|Images {{in which}} Chhinnamasta is {{depicted}} sitting on Kamadeva-Rati in a non-suppressive fashion {{suggest that the}} couple is giving sexual energy to the goddess. Images where Shiva is depicted in <b>coitus</b> with Chhinnamasta are associated with this interpretation. Chhinnamasta's names like Kameshwari ("goddess of desire") and Ratiragavivriddhini ("one who is engrossed {{in the realm of}} Rati– [...] ") and the appearance of klim– the common seed syllable of Kamadeva and Krishna– in her mantra support this interpretation. Her lolling tongue also denotes sexual hunger.|$|E
500|$|Richardson {{believed}} that while [...] "sex was all important to Dion, {{there is the}} constant impression that actual <b>coitus</b> was distasteful" [...] to her.

Chapman characterised Fortune's marriage as [...] "rocky", and the marriage produced no children. In later life, there were unsubstantiated rumours that Fortune had sexual relationships with both men and women, and in particular that she had a relationship with Tranchall-Hayes. Richardson nevertheless noted that there was no good evidence that Fortune had [...] "actively lesbian tendencies".|$|E
500|$|I just wanna be {{the girl}} you like, girl you like". The closing {{minute of the}} song {{features}} a French spoken word interpolation, which translates roughly as: [...] "Do you like sex? Sex. I mean, the physical activity. <b>Coitus.</b> Do you like it? You're not interested in sex? Men think that feminists hate sex, but it's a very stimulating and natural activity that women love". David Haglund and Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine noted undeniable similarities between this spoken section and a similar quote by actress Julianne Moore in 1998 film The Big Lebowski. In May 2014, during an interview with Vanity Fair, Lewinsky addressed the lyrics of the song mentioning her, saying, [...] "Thanks, Beyoncé, but if we're verbing, I think you meant 'Bill Clinton'd all on my gown'".|$|E

While prohibiting drunkenness, he promotes the drinking of alcohol in moderation following [...] Clement argues for a simple {{way of life in}} accordance with the innate simplicity of Christian monotheism. He condemns elaborate and expensive furnishings and clothing, and argues against overly passionate music and perfumes. But Clement does not believe in the abandoning of worldly pleasures and argues that the Christian should be able to express his joy in God's creation through gaiety and partying. He opposes the wearing of garlands, because the picking of the flowers ultimately kills a beautiful creation of God, and the garland resembles the crown of thorns. Clement treats sex at some length. He argues that both promiscuity and sexual abstinence are unnatural, and that the main goal of human sexuality is procreation. Homosexuality, prostitution, concubinage, adultery and <b>coitus</b> with pregnant women should all be avoided as they will not act towards the generation of legitimate offspring.|$|E
