5|$|Ana Jarvis (portrayed by Lotte Verbeek) is the free-spirited and quirky wife of Edwin Jarvis {{who quickly}} befriends Carter. She is wounded by Whitney Frost, {{resulting}} in internal <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> render her unable to have children.|$|E
5|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} may cause {{a range of}} serious {{coincidental}} <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> include cardiac arrhythmias and neurogenic pulmonary edema. These conditions must be adequately treated and stabilised {{as part of the}} core care for these patients.|$|E
5|$|A Rebel ship is {{captured}} by a Star Destroyer. On the ship are the droids C-3PO (Quagmire), R2-D2 (Cleveland) and the rebel leader Princess Leia (Lois). While {{the ship is}} boarded by stormtroopers, Leia tries to send an MPEG to Obi-Wan Kenobi through R2, but encounters so many <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> R2 offers to deliver the message himself. Leia {{is captured}} by Darth Vader (Stewie) while R2 and 3PO flee to Tatooine in an escape pod, where they are captured by Jawas.|$|E

5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the common cold. Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some {{of the reasons that}} antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson did {{not make}} his Panthers debut until December 8, 2011, missing the team's first 20 games {{following}} the trade due to a groin <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> had not fully healed in the off-season. In his first month with the team, he suffered another lower-body injury after being checked by Phoenix Coyotes forward Shane Doan during a game on December 20; he missed five games. Upon returning, he scored his first goal as a Panther since the 2003–04 season on January 6, 2012, in a 5–2 loss to the New Jersey Devils. Samuelsson finished the campaign with 14 goals and 31 points over 54 games, split between Vancouver and Florida. His points-per-game ranked fifth on the Panthers.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} sculpture, Seneb's size {{required}} {{the creator of}} the reliefs to make some unusual artistic choices. The standard convention of depicting higher status through physical size was maintained by portraying Seneb as being larger than his retainers, although this was clearly the opposite of the situation that actually existed. On the other hand, he is still shown with the physical characteristics of a dwarf. Unusually for such a relief, his wife is not pictured alongside him but appears separately. This may have been done to avoid the <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> would have arisen from needing to depict the couple's relative sizes realistically while still portraying Seneb as the larger party, as convention would have dictated. Seneb is also not shown carrying out typical male activities such as hunting, which was presumably impractical for someone of his stature, although one relief shows him pulling on papyrus reeds to guide his boat through the marshes of the Nile Delta.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> {{result from}} restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, {{to the risk}} factors of {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E
5|$|This {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in confirming venous pathology diagnoses. The imaging capability needed, was made possible with the developments of Doppler and color Doppler. Doppler measurements using Doppler effect can show {{the direction of the}} blood flow and its relative velocity and color Doppler is the provision of color to help interpret the image, showing for example, the blood flow towards the probe in one color and that flowing away another. Whilst the equipment itself is costly, the procedure is not. Apart from the scanner, different probes are required according to the depth to be studied. A gel is used with the probe to make a good acoustic impedance contact. The training and expertise of the examiner is important because of the many technical <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> can present. Venous anatomy for example, is not constant, for example a patient's vein layout of the right limb is not identical to that of the left limb.|$|E

25|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} {{is often}} a life-saving intervention, but carries potential complications including pneumothorax, airway injury, alveolar damage, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Other complications include diaphragm atrophy, decreased cardiac output, and oxygen toxicity. One of the primary <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> presents in patients mechanically ventilated is acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ALI/ARDS are recognized as significant contributors to patient morbidity and mortality.|$|E
25|$|Post-operative patient surveys about {{mental health}} and quality-of-life, {{reported}} improved physical health, physical appearance, social life, self-confidence, self-esteem, and satisfactory sexual functioning. Furthermore, the women reported long-term satisfaction with their breast implant outcomes; some despite having suffered medical <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> required surgical revision, either corrective or aesthetic. Likewise, in Denmark, 8.0 per cent of breast augmentation patients had a pre-operative history of psychiatric hospitalization.|$|E

25|$|In {{cases that}} {{progress}} beyond a throat infection, diphtheria toxin spreads through {{the blood and}} can lead to potentially life-threatening <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> affect other organs, such as the heart and kidneys. The toxin can cause damage to the heart that affects its ability to pump blood or the kidneys' ability to clear wastes. It can also cause nerve damage, eventually leading to paralysis. About 40% to 50% of those left untreated can die.|$|E

Normal {{procedure}} for persons of Jewish faith in Finland {{is to have a}} locally certified mohel who works in Finnish healthcare perform the operation. In the 2008 case, the infant was not anesthetized and developed <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> required immediate hospital care.

25|$|Three main forms {{have been}} described: {{thalassemia}} major, thalassemia intermedia, and thalassemia minor. All people with thalassemia {{are susceptible to}} health <b>complications</b> <b>that</b> involve the spleen (which is often enlarged and frequently removed) and gallstones. These complications are mostly found in thalassemia major and intermedia patients. Individuals with beta thalassemia major usually present within {{the first two years}} of life with severe anemia, poor growth, and skeletal abnormalities during infancy. Untreated thalassemia major eventually leads to death, usually by heart failure; therefore, birth screening is very important.|$|E
