5|$|In 2017, another {{stage of}} {{expansion}} was announced, adding a four-way tram junction {{at the intersection}} of North Terrace, King William Street and King William Road. One further stop would be provided north of that junction, adjacent to the Adelaide Festival Centre, and three to the east of it near Museum, University and East End at the new eastern terminus in front of the old Royal Adelaide Hospital. The project is expected to cost $80 million with the <b>contract</b> <b>awarded</b> <b>to</b> a joint venture of Downer Rail and York Civil. Preliminary works began in July 2017 with major works commencing in October and are scheduled to be completed in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the {{building}} of the reservoir were under discussion before the Second World War, and an Act of Parliament submitted by the Bristol Waterworks Company was passed in 1939. Following this, farms were bought by the company and farmed by the previous owners as tenancies. Farms and buildings still remaining in private hands were acquired by compulsory purchase. The sanction for construction was given in 1949 and the <b>contract</b> <b>awarded</b> <b>to</b> A.E. Farr, who employed 300 people on the site. The main dam was stabilised by injecting concrete into the cracks in the bedrock. The core of the dam was made of puddled clay mixed with sand. This {{was the first time the}} gain in strength brought about by the use of sand drains had been quantified. The lake was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, with the unveiling of a commemorative stone and plaque, which can be seen from the dam, on 17 April 1956, although it was not full until 25 February 1958. Flowers were presented to the Queen at the opening of Chew Valley Lake by Judith Blair Brown, daughter of Kennedy Brown, who worked at Bristol Water Works at the time of construction of the lake.|$|E

25|$|After {{winning the}} right to host the 1950 FIFA World Cup, the Brazilian {{government}} sought {{to build a new}} stadium for the tournament. The construction of Maracanã was criticized by Carlos Lacerda, then Congressman and political enemy of the mayor of the city, general Ângelo Mendes de Morais, for the expense and for the chosen location of the stadium, arguing that it should be built in the West Zone neighborhood of Jacarepaguá. At the time, a tennis stadium stood in the chosen area. Still it was supported by journalist Mário Filho, and Mendes de Morais was able to move the project forward. The competition for the design and construction was opened by the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in 1947, with the construction <b>contract</b> <b>awarded</b> <b>to</b> engineer Humberto Menescal, and the architectural <b>contract</b> <b>awarded</b> <b>to</b> seven Brazilian architects, Michael Feldman, Waldir Ramos, Raphael Galvão, Oscar Valdetaro, Orlando Azevedo, Pedro Paulo Bernardes Bastos, and Antônio Dias Carneiro.|$|E

The prototype F1M flew in April 1998, and CASA delivered the remainder between March 1999 and 15 March 2001. The project included a revised cockpit with colour LCDs and a Smart HUD from Sextant Avionique, a Sextant inertial navigation system with GPS interface; NATO-compatible Have Quick 2 secure communications; Mode 4 digital IFF; a defensive aids suite; and flight recorders. The radar was upgraded to Cyrano IVM standard, adding sea search and air to ground ranging modes.|$|E

As part of the five-year contract, BHP Billiton planned {{to increase the number}} of Aboriginal workers at the mine to 70, out of a total of 90 workers all up. The managing director of Ngarda, Brian Taylor, saw this contract as a positive step, moving Aboriginal people in the region away from government welfare and into permanent employment.

25|$|Governments {{may choose}} to give {{subsidies}} to rail operation, since rail transport has fewer externalities than other dominant modes of transport. If the railway company is state-owned, the state may simply provide direct subsidies in exchange for increased production. If operations have been privatized, several options are available. Some countries have a system where the infrastructure is owned by a government agency or company– with open access to the tracks for any company that meets safety requirements. In such cases, the state {{may choose to}} provide the tracks free of charge, or for a fee that does not cover all costs. This is seen as analogous to the government providing free access to roads. For passenger operations, a direct subsidy may be paid to a public-owned operator, or public service obligation tender may be helt, and a time-limited <b>contract</b> <b>awarded</b> <b>to</b> the lowest bidder. Total EU rail subsidies amounted to €73 billion in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Aboriginal mining {{companies}} {{have been able to}} secure contracts with the big international {{mining companies}}. In 2007, BHP Billiton awarded a A$300 million contract to Ngarda Civil and Mining, an Aboriginal-owned company, to manage the Yarrie mine, the largest ever mining <b>contract</b> <b>awarded</b> <b>to</b> an Aboriginal company. As part of the five-year contract, BHP Billiton planned {{to increase the number of}} Aboriginal workers at the mine to 70, out of a total of 90 workers.

Western Australian Aboriginals, in 2007, suffered from an unemployment rate of 14 percent in the state, compared to 3.3% for the general population. Of the 12,000 people employed by BHP Billiton in its Pilbara operations in 2010, 700 were indigenous. Rio Tinto also, as of 2010, employs 700 indigenous workers in its Pilbara operations, comprising 6 percent of its overall work force. FMG, under the leadership of Andrew Forrest, is driving a national program which aims to find 50,000 jobs for indigenous workers in Australia. Companies like BHP Billiton, FMG and Rio Tinto have programs aimed at increasing the number of Aboriginal employees in their operations. Indigenous Australians in Western Australia in 2001 accounted for 3.1% of the population.|$|E

The paved toll road was to be built on top [...] of an ancient Native American trail along the San Pablo Bay shore between the Sacramento Highway and the Black Point cut-off (LRN 8) near Sears Point. It was {{expected}} to cost $775,000USD, with a toll not exceeding $0.35. Toll road officials explained {{the purpose of the}} road; to stimulate motor vehicle usage by reducing the commute times and expenses of motorists traveling from the East Bay and Sacramento areas by offering a more direct route toward Marin, Sonoma and the Redwood Highway.
