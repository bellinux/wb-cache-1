Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>strength</b> of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius received more rain and had a more stable climate than Rodrigues, there was probably less need for male dodos to fight over territory. The solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} screw {{push-out}} strength {{and resistance to}} cantilever bending of 5 different angular stable systems using 4 different insertion torque values to tighten locking screws. Study Design: In vitro mechanical testing of 5 screw-plate constructs. Sample Population: Screw-plate constructs (n= 60) were tested; 12 for each design, 3 for each torque value. Methods: To compare push-out strength, screws were loaded in axial direction on the screw tip until loosening of the locking mechanism was recorded. For cantilever bending test, screws were loaded perpendicularly to their longitudinal axis at 2 mm of distance from the under surface of the plate. Load was applied in displacement control at 1 mm/min. Results: There {{was a significant difference}} between the 5 different angular stable systems regarding both push-out and <b>cantilever</b> bending <b>strength</b> for 2 systems and insertion torque value. Conclusions: Locking mechanisms using "treads in treads" principle provide a stronger screw push-out behavior. Screws material and core diameter of the different screws were directly related to <b>cantilever</b> bending <b>strength...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, low cis-butadiene (LCPB) {{is used in}} {{the process}} of {{polymerization}} of HIPS to study the influence of the polymerization condition on the particle size of rubber and mechanical property. It can be discovered from the study that the particle size was increased from 300 nm to 500 nm with the decreasing stir. The test of mechanical property shows that with the increase of content of rubber, elongation at break and impact <b>strength</b> on <b>cantilever</b> increase, but stretching strength decreases. On condition of 100 rpm, when the content of rubber increases from 3 % to 9 %, elongation at break increases from 21. 9 % to 25. 0 %, stretching strength decreases from 30. 5 MPa to 23. 9 MPa, and the <b>cantilever</b> impact <b>strength</b> increases from 5. 4 KJ/m 2 to 9. 3 KJ/m 2. On condition of 200 rpm, when the content of rubber increases from 3 % to 9 %, elongation at break increases from 21. 4 % to 29. 1 %, stretching strength decreases from 28. 7 MPa to 20. 8 MPa, and the <b>cantilever</b> impact <b>strength</b> increases from 5. 2 KJ/m 2 to 8. 1 KJ/m 2. High-impact polystyrene (HIPS) is a heterogeneous material obtained by polymerizing styrene (St) in the presence of polybutadiene (PB). Nowadays HIPS is used broadly, whose research was carried out for decades on types and amounts of rubbers and initiators used, and the improvement of condition fo...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} scheme utilizing standard {{nonlinear programming}} methodology is presented for the optimal design of elastic, redundant structures with strength and buckling constraints. Numerical examples are given which demonstrate how this method, involving a constraint redefinition, can successfully overcome certain problems typical to such structures. The scheme {{is applied to}} the design of a <b>cantilever</b> truss with <b>strength</b> and buckling constraints, in which optimal nonuniform cross section columns are used for all elements critical in buckling. It is found that permitting node movement and adding redundancies can lower the weight of the structure for the prescribed design constraints. In addition, the node excursions in this configuration are shown to be relatively small...|$|R

The Rodrigues solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.The preferred habitat of the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions suggest that it inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius. This view is supported by the fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern Mauritius. Such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the Gelderland journal shows a small island off the coast of Mauritius where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was l’île aux Benitiers in Tamarin Bay, on the west coast of Mauritius. Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and Pandanus trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and wetness of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Two simple {{low-cost}} thick-film {{force sensor}} designs are optimised, characterised and tested in this work, combining calculations of sensor element and joint stresses, joint strength characterisation and measurement of complete sensors. All sensors {{are based on}} standard hybrid substrates. Our results show that a single sensor geometry cannot cover such {{a wide range of}} forces in an optimal way. For small forces (100 mN to ca. 2 N), simple cantilever force sensors are an excellent solution, achieving reasonable precision with a very simple design and compatibility with an SMD (surface mount device) assembly process with solder or conductive glue. Characterisation of solder joint strength shows that such joints can reliably withstand the bending moments resulting form the loading of the cantilever sensor up to ca. 2 N. Above this force, both solder joint and <b>cantilever</b> <b>strength</b> become critical in the cantilever design. Therefore, a 3 -point or 4 -point bending beam geometry must be selected, thereby extending the force range to ca. 100 N. Key words: thick-film force sensors, cantilever beams, bridges...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} package {{technique for}} temperature independent Fiber Bragg grating sensor is proposed. A uniform <b>strength</b> <b>cantilever</b> with two FBG attached {{on the upper}} and lower surfaces was utilized as the key element. By detecting two wavelengths differential output, the applied force can be obtained and temperature effects can be eliminated. Experiment results show the sensor has linear response and output signal uctuates less than 12 pm as temperature changes from - 10 degrees C to 50 degrees C. The maximum thermal error is less than 0. 3 % of the full measurement range.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{influence}} of high-order frequency components {{in the operation of}} an amplitude modulation atomic-force microscope (AFM). A comparative study of point-mass and continuous models is performed to describe the tip motion. The tip–surface interaction force excites high-order frequency components whenever a higher harmonic of the excitation force is close to an eigenmode of the <b>cantilever</b> beam. The <b>strength</b> of those components depends on the set point amplitude and the fundamental resonance frequency of the cantilever. However, for standard operating conditions with quality factors in the 102 – 103 range, higher-order components are about three orders of magnitude smaller than the component at the excitation frequency. We conclude that point-mass models are suitable to describe the operation of a tapping-mode AFM in air environments. The authors acknowledge fruitful discussions with A. San Paulo.

40|$|Vibration-based damage detection, a {{nondestructive}} method, {{is based}} on the fact that vibration characteristics such as natural frequencies and mode shapes of structures are changed when the damage happens. This paper presents cooperative coevolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA), which is capable for an optimization problem with a large number of decision variables, as the optimizer for the vibration-based damage detection in beams. In the CCGA, a minimized objective function is a numerical indicator of differences between vibration characteristics of the actual damage and those of the anticipated damage. The damage detection in a uniform cross-section cantilever beam, a uniform <b>strength</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam, and a uniform cross-section simply supported beam is used as the test problems. Random noise in the vibration characteristics is also considered in the damage detection. In the simulation analysis, the CCGA provides the superior solutions to those that use standard genetic algorithms presented in previous works, although it uses less numbers of the generated solutions in solution search. The simulation results reveal that the CCGA can efficiently identify the occurred damage in beams for all test problems including the damage detection in a beam with a large number of divided elements such as 300 elements...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} in vitro the influence of fiber-reinforcement on the fracture strength and fatigue resistance of resin-based composites. Methods: One hundred rectangular bar-shaped specimens (2 mm × 2 mm × 25 mm) made of resin-based composite were prepared in a stainless steel split-mould: (i) thirty specimens of particulate filler composite (PFC) (Filtek Z 100, 3 M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA), (ii) thirty specimens of fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) (Everstick C&B, Sticktech Ltd., Turku, Finland) and (iii) forty specimens of PFC and FRC combined in two longitudinal layers of equal thickness. Each specimen was trimmed into a cylindrical hourglass shape. The fracture <b>strength</b> (<b>cantilever</b> beam test, n = 10) and the fatigue resistance (rotating cantilever beam test; staircase method: 104 cycles, 1. 2 Hz, n = 20) were determined. Fracture strength, fatigue resistance and work-of-fracture were calculated. The fracture surfaces of failed specimens were analyzed with SEM. Data was analyzed by logistic regression, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test and, a Student's t-test. Results: ANOVA revealed that fiber-reinforcement had significant effect (P < 0. 001) on fracture strength, fatigue resistance, and work-of-fracture. Student's t-test showed significant differences (P < 0. 001) in fatigue resistance compared to fracture strength. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn (i) the fatigue resistance of resin-based composites is lower than their fracture strength and (ii) FRC are more fatigue resistant than PFC or combinations of FRC and PFC...|$|R
40|$|SMA-composites are an {{adaptive}} composite in which SMA elements {{are incorporated into}} fiber reinforced epoxy composites. Many researches have been done on investigating the properties of shape memory effect and superelastic influence in SMA composites. However, little information available {{on the effect of}} different fiber volume fraction with continuous flexinol long wire to mechanical strength and vibrational characteristics. This study is mainly focused on the integration of shape memory alloy (SMA) elements with epoxy composites based on different fiber volume fraction. The aim is to analyze and investigate static and dynamic mechanical properties of SMAJDER 331 by measuring the first vibration mode of clamped <b>cantilever</b> beams, elastic <b>strength</b> and hysteresis behavior of SMAcomposites through monotonic tensile, cyclic and vibration analysis. This observation indicates that the Young's modulus increases (1667. 083 MPa) at 2. 4 % fiber volume fraction of flexinol wire of SMAJDER 331 compared to matrix Young's modulus (904. 495 MPa). The increase of temperature up to 75 °C and 90 °C lead to the recovery of stress and strain and therefore closed hysteresis achieved. TIle temperature dependency of vibration property is affected largely due to the addition of SMA Flexinol long fibers. The vibrational characteristics of SMA composites can be improved by the addition of certain amount of flexinol wire. The addition of 2. 4 % fiber volume fraction offlexinol long fibers resulted in the highest natural frequency with the value of 171 Hz at the temperature of 70 ° C...|$|R
