Users can be offered a far greater range of possibilities, however, if documents are <b>indexed</b> with <b>coordinated</b> <b>index</b> concepts. <b>Coordinated</b> <b>index</b> concepts are compound index concepts that express a relation between concepts that function as simple subject descriptors, as in cures(headache, aspirin).

He was a consultant and Lecturer on Scientific Documentation and was even the editor of American Documentation in the years 1952-1953. In 1952, Taube founded his own company, Documentation, Inc. with Gerald J. Sophar and two others. [...] Documentation, Inc. was the “largest aerospace information center” and did work for NASA. [...] Here Taube developed <b>Coordinate</b> <b>Indexing,</b> and important innovation {{in the field of}} Library Science. Taube defines <b>Coordinate</b> <b>Indexing</b> as, “the analysis of any field of information into a set of terms and the combination of these terms in any order to achieve any desired degree of detail in either indexing or selection." [...] <b>Coordinate</b> <b>Indexing</b> used “uniterms” to make storing and retrieving information easier and faster. [...] Uniterms “constitute a special set of rules and requirements which makes both the analysis into terms and the combination of the terms in order to specify items of information a remarkably simple and efficient process.” Taube had split <b>coordinate</b> <b>indexing</b> into two categories, item and term indexing. [...] It used punch cards and a machine reader to search for specific items or documents by terms or keywords. [...] Documentation, Inc. also brought forth the IBM 9900 Special Index Analyzer, also known as COMAC. COMAC stood for “continuous multiple access controller.” This machine handled data punch cards, used for information storage and retrieval. [...] It made “logical relationships among terms.” [...] Even though Documentation Inc. started as a small company, it soon grew to well over 700 members.|$|R

40|$|Indexing is a model-based {{recognition}} technique, {{in which}} unknown objects are identified using lookup tables. <b>Indexing</b> <b>coordinates</b> are extracted from sensed features, and the <b>indexing</b> <b>coordinates</b> specify a table entry containing the object's identity.
