40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} whether the addition of chromic oxide (Cr 2 O 3) to <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> {{could be used as}} a visual marker in feces for selection of creep feed-eating suckling pigs. Animals- 20 suckling pigs. Procedures-Via syringe, 5 pigs (2 to 3 days old on day 0; 1 pig/treatment) from each of 4 litters received oral administrations of 10, 20, 30, or 40 g of <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> containing 10 g of Cr 2 O 3 center dot kg(- 1) on each of 2 consecutive days (days 20 and 21) or 30 g of <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> containing 10 g of Cr 2 O 3 center dot kg(- 1) on day 20 and 30 g of Cr 2 O 3 free <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> on day 21. On days 21 through 24, 6 fecal samples were collected from each pig at regular intervals between 8 : 00 Am and 6 : 00 Pm. Green-colored feces were considered indicative of <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> consumption (eaters). Data analyses were based on single and multiple fecal samples.

A total of 24 gilts and 72 multiparous sows were selected at farrowing, and their litters allocated to a 2 by 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with the factors being weaning age (22 or 29 days of age) and {{the composition of}} the <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> [simple (diet based predominately on cereals and animal and vegetable protein sources) or complex (diet based predominately on cereals, animal protein sources and 300 g/kg whey powder) ]. <b>Creep</b> <b>feed</b> was offered to all litters from 9 days of age to weaning. While <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> disappearance did not affect pre-weaning growth performance, there was a greater disappearance of the simple <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> than the complex <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> from 9 days of age to weaning (776 versus 461 g/litter, respectively, P ≤ 0. 004). Apparent <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake from individual piglets in a subset of litters was assessed at three time points (16 and 19 days of age and at weaning), allowing the characterisation of individual pigs as good, moderate, small or non-eaters. There was no difference between treatment groups (χ 2 ≤ 6. 27, P ≤ 0. 71) in the characterisation of apparent <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> disappearance by individual piglets, however piglets offered the simple creep diet before weaning consumed more feed (P ≤ 0. 004) and gained weight faster (P ≤ 0. 007) during the first 5 days after weaning than those animals offered the complex <b>creep</b> diet. <b>Feed</b> intake from weaning to 49 days of age also tended to be greater in pigs offered the simple creep diet before weaning (P ≤ 0. 053), with this difference reflected in daily gain from weaning to 49 days of age (P ≤ 0. 051). Despite these differences, <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> composition did not influence lifetime growth performance or carcass composition. Pigs weaned at 22 days of age were heavier midway through the weaner period (49 days of age) than pigs weaned at 29 days of age (15. 2 versus 14. 3 kg, respectively, P ≤ 0. 009), and tended to grow faster from birth to slaughter (616 versus 610 g/day, respectively, P ≤ 0. 079).

40|$|In Europe, piglets {{are usually}} weaned before 4 weeks of age, thus {{changing}} abruptly from highly digestible milk {{to a less}} digestible starter diet, resulting in reduced feed intake and growth after weaning and sometimes post weaning diarrhea. Intake of a sufficient amount of <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> during lactation can reduce these post weaning problems, but <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> consumption is usually low and highly variable. This thesis describes the effect of intermittent suckling (IS; a management technique in which piglets are separated from the sow for 12 h/ day from d 14 to weaning (d 25), on performance of pigs before and after weaning. IS increased average <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake during lactation. Distribution of <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake shifted from a skewed one, with a majority of litters consuming less than 250 g. piglet- 1 in control litters, to a normal distribution with an average <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake of 500 to 750 g. piglet- 1 in IS litters. The higher <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake caused by IS resulted in better performance after weaning: IS litters had higher feed intake and higher weight gain {{in the first two}} weeks after weaning. Thereafter no differences were found until slaughter. IS litters with little or no <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake during lactation tended to have higher weight gains and feed intake after weaning than control litters with comparable <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake during lactation. IS did not increase the percentage of eaters within a litter during lactation and weaning weights did not differ between eaters and non-eaters. From one until four weeks after weaning piglets that were eaters during lactation had higher weights than non-eaters. IS did not affect feeder visiting behaviour of piglets from litters with an anyhow high level of feed intake during lactation, but IS piglets from litters with a low level of feed intake were stimulated to visit the feeder during lactation, which probably made them already familiar with the feeder and the feed. Part of the variation in feed intake between litters might be explained by differences in suckling behaviour and activity. To investigate if IS and/or <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake affects the absorptive capacity of the small intestines, an in vivo small intestine segment perfusion test was performed in 24 newly weaned piglets (6 eaters and 6 non- eaters from each treatment). Net absorption in non-infected segments of the small intestine was significantly higher in eaters than in non-eaters. No difference was found between IS and control piglets. IS also affected the sows: weight loss during lactation was decreased and ovulations were advanced. The results of these studies demonstrate that IS improves both <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake during lactation and feed intake and weight gain after weaning. Piglets consuming <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> during lactation had higher weights and net absorption in the small intestine after weaning, independent of the suckling regimen.

Thirty-six crossbred steer calves were used in a randomized block design to compare <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> vs. non-creep feeding on plasma glucose, plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) and plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), as well as overall performance. NEFA was tested as a measure of the mobilization of body fat reserves due to diet. Steers were randomly selected to one of three treatments. Steers were creep fed supplements daily during the <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> phase. They remained in the same treatment groups and were moved to drylot pens (6 animals/pen; 2 pens/treatment) for the feedlot phase. Live weights and blood samples were taken on selected days. Glucose, PUN and NEFA concentrations were analyzed colorimetrically using Linear Enzymatic Glucose, PUN and NEFA-C kits, respectively. Additionally, fat depth and rib eye area (REA) were measured using ultrasonography. There were no differences in average daily gains (ADG) between protein sources during the <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> or feedlot phases.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that during the {{suckling}} period pancreatic secretion is low. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with pancreatic-like enzymes of microbial origin (PLEM) and SiO 2, as an antibacterial factor, on the performance of piglets fed <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> during weaning and thereafter. The experiment was performed on piglets from 30 litters. The piglets were divided into 5 groups (n = 63 – 66) and weaned at the age of 28 d old. The control group received standard <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> (Days 7 – 28), and groups P 1 and P 2 and groups PA 1 and PA 2 received <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> with SiO 2 supplemented with protease (P 1 and P 2) or with protease+amylase (PA 1 and PA 2) during Days 7 – 13 (P 1 and PA 1) or Days 14 – 20 (P 2 and PA 2) before weaning. Dietary supplementation with PLEM and SiO 2 led to a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in ADG in the treated piglets compared to the control with the best results obtained in group P 2. To summarize, <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> supplemented with PLEM improves productivity parameters of piglets under standard rearing conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} grind the ceramic blade surface with the Numerical Control contour {{evolution}} ultrasonic grinding method using the simple shape grinding wheel, primary comparative experiments of <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> grinding {{with and without}} ultrasonic vibration were carried out to grind Al 2 O 3 ceramics so as to implore the effects of different process parameters on the machined surface quality. It can be concluded that when the direction of ultrasonic vibration {{is parallel to the}} direction of <b>creep</b> <b>feed,</b> the value of the surface roughness will be decreased; otherwise the surface quality will become worse. With the ultrasonic grinding method, the slower feed-rate, the smaller grinding depth, the higher grinding speed and the compound feed grinding method should be applied in order to improve the surface quality. The <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> grinding mechanisms with and without ultrasonic vibration were analyzed theoretically from the experimental results.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> and creep grazing on the pasture characteristics and on performance and productivity of sheep. Three systems of lambs production on Tifton 85 (Cynodon spp.) pastures oversown with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) were studied: lambs with dams until slaughter without supplementation (1); lambs with dams until slaughter fed concentrate in creep feeders at 2 % BW. day- 1 (2); and lambs with dams until slaughter and supplemented with white clover (Trifolium repens) in creep grazing system ad libitum (3). The characteristics of the pasture did not differ (P> 0. 05) among the systems. Individual lamb growth was higher with <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> (307 g/day) and creep grazing (274 g/day) compared to no supplemented systems (204 g/day; p< 0. 05). Animal productivity per area on supplemented treatments (2. 4 kg BW/ha/day) was significantly greater than no supplemented one (1. 8 kg BW/ha/day; p< 0. 05). White clover showed to be a particularly good supplement for raising lambs on pastures.

40|$|A {{total of}} 84 sows (PIC, Line 1050) and their litters {{were used to}} {{determine}} the effects of lactation and <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> on sow and piglet performance. Three groups of sows were blocked according to day of farrowing and parity and allotted to four treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial with lactation feed intake (ad libitum vs. restricted) and <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> (none vs. creep) as factors. Piglets were cross-fostered within each block to standardize litter weights and litter size (> 11 pigs). A common lactation diet (1, 586 kcal ME/lb, 0. 97 % TID Lys) was used in the study. From d 3 of lactation, ad libitum sows were allowed free access to feed while restricted sows were fed 25 % less than those fed ad libitum. A pelleted creep diet (1, 585 ME/lb, 1. 56 % TID Lys) with 1. 0 % chromium oxide was offered to creep-fed pigs from d 3 to weaning (d 21). Piglets were weighed individually at d 3, 7, 14, and 21. Amount of creep feed consumed was determined daily. Fecal samples from all creep-fed pigs were taken on d 7, 14, and 21 and fecal color was assessed to categorize pigs as eaters or non-eaters. Sow weight and P 2 backfat thickness (6. 5 cm from the midline over the last rib) were measured after farrowing and at weaning. There was no interaction between lactation feed intake and <b>creep</b> <b>feeding.</b> Ad libitum feeding of sows reduced BW loss (- 33. 0 vs. - 52. 9 lb; P 0. 30) sow BW and backfat loss, but increased days to estrus (5. 4 vs. 4. 9 d; P< 0. 03) for sows that returned to heat by 14 d. <b>Creep</b> <b>feeding</b> tended to improve litter weaning weights (132. 7 vs. 124. 9 lb/d; P< 0. 09) by reducing mortality rate after cross-fostering (3. 9 vs. 7. 3 %; P< 0. 06). Total creep feed intake of litters did not differ (2. 24 vs. 2. 28 lb/litter; P< 0. 93) between ad libitum and limit-fed sows. About 60 % of the creep-fed pigs were categorized as eaters. Of those identified as eaters, 23, 20, and 57 % began consuming <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> from d 3 to 7, 7 to 14, and 14 to 21, respectively. From d 0 to 28 post-weaning, there was no effect of <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> on d 28 weights (P< 0. 93), ADG (P< 0. 86), ADFI (P< 0. 93), and F/G (P< 0. 95) compared to non-creep fed pigs. Eaters tended to be heavier until d 28 post-weaning (P< 0. 16) and had greater (P< 0. 06) ADG and total gains than non-eaters and no creep pigs. In conclusion, <b>creep</b> <b>feeding</b> improved survivability, but had no effects on pre-weaning gain and sow performance. Low feed intake during lactation negatively affected both sow and litter performance. Creating more eaters in whole litters may be beneficial in improving post-weaning performance...|$|E
40|$|In Exp. 1, 96 sows (PIC C 29) {{and their}} litters {{were used to}} {{determine}} the effects of creep diet complexity on preweaning performance and the proportion of piglets consuming <b>creep</b> <b>feed.</b> The experimental treatments were: (1) no <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> (n = 26), (2) simple creep diet (n = 26), and (3) complex creep diet (n = 44). Pigs fed the complex creep diet had greater (P < 0. 03) ADG and tended to have greater (P < 0. 06) total gain than pigs fed the simple creep diet, with no creep pigs intermediate. Litters fed the complex creep diet consumed twice the total (2. 73 vs. 1. 37 lb; P < 0. 0006) and daily (0. 91 vs. 0. 45 lb; P < 0. 0006) <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake of litters fed the simple creep diet. The high-complexity creep diet improved (P < 0. 0001) the proportion of eaters from 28 % to 68 %. A greater (P < 0. 10) proportion of eaters were nursing in the middle and posterior teats (57 % and 52 %, respectively) than in the anterior teats (38 %). In Exp. 2, 675 pigs from Exp. 1 (initial BW 14. 1 lb and 21. 2 ± 0. 2 d) {{were used to determine}} whether social facilitation occurs between eaters and non-eaters in commercial nursery groups. The treatments were: non-eater group (pigs that were not provided any <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> or non-eaters of <b>creep</b> <b>feed),</b> eater group (pigs that positively consumed <b>creep</b> <b>feed),</b> and mix group (pigs that were 51 % non-eaters and 49 % eaters). Each treatment had 25 pigs per pen and 9 replications (pens). In the initial 3 d postweaning, eaters had greater (P < 0. 01) ADG and (P < 0. 002) ADFI than non-eaters, with the mix group being intermediate. Overall ADG of the eater group was 6. 2 % higher (P < 0. 05) than that of the non-eater group. For social facilitation to occur, weight gains of non-eaters in the mix pens should be either (1) closer to the weight gains of eaters in the mix pen or (2) greater than the weight gains of the non-eater group. Results showed that non-eaters within the mix pens failed both criteria. In conclusion, the high-complexity creep diet improved preweaning ADG, litter <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake, and the proportion of eaters. Eaters had improved postweaning feed intake, daily gains, and weight uniformity and reduced postweaning lag. Mixing eaters with non-eaters within pens in large commercial groups did not stimulate feed intake and daily gains of non-eaters, which indicates that social facilitation did not occur...|$|R

On d 10 of suckling, litters were allotted to 1 of 2 dietary treatments by parity and BW in a randomized complete block design with 13 replications per treatment. Starting on d 10 of lactation, pigs were fed common pelleted <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> processed using either a 3. 2 mm (small) or a 12. 7 mm (large) die. Chromic oxide was included as a fecal marker and fecal swabs were taken on d 14, 17, and 21 to determine percentage of pigs consuming <b>creep</b> <b>feed.</b> On d 21, pigs were weaned and re-allotted to nursery treatments for 21 -d and fed in 2 phases. Phase 1 (d 0 to 7 postweaning) treatment diets were the same diets fed during the suckling period with 50 % of the pigs remaining on their previously allotted pellet diameter treatment and the other 50 % of pigs were re-allotted to the opposite pellet diameter treatment in the nursery. A common meal form diet was fed from d 7 to 21 postweaning. During the suckling phase (d 10 to 21), litters of pigs fed the large creep pellet had decreased (P < 0. 03) pre-weaning mortality (0 vs. 2. 54 %; SEM = 0. 008) and increased (P < 0. 05) ADFI from d 17 to 21 (30. 8 vs. 17. 6 g; SEM = 4. 41). There {{were no significant differences in}} suckling pig BW gain (3. 21 vs. 3. 25 kg; SEM = 0. 107, for small and large pellet treatments, respectively) or percentage of pigs consuming <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> (58 vs. 59 %; SEM = 0. 008, for small and large pellet treatments, respectively). During the nursery phase, pigs fed a large nursery pellet, regardless of <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> treatment, had increased (P < 0. 01) ADFI from d 0 to 7 (138 vs. 153 g; SEM = 3. 6). Pigs fed the large <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> pellet, regardless of nursery pellet diameter, had improved (P < 0. 03) ADG (67 vs. 50 g; SEM = 5. 0) and G:F (0. 452 vs. 0. 334; SEM = 0. 0349) from d 0 to 7 postweaning, as well as improved G:F overall (0. 828 vs. 0. 779; SEM = 0. 0129). There were no significant differences in ADG or ADFI during the common or overall period.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study effects of intermittent suckling on <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake and weight gain of litters. Loss of weight and backfat during lactation, as well as reproductive performance, were also measured. Batches of multiparous sows (Parity I to 12, 4. 1 on average) were either suckled intermittently (IS, eight batches; n = 50) or continuously (control, eight batches; n = 62). Litters were weaned at 27 +/- 2 d of age, on average. Litter size (11. 1 +/- 0. 2 piglets, on average) was standardized within a batch within 3 d of birth. All litters had free access to <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> and water from 1 wk of age onward. In the IS group, litters were separated from the sow {{for a period of}} 12 h/d (0930 to 2130), starting 11 d before weaning. Rectal ultrasonography was applied at d 3 after weaning to check the ovaries for follicle development or presence of corpora lutea. <b>Creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake by the litters during lactation was higher in IS litters than in control litters (686 57 vs. 314 +/- 42 g/piglet, P < 0. 01). The distribution of <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake shifted from a skewed one, with a majority of litters consuming less than 250 g/piglet in control litters, to a normal distribution, with an average <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake of 500 to 750 g/piglet in IS litters. During the 7 d after weaning, <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake in IS litters was also higher (281 +/- 15 vs. 204 +/- 9 g(.) piglet(- 1.) d(- 1), P < 0. 01). The ADG of piglets during lactation was negatively affected by IS, resulting in lower weight at weaning (7, 229 +/- 140 vs. 7, 893 +/- 145 g/piglet, P < 0. 05). During the 7 d after weaning, however, ADG was higher in IS litters (255 +/- 10 vs. 177 +/- 8 g(.) piglet(- 1.) d(- 1), P < 0. 01), and 7 d after weaning, the weights of the litters were similar (9, 011 +/- 167 vs. 9, 132 +/- 164 g/piglet, P = 0. 81). The IS litters that consumed little or no feed during lactation had an ADG after lactation that was higher than in control litters, with comparable <b>creep</b> <b>feed</b> intake during lactation: 204 vs. 136 g/d. Body weight loss by the sows during lactation was lower in IS sows (- 10 +/- 2 vs. - 16 +/- 1 kg, P < 0. 05). A higher percentage of IS sows ovulated during lactation (22 vs. 3 %, P < 0. 01), and weaning-to-ovulation interval (excluding sows with lactational ovulation) was shorter in IS sows (4. 7 +/- 0. 2 vs. 5. 3 +/- 0. 2 d, P < 0. 05).
