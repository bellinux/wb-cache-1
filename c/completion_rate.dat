40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades there has been {{considerable}} {{growth in the number of}} new apprenticeship registrations in Canada. However, this has not been matched by a corresponding increase in the number of apprenticeship completions. As a result Canadian apprenticeship programs have seen declining <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> over this period. Across provinces, trades and time there is considerable variation in apprenticeship <b>completion</b> <b>rates.</b> In Canada apprenticeship programs are provincially regulated and there are differences in requirements across trades and provinces and, to a lesser extent, over time. Therefore, this paper asks to what extent the differences in <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> are related to differences in the structure of apprenticeship programs, as well as differences in demographic variables and unemployment rates. Results suggest that apprenticeship programs for which certication is mandatory have <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> that are about ten percentage points higher than those without mandatory certification. There is little evidence to support the view that either the length of the work experience term or the technical training requirement act as a barrier to completion. However, there is some evidence to suggest that the format in which technical training is delivered is related to <b>completion</b> <b>rates.</b> While the decline in <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> during the 1990 s coincided with the raising of education requirements, accounting for the trend in <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> implies a positive relationship between these two variables across trades and provinces. On average, trades with a higher fraction of female apprentices and apprentices with a younger average age tend to have higher <b>completion</b> <b>rates.</b> Finally, in general the results are consistent with high unemployment rates acting as a barrier to completion.

40|$|The {{extent in}} which a teacher {{communicates}} {{with his or her}} students in an online setting may affect student course <b>completion</b> <b>rates.</b> The increased use of online courses and degree programs at the post-secondary level has fundamentally changed the way faculty members and students interact, and ultimately may impact student course <b>completion</b> <b>rates.</b> Course <b>completion</b> is an aspect of student retention. The purpose of this quantitative correlational research study was to analyze the correlation between faculty interaction with online undergraduate students in required introductory English composition courses and student <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> in those courses. Blackboard is a learning management system used for interaction between teachers and students in online courses. The number of interactions a teacher has with students on Blackboard may affect the retention rates of students in a particular course.

High school status <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> for white and black young adults increased between the early 1970s and 1990 but has remained relatively the same since 1990.
