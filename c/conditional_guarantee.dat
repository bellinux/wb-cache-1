Consequently, a L/C is desirable in high value and/or high risk transactions. The guarantee is conditional upon the seller complying 100 % with the documentary requirements of the L/C, an issue of particular concern to exporters, as the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) estimates worldwide documentary discrepancy rates of 70 %. L/C transactions are governed by ICC rules, and whilst these provide an international standardised process, the differing interpretations of what constitutes documentary compliance create difficulties for sellers in particular. The new rules, UCP 600, supposedly have simpler and clearer wording, to reduce ambiguity and differences in interpretation, and hopefully reduce documentary discrepancy rates and the associated financial risks. This article examines the major changes introduced by the UCP 600 and comments on their likely impact on future L/C business. Whilst acknowledging some improvements were introduced in the UCP 600, the article concludes that a number of issues have been ignored to the detriment of traders. export finance; international banking regulations; international trade finance; letters of credit; UCP 600; financial risks. ...|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of economy in the world, {{people would like to}} spend more money to enjoy their life. In this way, service industry becomes more popular than manufacturing industry. In addition, although the main business of a company is production, it will provide additional services, such as after-sales services, to increase its products’ selling volume. At the same time, a good service quality should be improved and guaranteed by applying service guarantee. However, China is a developing country, and service industry has developed for just a few years, so companies in China are not familiar with how to provide services to their customers to satisfy their needs and wants. As a result, the main topic of this dissertation is to investigate the drivers and risks of applying service guarantee in three different sectors-Healthcare, white goods, and hotel in China, and put forward the suitable types of service guarantees to these sectors by analysing three influencing factors (consumer behaviour, industry characteristics, and operational issues). In order to achieve above objectives, both empirical data and secondary data should be collected. In the literature review, the researcher used secondary data and found gaps which need to be filled through using evidences in the real world. The researcher found that almost all kinds of service guarantees can reduce purchasing risks and protect consumers’ rights. In addition, different kinds of service guarantees have different benefits. While, designing a good service guarantee is difficult, and it needs to consider many factors, and different companies need to design different service guarantees according to their conditions. At the same time, the researcher found that some Chinese consumer behaviours, such as collectivism and cheating, characteristics of manufacturing industry, such as product-related services, and operational issues, such as distribution channel and some specific operations in hotel are the obstacles of implementing service guarantee in China. In the empirical researches, Siemens Healthcare, Elekta, Siemens electronic household appliances, Hilton hotel, KUNLUN hotel were analysed to give the further in-depth understanding of theories in literature review and put forward evidences of previous statements. The main findings of researcher were that manufacturing companies should use <b>conditional</b> service <b>guarantee</b> which needs to base on customers’ requirements, while service companies should use unconditional service guarantee, but they also need to understand their customers to reduce risks.

40|$|Purpose – Many service {{providers}} feel confident about their service quality and thus offer service guarantees to their customers. Yet service failures are inevitable. As guarantees {{can only be}} invoked when customers report service failures, firms are {{given the opportunity to}} redress the original failure potentially influencing customer outcomes. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide the first empirical investigation of whether excellence in service recovery affects customers’ intentions to invoke a service guarantee, thereby discriminating between <b>conditional</b> and unconditional <b>guarantees</b> and testing for the impact of customers’ individualistic vs collectivistic cultural orientation. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 171 respondents from four continents (spanning 23 countries) were recruited to participate in a quasi-experimental study in a hotel setting. A three-way analysis of variance was used to test the hypotheses. Findings – All customers are very likely to invoke the service guarantee after an unsatisfactory service recovery. When customers are satisfied with the service recovery, they report lower invoke intentions, except for collectivistic individuals who are still inclined to invoke an unconditional service guarantee after a satisfactory service recovery. The finding supports an in-group/out-group rationale, whereby collectivists tend to behave more opportunistically toward out-groups than individualistic customers. Originality/value – The study highlights the importance of excellence in service recovery, cultural differences and different types of service guarantees with respect to customers’ intentions to invoke the guarantee. The paper demonstrates how service guarantees should be designed in conjunction with service recovery strategies. Also, the paper shows that an unconditional service guarantee creates the condition in which collectivists might engage in opportunistic behavior; global {{service providers}} concerned about opportunistic customer claiming behavior thus might benefit from using <b>conditional</b> service <b>guarantees.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

Governments in all OECD countries have put in place various mechanisms aimed at providing public support for firms, including the provision of public funds, incentives, investment support, technical services and scientific and technological infrastructure. Identifying and measuring the impact of public support to industry is a difficult task. Recent OECD studies analyse transfers to industrial firms which are categorised in two groups: the first consisting of money transfers (for R&D and innovation contracts, and for procurement of innovated products and processes); the second of financial incentives (regular grants, reimbursable grants, interest rate subsidies, regular loans, <b>conditional</b> loans, <b>guarantees,</b> equity capital, tax concessions, mixed financial incentives) (OECD, 1997).

40|$|<b>Conditional</b> {{performance}} <b>guarantees</b> with risky collaterals {{are specific}} bonding instruments {{that are not}} credit extensions or require only a service fee. Instead, they resemble a credit default swap (CDS) that is essentially an insurance contract and can thus be priced accordingly. A CDS-based model is proposed here for pricing these instruments. The model incorporates both contractor default probability and the recovery risk of collateral. It also allows for explicit specification of bonding parameters such as the promised amount of payment {{in the event of}} default. For model implementation, a quasi-KMV-Merton approach is proposed for the estimation of contractor default probability. The historical market prices and basic accounting data of publicly traded construction firms in the Taiwan Economic Journal Database (TEJD) are used to test the model. The model demonstrates effective statistical power to distinguish categorized samples of the firms. It shows that the current industrial practice of asking a standard service rate of 1 % tends to charge too little for financially distressed firms and too much for normal ones.

40|$|In {{a recent}} pair of publications, Richard Bradley has offered two novel no-go theorems {{involving}} {{the principle of}} Preservation for <b>conditionals,</b> which <b>guarantees</b> that one’s prior conditional beliefs will exhibit {{a certain degree of}} inertia {{in the face of a}} change in one’s non-conditional beliefs. We first note that Bradley’s original discussions of these results—in which he finds motivation for rejecting Preservation, first in a principle of Commutativity, then in a doxastic analogue of the rule of modus ponens —are problematic in a significant number of respects. We then turn to a recent U-turn on his part, in which he winds up rescinding his commitment to modus ponens, on the grounds of a tension with the rule of Import-Export for conditionals. Here we offer an important positive contribution to the literature, settling the following crucial question that Bradley leaves unanswered: assuming that one gives up on full-blown modus ponens on the grounds of its incompatibility with Import-Export, what weakened version of the principle should one be settling for instead? Our discussion of the issue turns out to unearth an interesting connection between epistemic undermining and the apparent failures of modus ponens in McGee’s famous counterexamples...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} considerations for exporters in international trade transactions is the aspect of payment. In the context of financial risk management, Letters of Credit enable the exporter to substitute the credit risk of the buyer with that of his bank. The Letter of Credit is a <b>conditional</b> payment <b>guarantee,</b> relying on one hundred per cent documentary accuracy to trigger the payment. Less than one hundred per cent compliance means {{the loss of the}} payment guarantee. Non-compliance is a significant problem as, according to the International Chamber of Commerce, worldwide documentary discrepancy rates against Letter of Credit transactions have been estimated to be between sixty to seventy per cent. The mechanics of Letter of Credit transactions comprise a complex web of interactions between banks, traders and their service providers, providing a fertile ground for discrepancies and existing literature acknowledges this world-wide problem. In the UK, in 2000, losses were estimated to be AUD 305 million (£ 113) through non-compliant documents being presented under Letters of Credit – this amount did not include lost opportunities and cash flow problems. In the same year, a separate USA study of Letter of Credit transactions confirmed the high discrepancy rate, but also claimed that as long as buyers want the goods discrepancies did not translate into financial losses. The findings were refuted by others. It is the potential loss of revenue caused by the mismanagement of risk that is foremost in this research. It is estimated that the annual value of Letter of Credit business for manufacturing exports to ASEAN is approximately AUD 3. 5 billion, with losses estimated to be upwards of AUD 920 million. This research aims to assist in greater understanding of the usage of Letters of Credit and the dynamics that underpin these transactions leading to a greater understanding of the interactions between Australian exporters and ASEAN importers...|$|R

The first chapter {{is the product of}} my research experience as an intern at the Risk Management Department of Fondiaria-Sai S. p. A [...] I present a short review of the deterministic and stochastic claims reserving methods currently applied in practice and I develop a (standard) Over-Dispersed Poisson (ODP) Bayesian model for the estimation of the Outstanding Loss Liabilities (OLLs) of a line of business (LoB). I present the model, I illustrate the theoretical foundations of the MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) method and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm used in order to generate the non-standard posterior distributions. I apply the model to the Motor Third Party Liabil- ity LoB of Fondiaria-Sai S. p. A [...] Moreover, I explore the problem of computing the prudential reserve level of a multi-line non-life insurance company. In the second chapter, then, I present a full Bayesian model for assessing the reserve requirement of multiline Non-Life insurance companies. The model combines the Bayesian approach for the estimation of marginal distribution for the single Lines of Business and a Bayesian copula procedure for their aggregation. First, I consider standard copula aggregation for different copula choices. Second, I present the Bayesian copula technique. Up to my knowledge, this approach is totally new to stochastic claims reserving. The model allows to "mix" own-assessments of dependence between LoBs at a company level and market wide estimates. I present an application to an Italian multi-line insurance company and compare the results obtained aggregating using standard copulas and a Bayesian Gaussian copula. In the second part of my Dissertation I propose a theoretical model that studies optimal capital and organizational structure choices of financial groups which incorporate two or more business units. The group faces a VaR-type regulatory capital requirement. Financial conglomerates incorporate activities in different sectors either into a unique integrated entity, into legally separated divisions or in ownership-linked holding company/subsidiary structures. I model these different arrangements in a structural framework through different coinsurance links between units in the form of <b>conditional</b> <b>guarantees</b> issued by equityholders of a firm towards the debtholders of a unit of the same group. I study the effects of the use of such guarantees on optimal capital structural and organizational form choices. I calibrate model parameters to observed financial institutions' characteristics. I study how the capital is optimally held, {{the costs and benefits of}} limiting undercapitalization in some units and I address the issues of diversification at the holding's level and regulatory capital arbitrage. The last part of my Ph. D. Dissertation studies the hedging problem of life insurance policies, when the mortality rate is stochastic. The field developed recently, adapting well-established techniques widely used in finance to describe the evolution of rates of mortality. The chapter is joint work with my supervisor, prof. Elisa Luciano and Elena Vigna. It studies the hedging problem of life insurance policies, when the mortality and interest rates are stochastic. We focus primarily on stochastic mortality. We represent death arrival as the first jump time of a doubly stochastic process, i. e. a jump process with stochastic intensity. We propose a Delta-Gamma Hedging technique for mortality risk in this context. The risk factor against which to hedge is the difference between the actual mortality intensity in the future and its "forecast" today, the instantaneous forward intensity. We specialize the hedging technique first to the case in which survival intensities are affine, then to Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Feller processes, providing actuarial justifications for this restriction. We show that, without imposing no arbitrage, we can get equivalent probability measures under which the HJM condition for no arbitrage is satisfied. Last, we extend our results to the presence of both interest rate and mortality risk, when the forward interest rate follows a constant-parameter Hull and White process. We provide a UK calibrated example of Delta and Gamma Hedging of both mortality and interest rate risk...|$|R
2500|$|Spain left London in mid-April, but {{suffered}} shipwreck on {{the voyage}} {{and did not}} arrive in New Zealand until 8 December 1841. Some confusion surrounded his role: Russell had intended that Spain be the sole land commissioner, but Spain—possibly on discovering two other commissioners were already at work—told Hobson he would supervise their work. Hobson rejected the proposal, insisting the task was so vast it would require them all {{to be engaged in}} inquiries around the country. He directed Spain to proceed immediately to Wellington to investigate the New Zealand Company purchases that were defined in an agreement Hobson had made with the company in September 1841. In that agreement the Crown indicated its acceptance of certain earlier land purchases—110,000 acres at Port Nicholson, Porirua and Manawatu, 50,000 acres at Wanganui and 50,000 acres (later lifted to 60,000 acres) at New Plymouth—with the <b>guarantee</b> <b>conditional</b> on the company proving it had fairly extinguished the Maori title. Spain's task, then, was to first establish who had actually held the title to the lands before they were sold to the company, a difficult task in itself, and then find whether the sales were legitimate. Under instructions from Colonial Secretary Lord Stanley to Governor Robert FitzRoy, any land deemed to be in excess of a valid claim should be retained by the Crown. Stanley, who succeeded Russell in August 1841, explained: [...] "The excess is vested in the sovereign as representing and protecting the interest of society at large ... for the purposes of sale and settlement." ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{emergence}} of financial exposures between banks and introduces a novel game of financial network formation. It shows empirically that governance structures influence how banks use the interbank market to manage liquidity and that strategic factors are additional drivers of interbank lending for private banks (Ch. 2). It further develops a model of optimal bank behaviour {{in the absence of}} liquidity shocks considering the effect of an exogenous bailout probability (Ch. 3), and introduces a model of endogenous liquidity co-insurance formation (Ch. 4). The first chapter, The Purpose of Interbank Markets, tests competing theories of interbank lending using 43 quarters (2002 - 2012) of confidential data on the German banking sector and interbank market. It shows that banks use the interbank market for liquidity co-insurance as traditionally assumed. However, the importance of the liquidity management function is higher for regionally-focused credit cooperatives and savings banks than for private commercial banks. A distinct effect for private banks is identified; for private banks, increases in interbank liabilities are shown to correlate with a proxy for the bailout probability of banks. The chapter thus offers empirical support for an emerging literature on strategic behaviour in interbank markets and highlights the need to extend the traditional model of liquidity co-insurance. The second chapter, The Emergence of Interbank Exposures, develops a model showing that, even in the hypothetical absence of liquidity shocks, under some conditions the presence of <b>conditional</b> liability <b>guarantees</b> can lead to interbank exposures as an equilibrium outcome. It shows that such an equilibrium is characterised by banks of different sizes and asymmetric bank behaviour. Some banks are active only as lenders with others investing in a productive technology while borrowing in the interbank market. An equilibrium interbank rate is derived which depends on parameters characterising the bailout probability, including different parameters of government behaviour. The third chapter, Coordination and Competition in the Formation of Financial Networks, introduces a generalisation and extension of the seminal work of Allen and Gale (2000). It studies liquidity co-insurance between deposit-taking banks in an n-region economy. Both a static and a dynamic model of the endogenous formation of interbank liquidity co-insurance links are examined. Using a novel approach to model liquidity co-insurance, it is shown that contrary to previous findings it is not possible for banks with limited information to insure optimally against liquidity shocks. However, in a dynamic formulation of the model with best-response dynamics and learning, socially optimal insurance is an evolutionary stable equilibrium. The chapter also studies an extension to the model that introduces non-zero bailout probabilities, which endogenously leads to interbank networks consistent with the structure of interbank exposure networks documented empirically. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{special report}} {{on the cover of}} the June 2016 issue of the IEEE Spectrum {{magazine}} reads: "can we trust robots?" In a world that has been experiencing a seemingly irreversible process by which autonomous systems have been given increasingly more space in strategic areas such as transportation, manufacturing, energy supply, planetary exploration, and even medical surgeries, it is natural that we start asking ourselves if these systems could be held at the same or even higher levels of safety than we expect from humans. In an effort to make a contribution towards a world of autonomy that we can trust, this thesis argues that one necessary step in this direction is the endowment of autonomous agents with the ability to dynamically adapt to their environment while meeting strict safety guarantees. From a technical standpoint, we propose that autonomous agents in safety-critical applications be able to execute conditional plans (or policies) within risk bounds (also referred to as chance constraints). By being conditional, the plan allows the autonomous agent to adapt to its environment in real-time by conditioning the choice of activity to be executed on the agent's current level of knowledge, or belief, about the true state of world. This belief state is, in turn, a function of the history of potentially noisy sensor observations gathered by the agent from the environment. With respect to bounded risk, it refers to the fact that executing such <b>conditional</b> plans should <b>guarantee</b> to keep the agent "safe" - as defined by sets of state constraints - with high probability, while moving away from the conservatism of minimum risk approaches. In this thesis, we propose Chance-Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (CC-POMDP's) as a formalism for conditional risk-bounded planning under uncertainty. Moreover, we present Risk-bounded AO* (RAO*), a heuristic forward search-based algorithm that searches for solutions to a CC-POMDP by leveraging admissible utility and risk heuristics to simultaneously guide the search and perform early pruning of overly-risky policy branches. In an effort to facilitate the specification of risk-bounded behavior by human modelers, we also present the Chance-constrained Reactive Model-based Programming Language (cRMPL), a novel variant of RMPL that incorporates chance constraints as part of its syntax. Finally, in support of the temporal planning applications with duration uncertainty that this thesis is concerned about, we present the Polynomial-time Algorithm for Risk-aware Scheduling (PARIS) and its extension to conditional scheduling of Probabilistic Temporal Plan Networks (PTPN's). The different tools and algorithms developed in the context of this thesis are combined to form the Conditional Planning for Autonomy with Risk (CLARK) system, a risk-aware conditional planning system that can generate chance-constrained, dynamic temporal plans for autonomous agents that must operate under uncertainty. With respect to our empirical validation, each component of CLARK is benchmarked against the relevant state of the art throughout the chapters, followed by several demonstrations of the whole CLARK system working in tandem with other building blocks of an architecture for autonomy. by Pedro Henrique de Rodrigues Quemel e Assis Santana.

40|$|This report {{highlights}} {{the conditions for}} young people trying to establish themselves in the labour market in the Nordic countries. The aim has been to examine similarities and differences with regard to specific aspects of the welfare systems {{with a focus on}} upper secondary school level and political initiatives in the labour market. The passage of students through upper secondary school, transition, has been at the forefront {{in the study of the}} countries. In several chapters, the authors have referred to international youth research and working life research. The aims of welfare policy in the Nordic countries are similar. However, the report shows that conditions for young people to be able to support themselves and establish themselves in the labour market are different. The Nordic countries have different systems to regulate the transition of young people from school to working life. There are large variations in both the design of vocational education at upper secondary school level and political initiatives in the labour market. The report shows that the design of the systems has an impact on the conditions for young people to establish themselves in the labour market. Some of the large variations that can be seen in transition, employment rates and relative rates of employment among young people and young adults in the Nordic countries can be reasonably explained by differences in the design of vocational education at upper secondary school level and labour market policy. Labour market conditions for young people are less favourable in Finland and Sweden than in the other Nordic countries, although the situation in Finland has improved significantly in recent years. Conditions for young people are most favourable in Iceland, if only the unemployment rates and proportion of employed are taken into account. However, in Iceland there are still a relatively high proportion of young adults who have not completed upper secondary education and this can create problems in the future. Similarities in vocational education and employment policy: The proportion of young people who go on to study after the compulsory level is high in the Nordic countries. This also applies to the proportion of young people who have completed an upper secondary school education at the age of 24. But the range is quite large, from 90 percent in Finland to over 60 percent in Iceland. In the Nordic countries young women are more successful in the educational system than young men. Young women achieve higher grades and are more likely to seek higher education. Young men are over-represented in upper secondary vocational education. In vocational education the distribution according to gender follows a traditional pattern. In all countries there were greater transition problems in vocational education than in the theoretical education. This also reflects socio-economic conditions. Children of parents with a lower level of education and lower incomes generally perform less well in school and are over-represented in vocational education. Young adults who have not completed upper secondary school education are heavily over-represented among the unemployed and inactive, with the exception of those from Iceland. Labour market policy has been influenced by activation policy. The focus has increasingly been to break long-term dependency and provide vocational education for those who lack it. Subsidies have increasingly been made <b>conditional.</b> Youth <b>Guarantees</b> with promises of maximum unemployment periods and obligations to take action have been established in all Nordic countries except Iceland. Differences in vocational education and employment policy: In Finland and Sweden vocational education located in schools and designed to give general eligibility to higher education is the dominant form, even though apprenticeship programmes exist to a limited degree. The other countries have apprenticeship programmes that are connected to a regulated system for professional qualifications. In Denmark and Norway apprenticeship programmes have a very strong position, but are constructed according to very different models. In Iceland apprenticeship programmes as well as the vocational education located in schools generally have a much weaker position. Apprenticeship programmes are no guarantee for high transition. Transition problems within the Danish youth education are greater than those in Finland, for example, although Finland has a school located vocational education that is more academically demanding. In Sweden, problems with the transition in upper secondary school are significant. The high proportion of pupils with immigrant backgrounds are likely to affect the results negatively relative to the other Nordic countries, but it is far from the only explanation as to why the transition problems seem to be particularly high in Sweden. What seems to help alleviate the problems in Denmark, Finland and Norway, compared to Sweden, is that there is a more diverse range of educational programmes at various levels. There is no upper age limit - or time limit- for upper secondary education, the fundamental idea is that everyone has the right to complete an education. More extensive efforts are made to prepare pupils for upper secondary education, including voluntary supplementary years, while the follow-up of those who drop out of school is more comprehensive and action-oriented. The Norwegian model for the responsibility of following–up those who drop out stands out as particularly interesting. The conditions for young people to establish themselves in the labour market are also related to the size and alignment of labour market policy. Sweden spends relatively little real resources on specific youth activities within the framework of labour market policy. This is reflected not only in higher rates of youth unemployment, but also in a fairly large proportion of inactive young adults. Whilst in Denmark and Norway the unemployed and low skilled have been activated through various educational courses, long-term unemployment and long-term dependency on benefits has been more common amongst young people in Sweden. It should also be noted that Sweden stands out by differentiating to a greater degree between the regular educational system and political initiatives in the labour market. Regular education will not in principle be present within the framework of labour market policy. This reduces the discretion of labour market policy, at the same time the possibility of providing basic education for young adults is limited. From the analysis of the study of the countries, we can present some preliminary conclusions: Initiatives aimed at young people who have dropped out or are at risk of dropping out of school and for young unemployed and inactive people, benefit from a closer coordination between different participants such as: schools, employment agencies and social services. A vague division of responsibility reduces the effectiveness of the initiatives. In several Nordic countries there is a responsibility at the municipal level to follow-up young people who have dropped out of upper secondary school. However, experience has shown that it is not sufficient that municipalities are obliged to keep themselves informed of the activities of the young. This responsibility should be linked with activation initiatives. Basic vocational education in various forms and at different levels should be offered within the framework of the upper secondary school. General eligibility for higher education need not be an obvious target for all courses and all students. There should be more opportunities for young adults (about 20 - 29 years old) to participate in basic vocational education. This possibility is absent in several Nordic countries. Most of the vocational education offered to this age group is at post secondary level. The distinction between employment policies and regular education should be reviewed. The fair division as well as powerful motivations for effectiveness justifies a more flexible use of those resources available to labour market policy...|$|R
40|$|A new {{paper by}} STEPHEN DINHAM, LAWRENCE INGVARSON and ELIZABETH KLEINHENZ {{outlines}} an ambitious proposal to revitalise teaching THERE {{have been a}} variety of (seemingly) simplistic, populist approaches {{to the challenge of}} improving teacher quality. These include “merit” or “performance” pay; payment by student examination results; raising entry standards to teaching; higher teacher pay generally; smaller class sizes; standardised testing; publishing “league tables” of school performance and sacking poorly performing teachers. These measures frequently lack finer detail on how they might operate, are not supported by evidence and represent an ad hoc, fragmented response. Earlier this year, the Business Council of Australia commissioned staff at the Australian Council for Educational Research to write a position paper for the BCA on quality teaching. Our paper, “Investing in Teacher Quality: Doing What Matters Most,” was released this week as part of a BCA publication Teaching Talent: The Best Teachers for Australia’s Schools. The report has received wide publicity and general support from the profession. Where the approach outlined in the BCA report differs from previous efforts in the area of raising teacher quality, and therefore student achievement, lies {{in the nature of the}} comprehensive, national, integrated approach that is advocated. What did the BCA report find? • The quality of teaching is the main driver of successful student learning outcomes. • Australia’s teaching profession and its schools constitute an infrastructure that is critical to its survival in an increasingly global economy. • Every student deserves teachers who are suited to teaching, well trained and qualified, highly skilled, caring and committed to moving forward the learning of their students. • One of the main roles of leadership in professions is to build a framework for professional learning from registration to advanced levels of standards, and systems for providing assessments and certification for members who reach those standards. It important, therefore, to strengthen leadership in quality teaching at the wider professional level as well as at the level of the individual school. • Education in Australia is still highly bureaucratised, and it is time to question whether bureaucratic management of schools by state education departments is sufficient to deliver the kind of leadership that influences teachers’ practice significantly or improves student learning outcomes. • Stakeholders are unanimous that the first step in achieving improved outcomes in education is to attract the best people into teaching. • Salary may not be a strong reason why current teachers have chosen to teach, but it is a strong reason why many abler graduates choose not to teach, and this is cause for considerable concern if we want our education system to remain among the best in the world. There is no justification for assuming from this that our society can continue to get away with not paying teachers what they are worth. Research studies also constantly confirm that salary and working conditions are the main reasons why many good teachers leave the profession. • Present arrangements in teaching do not encourage, reward or indeed require advanced professional learning. • It is clear that there is a broad consensus that action is needed to radically strengthen procedures for recognising and rewarding teachers who reach high teaching standards. • Who really believes that a top salary for classroom teachers of about $ 70, 000 means we place sufficient value on teachers’ work to attract the best university graduates? Who really believes that the typical office spaces in which teachers are expected to prepare and assess student work and carry out their business are indicators of an attractive and esteemed profession? • Attracting enough people into teacher education and attracting people of suitable quality are two major issues that tend to work against each other. Any decline in the attractiveness of teaching is cause for concern, particularly if this results in universities lowering entry standards to fill their allocated quotas for teacher education students. When decline in the attractiveness of teaching as a career coincides with projected teacher shortages, this increases the pressure for entry standards to fall. This is the situation we face at present. Entry standards to teaching must not be allowed to fall further. Rather, they should rise. • The next step is to prepare future teachers through teacher education programs that meet the highest standards. It is becoming clear that the most effective way of achieving quality and consistency will be through a system of national accreditation of teacher education courses. • There is a pressing need for a unified national approach to managing teacher demand and supply. • There are no cost-neutral ways to ensure that in the future Australia will have a teaching profession equal to the best in the world. But there will be major costs if we do not. Fortunately, there is broad public recognition of the need for better pay and conditions for teachers. This is <b>conditional,</b> however, on <b>guarantees</b> that it will be linked to sound evidence of improving teacher quality and professional performance. • Newly conceived career paths are needed for the teaching profession to ensure that teachers have strong incentives to engage in the type of professional learning that leads to high teaching standards and improves student learning outcomes. Salary structures for teachers need to be more effective as instruments for promoting widespread use of successful teaching practices. • Although there is strong agreement that teacher quality is fundamental, it is currently difficult to find evidence of coherent, concerted, coordinated policy efforts at state and federal levels focused on teacher quality. Accountability for ensuring quality teachers and school leaders is unclear and diffused. • Education policy needs to focus more clearly on what matters most to student learning - concerted, long-term policies and strategies to assure quality in the teaching profession. We know that good teachers matter, but we must start to act as if we really believed it. What does the BCA report advocate? First, a new national agency should be established with one sole function: to establish and provide a voluntary advanced certification system for teachers. (Initial registration is compulsory and remains the responsibility of state registration bodies). Second, this agency should be constituted so that it brings together all the major stakeholders with an interest in recognising and rewarding quality teaching. Third, the agency should offer certification at two levels beyond initial registration as a competent teacher: the Accomplished Teacher level and the Leading Teacher level. Salaries for Accomplished Teachers should reach a level that is twice the starting salary for graduate teachers. Leading Teacher salaries should reach a salary that is 2. 5 times starting salaries. Fourth, standards at the Accomplished Teacher level should differentiate between what accomplished teachers know and do within each specialist field of teaching (early childhood specialist, primary school specialist, high school English specialist, etc). Standards at the Leading Teacher level should differentiate between what teacher leaders know and do to promote improved learning outcomes among teams of teachers. Fifth, the main purposes of the system will be twofold: to provide a basis for offering more attractive salaries and career paths to graduates and those who seek to change careers; and to strengthen incentives for professional learning and widespread use of successful practices. The report also called for national standards for teacher education courses, national accreditation of such courses and a minimum ENTER score of 75 for entry to all courses. It should be noted that the BCA report estimated that it will take ten years or more to reach a stage where 50 per cent of teachers have been certified at the Accomplished and Leading Teacher levels, based on the voluntary certification of approximately 10, 000 teachers per annum. Contrary to recent press reporting and reaction, only a minority of teachers - no more than 20 per cent - would receive a salary equivalent to around $ 130, 000 in today’s value. This proposal does not call for or constitute a doubling of the teacher wage bill. Revitalising teaching What is clear is the necessary relationship between the development of teaching as a profession and the development of more effective systems for teacher evaluation and professional development based on profession-defined standards. As we contemplate strategies for revitalising the teaching profession and assuring the quality of Australia’s education system in the future, the need for an independent national body with a clearly defined certification function has become imperative. • Stephen Dinham, Lawrence Ingvarson and Elizabeth Kleinhenz are researchers with the Australian Council for Educational Research Photo: iStockphoto. co...|$|R
