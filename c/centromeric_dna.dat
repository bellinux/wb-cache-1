50|$|The <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> is {{normally}} in a heterochromatin state, which {{is essential for}} the recruitment of the cohesin complex that mediates sister chromatid cohesion after DNA replication as well as coordinating sister chromatid separation during anaphase. In this chromatin, the normal histone H3 is replaced with a centromere-specific variant, CENP-A in humans. The presence of CENP-A is believed to be important for the assembly of the kinetochore on the centromere. CENP-C has been shown to localise almost exclusively to these regions of CENP-A associated chromatin. In human cells, the histones are found to be most enriched for H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 which are known heterochromatic modifications.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> {{sequence}} fis not the key {{determinant of}} centromeric identity in metazoans, {{it is thought}} that epigenetic inheritance {{plays a major role in}} specifying the centromere. The daughter chromosomes will assemble centromeres in the same place as the parent chromosome, independent of sequence. It has been proposed that histone H3 variant CENP-A (Centromere Protein A) is the epigenetic mark of the centromere. The question arises whether there must be still some original way in which the centromere is specified, even if it is subsequently propagated epigenetically. If the centromere is inherited epigenetically from one generation to the next, the problem is pushed back to the origin of the first metazoans.|$|E
5000|$|In higher eukaryotes, the {{recruitment}} of CENP-A nucleosomes to existing centromeres is an epigenetic process, independent of the underlying DNA sequence. In S.pombe, de novo recruitment of the CENP-A to the centromere {{is believed to be}} controlled by [...] "centromeric" [...] heterochromatin surrounding the centromere, and by an RNAi mechanism. The RNAi is cut to form siRNA; this complexes with the protein Chp1, which then binds the centromeric heterochromatin. This helps recruit other proteins, ultimately resulting in a protein complex that forms cohesin between two sister chromatids at the centromeric heterochromatin. This cohesin is believed to be essential in replacing the centromere H3 with CENP-A. CENP-A is one of the epigenetic changes that is believed to distinguish <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> from other DNA. Once the CENP-A has been added, the centromere becomes self-propagating, and the surrounding heterochromatin/RNAi mechanism is no longer necessary.|$|E

40|$|Gene {{expression}} can be silenced by {{proximity to}} heterochromatin blocks containing <b>centromeric</b> α-satellite <b>DNA.</b> This {{has been shown}} experimentally through cis-acting chromosome rearrangements resulting in linear genomic proximity, or through trans-acting changes resulting in intranuclear spatial proximity. Although {{it has long been}} been established that centromeres are nonrandomly distributed during interphase, little is known of what determines the three-dimensional organization of these silencing domains in the nucleus. Here, we propose a model that predicts the intranuclear positioning of centromeric heterochromatin for each individual chromosome. With the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy, we show that the distribution of <b>centromeric</b> α-satellite <b>DNA</b> in human lymphoid cells synchronized at G 0 /G 1 is unique for most individual chromosomes. Regression analysis reveals a tight correlation between nuclear distribution of <b>centromeric</b> α-satellite <b>DNA</b> and the presence of G-dark bands in the corresponding chromosome. Centromeres surrounded by G-dark bands are preferentially located at the nuclear periphery, whereas centromeres of chromosomes with a lower content of G-dark bands tend to be localized at the nucleolus. Consistent with the model, a t(11; 14) translocation that removes G-dark bands from chromosome 11 causes a repositioning of the centromere, which becomes less frequently localized at the nuclear periphery and more frequently associated with the nucleolus. The data suggest that “chromosomal environment” {{plays a key role in}} the intranuclear organization of centromeric heterochromatin. Our model further predicts that facultative heterochromatinization of distinct genomic regions may contribute to cell-type specific patterns of centromere localization...|$|R

50|$|Micronuclei {{formation}} {{may also}} result from chromosome malsegregation during anaphase. Hypomethylation of cytosine in centromeric and pericentromeric areas and higher-order repeats of satellite DNA in <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> {{can result in}} such chromosomal loss events. Classical satellite DNA is normally heavily methylated at cytosine residues but may become almost fully unmethylated due to ICF syndrome (Immunodeficiency, centromere instability, and facial anomalies syndrome) or after treatment by DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. Since assembly of kinetochore proteins at centromeres {{is affected by the}} methylation of cytosine and histone proteins, a reduction in heterochromatin integrity as a result of hypomethylation can interfere with microtubule attachment to chromosomes and with the sensing of tension from correct microtubule-kinetochore connections. Other possible causes of chromosome loss that could lead to micronuclei formation are defects in kinetochore and microtubule interactions, defects in mitotic spindle assembly, mitosis check point defects, abnormal centrosome amplification, and telomeric end fusions that result in dicentric chromosomes that detach from the spindle during anaphase. Micronuclei originating from chromosome loss events and acentric chromosome fragments can be distinguished using pancentromeric DNA probes.|$|E

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with the isolated clones as a probe showed that these repetitive sequences were localized in the telomeric regions of chromosomes in both species. Southern and dot blot analyses suggested conservation of homologous sequences with similar repeat unit in other salmonids including the species of the genus Oncorhynchus and Salvelinus, but lack or scarcity of such sequences in the genus Hucho and Salmo. Similarly, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based cloning of satellite DNA referring to a reported Rainbow trout (O. mykiss) centromeric sequence was successful for the Oncorhynchus, Salvelinus and Hucho species. The obtained satellite DNA clones were localized with FISH in the centromeric regions of chromosomes of the species from these three genera. Although PCR cloning of the <b>centromeric</b> satellite <b>DNA</b> had failed in the Salmo species due to some base changes in the priming sites, dot blot hybridization analysis suggested conservation of homologous satellite DNA in the genus Salmo as in the other three genera.

40|$|Transcripts of <b>centromeric</b> {{satellite}} <b>DNAs</b> {{are known}} {{to play a role}} in heterochromatin formation as well as in establishment of the kinetochore. However, little is known about basic mechanisms of satellite DNA expression within constitutive heterochromatin and its regulation. Here we present comprehensive analysis of transcription of abundant <b>centromeric</b> satellite <b>DNA,</b> PRAT from beetle Palorus ratzeburgii (Coleoptera). This satellite is characterized by preservation and extreme sequence conservation among evolutionarily distant insect species. PRAT is expressed in all three developmental stages: larvae, pupae and adults at similar level. Transcripts are abundant comprising 0. 033 % of total RNA and are heterogeneous in size ranging from 0. 5 kb up to more than 5 kb. Transcription proceeds from both strands but with 10 fold different expression intensity and transcripts are not processed into siRNAs. Most of the transcripts (80 %) are not polyadenylated and remain in the nucleus while a small portion is exported to the cytoplasm. Multiple, irregularly distributed transcription initiation sites as well as termination sites have been mapped within the PRAT sequence using primer extension and RLM-RACE. The presence of cap structure as well as poly(A) tails in a portion of the transcripts indicate RNA polymerase II – dependent transcription and a putative polymerase II promoter site overlaps the most conserved part of the PRAT sequence. The treatment of larvae with alpha-amanitin decreases the level of PRAT transcripts at concentrations that selectively inhibit pol II activity. In conclusion, stable, RNA polymerase II dependant transcripts of abundant <b>centromeric</b> satellite <b>DNA,</b> not regulated by RNAi, have been identified and characterized.

40|$|Centromere protein B, {{which is}} {{involved}} in centromere formation, binds to centromeric repetitive DNA by recognizing a nucleotide motif called the CENP-B box. Humans have large numbers of CENP-B boxes in the centromeric repetitive DNA of their autosomes and X chromosome.

On each chromosome we found an ∼ 150 - to 300 -kbp region of enrichment for all three proteins. These regions correspond to intervals predicted to be <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> by genetic mapping and DNA sequence analyses. By ChIP-seq we found extensive colocalization of CenH 3, CEN-C, CEN-T, and histone H 3 K 9 trimethylation (H 3 K 9 me 3). In contrast, H 3 K 4 me 2, which has been found at the cores of plant, fission yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian centromeres, was not enriched in Neurospora <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA.</b> DNA methylation was most pronounced at the periphery of <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA.</b> Mutation of dim- 5, which encodes an H 3 K 9 methyltransferase responsible for nearly all H 3 K 9 me 3, resulted in altered distribution of CenH 3 -green fluorescent protein (GFP).

The FISH patterns of seven non-satellite sequence elements generated from the BAC clone showed mainly specific to centromeres of the Indian muntjac representing novel <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNAs</b> of the species.

40|$|AbstractThe pathway of {{molecular}} interactions leading to kinetochore assembly on mammalian chromosomes is unknown. Kinetochores could be specified by structural features of <b>centromeric</b> satellite <b>DNA</b> [1 – 3] or by specific DNA sequences, analogous to budding yeast centromeres, interspersed in <b>centromeric</b> satellite <b>DNA</b> arrays [4, 5]. Alternatively, kinetochores could be epigenetic structures that replicate without strict dependence on DNA sequence [6 – 8]. We purified kinetochore-associated chromatin from human chromosomes by immunoprecipitation of CENP-A, a centromere-specific histone H 3 homologue {{located in the}} inner plate of the kinetochore [6, 9, 10]. Hybridization and DNA sequence analyses of cloned kinetochore DNA fragments revealed α-satellite as the predominant sequence associated with CENP-A. A major site of micrococcal nuclease digestion was identified by mapping the termini of α-satellite clones, suggesting that the inner kinetochore plate contains phased arrays of CENP-A–α-satellite nucleosomes. These experiments demonstrate {{for the first time}} that complex satellite DNA is a structural component of the kinetochore. Further, because complex satellite DNA is evolutionarily unconserved, these results suggest that molecular recognition events necessary for kinetochore formation take place at the level of DNA conformation or epigenetic mechanisms rather than DNA sequence per se...|$|R
40|$|Centromeres of {{mammalian}} chromosomes {{are rich}} in repetitive DNAs that are packaged into specialized nucleoprotein structures called heterochromatin. In humans, the major <b>centromeric</b> repetitive <b>DNA,</b> alpha-satellite DNA, has been extensively sequenced and shown to contain binding sites for CENP-B, an 80 -kDa centromeric autoantigen. The present report reveals that African green monkey (AGM) cells, which contain extensive alpha-satellite arrays at centromeres, appear to lack the well-characterized CENP-B binding site (the CENP-B box). We show that AGM cells express a functional CENP-B homolog that binds to the CENP-B box and is recognized by several independent anti-CENP-B antibodies. However, three independent assays fail to reveal CENP-B binding sites in AGM DNA. Methods used include a gel mobility shift competition assay using purified AGM alpha-satellite, a novel kinetic electrophoretic mobility shift assay competition protocol using bulk genomic DNA, and bulk sequencing of 76 AGM alpha-satellite monomers. Immunofluorescence studies reveal the presence of significant levels of CENP-B antigen dispersed diffusely throughout the nuclei of interphase cells. These experiments reveal a paradox. CENP-B is highly conserved among mammals, yet its DNA binding site is conserved in human and mouse genomes {{but not in the}} AGM genome.

40|$|During cell division, {{segregation}} of sister chromatids to daughter cells {{is achieved by}} the poleward pulling force of microtubules, which attach to the chromatids {{by means of a}} multiprotein complex, the kinetochore. Kinetochores assemble at the <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> organized by specialized centromeric nucleosomes. In contrast to other eukaryotes, which typically have large repetitive centromeric regions, budding yeast CEN DNA is defined by a 125 bp sequence and assembles a single centromeric nucleosome. In budding yeast, as well as in other eukaryotes, the Cse 4 histone variant (known in vertebrates as CENP-A) is believed to substitute for histone H 3 at the centromeric nucleosome. However, the exact composition of the CEN nucleosome remains a subject of debate. We report the use of a novel ChIP approach to reveal the composition of the centromeric nucleosome and its localization on CEN DNA in budding yeast. Surprisingly, we observed a strong interaction of H 3, as well as Cse 4, H 4, H 2 A, and H 2 B, but not histone chaperone Scm 3 (HJURP in human) with the <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA.</b> H 3 localizes to <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> at all stages of the cell cycle.

40|$|<b>Centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> is {{generally}} composed of large blocks of tandem satellite repeats that change rapidly due to loss of old arrays {{and expansion of}} new repeat classes. This extreme heterogeneity of <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> is difficult to reconcile with the conservation of the eukaryotic chromosome segregation machinery. Histone H 3 -like proteins, including Cid in Drosophila melanogaster, are a unique chromatin component of centromeres. In comparisons between closely related species of Drosophila, we find an excess of replacement changes that have been fixed since the separation of D. melanogaster and D. simulans, suggesting adaptive evolution. The last adaptive changes appear to have occurred recently, as evident from a reduction in polymorphism in the melanogaster lineage. Adaptive evolution has occurred both in the long N-terminal tail {{as well as in}} the histone fold of Cid. In the histone fold, the replacement changes have occurred in the region proposed to mediate binding to DNA. We propose that this rapid evolution of Cid is driven by a response to the changing satellite repeats at centromeres. Thus, centromeric H 3 -like proteins may act as adaptors between evolutionarily labile <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> and the conserved kinetochore machinery...|$|E

To elucidate the AGM CENP-B-CENP-B box interaction, we have analyzed the gene structure, expression, biochemical properties, and centromeric localization of its CENP-B. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cloned AGM CENP-B gene was established to be highly homologous to that of human and mouse CENP-B. In particular, the DNA binding and homodimer formation domains demonstrated 100 % identity to their human and mouse counterparts. Immunoblotting and DNA mobility shift analyses revealed CENP-B to be expressed in AGM cell lines. As predicted from the gene structure, the AGM CENP-B in the cell extracts exhibited the same DNA binding specificity and homodimer forming activity as human CENP-B. By indirect immunofluorescent staining of AGM mitotic cells with anti-CENP-B antibodies, a centromere-specific localization of AGM CENP-B could be demonstrated. We also isolated AGM alpha-satellite DNA with a CENP-B box-like sequence with CENP-B affinity.

Deletion of the CaCse 4 p-binding region of chromosome 7 results in a high rate of loss of the altered chromosome, confirming that CaCse 4 p, a centromeric histone in the CENP-A family, indeed identifies the functional <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> of Can. albicans. The CaCse 4 p-rich regions not only lack conserved DNA motifs of point (40 kb) centromeres, but also each chromosome of Can. albicans contains a different and unique CaCse 4 p-rich <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence, a centromeric property previously unobserved in other organisms...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} analyses on the centromere and {{its associated}} proteins, detailed studies of <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> structure have provided limited information about its topography in condensed chromatin. We have developed a method with correlative fluorescence light microscopy and atomic force microscopy that investigates the physical and structural organization of -satellite DNA sequences {{in the context of}} its associated protein, CENP-B, on human metaphase chromosome topography. Comparison of <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA</b> and protein distribution patterns in fixed homologous chromosomes indicates that CENP-B and -satellite DNA are distributed distinctly from one another and relative to observed centromeric ridge topography. Our approach facilitates correlated studies of multiple chromatin components comprising higher-order structures of human metaphase chromosomes. 9 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

40|$|Kinetochores are {{composed}} {{of a large number}} of protein complexes that must be properly assembled on DNA to attach chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and to coordinate their segregation with the advance of the cell cycle. CBF 3 is an inner kinetochore complex in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that nucleates the recruitment of all other kinetochore proteins to <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA.</b> Skp 1 p and Sgt 1 p act through the core CBF 3 subunit, Ctf 13 p, and are required for CBF 3 to associate with <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA.</b> To investigate the contribution of Skp 1 p and Sgt 1 p to CBF 3 function, we have used a combination of in vitro binding assays and a unique protocol for synchronizing the assembly of kinetochores in cells. We have found that the interaction between Skp 1 p and Sgt 1 p is critical for the assembly of CBF 3 complexes. CBF 3 assembly is not restricted during the cell cycle and occurs in discrete steps; Skp 1 p and Sgt 1 p contribute to a final, rate-limiting step in assembly, the binding of the core CBF 3 subunit Ctf 13 p to Ndc 10 p. The assembly of CBF 3 is opposed by its turnover and disruption of this balance compromises kinetochore function without affecting kinetochore formation on <b>centromeric</b> <b>DNA...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{high-quality}} draft {{sequence of the}} genome of the horse (Equus caballus). The genome is relatively repetitive but has little segmental duplication. Chromosomes appear to have undergone few historical rearrangements: 53 % of equine chromosomes show conserved synteny to a single human chromosome. Equine chromosome 11 is shown to have an evolutionary new centromere devoid of <b>centromeric</b> satellite <b>DNA,</b> suggesting that <b>centromeric</b> function may arise before satellite repeat accumulation. Linkage disequilibrium, showing the influences of early domestication of large herds of female horses, is intermediate in length between dog and human, and there is long-range haplotype sharing among breeds.

40|$|Abstract. We {{report the}} {{interaction}} between a human centromere antigen and an alphoid <b>DNA,</b> a human <b>centromeric</b> satellite <b>DNA,</b> which consists of 170 -bp repeating units. A cloned alphoid DNA fragment incubated with a HeLa cell nuclear extract is selectively immunoprecipitated by the anticentromere sera from scleroderma patients. Immunoprecipitation of the DNA made by primer extension defines the 17 -bp segment on the alphoid DNA that is required for formation of DNA-antigen complex. On the other hand, when proteins bound to the biotinylated alphoid DNA carrying the 17 -bp motif are recovered by streptavidin agarose and immunoblotted, the 80 -kD centromere antigen (CENP-B) is detected. DNA binding experiments for proteins immunoprecipitated with anticentromere serum...|$|R
40|$|Three DNA hypomethylation mutants of the {{flowering}} plant Arabidopsis thaliana were isolated by screening mutagenized populations for plants containing <b>centromeric</b> repetitive <b>DNA</b> arrays susceptible to digestion by a restriction endonuclease that was sensitive to methylated cytosines. The mutations are recessive, {{and at least}} two are alleles of a single locus, designated DDM 1 (for decrease in DNA methylation). Amounts of 5 -methylcytosine were reduced over 70 percent in ddm 1 mutants. Despite this reduction in DNA methylation levels, ddm 1 mutants developed normally and exhibited no striking morphological phenotypes. However, the ddm 1 mutations are associated with a segregation distortion phenotype. The ddm 1 mutations were used to demonstrate that de novo DNA methylation in vivo is slow...|$|R
