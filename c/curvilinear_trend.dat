40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} investigate the development of tem-perature regulation in Bobwhite quail. In experiment 1, eight groups of chicks were tested at 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 days of age. Body temperatures showed a <b>curvilinear</b> <b>trend,</b> increasing from 1 to 20 days and then decreasing to 30 days of age. Body temperature within some groups also increased with testing order of the chicks and this effect interacted with age. In experiment 2, one group of chicks was tested {{at each of the}} above ages. After determination of body tem-perature, each chick at each age was cooled for 30 minutes at 24 ° C. and its body temperature again recorded. The same <b>curvilinear</b> <b>trend</b> in body temperatures with age was evident in this group; however, an increase in body temperature with testing order only occurred at 5 days of age. When cooled, chicks showed a decrease in body temperature of approximately 9 °C. at 1 day of age and were able to maintain body temperature by 30 days of age.

However, it is not yet clear whether popularity is uniquely related to different functions of aggression. In this study, we examined associations between peer-perceived popularity, and reactive and proactive aggression using a cross-sectional and a longitudinal design. Yearly sociometric measures of popularity, and reactive and proactive aggression were gathered from 266 seventh and eight grade adolescents (M age grade 7 ¼ 12. 80, SD age ¼. 40). Popularity was positively correlated with proactive aggression and negatively correlated with reactive aggression, both concurrently as over time. <b>Curvilinear</b> <b>trends</b> indicated that a significant minority of low versus high popular adolescents showed both functions of aggression.

Results further indicated that youth with PTS had sharper morning declines and relatively higher evening levels (i. e., a greater curve in the daily trend) than nontraumatized youth.  Conclusions Findings help to elucidate the physiological basis for altered arousal patterns in youth with PTS. Traumatized youth showed wider daily fluctuations in cortisol levels when these trends were modeled in a curvilinear fashion. The findings help to describe the nature of stress dysregulation in trauma-exposed youth and may have implications for clarifying some of the apparent inconsistencies in the literature...|$|R

In Study 1, 235 10 th-grade adolescents’ overt, relational, and reputational forms of aggression and victimization were assessed. Functions of aggression (instrumental, reactive, bullying) within each form were also examined. Results supported the general prediction that aggression is associated with high peer-perceived popularity, but low likability (i. e., social preference) among peers. Significant <b>curvilinear</b> <b>trends</b> revealed a subtle association between aggression and low levels of popularity as well. Regarding forms and functions, results indicated that both the provocateurs and targets of reputational aggression had high levels of peer-perceived popularity; proactive uses of aggression were also associated with high popularity among adolescents, while reactive aggression was associated with low social preference. Longitudinal analyses of the same participants in Study 2 indicated that high peer-perceived popularity and low social preference predicted all forms of aggressive behavior over a 17 -month interval. Overall, the results reveal complex associations between aggression and status that help to explain possible social reinforcement associated with aggression and clarify the pattern of heterogeneous aggressive behaviors exhibited by adolescents at various points along the status continuum...|$|R

Calculations based upon known major element partitioning between mafic minerals, plagioclase and subalkaline basaltic liquids indicate that fractional crystallization coupled with cotectic accumulation of mafic minerals and plagioclase will produce mineral composition trends on the Mg versus An diagram with slopes greater than 1 for cases where An is approximately greater than Mg. Furthermore, fractional crystallization of basaltic magmas with alkali concentrations approaching zero will produce near vertical Mg versus An trends. Therefore, the steep slopes of the lunar rock series are consistent with relatively simple fractionation processes. The relatively flat slope of mineral compositions from gabbros collected from the mid-Atlantic ridge at 26 deg N is inconsistent with simple fractionation processes, and calculations show that periodic refilling of a fractionating magma chamber with picritic magma cannot simply explain this flat slope either...|$|E

DESIGN: A longitudinal study of children 6 years of age at baseline followed at annual intervals over 5 years. SUBJECTS: A total of 285 children (143 boys and 142 girls) were enrolled in grade 1 (age 6 years) and followed through grade 5 (age 10 years). MEASUREMENTS: BMI was recorded and physical activity was assessed by questionnaire, aerobic fitness was evaluated with the 1 -mile run/walk and gross motor coordination was measured with the KTK test battery (Körperkoordination test für Kinder). Multilevel modelling techniques were for the primary analysis. RESULTS: Changes in BMI showed similar <b>curvilinear</b> <b>trends</b> in boys and girls, with ample inter-individual crossing trajectories that is, low tracking. Longitudinal changes in physical activity (PA) and aerobic fitness were not significantly associated with BMI-changes during the 5 years. Children who were more proficient in their motor coordination showed lower values of BMI during the 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: BMI trajectories of {{both boys and girls}} show low tracking of BMI-values. Considerable inter-individual variation exists both in baseline BMI-values and changes (velocity and acceleration) over time. PA and fitness were not associated with BMI-changes, but gross motor function was negatively associated with BMI-changes. No gender-specific associations were found. If confirmed in other populations these observations could be translated in the promotion of physical activities that improve gross motor function in children aged 6 - 10 years. This seems to be of major importance for the physical education curriculum of primary school children. status: publishe...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To examine the concurrent and prospective dose-response relationships between total {{physical activity}} (TPA) and (only) walking with HRQL in two age cohorts of women. METHODS: Participants were 10   698 women born in 1946 - 1951 and 7646 born in 1921 - 1926, who completed three mailed surveys for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. They reported weekly TPA minutes (sum of walking, moderate and vigorous minutes). HRQL was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 Health Status Survey (SF- 36). Linear mixed models, adjusted for socio-demographic and health-related variables, were used to examine associations between TPA level (none, very low, low, intermediate, sufficient, high and very high) and SF- 36 scores. For women who reported walking as their only physical activity, associations between walking and SF- 36 scores were also examined. RESULTS: <b>Curvilinear</b> <b>trends</b> were observed between TPA and walking with SF- 36 scores. Concurrently, HRQL scores increased significantly with increasing TPA and walking, in both cohorts, with increases less marked above sufficient activity levels. Prospectively, associations were attenuated although significant and meaningful improvements in physical functioning and vitality were observed across most TPA and walking categories above the low category. CONCLUSION: For women in their 50 s- 80 s without clinical depression, greater amounts of TPA are associated with better current and future HRQL, particularly physical functioning and vitality. Even if walking is their only activity, women, particularly those in their 70 s- 80 s, have better HRQL. status: publishe...|$|R

The results show relatively large variations in δ 98 Mo for igneous rocks ranging from - 1. 73 ‰ to 0. 59 ‰ with significant overlaps between different types. No relationships between δ 98 Mo and δ 18 O or ASI (Alumina Saturation Index) are observed, indicating that Mo isotopes do not clearly distinguish igneous versus sedimentary source types. Instead, effects of igneous processes, source mixing, regional geology, as well as hydrothermal activity control the Mo isotope compositions in these granites. It is found that Mo is mainly accommodated in biotite {{and to a lesser}} extent in hornblende. Hornblende and Fe 3 +-rich minerals may preferentially incorporate light isotopes, as reflected by negative correlations between δ 98 Mo and K/Rb and [Fe 2 O 3]. There is a positive correlation between initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and δ 98 Mo in I-type granitic rocks, reflecting the admixing of material from isotopically distinct sources. Granitic rocks from Scotland and Australia display strikingly similar <b>curvilinear</b> <b>trends</b> in δ 98 Mo vs. initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr despite the differing regional geology. Localized hydrothermal effects on Mo isotopes in three samples from Loch Doon and Criffell can result in anomalously low δ 98 Mo of < - 1 ‰. Based on this study, an estimate of δ 98 Mo = 0. 14 ± 0. 07 ‰ (95 % s. e.) for the Phanerozoic upper crust is proposed. This is slightly heavier than basalts indicating an isotopically light lower crust and / or a systematic change to the crust resulting from subduction of isotopically light dehydrated slab and / or pelagic sediment over time...|$|R

Four years of school level secondary data from publicly available databases maintained by the Florida Department of Education were combined for all public elementary, middle, and high schools in the state. This study examined approximately 2300 schools that participated each year in the Florida Innovates Survey about technology integration between 2003 - 04 and 2006 - 07. Complexity theory supported the use of multi-level modeling to examine the relationships between technology integration and outcomes. Three achievement outcomes (reading, mathematics, and writing) and two mediating behavioral outcomes (attendance and misconduct) were investigated. Moderating variables controlled in the model included school level, demographics, and learning environment. After data preparation, all composite variables were developed using factor analysis. Models were progressively built with significant variables at each level retained in subsequent levels of the study. A total of 94 models were estimated with maximum likelihood estimation using SAS 9. 1. 3 statistical software. The integration of technology is only one of the many factors that impact student learning within the classroom environment. Results supported previous research about the relationship between the moderating variables and school level achievement and confirmed the need to include moderating variables in the model. After controlling for all the other moderating variables, technology integration had a significant relationship with mean school achievement. Although the percent of teachers who regularly use technology for administrative purposes was consistently significant in the models for four out of five outcomes studied, the interactions with time, time 2, and time 3, resulted in <b>curvilinear</b> <b>trends</b> with inconsistent results. These inconsistent significant findings make drawing conclusions about the integration of technology within Florida 2 ̆ 7 s public schools difficult. Furthermore, the small changes observed in mean school achievement over the span of this study support the concept that time is a critical factor for school level learning and change. Therefore, continued analyses of the longitudinal trends for Florida schools in the relationship between technology integration variables and school achievement, while controlling for moderating variables, are recommended...|$|R

Instead, effects of igneous processes, source mixing, regional geology, as well as hydrothermal activity control the Mo isotope compositions in these granites. It is found that Mo is mainly accommodated in biotite {{and to a lesser}} extent in hornblende. Hornblende and Fe 3 +-rich minerals may preferentially incorporate light isotopes, as reflected by negative correlations between δ 98 Mo and K/Rb and [Fe 2 O 3]. There is a positive correlation between initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and δ 98 Mo in I-type granitic rocks, reflecting the admixing of material from isotopically distinct sources. Granitic rocks from Scotland and Australia display strikingly similar <b>curvilinear</b> <b>trends</b> in δ 98 Mo vs. initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr despite the differing regional geology. Localized hydrothermal effects on Mo isotopes in three samples from Loch Doon and Criffell can result in anomalously low δ 98 Mo of < - 1 ‰. Based on this study, an estimate of δ 98 Mo = 0. 14 ± 0. 07 ‰ (95 % s. e.) for the Phanerozoic upper crust is proposed. This is slightly heavier than basalts indicating an isotopically light lower crust and / or a systematic change to the crust resulting from subduction of isotopically light dehydrated slab and / or pelagic sediment over time.

The data are provided by the Monitoring the Future project, an ongoing study which employs a cohort-sequential design. Weighted least squares regression is used to find plausible and parsimonious models to account for the observed variation in 12 different classes of drugs, both licit and illicit. The point is made that there are no definitive ways to differentiate among the types of effects; thus, any interpretation is open to debate. Period effects involving increased use occurred for cocaine, amphetamines, and methaqualone, while decreases occurred for barbiturates, tranquilizers, and psychedelics other than LSD. Marijuana showed a curvilinear period effect, first increasing then decreasing. Effects of age were more complex. There were increases in the year after high school for daily cigarette use, but not for monthly use. Monthly and daily alcohol use increased with age. A measure of heavy drinking showed a <b>curvilinear</b> <b>trend,</b> first increasing and then decreasing. Annual use of cocaine showed an increase between the ages of 18 and 21. Annual use of narcotics other than heroin showed a linear age decrease. Clear class (or cohort) effects appeared for cigarette use, with each successive class smoking less...|$|E
40|$|Distinguishing between {{physical}} and social aggression, this study examined whether the predictive effect of aggression on resource control a) is moderated by prosocial behavior and b) corresponds to a linear or a <b>curvilinear</b> <b>trend.</b> Moderating effects of children’s social preference among peers and child sex in this context were also tested. Based on a sample of 682 kindergarten children (348 girls; average age 72. 7 months, 3. 6 SD), multilevel regressions revealed additive linear effects of social preference and prosociality on resource control. Moderate (but not high) levels of social aggression also facilitated resource control for disliked children. There was no such threshold effect for well liked children, who increasingly controlled the resource the more socially aggressive they were. In contrast, physical aggression hampered resource control unless used very modestly. The present study {{has a number of}} positive features. First, the distinction {{between physical}} and social aggression improves our understanding of the relation between aggression and social competence and sketches a more differentiated picture of the role of different forms of aggression in resource control. Second, this study combines the concept of resource control with the concept of social preference and investigates curvilinear effects of aggression. Third, the direct observation of resource control in the Movie Viewer increases the internal validity of this study...|$|E
40|$|If {{single case}} {{experimental}} designs {{are to be}} used to establish guidelines for evidence-based interventions in clinical and educational settings, numerical values that reflect treatment effect sizes are required. The present study compares four recently developed procedures for quantifying the magnitude of intervention effect using data with known characteristics. Monte Carlo methods were used to generate AB designs data with potential confounding variables (serial dependence, linear and <b>curvilinear</b> <b>trend,</b> and heteroscedasticity between phases) and two types of treatment effect (level and slope change). The results suggest that data features are important for choosing the appropriate procedure and, thus, inspecting the graphed data visually is a necessary initial stage. In the presence of serial dependence or a change in data variability, the Nonoverlap of All Pairs (NAP) and the Slope and Level Change (SLC) were the only techniques of the four examined that performed adequately. Introducing a data correction step in NAP renders it unaffected by linear trend, as is also the case for the Percentage of Nonoverlapping Corrected Data and SLC. The performance of these techniques indicates that professionals" judgments concerning treatment effectiveness can be readily complemented by both visual and statistical analyses. A flowchart to guide selection of techniques according to the data characteristics identified by visual inspection is provided...|$|E

This research examines {{the form of}} the relationship between Big Five-oriented personality predictors and occupational performance throughout the predictor and criterion score ranges. Building on rationale that individuals can be either "too low" or "too high" in their standing on various personality attributes for optimal performance, previous research has produced discrepant findings with regard to whether and when to expect curvilinear relationships between these attributes and job performance. Previous studies have relied on small samples and unsystematic sampling, a variety of performance criteria, the use of personality inventories for which construct validity evidence is not immediately available, and a focus on only {{one or two of the}} Big Five personality factors (typically conscientiousness). If personality [...] performance relationships exhibit nonlinearity within the score range where decisions are made, there could be immediate implications for the inferences that could be drawn from the use of such test scores, such as whether top-down or cutoff-score based uses are most appropriate. Incorporating large sample (n > 11, 000) operational personality and performance data, this research had several goals: (a) replicate and extend previous research on conscientiousness and emotional stability to clarify existing conflicts in findings, (b) provide the first major tests of nonlinearity for agreeableness, openness, and extraversion, and (c) use a theoretically linked framework to identify and test for relevant occupation-level moderating variables by incorporating job complexity and personality based job analytic information. Results showed a general lack of meaningful curvilinear effects for each Big Five scale in relation to overall job performance. Any expected declines in performance at high ends of the predictor range were very small on average, and would be highly unlikely to produce scenarios in which those passing a realistic cut score would be expected to underperform those screened out due a curvilinear effect. Indices of job complexity and the importance of the personality trait to performance did not exhibit moderating effects for the forms of each personality [...] performance relationship. Results are useful for evaluating whether nonlinearity is likely to be an issue when self-report personality assessments are used to make decisions with tangible employment consequences. Even with slight <b>curvilinear</b> <b>trends</b> for several of the scales examined, the results suggest that curvilinearity is highly unlikely to present problems for typical uses of personality test scores in employment settings...|$|R
40|$|Background: Time {{trends in}} infant {{mortality}} for the 20 th century show a curvilinear pattern that most demographers have {{assumed to be}} approximately exponential. Virtually all cross-country comparisons and time series analyses of infant mortality have studied the logarithm of infant mortality {{to account for the}} <b>curvilinear</b> time <b>trend.</b> However, {{there is no evidence that}} the log transform is the best fit for infant mortality time trends. Methods: We use maximum likelihood methods to determine the best transformation to fit time trends in infant mortality reduction in the 20 th century and to assess the importance of the proper transformation in identifying the relationship between infant mortality and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. We apply the Box Cox transform to infant mortality rate (IMR) time series from 18 countries to identify the best fitting value of lambda for each country and for the pooled sample. For each country, we test the value of λ against the null that λ = 0 (logarithmic model) and against the null that λ = 1 (linear model). We then demonstrate the importance of selecting the proper transformation by comparing regressions of ln(IMR) on same year GDP per capita against Box Cox transformed models...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: While {{external}} {{factors such as}} family and peers were widely known to be predictive of juvenile delinquency, mixed results were reported regarding the effects of internal (personal) variables such as self-concept and moral reasoning maturity. The {{present study was to}} delineate the effects of two variables relating to the self (self-esteem, moral self) and the moral reasoning maturity in predicting delinquency. A sample of 266 young people aged between 17 and 21 were invited to complete a questionnaire composed of global self-concept (self-esteem) scale, moral self scale, moral reasoning test, and a daily behavior checklist. Regression and correlation analyses indicated that moral self and moral reasoning were in general negatively associated with delinquency, but global self-esteem did not have significant linear relation with delinquency. Polynomial contrast tests revealed that moral reasoning and moral self to certain extent had a linear trend with delinquency negatively, but global self-esteem exhibited a <b>curvilinear</b> (U-shape) <b>trend</b> with some but not all delinquent behaviors such as sexual misconduct, drug offenses, gambling. The results were then discussed in the light of self-derogation theory and other relevant theories such as the “threatened ego ” and the multidimensional model of self-concept, and hopefully could throw lights to explain the phenomenon for further research...|$|R
