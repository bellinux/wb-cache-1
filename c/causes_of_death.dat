5|$|American Cocker Spaniels in UK and USA/Canada surveys had {{a median}} {{lifespan}} of about 10 to 11 years, {{which is on}} {{the low end of the}} typical range for purebred dogs, and one to two years less than other breeds of their size. The larger English Cocker Spaniel typically lives about a year longer than the American Cocker Spaniel. In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were cancer (23%), old age (20%), cardiac (8%), and immune-mediated (8%). In a 2003 USA/Canada Health Survey with a smaller sample size, the leading <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were cancer, hepatic disease, and immune-mediated.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia and {{dehydration}} are {{the most}} frequent immediate <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> brought by AD, while cancer is a less frequent cause of death than in the general population.|$|E
5|$|Despite these differences, {{the leading}} <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in the United States are remarkably similar {{for men and}} women, headed by heart disease, which {{accounts}} {{for a quarter of}} all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke. While women have a lower incidence of death from unintentional injury (see below) and suicide, they have a higher incidence of dementia (Gronowski and Schindler, Table I).|$|E

40|$|Identification <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> was {{the topic}} of the Town Hall {{discussion}} at the STP Annual Symposium in 2003 (The Scope). General points of agreement from this discussion were: The responsibility for identifying the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in in-dividual animals is part of the pathologist’s responsibility to interpret compound-related effects. If <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> cannot be determined, this should be stated. Basic guidelines for addressing the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> would be useful. The need for identifying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> has been previously addressed by the STP (2002) in the context of recom-mendations for analysis of carcinogenicity studies: “Note: Identification <b>of</b> the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in individual animal...|$|R

5|$|Some Giant Schnauzers develop central {{diabetes}} insipidus, {{autosomal recessive}} hypothyroidism, selective malabsorption of cobalamin, narcolepsy, cataplexy, and various seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in Giant Schnauzers are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by {{heart attacks and}} heart failure.|$|E
5|$|The longest {{documented}} {{giant otter}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is eight years. In captivity, this may increase to 17, with an unconfirmed record of 19. The animal is susceptible {{to a variety of}} diseases, including canine parvovirus. Parasites, such as the larvae of flies and a variety of intestinal worms, also afflict the giant otter. Other <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> include accidents, gastroenteritis, infanticide, and epileptic seizures.|$|E
5|$|According to the Kennel Club Purebred Dog Health Survey {{conducted}} in 2004, the two breeds had similar average lifespans: {{the median age}} at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes, and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans. The main <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were similar in both breeds: the primary causes were canine cancer and old age. However, the Pembroke breed showed {{a higher proportion of}} deaths attributed to either kidney failure or a urethral obstruction.|$|E

2500|$|The lack {{of success}} in {{determining}} the identity and <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> the Somerton Man had led authorities to call it an [...] "unparalleled mystery" [...] and believe that the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> might never be known.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Trials in {{critical}} care have previously used unvalidated systems to classify <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> We aimed to provide initial validation of {{a method to}} classify <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{in intensive care unit}} patients. Design, setting and participants: One hundred case scenarios of patients who died in an ICU were presented online to raters, who were asked to select a proximate and an underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> for each, using the ICU Deaths Classification and Reason (ICU-DECLARE) system. We evaluated two methods <b>of</b> categorising proximate <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> (designated Lists A and B) and one method <b>of</b> categorising underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Raters were ICU specialists and research coordinators from Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Main outcome measures: Inter-rater reliability, as measured by the Fleiss multirater kappa, and the median proportion of raters choosing the most likely diagnosis (defined as the most popular classification choice in each case). Results: Across all raters and cases, for proximate <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> List A, kappa was 0. 54 (95 % Cl, 0. 49 – 0. 60), and for proximate <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> List B, kappa was 0. 58 (95 % Cl, 0. 53 – 0. 63). For the underlying <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> kappa was 0. 48 (95 % Cl, 0. 44 – 0. 53). The median proportion of raters choosing the most likely diagnosis for proximate <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> List A, was 77. 5 % (interquartile range [IQR], 60. 0 %– 93. 8 %), and the median proportion choosing the most likely diagnosis for proximate <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> List B, was 82. 5 % (IQR, 60. 0 %– 92. 5 %). The median proportion choosing the most likely diagnosis for underlying cause was 65. 0 % (IQR, 50. 0 %– 81. 3 %). Kappa and median agreement were similar between countries. ICU specialists showed higher kappa and median agreement than research coordinators. Conclusions: The ICU-DECLARE system allowed ICU doctors to classify the proximate <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> patients who died in the ICU with substantial reliability...|$|R
5|$|Acute cholangitis {{carries a}} {{significant}} risk of death, {{the leading cause}} being irreversible shock with multiple organ failure (a possible complication of severe infections). Improvements in diagnosis and treatment {{have led to a}} reduction in mortality: before 1980, the mortality rate was greater than 50%, but after 1980 it was 10–30%. Patients with signs of multiple organ failure are likely to die unless they undergo early biliary drainage and treatment with systemic antibiotics. Other <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> following severe cholangitis include heart failure and pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{densities of}} this waxwing are {{typically}} {{low compared to}} other passerines, usually less than ten birds per square kilometre (26per square mile) even in good habitat, although up to 35·6birds per square kilometre (92per square mile) {{have been found in}} Russia. One brood each year is normal. Maximum recorded ages are 5years 10months in North America and more than 13years 6months in Europe. The average life expectancy is unknown. Significant <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> include predation, collisions with windows and cars, and poisoning by road salt consumed when drinking.|$|E
5|$|<b>Causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{of adult}} ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E

50|$|Homicide was the second-leading <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{among women}} ages 20 to 24 and fifth among women ages 25-34 in 1999. The top <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in both age groups is accidents.|$|R
40|$|Background: Detailed <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> data by {{age group}} and sex are {{critical}} to identify key public health issues and target interventions appropriately. In this study the quality of local routinely collected <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> data from medical certification is reviewed, and a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> profile for Tonga based on amended data is presented. Methods: Medical certificates <b>of</b> <b>death</b> for all deaths in Tonga for 2001 to 2008 and medical records for all deaths in the main island Tongatapu for 2008 were sought from the national hospital. <b>Cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> data for 2008 were reviewed for quality through (a) a review of current tabulation procedures and (b) a medical record review. Data from each medical record were extracted and provided to an independent medical doctor to assign <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> with underlying <b>cause</b> from the medical record tabulated against underlying cause from the medical certificate. Significant associations in reporting patterns were evaluated and final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> for each case in 2008 was assigned based on the best quality information from the medical certificate or medical record.

5|$|Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and {{starvation}} are {{the other}} leading <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.|$|E
5|$|In June 1981, Owen Beattie, a {{professor}} of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began the 1845–48 Franklin Expedition Forensic Anthropology Project (FEFAP) when he and his team of researchers and field assistants travelled from Edmonton to King William Island, traversing the island's western coast as Franklin's men did 132years before. FEFAP hoped to find artifacts and skeletal remains in order to use modern forensics to establish identities and <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> among the lost 129.|$|E

40|$|Postmortem CT is a {{relatively}} new field of interest within paediatric radiology. This paper focusses on its value in cases <b>of</b> unexpected natural <b>death.</b> We report on an observational Dutch study regarding the value of postmortem CT in children with an assumed natural unexpected death because postmortem CT is part of the Dutch NODO (additional investigations <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death)</b> procedure. We included consecutive children who fulfilled criteria for the NODO procedure and were therefore referred to one of the centres for the procedure. Postmortem CT was performed in all cases and skeletal survey was performed in all children ages < 5 years. The <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> was defined in a consensus meeting. We included a total of 54 children (30 boys, median age 1. 1 years, and 24 girls, median age 0. 8 years). A definitive <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> was established in 38 cases. In 7 cases the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> could be identified on postmortem CT. In 7 cases imaging findings were clinically relevant but did not lead to a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> In the remaining 40 cases postmortem CT did not add to the diagnostic workup. Our study shows that in a group of children who unexpectedly died of an assumed natural <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and in whom a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> was found at autopsy, postmortem CT detected the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in a minority of cases (12. 9 %).

5|$|The {{range of}} {{structural}} and biochemical effects that viruses {{have on the}} host cell is extensive. These are called cytopathic effects. Most virus infections eventually result {{in the death of}} the host cell. The <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> include cell lysis, alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis. Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activities because of suppression by virus-specific proteins, not all of which are components of the virus particle.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E
5|$|In fatal {{cases of}} {{ordinary}} smallpox, death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth {{days of the}} illness. The cause of death from smallpox is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs. Circulating immune complexes, overwhelming viremia, or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors. In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. Cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema. In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained viremia, severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> In flat smallpox modes of death {{are similar to those}} in burns, with loss of fluid, protein and electrolytes beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire, and fulminating sepsis.|$|E

5|$|In {{most major}} categories, Phoenix {{had a lower}} {{incidence}} of death {{than the rest of}} the nation. Only deaths due to Alzheimer's (29.7 to 27.2 deaths per 100,000) and pre-natal conditions (5.3 to 3.8 deaths per 100,000) were slightly above the national average. Deaths due to HIV and liver disease were exactly at the national average of 2.5 and 10.8 respectively. However, in several major categories, Phoenix had significantly lower indices of death: deaths by cancer stood at only 57% (106) of the national average of 184.6 deaths per 100,000; deaths due to heart disease, 56.1% of the national rate of 249.8 per 100,000.

5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need for {{veterans}} to prove a causal link between certain forms of cancer and radiation exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E
