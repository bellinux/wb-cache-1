25|$|Redgrave v Hurd raises another question, about <b>contributory</b> <b>negligence</b> {{under the}} Law Reform (<b>Contributory</b> <b>Negligence)</b> Act 1945. In the case, Mr Redgrave's mistake was {{referred}} to as innocent misrepresentation, though it is very arguable that it was at least negligent. Was it negligent of Mr Hurd to not check the papers as well? Had Mr Redgrave been fraudulent, it is clear that any negligence on Mr Hurd's part could not affect his right to compensation.

25|$|<b>Contributory</b> <b>negligence</b> is a mitigatory defence, whereby a claimant's damages {{are reduced}} in {{accordance}} with the percentage of contribution made by the claimant to the loss or damage suffered. Thus, in evaluating a collision between two vehicles, for example, if the wronged driver were not wearing a seatbelt, he would most likely be contributorily negligent. The court will then quantify the damages for the actual loss or damage sustained, and then reduce the amount paid to the claimant by 20%. <b>Contributory</b> <b>negligence</b> can also function as a full defence, when it is assessed at 100%, as in Jayes v IMI Kynoch.|$|E
40|$|One hundred medicolegal {{cases were}} {{analysed}} to obtain quantitative data about diagnoses and {{the causes of}} litigation that affect hospital doctors in the National Health Service. Sixteen actions concerned minor problems that are an unavoidable risk of treatment, and 39 were due to natural causes. In other cases it was debatable whether a medical accident or negligence was responsible. At the end of three years 73 actions had been withdrawn, 12 settled out of court, and one lost in court by the plaintiff, and 14 were pending. Of these 14, nine were likely to reach court on charges of <b>negligence.</b> <b>Contributory</b> causes were failure of communication in 27 and matters connected with the patient's attitude or personality in 20. Because much time and money are spent on cases that should never have started a doctor should sit on the legal aid panel to give advice for medical cases. Also, solicitors should obtain an independent medical opinion when a complaint is first received from a patient. Consent forms should be more informative and give details of what can reasonably be expected from treatment and its possible risks...|$|R
40|$|Not long ago, American {{tort law}} clearly {{rejected}} an "outlaw" doctrine: a plaintiff engaged in tortious or criminal acts was not {{treated as an}} outlaw who could be injured with impunity. The plaintiff's unlawful conduct might {{give rise to a}} defense such as <b>contributory</b> or comparative <b>negligence</b> under ordinary tort prlnciples, or might trigger a privilege assertable against the plaintiff. However, unlawful conduct, by itself, did not inevitably bar the courthouse doors. The second Restatement's rejection of a rule making tortious or criminal conduct an absolute obstacle to recovery in tort was not surprising. Much has changed in American tort law during the past thirty years, including the rules relating to unlawful conduct. There are questions as to how far the unlawful conduct defense extends. Courts are in disagreement as to both the requirements of the unlawful conduct defense and whether the plaintiff or the defendant bears the burden of proof. It makes a world of difference, both to the individual litigant and to the fairness of the justice system, whether unlawful conduct is treated as an affirmative defense on which the defendant bears the burden of proof, versus an aspect of proximate causation that precludes a plaintiff from establishing a prima facie case...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{criminal}} law is intensely one-sided in {{its treatment of}} victims and defendants. Crime victims and criminal defendants do not enter the trial process on an equal moral footing. Rather, from the beginning victims are assumed blameless, truthful, and even beyond doubt, while defendants are guilty, not worthy of credence, and immoral. This one-sided view of victims, however, is a fiction. As any other people, victims differ in their characterizations. Some are indeed trustworthy, truthful, blameless and ultimately innocent. Others, however, are bad actors themselves, have memory failures, falsely identify, provoke, and even lie. Some victims are in fact, and indeed encouraged to be by society, vengeful. Others, however, advocate mercy and forgiveness {{as part of the}} process of 2 ̆ 2 closure, 2 ̆ 2 a process to which prosecutors and victim advocates often allude in justifying particularly severe punishments like the death penalty. The first article in this project, Victim Wrongs: The Case for a General Criminal Defense based on Wrongful Victim Behavior in an Era of Victims 2 ̆ 7 Rights, 77 TEMP. L. REV. 645 (2003), advocates as a response to the one-sided nature of victim characterizations a nonspecific victim liability defense. It proposes a general defense that mitigates punishment or exculpates defendants when their criminal behavior occurs in direct response to wrongful behavior on the part of the victim. The term, 2 ̆ 2 nonspecific, 2 ̆ 2 denotes that the defense applies to any criminal defendant who responds to wrongful victim behavior, under the specified conditions, as opposed to just murder or assault defendants. 2 ̆ 2 Nonspecific 2 ̆ 2 also captures the idea that wrongful victim behavior can include more types of behavior than the current specific laws take into account. The elements of the nonspecific victim liability defense are: (1) The victim of the crime engaged in sufficiently wrongful conduct; (2) The victim 2 ̆ 7 s conduct caused the defendant to commit the charged offense; (3) The defendant was not predisposed to commit the charged offense; and (4) The severity of the victim 2 ̆ 7 s wrongful conduct balanced against the severity of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s response dictates that the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s actions were justified or excused or that punishment should be mitigated. This article is the second part of an on-going project to develop and justify the nonspecific victim liability defense by responding prospectively to potential criticisms of the defense based in penal theory. To that end, Part I of the article explains the importance of penological discourse in {{criminal law}} theory and introduces several broad categories of penal philosophy. Part II of the paper discusses the potential deontological criticism that the nonspecific victim liability defense inaccurately reflects sentiments regarding just deserts because of its potential to sanction victim negligence. In responding to this important objection, the paper distinguishes the non-specific victim liability defense from the seemingly analogous tort principles of <b>contributory</b> and comparative <b>negligence.</b> Part III briefly responds to consequentialist critiques of the defense, which involve concerns over deterrence, rehabilitation, incapacitation, and redistribution. In the end, this project hopes to recharacterize criminal law in a more transactional way so that criminal doctrines can account adequately for the relative moral culpability of all the parties to an injurious event...|$|R

25|$|As {{scientific}} evidence {{mounted in the}} 1980s, tobacco companies claimed <b>contributory</b> <b>negligence</b> as the adverse health effects were previously unknown or lacked substantial credibility. Health authorities sided with these claims up until 1998, from which they reversed their position.

25|$|Even if Hedley Byrne {{was not a}} {{contract}} case, Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon confirmed that its principles were applicable to negligent misrepresentation preceding {{a contract}}. Since the same principles apply, it has been held that where a represent is also partly at fault for his loss, her damages can be reduced under the Law Reform (<b>Contributory</b> <b>Negligence)</b> Act 1945 s 1. However, it will almost always be more advantageous to sue under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1).|$|E
25|$|Further {{illustrations}} are plentiful. In East v Maurer where Maurer lied that {{he would}} not set up a barber competing with the one he was selling to East, Maurer was liable for East's normal market lost profits, costs of improvements and the price paid minus the business' selling price. In Smith New Court Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd Smith New Court Ltd was deceitfully told there were close rival bids for shares in a company called Ferranti IS Inc. Smith New Court Ltd bought, but then it transpired that massive fraud had occurred. The Court of Appeal held that only £1.2m was recoverable, the difference between the market price at the time of purchase and the real price, but the House of Lords held that the full losses of £11.8m were recoverable (even though the fraud was unconnected to the misrepresentation) because that loss was one which Smith New Court Ltd had due to entering the transaction after being deceived. In practice, because an action for negligent misrepresentation has now been developed through Hedley Byrne and the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), it is often not beneficial to sue for deceit. The only certain difference is that the defence of <b>contributory</b> <b>negligence</b> is unavailable in a deceit action. But deceit is harder to prove, since evidence of a person's state of mind is needed. Because the charge can sink people's reputations, alleging deceit is also contrary to professional conduct rules at the bar, unless a good case exists. A large difference which is subject to debate, is that the causation and remoteness rules are more generous for deceit. Certainly this is true when comparing negligence and deceit. However, the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), which was modelled on the law as it stood when the Act was passed, has the same causation rules as for deceit (see below).|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} defences in England and Wales to a claim under Rylands v Fletcher; act {{of an unknown}} third party, <b>contributory</b> <b>negligence,</b> consent and {{statutory}} authority. An act of an unknown third party will absolve the defendant of liability, as in Perry v Kendricks Transport Ltd. In Northwestern Utilities Ltd v London Guarantee and Accident Co Ltd, the principle was established that if a claimant knows of the unknown third party and their actions, the defendant is additionally {{likely to be able}} to deny liability. As Rylands requires strict liability, any <b>contributory</b> <b>negligence</b> voids most of the claim. Initially it was sufficient to offset the case itself; with the Law Reform (<b>Contributory</b> <b>Negligence)</b> Act 1945, courts instead apportion damages, taking into account how much of the harm was contributed by the claimant. Nevertheless, <b>contributory</b> <b>negligence</b> is still a viable partial defence to a Rylands claim. Other valid defences are where the claimant has consented, expressly or impliedly, to the accumulation of the [...] "thing", and where there is statutory authority for the accumulation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of {{reasonable}} care {{on the part of}} the claimant, courts are likely to reduce the liability of the injurer. [...] "The rule of negligence with the defense of <b>contributory</b> <b>negligence</b> holds an injurer liable if and only if he was negligent and the victim was not. In India, this rule requires proportional sharing of liability when both parties were negligent. That is, the compensation that the victim receives gets reduced in proportion to his or her negligence." ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{the victim}} {{has contributed to}} causing their own harm through negligent or irresponsible actions, the damages may be reduced or {{eliminated}} entirely. The English case Butterfield v. Forrester (1809) established this defense. In England, this [...] "contributory negligence" [...] became a partial defense, but in the United States, any fault by the victim completely eliminated any damages. This meant that if the plaintiff was 1% at fault, the victim would lose the entire lawsuit. This was viewed as unnecessarily harsh and therefore amended to a comparative negligence system in many states; as of 2007 <b>contributory</b> <b>negligence</b> exists {{in only a few}} states such as North Carolina and Maryland.|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{concepts}} of [...] Torts [...] under Anglo-American Common Law, these points might {{best be described as}} a defense of <b>contributory</b> <b>negligence.</b> In other words, Ms Calad and Mr. Davila might have prevented the damage to their person for which they are allowed no monetary damages in court if they had properly enforced their ERISA or THCLA rights against CIGNA and Aetna to prevent the injury from happening. The fact that ERISA had failed to prevent the harm, however, {{and the fact that it}} was ruled by the Supreme Court that neither CIGNA nor Aetna could owe monetary damages for their contribution to the harm done, shows that there is a need for change, either in ERISA itself by Congress or by Supreme Court common law.|$|E

The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case Li v.

If people are injured at work, they may be treated regardless of their means to pay. There is also the right, under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to statutory sick pay. People at work can also sue for compensatory damages whenever they are injured and employers have breached a statutory duty. They can claim for the injury itself, loss of income, and relatives or dependents may recover small sums to reflect distress. Employers are vicariously liable for all agents acting for them in the [...] "course of employment" [...] whenever their actions have a [...] "close connection" [...] to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules. An employer only has a defence if an employee, on a [...] "frolic of his own", was not placed by an employer in a position to cause harm.

Insurance companies may not their employee to recover costs unless there is fraud. However, until the mid-20th century there were a series of major limitations. First, until 1937, if an employee was injured by a co-worker, the doctrine of common employment, the employer could only be liable if it was shown they were personally liable by carelessness in selecting staff. The House of Lords changed this in Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English, holding an employer had a non-delegable duty of care for all employees. Lord Wright held there were [...] "fundamental obligations of a contract of employment... for which employers are absolutely responsible". The second old restriction was that, until 1891, volenti non fit injuria meant workers were assumed to voluntarily accept the dangers of their work by agreeing to their contracts of employment. Only if an employee callously ignores clear directions of the employer will he be taken to have voluntarily assumed the risk, like in ICI Ltd v Shatwell where an experience quarry shotfirer said he [...] "could not be bothered" [...] to wait 10 minutes before setting of a detonation, and blew up his brother. Third, even if a worker was slightly at fault, until 1945 such <b>contributory</b> <b>negligence</b> precluded the whole of the claim. Now the court will only reduce damages by the amount the employee contributed to their own injury. The fourth defence available to employers, which still exists, is ex turpi causa non oritur actio, that if the employee was engaged in any illegal activity they may not claim compensation for injuries. In Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd Mr Hewison concealed his epilepsy so that he could work offshore was technically guilty of illegally attempting to gain a pecuniary advantage by deception under the Theft Act 1968 section 16. After being struck in the head by a defective gangplank he suffered worse fits than before, but the Court of Appeal, by a majority, held his illegal act precluded any compensation.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the modern}} scheme of {{legislation}} and regulation engenders {{a comprehensive approach}} to enforcement and worker participation for health and safety matters, the common law remains relevant for getting civil law compensation, and some limits on an employers' duties.

At dinner--he pigged at a table by himself, him and two other Hindoos--the captain kind of jeered at him about it, and he got very excited. He turned round and talked into my ear. He would not buy the birds; he would have his diamond. He demanded his rights as a British subject. His diamond must be found. He was firm upon that. He would appeal to the House of Lords.

Padishah had wanted a stomach-pump--though you can't do that to a bird, you know. This Padishah was full of bad law, like most of these blessed Bengalis, and talked of having a lien on the birds, and so forth. But an old boy, who said his son was a London barrister, argued that what a bird swallowed became ipso facto part of the bird, and that Padishah's only remedy lay in an action for damages, and even then {{it might be possible to}} show <b>contributory</b> <b>negligence.</b> He hadn't any right of way about an ostrich that didn't belong to him. That upset Padishah extremely, the more so as most of us expressed an opinion that that was the reasonable view. There wasn't any lawyer aboard to settle the matter, so we all talked pretty free. At last, after Aden, it appears that he came round to the general opinion, and went privately to the man in charge and made an offer for all five ostriches.|$|E

A colored brother of Massachusetts birth, as black as a man can well be, and of a merely anthropoidal profile, was driving me along shore {{in search of a}} sea-side hotel when we came upon a weak-minded young chicken in the road. The natural expectation is that any chicken in these circumstances will wait for your vehicle, and then fly up before it with a loud screech; but this chicken may have been overcome by the heat (it was a land breeze and it drew like the breath of a furnace over the hay-cocks and the clover), or it may have mistimed the wheel, which passed over its head and left it to flop a moment in the dust and then fall still. The poor little tragedy was sufficiently distressful to me, but I bore it well, compared with my driver. He could hardly stop lamenting it; and when presently we met a young farmer, he pulled up. [...] "You goin' past Jim Marden's?" [...] "Yes." [...] "Well, I wish you'd tell him I just run over a chicken of his, and I killed it, I guess. I guess it was a pretty big one." [...] "Oh no," [...] I put in, [...] "it was only a broiler. What {{do you think it was}} worth?" [...] I took out some money, and the farmer noted the largest coin in my hand; [...] "About half a dollar, I guess." [...] On this I put it all back in my pocket, and then he said, [...] "Well, if a chicken don't know enough to get out of the road, I guess you ain't to blame." [...] I expressed that this was my own view of the case, and we drove on. When we parted I gave the half-dollar to my driver, and begged him not to let the owner of the chicken come on me for damages; and though he chuckled his pleasure in the joke, I could see that he was still unhappy, and I have no doubt that he has that pullet on his conscience yet, unless he has paid for it.
