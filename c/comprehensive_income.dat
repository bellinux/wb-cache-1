5|$|The IFC prepares {{consolidated}} {{financial statements}} in accordance with United States GAAP which are audited by KPMG. It reported income before grants to IDA members of $2.18 billion in fiscal year 2011, up from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2010 and $299 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in income before grants is ascribed to higher earnings from the IFC's investments and also from higher service fees. The IFC reported a partial offset from lower liquid asset trading income, higher administrative costs, and higher advisory service expenses. The IFC made $600 million in grants to IDA countries in fiscal 2011, up from $200 million in fiscal 2010 and $450 million in fiscal 2009. The IFC reported a net income of $1.58 billion in fiscal year 2011. In previous years, the IFC had reported {{a net loss of}} $151 million in fiscal 2009 and $1.75 billion in fiscal 2010. The IFC's total capital amounted to $20.3 billion in 2011, of which $2.4 billion was paid-in capital from member countries, $16.4 billion was retained earnings, and $1.5 billion was accumulated other <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income.</b> The IFC held $68.49 billion in total assets in 2011.|$|E
25|$|According to the OECD, Finland's {{job market}} is the least {{flexible}} of the Nordic countries. Finland increased job market regulation in the 1970s to provide stability to manufacturers. In contrast, during the 1990s, Denmark liberalised its job market, Sweden moved to more decentralised contracts, whereas Finnish trade unions blocked many reforms. Many professions have legally recognized industry-wide contracts that lay down common terms of employment including seniority levels, holiday entitlements, and salary levels, usually {{as part of a}} <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Income</b> Policy Agreement. Those who favor less centralized labor market policies consider these agreements bureaucratic, inflexible, and along with tax rates, a key contributor to unemployment and distorted prices. Centralized agreements may hinder structural change as there are fewer incentives to acquire better skills, although Finland already enjoys one of the highest skill-levels in the world.|$|E

40|$|E SummaryCollective {{bargaining}} {{has traditionally}} been thought to be gender neutral. When the apparently gender-neutral surface of the agreements and their application has been investigated more closely, however, this notion has shattered. Finland {{is one of the}} European countries in which it is common for women to work. Approximately one half of the labour force consists of women. Despite the fact that the educational level of women already exceeds that of men, the difference in their wages is still significant. Most workers fall within the sphere of collective agreements and most are also members of employee or trade unions, women even more so than men. However, more men than women hold leading positions in unions and work as principal nego-tiators for unions. Female negotiators have emphasised gender equality more than their male counterparts. <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>incomes</b> policy agreements have been part of Finland’s working life for nearly three decades. Such agreements restrain the growth in the division of wages in society. In the 1990 s, elements supporting gender equality were openly included in these agree-ments, and equality supplements were incorporated. According to statistics, it seems that the differences in wages between the genders have slightly decreased during the preceding decade.
