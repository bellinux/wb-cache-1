5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{they feed}} almost {{exclusively}} on euphausiids (mainly the genera Euphausia and Thysanoessa), as well as taking small amounts of amphipods (e.g. Themisto gaudichaudii) and various species of fish. Of the more than 16,000 fin whales <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Hemisphere between 1961 and 1965 that contained food in their stomachs, 99.4% fed on euphausiids, 0.5% on fish, and 0.1% on amphipods. In the Southern Ocean they mainly consume E. superba.|$|E

5|$|Pilot whales {{have also}} {{fallen victim to}} bycatches. In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot whales were <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> squid round-haul fishery in {{southern}} California. Likewise, California's drift gill net fishery took around 20 whales {{a year in the}} mid-1990s. In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlantic mackerel fishery, which forced it to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|After {{all three}} contestants {{have played a}} Cash Builder round {{followed}} by a chase, the contestants who were not <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> chaser advance to the Final Chase, with the team bank set to the total that they won in their Cash Builder rounds. If all three contestants fail to win their individual chases, the team selects one contestant to play the Final Chase alone {{for a total of}} $15,000 ($5,000 per contestant). During celebrity episodes, contestants who are caught leave with $5,000 for their respective charities.|$|E
5|$|After being <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Environmental Protection Agency dumping {{nuclear waste}} in the city park, Mr. Burns is fined $3 million. A town meeting is held so that the {{citizens}} can decide how to spend the money. Marge suggests that the city {{use the money to}} fix Main Street, which is in poor condition. The town is about to vote in favor when someone new to town, a fast-talking salesman named Lyle Lanley, suggests that Springfield construct a city monorail.

5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, and was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, they were <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Turks and massacred almost to the man.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of French prisoners who escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, it has been {{estimated}} at around 70,000, representing approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees who reached French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial amounts of time without guards, and prisoners <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Germans trying to escape were rarely severely punished. During the period of detention in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass escapes of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent escapes that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich.|$|E
5|$|Cancer pagurus {{is heavily}} {{exploited}} commercially throughout its range, {{being the most}} commercially important crab species in Western Europe. The crabs are caught using crab pots (similar to lobster pots) which are placed offshore and baited. The catch of C. pagurus has increased steadily, rising from 26,000tonnes in 1978 to 60,000t in 2007, of which more than 70% was caught around the British Isles. The fishery is widely dispersed around the British and Irish coasts, and C. pagurus {{is thought to be}} overfished across much of this area. Most of the edible crabs <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British fleet are exported live for sale in France and Spain.|$|E

5|$|In the game's introduction, {{the ghost}} of Garamon haunts the Avatar's dreams with {{warnings}} of a great danger in Britannia. The Avatar allows Garamon to take him there, where he watches Tyball kidnap Arial. Tyball escapes, leaving the Avatar to be <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Baron's guards. The guards {{take him to the}} Baron, who banishes him to the Great Stygian Abyss to rescue Arial. After the introduction, the Avatar explores the dungeon and finds remnants of Cabirus's colony. A few possible scenarios include deciding the fate of two warring goblin tribes, learning a language, and playing an instrument to complete a quest. The Avatar eventually defeats Tyball and frees Arial.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{quarter of the}} game, the Eagles took a 70 lead on a 51-yard fumble return for a touchdown. The Eagles' offense {{dominated}} {{the first half of}} the game statistically, but failed to add to its early lead until the second quarter, when a field goal made it 100. Virginia Tech answered with a touchdown of their own, but Boston College responded with a seven-play, 74-yard touchdown drive of its own. Then came perhaps the most pivotal play of the game. During the extra point kick following the Boston College touchdown, Virginia Tech's Duane Brown blocked the kick, which was <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hokies' cornerback Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75yards for a defensive two-point conversion.|$|E
5|$|Octopus {{card reader}} {{includes}} a fail-safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction {{when more than}} one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> station staff, they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.|$|E

5|$|On the Côte de Peille, Contador {{attacked}} in the peloton. He quickly built an advantage, with Kiserlovski and Trofimov dropping {{back from the}} breakaway to assist him. They built a lead of around a minute, but Team Sky pulled the lead back and Contador's group was <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> foot of the Col d'Èze, with only Tim Wellens (Lotto–Soudal) ahead. Romain Bardet attacked, but Contador chased him down. Contador himself attacked several times, with Sky's Sergio Henao and the Orica–GreenEDGE team chasing him down; Thomas appeared to be struggling. In the final part of the climb, Contador got away, initially with Majka and then with Richie Porte. At {{the top of the}} climb, they caught Wellens and had a 30-second advantage over the chasing group.|$|E

Kate and Sawyer land on the main island and question Karl about the Others. Karl reveals that the Others work on the Hydra island, but live on the main island. The next morning, Sawyer finds Karl crying in the jungle. Karl {{says that he is}} crying because he misses Alex. Sawyer asks Karl if he is in love, which Karl affirms to be true. Sawyer tells him that love is worth the risks of getting <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Others and lets Karl go into the jungle to find Alex.|$|E

5|$|The sixth day {{of racing}} {{was marred by}} poor weather. General {{classification}} contenders Pedro Delgado and Laurent Fignon lost time due to crashing on the descent of Monte Terminillo, while Greg LeMond lost over two minutes. On the final climb of the day, Iñaki Gastón and Leonardo Sierra attacked with eight kilometers to go but were <b>caught</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> chasing riders. Gaston attacked again with a kilometer remaining, but was robbed of the stage win as Vladimir Poulnikov overtook him three meters before the finish. Cipollini won the event's seventh leg {{by means of a}} field sprint.|$|E
5|$|Vincent DiStephano (Raymond Cruz), a United Systems Military soldier sent {{to capture}} {{the crew of the}} Betty, is {{captured}} by the mercenaries {{when the rest of the}} soldiers are killed by the Aliens.
