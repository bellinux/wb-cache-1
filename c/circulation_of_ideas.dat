An elaborate system of censorship and control over scribes did not exist, as scribes were scattered and worked on single manuscripts.

No elaborate system of censorship and control over scribes existed, who until the 14th century were restricted to religious institutions, and their works rarely caused wider controversy. In response to the printing press, and the heresies it allowed to spread, the Roman Catholic Church moved to impose censorship. Printing allowed for multiple exact copies of a work, leading to a more rapid and widespread <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> and information (see print culture).

50|$|As {{technology}} {{continues to}} enable new avenues for communication, collaboration, and <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas,</b> {{it has also}} given rise to new opportunities for consumers {{to create their own}} content. Barriers like time and money are beginning to become less significant to large groups of consumers. For example, the creation of movies once required large amounts of expensive equipment, but now movie clips can be made with equipment that is affordable to a growing number of people. The ease with which consumers create new material has also grown. Extensive knowledge of computer programming is no longer necessary to create content on the internet. Media sharing over the Internet acts as a platform to invite users to participate and create communities that share similar interests through duplicated sources, original content, and repurposed material.|$|E
40|$|Citizenship {{is given}} form, meaning, and power through the {{transactions}} and circulations that constitute it. Our focus {{in this article}} is the ways in which circulations through networks and institutions that extend beyond nation-states are enacted and encouraged through pedagogies and practices that moor habits of citizenship in daily lives. Although there has been significant attention to those practices at national and local levels, there has been relatively little attention to the ways that floating sites of citizenship formation are entwined with, but also seem to be suspended above, other sites. There are at least three ways in which circulations both construct those sites and are entwined in citizenship formation: They are the reason that the seeming contradiction between cosmopolitanism and efforts to moor citizens to place becomes unremarkable; they enable and shape the modes of interaction that conjoin politics and emotional geographies; and {{they are part of the}} way in which a common understanding of active citizenship is accepted almost without question. We use the examples of two international conferences for young citizen-activists to illustrate our arguments regarding the <b>circulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas,</b> norms, and practice that are central to citizenship formation...|$|R

5000|$|... “My {{educational}} background {{is in the}} Soviet Russian avant-garde school of Futurism, which I combine with a nomadic aesthetic of post-Soviet, contemporary Kazakhstan - something that I have been exploring in recent years through my photographic and video work.I use specific ways of expression in modern and contemporary art {{as a vehicle to}} investigate my personal archaic atavism as a certain mystical anthropomorphism. In other words, I explore the nature of a specific Egregore, a shared cultural psychic experience, which manifests itself as a specific thought-form among the people(s) of the ancient, arid and dusty Steppes between the Caspian Sea, Baikonur and Altai in today’s Kazakhstan. In the Russian language, Archaic Atavism is personalized as a being, which points to and creates a different meaning. We are not just speaking about an idea or archaic element in the collective subconscious of a people, but about the embodiment of our archaic atavism that becomes an active entity, just like a creature itself. Our archaic atavism is not just internalized, but also externalized. It is as if he has been awakened by the post-Soviet experience of the indigenous Kazakh people, who are becoming their own after 80 years of Soviet domination and cultural genocide. Suddenly he (Archaic Atavism) became interested in enculturation and in behavioral modernity. He also began to have entertaining dialogues with the transnational <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> in contemporary art. For this dialogue, I have chosen the medium of video and photography and like to work with the notion of memory and reality. My archaic atavism is interested in my video explorations in the Steppes and in post-Soviet Asia. By editing raw data and combining documentary and staged footage, I become his voice, enabling a cultural eхоdus from long oblivion. My work raises metaphysical questions such as who am I? And where shall I go? This (psychic) experience and perspective marks my artistic language.” (Almagul Menlibayeva)÷ ...|$|E
