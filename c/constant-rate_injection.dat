This experiment used an inflatable drill-string packer to conduct pressurized slug tests and <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> tests. Pressure responses during testing indicate dilation of fractures {{as a result}} of fluid injection. Consequently, test data allow examination of the transmissivity of an open fracture network. Analysis of pressurized slug-test data yields an average transmissivity of 1. 0 × I 0 " 5 m 2 s" 1, while recovery data from the <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> tests indicate transmissivities ranging from 4. 7 to 9. 2 × I 0 " 5 m 2 s~ 1. Test data indicate background borehole fluid pressure was 0. 25 to 0. 30 MPa greater than hydrostatic (approximately one-half lithostatic excess pressure) and indicate that fractures within the fault zone remain open at pressures approximately 0. 315 to 0. 325 MPa above hydrostatic...|$|E

The computational results are evaluated in order to provide a measured a discharge measurement's accuracy. The main source causing discrepancies between the actual and measured discharges is the difference in propagation velocities of the tracer cloud and the flood wave.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the relationship between permeability and effective stress in tight petroleum reservoir formations. Specifically, a quantitative method is developed to describe the correlation between permeability and effective stress, a method based on the original in situ reservoir effective stress rather than on decreased effective stress during development. The experimental results show that the relationship between intrinsic permeability and effective stress in reservoirs in general follows a quadratic polynomial functional form, found to best capture how effective stress influences formation permeability. In addition, this experimental study reveals that changes in formation permeability, caused by both elastic and plastic deformation, are permanent and irreversible. Related pore-deformation tests using electronic microscope scanning and <b>constant-rate</b> mercury <b>injection</b> techniques show that while stress variation generally has small impact on rock porosity, {{the size and shape of}} pore throats have a significant impact on permeability-stress sensitivity. Based on the test results and theoretical analyses, we believe that there exists a cone of pressure depression in the area near production within such stress-sensitive tight reservoirs, leading to a low-permeability zone, and that well production will decrease under the influence of stress sensitivity...|$|R

In this paper, a simple analytical solution is developed by invoking steady-state flow and constant thermophysical properties. The analytical solution allows fast evaluation of spatiotemporal temperature fields, resulting from <b>constant-rate</b> CO 2 <b>injection.</b> The applicability of the analytical solution is demonstrated by comparison with non-isothermal simulation results from the reservoir simulator TOUGH 2. Analysis confirms that for an injection rate of 3 kg s− 1 (0. 1 MT yr− 1) into moderately warm (> 40 °C) and permeable formations (> 10 − 14 m 2 (10 mD)), JTC {{is unlikely to be}} a problem for initial reservoir pressures as low as 2 MPa (290 psi) ...|$|R
40|$|Well R- 14 {{is located}} in Ten Site Canyon and was {{completed}} {{at a depth of}} 1316 ft below ground surface (bgs) in August 2002 within unassigned pumiceous deposits located below the Puye Formation (fanglomerate). The well was constructed with two screens positioned below the regional water table. Individual static depths measured for each isolated screen after the Westbay{trademark} transducer monitoring system was installed in mid-December 2002 were nearly identical at 1177 ft bgs, suggesting only horizontal subsurface flow at this time, location, and depth. Screen 1 straddles the geologic contact between the Puye fanglomerate and unassigned pumiceous deposits. Screen 2 is located about 50 ft deeper than screen 1 and is only within the unassigned pumiceous deposits. <b>Constant-rate,</b> straddle-packer, <b>injection</b> tests were conducted at screen 2, including two short tests and one long test. The short tests were 1 minute each but at different injection rates. These short tests were used to select an appropriate injection rate for the long test. We analyzed both injection and recovery data from the long test using the Theis, Theis recovery, Theis residual-recovery, and specific capacity techniques. The Theis injection, Theis recovery, and specific capacity methods correct for partial screen penetration; however, the Theis residual-recovery method does not. The long test at screen 2 involved injection at a rate of 10. 1 gallons per minute (gpm) for 68 minutes and recovery for the next 85 minutes. The Theis analysis for screen 2 gave the best fit to residual recovery data. These results suggest that the 158 -ft thick deposits opposite screen 2 have a transmissivity (T) equal to or greater than 143 ft{sup 2 }/day, and correspond to a horizontal hydraulic conductivity (K) of at least 0. 9 ft/day. The specific capacity method yielded a T value equal to or greater than 177 ft{sup 2 }/day, and a horizontal K of at least 1. 1 ft/day. Results from the injection and recovery phases of the test at screen 2 were similar to those from the residual-recovery portion of the test, but were lower by a factor of about two. The response to injection was typical for a partially penetrating well screen in a very thick aquifer...|$|R
40|$|Tracer tests {{performed}} under natural or forced gradient flow conditions can provide useful information for characterizing subsurface properties, through monitoring, modeling, {{and interpretation of}} the tracer plume migration in an aquifer. Nonreactive tracer experiments were conducted at the Hanford 300 Area, along with <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> tests and electromagnetic borehole flow meter tests. A Bayesian data assimilation technique, the method of anchored distributions (MAD) (Rubin et al., 2010), was applied to assimilate the experimental tracer test data with the other types of data and to infer the three-dimensional heterogeneous structure of the hydraulic conductivity in the saturated zone of the Hanford formation. In this study, the Bayesian prior information on the underlying random hydraulic conductivity field was obtained from previous field characterization efforts using <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> and borehole flow meter test data. The posterior distribution of the conductivity field was obtained by further conditioning the field on the temporal moments of tracer breakthrough curves at various observation wells. MAD was implemented with the massively parallel three-dimensional flow and transport code PFLOTRAN {{to cope with the}} highly transient flow boundary conditions at the site and to meet the computational demands of MAD. A synthetic study proved that the proposed method could effectively invert tracer test data to capture the essential spatial heterogeneity of the three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity field. Application of MAD to actual field tracer data at the Hanford 300 Area demonstrates that inverting for spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity under transient flow conditions is challenging and more work is needed...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} utility of <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> of a nonrecirculating indicator (H 2) for the measurement of cardiac output in man. 42 patients were studied during cardiac catheterization and 8 during acute complications of arteriosclerotic heart disease, including acute myocardial infarction. Pulmonary (or systemic) arterial H 2 concentration was measured chromatographically from 2. 0 ml blood samples drawn during <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> of dissolved H 2 into the systemic venous circulation (or left heart). The chromatograph was a thermal conductivity unit housed in a constant-temperature water bath to achieve an improved signal-to-noise ratio. Intrapulmonary H 2 elimination from mixed venous blood was measured directly in 14 patients and averaged 98 ± 1. 5 % (SD). Reproducibility of output measurements was evaluated using triplicate determinations obtained over 45 - 60 sec in 25 consecutive patients. Coefficients of variation (SD/Mean × 100) averaged 3. 4 ± 2. 0 %, {{making it possible to}} evaluate relatively small changes in measured output with conventional statistical tests. Individual measurements could be repeated at 10 - 15 sec intervals. Comparisons of H 2 and direct Fick measurements were made in 14 patients; H 2 outputs averaged 106 ± 4 % (SEM) of Fick outputs (P > 0. 1). Comparisons of H 2 and dye dilution measurements were performed in an additional 24 patients. Seven had angiographically-negligible valvular regurgitation and dye outputs averaged 106 ± 3 % of H 2 outputs (P > 0. 1). 17 had moderate-to-severe regurigation and dye outputs averaged 91 ± 4 % of H 2 outputs (P < 0. 05), suggesting a small but systematic error due to undetected recirculation of dye. The H 2 technique appears advantageous for rapidly repeated determinations of output, for quantitation of small changes in output, and for situations in which recirculation of conventional indicators is a potentially significant problem...|$|E
40|$|An {{inflatable}} drill-string packer {{was used}} at Site 839 {{to measure the}} bulk in-situ permeability within basalts cored in Hole 839 B. The packer was inflated at two depths, 398. 2 and 326. 9 mbsf; all on-board information indicated that the packer mechanically closed off the borehole, although apparently the packer hydraulically sealed the borehole only at 398. 2 mbsf. Two pulse tests were run at each depth, two <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> tests were run at the first set, and four were run at the second. Of these, only the <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> tests at the first set yielded a permeability, calculated as ranging from 1 to 5 * 10 **- 12 m** 2. Pulse tests and <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> tests for the second set did not yield valid data. The measured permeability is an upper limit; if the packer leaked during the experiments, the basalt would be less permeable. In comparison, permeabilities measured at other Deep Sea Drilling Project and Ocean Drilling Program sites in pillow basalts and flows similar to those measured in Hole 839 B are mainly about 10 **- 13 to 10 **- 14 m** 2. Thus, if our results are valid, the basalts at Site 839 are more permeable than ocean-floor basalts investigated elsewhere. Based on other supporting evidence, we consider these results to be a valid measure of the permeability of the basalts. Temperature data and the geochemical and geotechnical properties of the drilled sediments all indicate that the site is strongly affected by fluid flow. The heat flow is very much less than expected in young oceanic basalts, probably a result of rapid fluid circulation through the crust. The geochemistry of pore fluids {{is similar to that}} of seawater, indicating seawater flow through the sediments, and sediments are uniformly underconsolidated for their burial depth, again indicating probable fluid flow. The basalts are highly vesicular. However, the vesicularity can only account for part of the average porosity measured on the neutron porosity well log; the remainder of the measured porosity is likely present as voids and fractures within and between thin-bedded basalts. Core samples, together with porosity, density, and resistivity well-log data show locations where the basalt section is thin bedded and probably has from 15 % to 35 % void and fracture porosity. Thus, the measured permeability seems reasonable with respect to the high measured porosity. Much of the fluid flow at Site 839 could be directed through highly porous and permeable zones within and between the basalt flows and in the sediment layer just above the basalt. Thus, the permeability measurements give an indication of where and how fluid flow may occur within the oceanic crust of the Lau Basin...|$|E
40|$|Depleted {{natural gas}} {{reservoirs}} are a promising target for Carbon Sequestration with Enhanced Gas Recovery (CSEGR). The {{focus of this}} study is on evaluating the importance of Joule-Thomson cooling during CO 2 injection into depleted natural gas reservoirs. Joule-Thomson cooling is the adiabatic cooling that accompanies the expansion of a real gas. If Joule-Thomson cooling were extreme, injectivity and formation permeability could be altered by the freezing of residual water, formation of hydrates, and fracturing due to thermal stresses. The TOUGH 2 /EOS 7 C module for CO 2 -CH 4 -H 2 O mixtures is used as the simulation analysis tool. For verification of EOS 7 C, the classic Joule-Thomson expansion experiment is modeled for pure CO 2 resulting in Joule-Thomson coefficients in agreement with standard references to within 5 - 7 percent. For demonstration purposes, CO 2 injection at constant pressure and with a large pressure drop (~; 50 bars) is presented in order to show that cooling by more than 20 oC can occur by this effect. Two more-realistic <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> cases show that for typical systems in the Sacramento Valley, California, the Joule-Thomson cooling effect is minimal. This simulation study shows that for constant-rate injections into high-permeability reservoirs, the Joule-Thomson cooling effect is not expected to create significant problems for CSEGR...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a stochastic, three-dimensional characterization of a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field within DOE's Hanford 300 Area site, Washington, by assimilating large-scale, <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> test data with small-scale, three-dimensional electromagnetic borehole flowmeter (EBF) measurement data. We first inverted the injection test data {{to estimate the}} transmissivity field, using zeroth-order temporal moments of pressure buildup curves. We applied a newly developed Bayesian geostatistical inversion framework, the method of anchored distributions (MAD), to obtain a joint posterior distribution of geostatistical parameters and local log-transmissivities at multiple locations. The unique aspects of MAD that make it suitable for this purpose are its ability to integrate multi-scale, multi-type data within a Bayesian framework and to compute a nonparametric posterior distribution. After we combined the distribution of transmissivities with depth-discrete relative-conductivity profile from the EBF data, we inferred the three-dimensional geostatistical parameters of the log-conductivity field, using the Bayesian model-based geostatistics. Such consistent use of the Bayesian approach throughout the procedure enabled us to systematically incorporate data uncertainty into the final posterior distribution. The method was tested in a synthetic study and validated using the actual data that {{was not part of}} the estimation. Results showed broader and skewed posterior distributions of geostatistical parameters except for the mean, which suggests the importance of inferring the entire distribution to quantify the parameter uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{variation}} in physical parameters responsible for the transition from convective to conductive heat flow near mid-ocean ridges, in situ permeability and pore-pressure measurements were made 200 meters into oceanic crustal Layer 2 A in DSDP Hole 504 B, on the south flank of the Costa Rica Rift. Conventional "slug " and <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> tests were made below a hydraulic packer set at various depths in the hole. The packer was first set in a massive flow unit 37 meters below the sediment/basement interface. The bulk permeability of the 172. 5 meters of pillow basalts and basaltic flows below the packer {{was found to be}} about 40 millidarcys (4 × 10 ~ 10 cm 2). Measurements over 3 - and 15 -meter intervals {{at the bottom of the}} hole in an altered pillow zone indicated a bulk permeability of 2 to 4 millidarcys and formation pore pressures approximately 10 bars (~ 2 %) below hydrostatic. Inter-pretation of the data with respect to simple numerical convection models suggests that the transition from convective to conductive heat flow is controlled by the cessation of convective heat transport through the sedimentary layer, rather than the cessation of convection in the basement. Furthermore, the agreement between observed and modelled under-pressures implies that Hole 504 B penetrated an active ocean crustal convection system. The thick sedimentary layer, layers of basal chert, and massive flow basalts above the Layer 2 A pillow flows apparently form an impermeable lid, ef-fectively isolating the convective system from the ocean...|$|E
40|$|During {{injection}} {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) into deep saline aquifers, the available pore volume of the aquifer may be used inefficiently, thereby decreasing the effective capacity of the repository for CO 2 storage. Storage efficiency is the fraction of the available pore space that is utilized for CO 2 storage, or, in other words, it is the ratio between the volume of stored CO 2 and the maximum available pore volume. In this note, we derive and present simple analytical expressions for estimating CO 2 storage efficiency under the scenario of a <b>constant-rate</b> <b>injection</b> of CO 2 into a confined, homogeneous, isotropic, saline aquifer. The expressions for storage efficiency are derived from models developed previously by other researchers describing {{the shape of the}} CO 2 -brine interface. The storage efficiency of CO 2 is found to depend on three dimensionless groups, namely: (1) the residual saturation of brine after displacement by CO 2; (2) the ratio of CO 2 mobility to brine mobility; (3) a dimensionless group (which we call a “gravity factor”) that quantifies the importance of CO 2 buoyancy relative to CO 2 injection rate. In the particular case of negligible residual brine saturation and negligible buoyancy effects, the storage efficiency is approximately equal to the ratio of the CO 2 viscosity to the brine viscosity. Storage efficiency decreases as the gravity factor increases, because the buoyancy of the CO 2 causes it to occupy a thin layer {{at the top of the}} confined formation, while leaving the lower part of the aquifer under-utilized. Estimates of storage efficiency from our simple analytical expressions are in reasonable agreement with values calculated from simulations performed with more complicated multi-phase-flow simulation software. Therefore, we suggest that the analytical expressions presented herein could be used as a simple and rapid tool to screen the technical or economic feasibility of a proposed CO 2 injection scenario...|$|E
