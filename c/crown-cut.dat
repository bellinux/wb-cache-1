40|$|This {{research}} {{determines the}} profitability for farmers of marketing film-wrapped <b>Crown-Cut</b> broccoli in Southwest Virginia. Historical price {{data was collected}} in three eastern terminal markets (Atlanta, Baltimore, and Philadelphia) for <b>Crown-Cut</b> and bunched broccoli from October 1998 to January 2005. Cost-of-production budgets were estimated for <b>Crown-Cut</b> broccoli. The economic data was entered into a market window analysis and the profitability of each market was evaluated. The profitability of <b>Crown-Cut</b> broccoli was illustrated by market-window graphics. Market windows were generated using an analysis platform developed by Kalo (1998). The profitability estimates were calculated by posting historical market prices by week in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and subtracting corresponding unit costs for transportation and production. Study results {{show that there is}} potential profit for producing <b>Crown-Cut</b> broccoli during the first weeks of October. Atlanta proved to have the most profit potential of the three markets studied. Given the frost dates in the area, these production windows favor broccoli production without weather risk. Southwestern Virginia should consider developing <b>Crown-Cut</b> production options: the early open market windows combined with the potential for reducing production costs by double-cropping means that a potential profit opportunity exists.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{packaging}} treatments, post harvest cooling delay and storage duration on color, texture, ascorbic acid content, {{weight loss and}} glucosinolate retention in <b>crown-cut</b> heads of broccoli were studied. Oxygen and CO 2 levels inside shrink wrap packages were also monitored. Shrink wrap packaging had a significant positive effect on hue angle (p 0. 05). Packaging and post harvest cooling delay {{had no effect on}} hue difference (H) and total color difference (E). While post harvest cooling delay had no effect on texture, <b>crown-cut</b> heads of broccoli stored in shrink wrap packaging retained firmness significantly better than ice packaged heads of broccoli (p 0. 05). Ascorbic acid was retained better in broccoli held in shrink wrap packages and cooling delay had a significant negative influence on ascorbic acid content (p 0. 05). Packaging and post harvest cooling delay had a significant positive effect on weight loss (p 0. 05). Broccoli stored in shrink wrap film lost about 3. 7 % of original weight while ice packaging resulted in about 17. 4 % weight loss (p 0. 05). No consistent trends were observed in the levels of O 2 and CO 2 inside shrink wrap packages. An important glucosinolate, glucoraphanin wa...|$|E
