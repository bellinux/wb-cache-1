In the 1910 s, Mendelian genetics fused with the <b>chromosomal</b> theory of <b>inheritance,</b> giving rise to what is still called ‘classical genetics’. Within this framework, the gene is simultaneously a unit of function and transmission, a unit of recombination, and of mutation. Until the early 1950 s, these concepts of the gene coincided.

Then began the venture of molecular biology, which has never stopped revealing the complexity of the way in which hereditary material functions...|$|R

40|$|Heterochromatin {{assembly}} in fission yeast is initiated by binding of Swi 6 /HP 1 to the Lys- 9 -dimethylated H 3 followed by spreading via cooperative recruitment of Swi 6 /HP 1. Recruitment of Cohesin by Swi 6 /HP 1 further stabilizes the heterochromatin structure and integrity. Subsequently, polyubiquitylation of Cut 2 by anaphase-promoting complex-cyclosome (APC/C) -ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E 3 ligase) followed by degradation of Cut 2 releases Cut 1, which cleaves the Rad 21 subunit of Cohesin, facilitating sister chromatid separation during mitosis. Here, we demonstrate a surprising role of APC/C in assembly of heterochromatin and silencing at mating type, centromere, and ribosomal DNA loci. Coincidentally {{with the loss}} of silencing, recruitment of Swi 6, H 3 -Lys- 9 -Me 2, and Clr 4 at dg-dh repeats at cen 1 and the K region of mat locus is abrogated in mutants cut 4, cut 9, and nuc 2. Surprisingly, both Cut 4 and Cut 9 are also highly enriched at these regions in wild type and depleted in swi 6 Δ mutant. Cut 4 and Cut 9 interact directly with Swi 6 /HP 1 and Clr 4, whereas the mutant Cut 4 does not, suggesting that a direct physical interaction of APC subunits Cut 4 and Cut 9 with Swi 6 and Clr 4 is instrumental in heterochromatin assembly. The silencing defect in APC mutants is causally related to ubiquitylation activity of APC-E 3 ligase. Like swi 6 mutant, APC mutants are also defective in Cohesin recruitment and exhibit defects like lagging chromosomes, chromosome loss, and aberrant recombination in the mat region. In addition, APC mutants exhibit a bidirectional expression of dh repeats, suggesting a role in the RNA interference pathway. Thus, APC and heterochromatin proteins Swi 6 and Clr 4 play a mutually cooperative role in heterochromatin assembly, thereby ensuring <b>chromosomal</b> integrity, <b>inheritance,</b> and segregation during mitosis and meiosis...|$|R
40|$|Karyotypic fission {{theory of}} Todd offers an {{explanation}} for the diverse range of diploid numbers of many mammalian taxa. Theoretically, a full complement of acrocentric chromosomes can be introduced into a population by <b>chromosomal</b> fission. Subsequent <b>inheritance</b> of ancestral chromosomes and paired fission derivatives potentially generates a diploid range from the ancestral condition to double its number of chromosomes. Although it is undisputed that both chromosomal fission and fusion (“Robertsonian rearrangements”) have significantly contributed to karyological diversity, it is generally assumed that independent events, the fission of single chromosomes or the fusion of two chromosomes, are the sources of such change. The karyotypic fission idea by contrast posits that all mediocentric chromosomes simultaneously fission. Here I propose a specific cell biological mechanism for Todd's karyotypic fission concept, “kinetochore reproduction theory,” where a complete set of dicentric chromatids is synthesized during gametogenesis, and kinetochore protein dephosphorylation regulates dicentric chromatid segregation. Three postulates of kinetochore reproduction theory are: (i) breakage of dicentric chromosomes between centromere pairs forms acrocentric derivatives, (ii) de novo capping of newly synthesized acrocentric ends with telomeric DNA stabilizes these derivatives, and (iii) mitotic checkpoints regulate chromosomal disjunction to generate fissioned karyotypes. Subsequent chromosomal rearrangement, especially pericentric inversion, increases the probability of genetic isolation amongst incipient sympatric species polytypic for fission-generated acrocentric autosomes. This mechanism obviates the requirement for numerous independent Robertsonian rearrangements and neatly accounts for mammalian karyotype evolution as exemplified in analyses of Carnivora, Artiodactyla, and Primates...|$|R

40|$|Armillaria root {{disease is}} one of the most {{damaging}} timber and fruit tree diseases in the world. Despite its economic importance, many basic questions about the biology of the causal fungi, Armillaria spp., are unanswered. For example, Armillaria undergoes matings between diploid and haploid mycelia, which can result in a recombinant diploid without meiosis. Evidence of such somatic recombination in natural populations suggests that this reproductive mode may affect the pathogen's ecology. Investigations of the mechanisms and adaptive consequences of somatic recombination are, however, hampered by the lack of a method to reliably synthesize somatic recombinants. Here we report the first genetic transformation system for the genus Armillaria. We transformed A. mellea with selective markers for use in diploid-haploid matings to reliably synthesize somatic recombinants. This was accomplished with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying pBGgHg, which carries the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hph). hph was integrated into transformants, as evidenced by serial transfer to selective media, PCR, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and Southern hybridization. Nuclear and mitochondrial markers were developed to genotype synthesized mycelia. In matings between a wild-type diploid and hygromycin-resistant haploids (transgenic), we identified recombinant, hygromycin-resistant diploids and, additionally, hygromycin-resistant triploids, all with the mitochondrial haplotype of the haploid partner. Our approach created no mycelium in which the haploid nucleus was replaced by the diploid nucleus, the typical outcome of diploid-haploid matings in Armillaria. This genetic transformation system, in combination with new markers to track <b>chromosomal</b> and cytoplasmic <b>inheritance</b> in A. mellea, will advance research aimed at characterizing the significance of somatic recombination in the ecology of this important fungus...|$|R

Management of patients with congenital heart diseases has been greatly transformed during the past s ix decades; nevertheless the underlying causes for the defects and pathogenic mechanisms remain enigmatic. Tools of molecular biology and human genetics have provided avenues for recognizing disease genes causing congenital heart defects. A small portion of all cases of congenital heart defects can be attributed to Mendelian <b>inheritance,</b> <b>chromosomal</b> anomalies or the action of known environmental teratogenic agents. There is seldom any evidence of the causative agents in the common forms of CHD. A better understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms of heart development is expected to help in delineating the morphogenesis of cardiac anomalies and in defining ways of effective prevention or in utero repair of the defects at embryonic or fetal stage. The beginning of a systematic approach to the study of congenital anomalies can be traced to Sir William Osler. Osler, when at McGill University initiated a collection of specimens of malformed hearts, which was referred to as the Osler collection. Osler encouraged Maude Abbott, who was curator of the medical museums at Montreal, to work at his museum and in 1936 they published the first atlas of congenital heart diseases. Some years earlier in his Hunterian lectures, published in The Lancet, Sir Arthur Keith had also chronicled a full account of cardiac malformations. These writings are considered to have spurred the development of pediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery. Not much changed in the field of congenital heart disease until the middle of the 19 th century.

Congenital anomalies are {{a diverse group of}} disorders of prenatal origin, which can be caused by single gene defects, <b>chromosomal</b> disorders, multifactorial <b>inheritance,</b> environmental teratogens or micronutrient malnutrition. This manual is intended to serve as a tool for the development, implementation and ongoing improvement of a congenital anomalies surveillance programme, particularly for countries with limited resources. The focus of the manual is on population-based and hospital-based surveillance programmes. Some countries may not find it feasible to begin with the development of a population-based programme. Therefore, the manual covers the methodology needed for the development of both population-based and hospital-based surveillance programmes. Further, although many births in predominantly low- and middle- income countries occur outside of hospitals, some countries with limited resources may choose to start with a hospital-based surveillance programme and expand it later into one that is population based. Any country wishing to expand its current hospital-based programme into a population-based programme, or to begin the initial development of a population-based system, should find this manual helpful in reaching its goal. This manual provides selected examples of congenital anomalies (see Appendix A). Typically, these anomalies are severe enough that they would probably be captured during the first few days following birth. Also, because of their severity and frequency, these selected conditions have significant public health impact, and for some there is a potential for primary prevention. Nevertheless, these are just suggestions, and countries can choose to monitor a subset of these conditions or add other congenital anomalies to meet their needs. In particular, this manual will help the reader to: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 describe the purpose and importance of public health surveillance of congenital anomalies; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 describe the use of logic models for planning and evaluation of a surveillance programme; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 understand how to present data to policy-makers; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 identify an initial list of congenital anomalies to consider for monitoring; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 describe the tools needed to ascertain and code identified cases; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 describe the processes for managing and analysing data; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 understand how to calculate the prevalence of congenital anomalies. Surveillance of congenital anomalies should be ongoing and should involve a systematic review of birth outcomes to determine the presence of congenital anomalies. If countries have the capacity to identify risk factors associated with congenital anomalies such as maternal exposures (e. g., use of medications during the first trimester), a pregnancy registry or a case 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 ccontrol study can be implemented to allow for the collection of exposure data during pregnancy.

Recently, attempts to characterize target antigens for cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses from NZB anti-H- 2 -identical mixed leukocyte cultures have led to the identification of a new aUoantigen, called maternally transmitted antigen (Mta) (3 - 5). Mta is a cell surface antigen found on lymphocytes from most mouse strains (3); it is recognized by H- 2 -nonrestricted CTL from the few Mta- strains, NZB/BIN, NZO, or NMRI (3). Interestingly, two substrains of NZB mice, NZB/BIPt and NZB/Fiill do express Mta (3, 4).

In filamentous fungi, STRIPAK was initially discovered in Sordaria macrospora, a model system for fungal differentiation. Here, we function-ally characterize the STRIPAK subunit PRO 45, a homolog of human SLMAP. We show that PRO 45 is required for sexual propa-gation and cell-to-cell fusion and that its forkhead-associated (FHA) domain is essential for these processes. Protein-protein in-teraction studies revealed that PRO 45 binds to STRIPAK subunits PRO 11 and SmMOB 3, which are also required for sexual propagation. Superresolution structured-illuminationmicroscopy (SIM) further established that PRO 45 localizes to the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, andmitochondria. SIM also showed that localization to the nuclear envelope requires STRIPAK subunits PRO 11 andPRO 22,whereas formitochondria it does not. Taken together, our study provides important insights into fundamental roles of the fungal SLMAPhomolog PRO 45 and suggests STRIPAK-related and STRIPAK-unrelated functions.

40|$|Authors: Magdalena Lütz & Noemí Colombo ### Abstract PCR {{amplification}} of {{a single}} copy nuclear region and a multicopy mitochondrial region together results in the competition between targets unequally represented in a single tube PCR reaction. This protocol allows a correct amplification of both products by adopting a sequential lay out of the PCR reaction which enhances the amplification of the nuclear gene in the first step and the mitochondrial gene in the final step. ### Introduction Multiplex PCR was first described by Chamberlain et al., 1988. It allows simultaneous amplification of many targets in a single reaction by using more than one pair of primers. Our objective was to amplify a nuclear region and a mitochondrial region which are present in different numbers in the cell due to the polyploid nature of mitochondrial DNA. Multiplex PCR {{of a single}} copy nuclear region and a multicopy mitochondrial region together results in the competition between targets unequally represented. We designed a two-steps PCR reaction: in the first one, a 25 µl reaction was set adding only the primers amplifying the nuclear target. In this case, the nuclear target was a 170 bp SCARE 3 M 12 marker associated to the restorer of fertility allele Rf 3 in maize (Zhang et al., 2006). After 10 cycles the reaction was stopped and the primers to amplify the mitochondrial region were added, maintaining constant concentrations for the buffer, Mg 2 Cl and dNTPs in a 27 µl reaction. The mitochondrial primers amplify a 799 bp region of the cytoplasmic male sterility-associated orf 355 in CMS-S maize (Liu et al., 2002). Both sets of primers were chosen so {{that they had the}} same annealing temperature. The sequential lay out of the reaction allowed for efficient amplification of both products. ### Materials 1.

40|$|International audienceThe faster {{evolution}} of X chromosomes {{has been documented}} in several species, and results from the increased efficiency of selection on recessive alleles in hemizygous males and/or from increased drift due to the smaller effective population size of X chromosomes. Aphids are excellent models for evaluating the importance of selection in faster-X evolution because their peculiar life cycle and unusual inheritance of sex chromosomes should generally lead to equivalent effective population sizes for X and autosomes. Because we lack a high-density genetic map for the pea aphid, whose complete genome has been sequenced, we first assigned its entire genome to the X or autosomes based on ratios of sequencing depth in males (X 0) to females (XX). Then, we computed nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions ratios (dN/dS) for the pea aphid gene set and found faster {{evolution of}} X-linked genes. Our analyses of substitution rates, together with polymorphism and expression data, showed that relaxed selection {{is likely to be}} the greatest contributor to faster-X because a large fraction of X-linked genes are expressed at low rates and thus escape selection. Yet, a minor role for positive selection is also suggested by the difference between substitution rates for X and autosomes for male-biased genes (but not for asexual female-biased genes) and by lower Tajima’s D for X-linked compared with autosomal genes with highly male-biased expression patterns. This study highlights the relevance of organisms displaying alternative <b>chromosomal</b> <b>inheritance</b> to the understanding of forces shaping genome evolution...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{establishment}} of the bisexual fertile fish hybrid lineage including the allodiploid and allotetraploid hybrids, from interspecific hybridization of red crucian carp (Carassius auratus red var. 2 n = 100, 2 n = AA) (♀) × common carp (Cyprinus carpio L. 2 n = 100, 2 n = BB) (♂), provided a good platform to investigate genetic relationship between the parents and their hybrid progenies. Results: The <b>chromosomal</b> <b>inheritance</b> of diploid and allotetraploid hybrid progenies in successive generations, was studied by applying 5 S rDNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. Signals of 5 S rDNA distinguished the chromosomal constitution of common carp (B-genome) from red crucian carp (A-genome), in which two strong signals were observed on the first submetacentric chromosome, while no major signal was found in common carp. After fish hybridization, one strong signal of 5 S rDNA was detected in the same locus on the chromosome of diploid hybrids. As expected, two strong signals were observed in 4 nF 3 tetraploid hybrids offspring and it is worth mentioning that two strong signals were detected in a separating bivalent of a primary spermatocyte in 4 nF 3. Furthermore, the mitosis of heterozygous chromosomes was shown normal and stable with blastular tissue histological studies. Conclusions: We revealed that 5 S rDNA signal {{can be applied to}} discern A-genome from B-genome, and that 5 S rDNA bearing chromosomes can be stably passed down in successive generations. Our work provided a significant method in fish breeding and this is important for studies in fish evolutionary biology...|$|E
