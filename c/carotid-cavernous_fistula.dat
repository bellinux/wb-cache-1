50|$|It is {{the only}} {{anatomic}} location in the body in which an artery travels completely through a venous structure.

40|$|Symptomatic {{patients}} with dural <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistulas</b> often require treatment. Traditional therapies, which often {{are not completely}} successful, include manual com-mon carotid artery compression and embolization via transarterial routes. This report describes four symptomatic {{patients with}} spontaneous dural <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistulas</b> who were treated unsuccessfully with transarterial embolotherapy and subsequently treated successfully by having a detachable balloon introduced into the cavernous sinus via the superior ophthalmic vein, which was surgically exposed.

40|$|<b>Carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistulas</b> (CCFs) are rare, {{pathologic}} communications of the {{carotid artery}} and the venous plexus of the cavernous sinus. They can develop spontaneously in certain at risk individuals or following traumatic head injury. Typical clinical manifestations include headache, proptosis, orbital pain, and diplopia. We report {{a case of}} bilateral <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistulas</b> associated with these symptoms and also with pituitary enlargement and hypopituitarism, which improved following surgical intervention. Arterialization of the cavernous sinus and elevated portal pressure may interfere with normal venous drainage and the conveyance of inhibiting and releasing hormones from the hypothalamus, resulting in pituitary enlargement and hypopituitarism. This condition {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis of hypopituitarism associated with anterior pituitary enlargement...|$|R
50|$|Potential {{causes of}} {{cavernous}} sinus syndrome include metastatic tumors, direct extension of nasopharyngeal tumors, meningioma, pituitary tumors or pituitary apoplexy, aneurysms of the intracavernous carotid artery, <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistula,</b> bacterial infection causing cavernous sinus thrombosis, aseptic thrombosis, idiopathic granulomatous disease (Tolosa-Hunt syndrome), and fungal infections.

50|$|A <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistula</b> (CCF) {{results from}} an {{abnormal}} {{communication between the}} arterial and venous systems within the cavernous sinus in the skull. It {{is a type of}} arteriovenous fistula. As arterial blood under high pressure enters the cavernous sinus, the normal venous return to the cavernous sinus is impeded and this causes engorgement of the draining veins, manifesting most dramatically as a sudden engorgement and redness of the eye of the same side.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s Fedor Serbinenko {{developed}} a technique for closing aneurysms with balloons that were {{released into the}} internal carotid artery by occluding the light.

40|$|SUMMARY: Three {{patients}} with spontaneous dural <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistulas</b> were treated {{by using a}} combination of detachable coils and Onyx liquid embolic agent. Cavernous sinus was accessed via the superior ophthalmic vein or inferior petrous sinus approach. In all cases, a complete angiographic closure of the fistulas was achieved with full recovery from neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms. This report suggests that the controlled and excellent penetration of Onyx is superb for blocking the intricate communication of dural <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistulas.</b> Ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) (Onyx, MicroTherapeutics, Irvine, Calif), is a nonadhesive liquid em-bolic agent that was evaluated at UCLA Medical Center be-tween January 1998 and May 1999. Experimental histopatho-logic research in swine rete mirabile had already been performed between 1997 and 1998. 1, 2 The FDA approved the intravascular use of Onyx for embolization of intracranial ar-teriovenous malformations (AVMs) in July 2005.

50|$|Though the sphenoidal {{emissary}} foramen {{is small}} and variable, it is consistently symmetrical. In a study in which 50 high-resolution CT scans of {{the base of the}} skull were reviewed, the significance of asymmetry was investigated. In a large number of cases, the foramen was remarkably symmetric, and where there was asymmetry, it signified abnormality in four of the six cases. Abnormal causes of asymmetry included invasion by nasopharyngeal melanoma, angiofibroma, <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistula</b> with drainage through the emissary veins, and neurofibromatosis. Thus, for the usually symmetric sphenoidal emissary foramina, asymmetry is more likely the result of a pathologic process than a normal variant. Ginsberg, Pruett, Chen and Elster did not find that asymmetry indicated disease in a study under 123 CT studies.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of {{spontaneous}} direct <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistula</b> causing abrupt loss of vision. Case Report: A 50 -year-old woman with systemic hypertension but no history of ocular disease developed sudden proptosis, frozen eye, subconjunctival hemorrhage and loss of vision in her left eye over 2 hours. Imaging studies revealed a direct <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistula.</b> Management for high intraocular pressure was promptly initiated and the patient was referred to a neurosurgery service, but she refused any surgical intervention. Ultimately, she accepted to undergo manual carotid artery compression which resulted in significant reduction in the proptosis, but she lost all vision permanently. Conclusion: Direct <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistula</b> can occur spontaneously and {{should be taken into}} account in patients with signs suggestive of direct carotid-cavernous sinus fistula even without history of trauma or connective tissue disorder...|$|E

The patients (18 men and 21 women, age range: 52 - 68 years) were further divided into 4 subgroups: 12 of them had retinitis pigmentosa, 15 simple chronic glaucoma, 8 low-tension glaucoma and 4 <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistulas.</b> Color-Doppler yielded useful pieces of information on the position of orbital vessels and flow direction, while pulsed Doppler allowed the measurement of several variables, i. e., time average velocity, protosystolic velocity, peak systolic velocity, mesodiastolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistive index and pulsatility index. The study of the 20 healthy volunteers yielded valuable information on the anatomy and flow patterns of some vessels, such as the ophthalmic artery, the central retinal artery, the lacrimal artery and the posterior ciliary arteries, all of them visible in 90 - 100 % of patients; the central retinal vein, the superior ophthalmic vein and venae varicosae were demonstrated in about 10 - 30 % of them. In the group of patients, the mean flow velocities of the examined arteries were significantly lower than those in the normal volunteers; in the patients with <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistulas</b> an ectasic superior ophthalmic vein was demonstrated, with its typical flow "arterialization" pattern.

In the cavernous sinus, common sites of non-traumatic and traumatic carotid aneurysms as well as traumatic <b>carotid-cavernous</b> <b>fistulas</b> were the C_ 3 -senment and C 4 -C 5 Junction of the internal carotid artery although 27 per cent of non-traumatic carotid aneurysms originated in the C_ 4 -segment of the carotid artery. An anatomical study of 37 cavernous sinuses removed from 23 cadavers revealed the following findings. The inner surface of the venous sinus was covered with endothelial cell layers. The size and shape of the venous sinuses vary considerably, but they can be divided into three major groups: 1) the broken (58 per cent) or 2) the unbroken (33 per cent) according to the amount of trabeculae and 3) the small scattered venous channel without trabeculation (9 per cent).
