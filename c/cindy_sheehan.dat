25|$|At an August 27, 2007, peace {{rally in}} Kennebunkport, Maine, McKinney {{confirmed}} {{the depth of}} her disenchantment with the Democratic Party, urging San Francisco voters to replace Nancy Pelosi with antiwar activist <b>Cindy</b> <b>Sheehan.</b> On September 10, {{in a letter to}} the Steering Committee of the Green Party of the United States, McKinney stated she would not seek the Green Party nomination for president.

25|$|A {{series of}} protests were {{organized}} and held following Lopez's death. The protests were mainly organized by immigrant, religious {{and community groups}} and activists. Many protesters have stated that Lopez's shooting {{was a case of}} police brutality, and that Lopez, who was Latino, was a victim of racial profiling by the deputies. On October 25, 2013, more than 100 people, consisting mostly of {{middle school and high school}} students, protested at the Santa Rosa City Hall. On October 29, over 1,000 people attended a protest in downtown Santa Rosa, in the form of a mass march. The march initiated in the Courthouse Square in downtown Santa Rosa, and ended at the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office. Lawyer John Burris, who represented the family of police shooting victim Oscar Grant, gave a speech at the rally. Attendees traveled from all over the San Francisco Bay Area to attend the event.

On August 4, 2012, Barr won the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party. Barr's running mate, <b>Cindy</b> <b>Sheehan,</b> immediately had disagreements with Barr, from Barr's views on policy, to Barr's desire to only campaign online, and Barr's treatment of Green Party nominee Jill Stein, leading Sheehan to request her name taken off the Peace and Freedom Party ticket. Sheehan was told {{it was too late}} to have her name removed, so she instead announced that she was simply leaving the campaign.|$|E
500|$|Ojeda Ríos also {{discussed}} international politics, {{in particular the}} involvement of local politicians with the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), nothing the peculiarity that Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño and Eduardo Bathia supported the initiative. After citing that the former supported recent criticism issued by Condolezza Rice against Venezuela, {{he argued that the}} treaty only [...] "granted more control" [...] to the United States over the other parts and represented a threat to Puerto Rico, since production costs in these countries were lower and could trigger a migration of enterprises. Ojeda Ríos also expressed that despite openly supporting Puerto Rican independence, Castro and Chavéz had avoided adopting radical measures on the matter, arguing that they were most likely being cautious since their involvement in local affair at could justify military intervention by the United States. When discussing the ongoing war in Iraq, he called it [...] "part of a geopolitical strategy for the Middle East" [...] and claimed that it served economic interests, calling it [...] "the most abusive war" [...] since Vietnam. Ojeda Ríos expressed opposition to the military recruitment of students in high schools and lamented the participation of Puerto Ricans in this war. He also supported the anti-war activism of <b>Cindy</b> <b>Sheehan</b> and Sonia Santiago.

2500|$|In a CounterPunch {{article in}} August 2005, Cockburn {{referred}} to Hitchens as: [...] "A guy who called Sid Blumenthal {{one of his}} best friends and then tried to have him thrown into prison for perjury; a guy who waited til his friend Edward Said was on his death bed before attacking him in the Atlantic Monthly; a guy who knows perfectly well the role Israel plays in US policy but who does not scruple to flail <b>Cindy</b> <b>Sheehan</b> as a LaRouchie and anti-Semite because, maybe, she dared mention the word Israel." [...] In response Hitchens stood by his standpoint on the deposition he made to prosecutors regarding Sidney Blumenthal during the impeachment of Bill Clinton and his critical review of Edward Said's book Orientalism (1978). He stated that the review was determined by the 25th anniversary of the book's original publication and not by the state of Said's health. On <b>Cindy</b> <b>Sheehan,</b> Hitchens backtracked [...] "On consideration, I would take back the word 'LaRouchie', which I applied not to her but to the words she said she didn't utter (but did)." [...] Cockburn comments, [...] "Six hundred and twenty nine words into a seven hundred and eighty-two-word letter Hitchens addresses the very first point I raised, slipping us the news that he takes it back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Linguist George Lakoff {{argued that}} the [...] "ad has raised vital {{questions}} that need a thorough and open discussion. The ad worked brilliantly to reveal, via its framing, an essential but previously hidden truth: the Bush Administration and its active supporters have betrayed {{the trust of the}} troops and the American people." [...] Liberal blogger Arianna Huffington argued that [...] "Was the MoveOn ad blunt? Yes. Did it go for the ? No doubt. But while the way it chose to make its points can be debated, the accuracy of those points cannot." [...] Anti-war activist and Congressional candidate <b>Cindy</b> <b>Sheehan</b> stated that [...] "I have often been critical of MoveOn.org, basically because I feel, for the most part that they support Democrats to the detriment of democracy... The occupation of Iraq is a disaster and I applaud MoveOn for moving a little closer to the true 'anti-war' movement and encourage them to come with us farther." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{large group}} of people {{assembled}} at the Women's Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery for the National Memorial Procession, described as [...] "A Trail of Mourning and Truth from Iraq to the White House".

[...] Participants were encouraged to dress in black to symbolize mourning. <b>Cindy</b> <b>Sheehan</b> was among the participants at this demonstration. Speeches were made by veterans, members of military families, family members of fallen soldiers, and others.
