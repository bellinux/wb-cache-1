25|$|<b>Controlled</b> <b>burn</b> {{practices}} in agriculture and forest management. Controlled or prescribed burning {{is a technique}} sometimes used in forest management, farming, prairie restoration or greenhouse gas abatement. Fire is {{a natural part of}} both forest and grassland ecology and controlled fire can be a tool for foresters. Controlled burning stimulates the germination of some desirable forest trees, thus renewing the forest.|$|E
25|$|The {{longleaf}} pine at Geneva State Forest {{is managed}} in three stages. The Alabama Forest Commission uses the natural regeneration method in their forest management. The three stages are preparatory cutting, establishment cutting and removal cutting. All three sections undergo an annual <b>controlled</b> <b>burn</b> in which ⅓ {{of the unit}} is set ablaze by foresters. The controlled fires encourage regrowth and provide forage for wildlife. Following removal cutting the forests are allowed to regenerate naturally. It takes 75 years for the forests to regrow.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services {{proposed}} a <b>controlled</b> <b>burn</b> on 701 {{acres of the}} Wildlife Refuge. [...] In 2015, they reported that they will postpone those burns until 2017. [...] In 2015, there was a [...] "soft opening" [...] of the Rocky Flats Wildlife Refuge where small groups of people could reserve space on a three-mile guided nature walk. The official opening of the Refuge in now planned for 2017.|$|E
5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large <b>controlled</b> <b>burns</b> in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was {{consumed}} in 1988. <b>Controlled</b> <b>burns</b> would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than <b>controlled</b> <b>burns,</b> are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by <b>controlled</b> <b>burns</b> that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|R
25|$|Wildfire {{prevention}} programs {{around the world}} may employ techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or <b>controlled</b> <b>burns.</b> Wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to <b>burn.</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>burns</b> are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions.|$|R

500|$|Between {{the years}} 1970 and 2012, Shoshone National Forest {{averaged}} 25 fires annually, of which half {{were due to}} natural ignition from lightning, which accounted for 90percent of the total acreage burned. The remaining acreage that burned was due to campfires that got out of control or from other causes. In Shoshone National Forest, the highest fire incidence is generally in the months of August and September. An average of [...] burns annually, with the worst year {{in the past century}} being 1988, when [...] burned from fires that had spread from the conflagration that engulfed Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding region. After the Yellowstone region fires of 1988, an effort to identify areas of similar fire potential was implemented. Fire managers at Shoshone National Forest work with a number of outside agencies to incorporate fire restrictions, fuels management, and a <b>controlled</b> <b>burn</b> plans to reduce the chances of a catastrophic fire. The dead and dying trees which have been killed by various species of bark beetle may have a great impact on future forest fires. Fire managers have stated the worst time for increased fire activity is 1–2years after the trees are killed and then again after the trees have fallen many years later.|$|E

30|$|During the war, fuel {{accumulated}} because residents stopped burning {{areas for}} livelihood practices. The fires drew military patrols {{to investigate and}} endangered personal safety. When the war ended in 1992, people resumed their use of <b>controlled</b> <b>burns</b> but {{the combination of a}} smaller population, fewer cattle, and new policies meant fewer <b>controlled</b> <b>burns</b> of fields and pasture. National censuses in 1980 and 1997, a time period covering the Civil War, show that in Matutúine District the population decreased 38.9 % from an initial count of 57 509 people (Gaspar 2002), so fewer people now burn for livelihood activities. Nongovernmental organizations entering the region after the war to provide economic and development aid pushed no-burn policies as part of their assistance packages. Community rules changed to accommodate these new requirements and certain areas in Madjadjane and Gala became off limits to <b>controlled</b> <b>burns.</b> The simultaneous reduction in <b>controlled</b> <b>burns</b> and resulting increased fuel accumulation during the war and afterward, as well as drought, have likely contributed to the observed increase in numbers and severity of wildfires observed by residents.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Controlled</b> <b>burns</b> on {{far north}} Australian savannas {{can result in}} an overall carbon sink. One working example is the West Arnhem Fire Management Agreement, started to bring [...] "strategic fire {{management}} across 28,000 km² of Western Arnhem Land". Deliberately starting <b>controlled</b> <b>burns</b> early in the dry season results in a mosaic of burnt and unburnt country which reduces the area of burning compared with stronger, late dry season fires. In the early dry season there are higher moisture levels, cooler temperatures, and lighter wind than later in the dry season; fires tend to go out overnight. Early <b>controlled</b> <b>burns</b> also results in a smaller proportion of the grass and tree biomass being burnt. Emission reductions of 256,000 tonnes of CO2 have been made as of 2007.|$|R

50|$|Proceeding {{with the}} burn risked {{disaster}} if control was lost, as indeed happened. However, {{not doing the}} burn might also have been disastrous because the entire southern slope of Cerro Grande was tinder-dry and ready to ignite catastrophically {{in the event of}} a lightning strike (hardly unusual in the Jemez in the spring) or human carelessness with fire. The same winds that militated against starting the <b>controlled</b> <b>burn</b> might then have driven the uncontrolled fire toward Los Alamos, with terrible consequences.

50|$|On 6 October {{and during}} the week following, 6 houses, 15 non-residential structures, 5 {{vehicles}} and 3100 ha of forest and paddock were destroyed by a significant bushfire in the Lancefield area of the Shire of Macedon Ranges, 70 km north of Melbourne. Communities affected by the fire included Baynton, Benloch, Nulla Vale, Lancefield, Pastoria and Sidonia. At least 22 aircraft were utilized by the Country Fire Authority to fight the fire before it was contained on 12 October. The fire had been lit a week earlier {{as part of a}} <b>controlled</b> <b>burn</b> in Cobaw State Forest overseen by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, however the authorities had lost control of the blaze in strong winds and hot conditions.
