5|$|In 2010, a team {{of doctors}} from Al-Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of {{training}} at the <b>cystic</b> fibrosis clinic at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Upon their return to Gaza, a <b>cystic</b> fibrosis center was established at Al-Durrah, although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah.|$|E
5|$|In children, {{additional}} causes include measles, echinococcosis, inhalation of {{a foreign}} body, and certain congenital malformations (congenital <b>cystic</b> adenomatoid malformation and congenital lobar emphysema).|$|E
5|$|A further use of CT {{is in the}} {{identification}} of underlying lung lesions. In presumed primary pneumothorax, it may help to identify blebs or <b>cystic</b> lesions (in anticipation of treatment, see below), and in secondary pneumothorax it can help to identify most of the causes listed above.|$|E
5|$|CASS4 {{has been}} {{reported}} to play a modifying role in <b>cystic</b> fibrosis severity, progression and comorbid conditions. The CAS family member NEDD9 has also been shown to interact directly with AURKA (encoding Aurora-A kinase) to regulate cell cycle and ciliary resorption; it is possible that CASS4 may similarly interact with aurora-A kinase.|$|E
5|$|Congenital {{disorders}} include <b>cystic</b> fibrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia (an incomplete {{development of}} the lungs)congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant. An azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency in SP-A {{levels is}} {{associated}} with infant respiratory distress syndrome in prematurely born infants with developmental insufficiency of surfactant production and structural immaturity in the lungs. Alterations of the relative levels of SP-A1 and SP-A2 {{have been found in}} BALF from patients with <b>cystic</b> fibrosis, asthma, and infection.|$|E
5|$|Pancreatic mucinous <b>cystic</b> {{neoplasms}} are a broad {{group of}} pancreas tumors that have varying malignant potential. They are being detected at a greatly increased rate as CT scans become {{more powerful and}} common, and discussion continues as how best to assess and treat them, given that many are benign.|$|E
5|$|The {{ratio of}} SP-A1 to total SP-A has been {{correlated}} with lung disease (e.g. asthma, <b>cystic</b> fibrosis) and aging. Methylation of SFTPA1 promoter sequences {{has also been}} found in lung cancer tissue.|$|E
5|$|The third type, {{pancreatic}} mucinous <b>cystic</b> neoplasms (MCNs) mainly {{occur in}} women, and may remain benign or progress to cancer. If these lesions become large, cause symptoms, or have suspicious features, they {{can usually be}} successfully removed by surgery.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including <b>cystic</b> fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is difficult, as mutations {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in <b>cystic</b> fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes have been linked with disease.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be commonly associated with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary <b>cystic</b> kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and <b>cystic</b> fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Scott Paper {{created the}} Sandra Schmirler Foundation in January 2001, with the {{assistance}} of the Canadian Curling Association and Scott Paper Limited. The foundation raises funds to help care for babies in crisis through direct donations to benefit neonatal care across Canada. In the charity's first four years of existence donations were made to the Children's Miracle Network, Canadian <b>Cystic</b> Fybrosis Foundation and Canadian Ronald McDonald Houses. After altering the charity's mission to focus on neonatal care, donations have been made directly to hospitals in Halifax, Regina, London, Lethbridge, Hamilton and Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The {{spreading}} {{of organisms}} is facilitated when risk factors are present. Alcoholism {{is associated with}} Streptococcus pneumoniae, anaerobic organisms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; smoking facilitates the effects of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella pneumophila. Exposure to birds is associated with Chlamydia psittaci; farm animals with Coxiella burnetti; aspiration of stomach contents with anaerobic organisms; and <b>cystic</b> fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae {{is more common in}} the winter, and should be suspected in persons aspirating a large amount of anaerobic organisms.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} no therapeutic approaches targeting CASS4, {{and in the}} absence of a catalytic domain and no extracellular moieties, it may be challenging to generate such an agent. However, CASS4 may ultimately be relevant in clinical practice as a possible marker to assess prognosis and outcome in cases of NSCLC (and possibly other types of cancer). At present, its greatest clinical value is likely to be as a predictive variant for severity and onset of Alzheimer's disease and <b>cystic</b> fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|CFTR, the {{transporter}} {{involved in}} the disease <b>Cystic</b> Fibrosis, is also considered part of this subfamily. <b>Cystic</b> fibrosis occurs upon mutation and loss of function of CFTR.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} and renowned CF programs in the city, the Saint Vincent's <b>Cystic</b> Fibrosis therapy program offered care for patients with <b>cystic</b> fibrosis and attracted patients from around the region.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cystic</b> {{fibrosis}} {{genetic mutation}} known as delta-F508 in humans {{has been said}} to maintain a selective heterozygous advantage: heterozygous carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by <b>cystic</b> fibrosis) are more resistant to V. cholerae infections. In this model, the genetic deficiency in the <b>cystic</b> fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the intestinal epithelium, thus reducing the effects of an infection.|$|E
25|$|Comparisons of <b>cystic</b> {{fibrosis}} against non-cystic fibrosis airway {{epithelial cells}} shows that various miRNAs are differentially regulated {{in response to}} the disease. mir-126 is suspected {{to play a role in}} regulating the innate immune responses within <b>Cystic</b> Fibrosis affected lungs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cystic</b> {{kidney disease}} in patient or close relatives.|$|E
25|$|So far, no {{large-scale}} research {{involving the}} incidence of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in adults with <b>cystic</b> fibrosis has been conducted. This is likely because {{the vast majority of}} people with <b>cystic</b> fibrosis do not live long enough to develop clinically significant atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease.|$|E
25|$|In Europe E. dermatitidis {{tends to}} be {{associated}} with <b>cystic</b> fibrosis, and is frequently found to have colonized the lungs of CF patients. In one study, E. dermatitidis could be isolated from 6.2% of <b>cystic</b> fibrosis patients using erythritol-chloramphenicol agar culture dishes. Exophiala dermatitidis has also been reported as the etiological agent of lung infections causing pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|The large {{intestine}} also secretes K+ and Cl-. Chloride secretion increases in <b>cystic</b> fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cystic</b> {{fibrosis}} {{is caused}} by mutations in the CFTR gene, which is a chloride channel.|$|E
25|$|Other {{causes of}} the {{development}} of AAA include: infection, trauma, arteritis, and <b>cystic</b> medial necrosis.|$|E
25|$|CD10+ differentiates mucinous <b>cystic</b> {{neoplasms}} (CD10+/CK20+) from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of {{branch duct}} type (CD10−/CK20-).|$|E
25|$|In 1955 {{he married}} Shirley Anne Webb. Their two {{children}} died in childhood from <b>cystic</b> fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|Patients with Addison's disease, {{pituitary}} insufficiency, or <b>cystic</b> fibrosis {{sometimes have}} a hyper-sensitivity {{to the five}} primary tastes.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} as of 2014 if ursodeoxycholic acid {{is useful for}} those with <b>cystic</b> fibrosis-related liver disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{gallbladder}} {{varies in}} size, shape, and position between different people. Rarely, two or even three gallbladders may coexist, either as separate bladders draining into the <b>cystic</b> duct, or sharing a common branch that drains into the <b>cystic</b> duct. Additionally, the gallbladder {{may fail to}} form at all. Gallbladders with two lobes separated by a septum may also exist. These abnormalities {{are not likely to}} affect function and are generally asymptomatic.|$|E
25|$|Bush is the honorary {{chairman}} of the Annual AT Jeb Bush Florida Golf Classic, a fundraiser that benefits the <b>Cystic</b> Fibrosis Foundation. He first {{became involved in the}} benefit after meeting with committee member Lawson Dutton, whose child suffered from <b>cystic</b> fibrosis. Supporters raised more than 722,000 in 2014 at the , exceeding their goals in attendance and revenues raised. Since the event’s inception 19 years ago, the total revenue netted has reached over 7.478 million.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no strong}} {{evidence}} that people with <b>cystic</b> fibrosis can prevent osteoporosis by increasing their intake of vitamin D. Bisphosphonates taken by mouth or intravenously {{can be used to}} improve the bone mineral density in people with <b>cystic</b> fibrosis. When taking bisphosphates intravenously, adverse effects such as pain and flu-like symptoms can be an issue. The adverse effects of bisphosphates taken by mouth on the gastrointestinal tract are not known.|$|E
25|$|It is {{accepted}} that kidney transplantation {{is the preferred}} treatment for ADPKD patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Among American patients on the kidney transplant waiting list (as of December 2011), 7256 (8.4%) were listed due to <b>cystic</b> kidney disease and of the 16,055 renal transplants performed in 2011, 2057 (12.8%) were done for patients with <b>cystic</b> kidney disease, with 1,189 from deceased donors and 868 from living donors.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{completed}} {{on the effectiveness of}} introducing inhaled glutathione to people with <b>cystic</b> fibrosis with mixed results.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} lung diseases (panbronchiolitis, asthma, <b>cystic</b> fibrosis, bronchitis). Both doxycycline and minocycline {{have shown}} effectiveness in asthma due to immune suppressing effects.|$|E
