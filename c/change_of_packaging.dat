Danes ni več najpomembneje, kakšen izdelek prodajaš, temveč le, ali ga znaš prodati. Vedno bolj postaja pomemben tudi videz embalaže in ne samo izdelek, ki je v njej. Embalaža mora biti privlačna za kupca in ga mora pritegniti ter privabiti v nakup. V diplomskem delu smo predstavili pospeševanje prodaje, pomen embalaže, podjetje Fructal in njegove izdelke, menjavo embalaže dvema izdelkoma ter učinek te menjave. Skozi teoretični del smo na kratko predstavili pospeševanje prodaje ter osnovne funkcije embalaže. Poleg tega teoretični del opisuje zgodovino, pomen, orodja in cilje pospeševanja prodaje ter pomen, funkcijo in kriterije ocenjevanja embalaže. V analitičnem delu pa smo analizirali menjavo embalaže dvema izdelkoma in navedli nekaj lastnih predlogov za izboljšanje. Z analizo podjetja Fructal in njegove menjave embalaže izdelkoma Fructal Classic in Smoothie smo prišli do sklepov in ugotovitev, ki bi morda pomagali podjetju. Na splošno je bila menjava embalaže izdelka Classic dobro ocenjena, medtem ko je bila menjava embalaže izdelku Smoothie slabše ocenjena. Menimo, da bi moralo podjetje Fructal v spremembe bolj vključiti potrošnike in jim te še bolje skomunicirati in približati.

What {{is becoming more and more}} significant is the aspect of the packaging, and not just the product that is inside it. The packaging must be attractive to the consumer and must encourage and allure him to purchase the product. In the thesis we present the sales improvement, the importance of the packaging, the company Fructal and its products, the alternations on two packages, and their effect. Throughout the theoretical part we present the sales improvement and the elementary functions of the packaging. In addition, the theoretical part summarises the history, the importance, the tools and the goals of sales improvement, and the significance, functions and criteria for the evaluation of the packaging.

40|$|Irradiation <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> materials-in most cases, plastic-generally {{leads to}} the {{formation}} of free radicals and ions, which eventually result either in cross-linking or in chain scission. The latter {{leads to the}} release of volatile radiolysis products that may induce off-odors in the polymers, thereby altering the migration characteristics <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> materials. Irradiation also affects polymer additives, which change the specific migration behavior of polymer additives and additive-related decomposition products. Both migration and sensory <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> presterilized <b>packaging</b> materials strongly affect the quality <b>of</b> <b>packaged</b> goods and consumer safety. Radiation processing is widely used for medical product sterilization and food irradiation. Moreover, the use of irradiation has become a standard treatment to sterilize packages in aseptic processing of foods and pharmaceuticals. Nowadays, <b>packaging</b> consists <b>of</b> natural or synthetic plastics; therefore, the effect of irradiation on these materials is crucial for packaging engineering. The effect of ionizing radiation on polymeric materials has been found to manifest itself in two ways: (i) as a molecular weight increase (cross-linking); and (ii) as a molecular weight decrease (chain scission degradation). The ability of radiation to process the packaged material, compared to the ineffectiveness of chemical treatments, is a critical advantage over the others. The most important applications of polymer irradiation are: (i) sterilization of medical disposables, syringes, and tubing; and (ii) food and food packaging irradiation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

MethodsThe {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of substitution between unbranded generics on persistence and adherence to therapy in two Italian Local Health Units (ASL) in real-world clinical practice in 5 therapeutic areas using tracing drugs. Substitution of generic drugs is any change in the name of the manufacturer of the generic drug. The therapeutic areas were: diabetes (metformin); hypertension (amlodipine); dyslipidemia (simvastatin); psychiatry (sertraline); cardiology (propafenone); osteoporosis (alendronate). The retrospective analysis was carried out on the administrative databases of two Local Healthcare Units (ASL – Azienda sanitaria locale Bergamo (BG) and Pavia (PV)) in the Lombardy Region of Italy. The correlation between persistence and adherence with the different cohorts of generic substitution frequency within each therapeutic area was then calculated. ResultsAccording to the inclusion criteria, 23, 773 patients were evaluated. Patients were observed for a period of 36 months starting from the first drug delivery (index date). The median age of the overall population was above 61 years in all therapeutic areas. The generic drug substitution occurred in 61. 5 % of patients (BG: 57. 6 % and PV: 65. 4 % respectively); Hypertension was the therapeutic area with the highest percentage of patients with substitutions. Patients' adherence, evaluated by the Medical Possession Rate (MPR) and persistence to the treatment decreases with the increase in the frequency of generic substitutions. This observation was confirmed by a statistically significant negative correlation (p-value of < 0. 001) between the adherence and persistence and the number of generic substitutions in each therapeutic area and Local Healthcare Units (ASL). DiscussionAdherence is one of the pillars of the patient's health management in the control and prevention of progression of the disease. Several factors, such as ageing, comorbidities, and polypharmacy, may affect adherence and influence the outcome of treatments. These results are in line with studies supporting the possibility that the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> appearance each time a new prescription is dispensed may create confusion and ultimately reduce patients' adherence. Clinicians and decision makers should consider the impact of frequent generic substitutions on persistence and adherence, which may influence efficacy and/or safety...|$|R

These developments are further investigated through exploring changes in verbal and design content <b>of</b> <b>packaging.</b> It is believed that these changes can influence consumer behaviour and social values. Various types of consumer buying behaviour and consumer purchase decision processes are discussed. The issue of the effect <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> in consumer perceptions of food-related health issues has influenced consumption behaviour. Marketers’ response to these changes in consumer consumption behaviour is also discussed. The use of Freud’s theory of motivation (Boeree, 2006) is adopted as a basis for generalisations about consumer motivation. Documentary data in the form of visuals and mass media outputs of the Heinz Wattie’s brand (and its sub brands) from 1950 s till to today were used to review the <b>changes</b> anddevelopment <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> (verbal and graphic content) in this study. These visuals and mass media outputs were obtained mainly from secondary sources, which included the Heinz Wattie’s Company. The data collected was analysed using thematic and semiotic analysis. Results of the research indicate that the focus <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> has widened in its scope from being a functional requirement to holding important symbolic values. Packaging functions as a messenger or “silent salesman” while representing symbolic signs and texts that are deciphered into meanings by the consumer at the time of purchase. The meanings that these signs and text convey focus on the health benefits of consuming Heinz Wattie’s products. Such benefits include being free from preservatives, from artificial colourings or flavourings, from being healthy; for example a good source of vitamins, and from being recyclable. Consumers who purchased and consume Heinz Wattie’sproducts will fulfil their motivation to become healthier while maintaining a green image of being environmentally friendly. The study contributes to knowledge by identifying the historical developments in food packaging. These changes reflect the changes that have occurred in consumer behaviour and social values.

In the study, the numerical model was firstly validated by experimental work using short shots experiment and X-ray technology. Then the verified model was employed for flow pattern and wire sweep analysis. The leadframe detail structure effects were evaluated at first. The effects of leadframe detail structure on flow pattern and wire sweep are insignificant and may be ignored, most likely due to the thin thickness of leadframe and the relatively lower position to the bond wire loop. Besides, for fixed width and length of the die, the wire sweep behavior was predicted by simulation to estimate {{the influence of the}} die height (thickness). The results show that the thinner the die, the smaller the wire sweep. Furthermore, the effect of cavity height on wire sweep value was also evaluated. Then, the ratio of the die height to that of the cavity was introduced as an index to investigate the main factors which influence the wire sweep values and propose a guideline for package and cavity design to reduce the wire sweep. It can be further concluded that velocity is more sensitive to the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the <b>package</b> and cavity structures, compared with the viscosity. Next, a new design <b>of</b> industry <b>package</b> array mold was introduced for wire sweep study with the practical transfer molding process conditions.

Controlled atmosphere (CA) storage is a very effective method to maintain broccoli quality. The aim of this paper is to characterise the colour behaviour (measured by RGB colour image analysis) of broccoli as affected by CA and temperature. Data on colour behaviour and gas exchange were gathered for broccoli heads stored in containers at three temperatures and subjected to four levels of O 2 and three levels of CO 2 concentrations. An integrated colour model is proposed that combines a colour model with a standard gas exchange model. The colour model is based on an existing colour model that describes the formation of (blue/green) chlorophyllide from the colourless precursor, the bidirectional conversion of chlorophyllide into (blue/green) chlorophyll and the decay of chlorophyllide. A multi-response approach was applied, accounting for 92 % of the variance. Gas exchange parameters were estimated using the gas exchange model, the colour parameters were estimated using the colour model. Both models are linked via the reaction rate constant that describes the decay of chlorophyllide, as this reaction rate constant was found to be affected by the gas conditions. The integrated model might be applied to predict colour <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> MAP <b>packaged</b> broccoli as a low level of O 2 and a high level of CO 2 will only affect colour retention at higher temperatures...|$|R

In this paper composite polymer/paper material {{is used for}} production <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> in cosmetic industry. There are problems with bonding this material at the time <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> production due to its properties. Composite surface was treated by air plasma for 1, 10, 20, and 30 [*]s. The advancing and receding contact angles of water, formamide, and diiodomethane were measured using both treated and untreated samples. Apparent surface free energy was estimated using the hysteresis (CAH) and Van Oss, Good, Chaudhury approaches (LWAB). Surface roughness was investigated using optical profilometry and identification of after {{plasma treatment}} emerging chemical groups was made {{by means of the}} XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) technique. After plasma treatment the values of contact angles decreased which is particularly evident for polar liquids. Apparent surface free energy increased compared to that <b>of</b> untreated samples. <b>Changes</b> <b>of</b> energy value are due to the electron-donor parameter of energy. This parameter increases as a result of adding polar groups at the time of surface plasma activation. <b>Changes</b> <b>of</b> surface properties are combination of increase of polar chemical functional groups, increase on the surface, and surface roughness increase...|$|R
