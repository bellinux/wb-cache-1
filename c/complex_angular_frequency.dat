40|$|A {{class of}} pseudo-hermitian quantum system with an {{explicit}} {{form of the}} positive-definite metric in the Hilbert space is presented. The general method involves a realization of the basic canonical commutation relations defining the quantum system in terms of operators those are hermitian {{with respect to a}} pre-determined positive definite metric in the Hilbert space. Appropriate combinations of these operators result in a large number of pseudo-hermitian quantum systems admitting entirely real spectra and unitary time evolution. The examples considered include simple harmonic oscillators with <b>complex</b> <b>angular</b> <b>frequencies,</b> Stark(Zeeman) effect with complex electric(magnetic) field, non-hermitian general quadratic form of N boson(fermion) operators, symmetric and asymmetric XXZ spin-chain in complex magnetic field, non-hermitian Haldane-Shastry spin-chain and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the design of}} metamaterial blueprints for impedance-matched (reflectionless) absorbers over nonplanar surfaces in connection with optical pseudo black holes. The presence of some fundamental constraints {{on the existence of}} reflectionless absorber media at nonplanar surfaces are discussed based on analytical proper-ties of the associated constitutive tensors on the <b>complex</b> ω (<b>angular</b> <b>frequency)</b> plane. In view of such constraints, some new metamaterial blueprints of near-reflectionless absorbers are suggested for integration into optical pseudo black hole devices. © 2011 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 160. 1190, 160. 3918, 260. 2110, 260. 2710. 1...|$|R
40|$|In the {{development}} of inks for printed electronics, {{it is important to}} understand the behaviour of the functional inks and more especially their rheology and surface properties. This project emphasises the importance of ink characterization by performing rheological tests on silicon nanoparticle based inks that are used in the screen printing of electronic devices. The inks were characterized for linear viscoelastic behaviour, flow behaviour, change in properties with <b>angular</b> <b>frequency,</b> as well as thixotropic behaviour. All showed shear thinning, with the more dilute inks showing a power law (Ostwald / de Waele model) behaviour dependence of <b>complex</b> viscosity on <b>angular</b> <b>frequency.</b> The flow behaviour of the inks was also seen to follow a Windhab model. The printability of the inks primarily depends on the shear-dependent viscosity as highly viscous and dilute inks do not produce good printed structures.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{conditions under}} which kink magnetohydrodynamic waves propagating along photospheric uniformly twisted flux tubes with axial mass flows become unstable {{as a consequence of}} the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We employed the dispersion relations of kink waves derived from the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations. We assumed real wave numbers and <b>complex</b> <b>angular</b> wave <b>frequencies,</b> namely <b>complex</b> wave phase velocities. The dispersion relations were solved numerically at fixed input parameters and several mass flow velocities. We show that the stability of the waves depends upon four parameters, the density contrast between the flux tube and its environment, the ratio of the background magnetic fields in the two media, the twist of the magnetic field lines inside the tube, and the value of the Alfven-Mach number (the ratio of the jet velocity to Alfvén speed inside the flux tube). At certain densities and magnetic field twists, an instability of the Kelvin-Helmholtz type of kink (m = 1) mode can arise if the Alfven-Mach number exceeds a critical value. The observed mass flows may trigger the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the kink (m = 1) mode in weakly twisted photospheric magnetic flux tubes at critical Alfven-Mach numbers lower that those in untwisted tubes if the magnetic field twist lies in the range 0. 36 [...] 0. 4 and the flow speed exceeds a critical value. A weak external magnetic field (with a ratio to the magnetic field inside the tube in the range 0. 1 [...] 0. 5) slightly increases that critical value.

40|$|We {{measured}} human {{frequency response}} functions for seven <b>angular</b> <b>frequency</b> filters whose test frequencies were centered at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16 or 24 cycles/ 360 º using a supra-threshold summation method. The seven functions of 17 experimental conditions each were measured nine times for five observers. For the arbitrarily selected filter phases, the maximum summation effect occurred at test frequency for filters at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 cycles/ 360 º. For both 16 and 24 cycles/ 360 º test frequencies, maximum summation {{occurred at the}} lower harmonics. These results allow us to conclude that there are narrow-band <b>angular</b> <b>frequency</b> filters operating somehow in the human visual system either through summation or inhibition of specific frequency ranges. Furthermore, as a general result, it appears that addition of higher <b>angular</b> <b>frequencies</b> to lower ones disturbs low <b>angular</b> <b>frequency</b> perception (i. e., 1, 2, 3 and 4 cycles/ 360 º), whereas addition of lower harmonics to higher ones seems to improve detection of high <b>angular</b> <b>frequency</b> harmonics (i. e., 8, 16 and 24 cycles/ 360 º).
