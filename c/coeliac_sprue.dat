50|$|Tropical sprue is a {{malabsorption}} disease {{commonly found}} in tropical regions, marked with abnormal flattening of the villi and inflammation of {{the lining of the}} small intestine.It differs significantly from <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue.</b> It appears to be a more severe form of environmental enteropathy.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{conditions}} which can resemble tropical sprue {{need to be}} differentiated. [...] Coeliac disease (also known as <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue</b> or gluten sensitive enteropathy), has similar symptoms to tropical sprue, with the flattening of the villi and small intestine inflammation and is caused by an autoimmune disorder in genetically susceptible individuals triggered by ingested gluten. Malabsorption can also be caused by protozoan infections, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, immunodeficiency, chronic pancreatitis and inflammatory bowel disease. [...] Environmental enteropathy is a less severe, subclinical condition similar to tropical sprue.|$|E
5000|$|Incomplete {{digestion}} of {{food can}} lead to excess gas in the intestine. In humans, this can be due to incomplete digestion of carbohydrate-containing foods, including milk and other dairy products (lactose intolerance {{or the use of}} α-glucosidase inhibitors by diabetics), gluten (protein in wheat, barley, and rye) (coeliac disease), fruit, vegetables, beans, legumes, and high-fiber whole grains. In rare instances, excessive abdominal noise may be a sign of digestive disease, especially when accompanied by abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation. Some examples of diseases that may be associated with this symptom include carcinoid neoplasm and <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue.</b>|$|E

40|$|In vivo, {{epithelial}} cells which line the intestine are intimately associated with lymphocytes, termed intraepithelial lympho-cytes. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that intraepithe-lial lymphocytes are present in the uninflamed mucosa, and become especially prominent in various human enteropa-thies including <b>coeliac</b> disease, tropical <b>sprue,</b> dermatitis herpetiformis, and giardiasis. Using the intestinal crypt cell line T 84, and a previously well-defined human mucosa-de-rived lymphocyte (MDL) line with phenotypic features simi-lar to (but not specific for) intraepithelial lymphocytes, we describe a co-culture model to study the functional sequellae of MDL-T 84 cell interactions in vitro.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the rectal surface epithelial lymphocyte and leucocyte response to wheat, gluten, and gliadin enema challenges in control individuals and in patients with <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue</b> in remission is shown. There is a clear increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes {{in response to these}} enemas in <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue,</b> but not in controls. The peak response was at eight hours and cleared within 24 hours. There was no change in the crypt epithelium. These data add further support to the role of wheat, gluten, and gliadin in the pathogenesis of <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue,</b> at least in the rectal mucosa...|$|E
40|$|Intestinal folate {{absorption}} {{was assessed}} in six normal subjects and in four patients with <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue</b> who were studied {{before and after}} treatment by dietary gluten exclusion. Comparisons were made of the luminal disappearance from the perfused jejunum of 3 H-pteroylmonoglutamate and pteroyl 14 C-glutamylhexaglutamate, and of the 48 -hour urinary recovery of each isotope after perfusion and a tissue saturating dose of folic acid. The labelled urinary folates consisted of folic acid, 10 -formyltetrahydrofolate, and 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate. In each group urinary recovery of 3 H was significantly {{greater than that of}} 14 C, confirming the evidence from jejunal perfusion that the availability of monoglutamyl folate is greater than that of polyglutamyl folate. According to the urinary recovery data, both folates were poorly absorbed in untreated <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue,</b> but were normally absorbed after treatment. Assuming uniform displacement of the absorbed labelled folates by the parenteral flushing dose, the finding of greater urinary isotope recovery than of luminal folate disappearance from the perfused proximal jejunal segment suggests an adaptation of the distal small bowel for folate absorption in <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue...</b>|$|E
40|$|Prolyl endopeptidases have {{potential}} for treating <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue,</b> {{a disease of}} the intestine caused by proteolytically resistant peptides from proline-rich prolamins of wheat, barley and rye. We compared the properties of three similar bacterial prolyl endopeptidases, including the known enzymes from Flavobacterium meningosepticum (FM) and Sphingomonas capsulate (SC) and a novel enzyme from Myxococcus xanthus (MX). These enzymes were interrogated with reference chromogenic substrates, {{as well as two}} related gluten peptides (PQPQLPYPQPQLP and LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQPF), believed to {{play a key role in}} <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue</b> pathogenesis. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to evaluate the activity, specificity and acid/protease stability of the enzymes. All peptidases were relatively resistant to acid, pancreatic proteases and membrane peptidases of the small intestinal mucosa. Although their activities against reference substrates were similar, the enzymes exhibited substantial differences with respect to chain length and subsite specificity. SC hydrolysed PQPQLPYPQPQLP well, but had negligible activity against LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQPF. In contrast, the FM and MX peptidases cleaved both substrates, although the FM enzyme acted more rapidly on LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQPF than MX. Whereas the FM enzyme showed a preference for Pro–Gln bonds, SC cleaved both Pro–Gln and Pro–Tyr bonds with comparable efficiency, and MX had a modest preference for Pro–(Tyr/Phe) sites over Pro–Gln sites. While a more comprehensive understanding of sequence and chain-length specificity may be needed to assess the relative utility of alternative prolyl endopeptidases for treating <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue,</b> our present work has illustrated the diverse nature of this class of enzymes from the standpoint of proteolysing complex substrates such as gluten...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Gastrointestinal {{endoscopy}} is not {{the first}} line diagnostic tool in coeliac disease. However, awareness of its basic endoscopic features may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease. Endoscopic features of coeli-ac disease comprise reduction in the number or loss of folds, mosaic appearance, scalloping, fissures or grooves of folds in the jejunum, and visible vascular pattern (in the duodenum) and (micro-) nodularity. Loss of intestinal villi can be set off with the immersion technique. Chromoendoscopy using indigo carmine or methylene blue can enhance the mosaic pattern of intestinal mucosa. Push-enteroscopy and/or capsule endoscopy is important in the follow-up and diagnostics of complications of <b>coeliac</b> disease (refractory <b>sprue,</b> ulcerative jejunoileitis and T-cell lymphoma) ...|$|R
40|$|In vivo, {{epithelial}} cells which line the intestine are intimately associated with lymphocytes, termed intraepithelial lymphocytes. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that intraepithelial lymphocytes are present in the uninflamed mucosa, and become especially prominent in various human enteropathies including <b>coeliac</b> disease, tropical <b>sprue,</b> dermatitis herpetiformis, and giardiasis. Using the intestinal crypt cell line T 84, and a previously well-defined human mucosa-derived lymphocyte (MDL) line with phenotypic features similar to (but not specific for) intraepithelial lymphocytes, we describe a co-culture model to study the functional sequellae of MDL-T 84 cell interactions in vitro. A co-culture method was defined which permitted reconstitution of the paracellular spaces of physiologically confluent epithelial monolayers with MDL. Such co-cultures thus mimicked the correct geometry of intraepithelial lymphocytes-epithelial cell interactions. The presence of physiologically positioned MDL brought about specific and dramatic effects on intestinal epithelial monolayer function. In a dose-dependent fashion, the presence of MDL significantly attenuated barrier function (expressed as a decrease in monolayer resistance), decreased epithelial electrogenic Cl- secretion, and modulated epithelial-neutrophil interactions. Such effects were not reproduced in monolayers similarly reconstituted with inert polystyrene beads equivalent in size to MDL. These MDL-elicited effects on epithelial function specifically required direct MDL apposition to the epithelial basolateral membrane. Furthermore, this specific form of MDL-epithelial basolateral contact released soluble factors which were able to confer the MDL-reconstituted phenotype on virgin epithelial monolayers in the absence of MDL. We have previously shown that many aspects of the MDL converted epithelial phenotype described here can be induced by IFN-gamma. While IFN-gamma, a cytokine produced by many lymphocytes including intraepithelial lymphocytes, was detectable in conditioned supernatants from co-cultures, it existed at concentrations insufficient to fully explain the physiologic effects observed here...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Abdominal {{distension}} is {{a common}} but non-specific sign {{of a variety of}} diseases and conditions that always warrant meticulous and thorough physical examination as well as investigations. An Indian girl who presented with a grossly distended abdomen was admitted for suspected child neglect and malnutrition. History of pica was noted and a big gastric bezoar was removed surgically. Investigations came up with the diagnosis of <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue.</b> Low level of awareness would overlook this disease entity easily, particularly in a region with exceedingly low prevalence like our locality. Indeed, screenings of at-risk groups in Caucasians have resulted in identification of considerable numbers of atypical and asymptomatic cases...|$|E
40|$|In small {{intestinal}} disease, <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue,</b> proline-rich gluten peptides from wheat, rye {{and barley}} are relatively resistant to gastrointestinal digestion, and therefore {{remain in the}} intestinal lumen to elicit immunopathology in genetically susceptible individuals.

40|$|Lymphocytic {{gastritis}} {{is a form}} of gastric inflammation characterised by {{a pronounced}} increase in lymphocytes in gastric surface and foveolar epithelium. Lymphocytic gastritis is often associated with endoscopic evidence of 'varioliform gastritis'. Lymphocytic gastritis has recently been reported to be associated with other forms of hypertrophic gastropathies. We present a case of hypertrophic gastropathy with gastric adenocarcinoma, with both Menetrier's disease and lymphocyte gastritis. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the intraepithelial lymphocytes were predominantly alpha/beta T cells as in the normal stomach and not gamma/delta T cells as in <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue.</b> This case together with the six recently published cases suggests that Menetrier's disease and lymphocytic gastritis may be part of the same disease spectrum...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{relation}} between the gluten-sensitive intestinal lesion observed in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and in gluten-sensitive enteropathy (<b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue)</b> (GSE) was analyzed. Jejunal IgA synthesis in DH was estimated from the extent of incorporation of [14 C]leucine into IgA in jejunal biopsy specimens during short-term in vitro culture. Patients with DH have significantly elevated incorporation values as compared to normal control individuals (18, 880 ± 13, 614 vs. 5, 830 ± 3, 190 cpm/mg tissue protein/ 90 min) (P < 0. 02) and the degree of elevation correlates well with the degree of morphologic abnormality. Thus patients with DH are similar to patients with GSE where elevated local mucosal IgA synthesis has also been observed...|$|E
40|$|Epithelial barrier {{function}} and ion transport was studied in <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue</b> using a miniaturised Ussing device for measurements on diagnostic aspiration biopsy specimens from the jejunum of untreated or gluten free nourished sprue patients, or from healthy controls. Pure epithelial resistance (Re) indicating epithelial {{barrier function}} {{was determined by}} transmural alternating current impedance analysis. It was reduced by 56 % in acute sprue mean (SEM) (9 (1) omega. cm 2) compared with controls (20 (2) omega. cm 2). In gluten free nourished sprue patients Re was only partly recovered (15 (1) omega. cm 2). Subepithelial resistance (Rsub) was also changed from 28 (1) omega. cm 2 - in control to 17 (1) omega. cm 2 in acute sprue because {{of the change in}} mucosal architecture, but was unchanged in gluten free nourished sprue patients (29 (4) omega. cm 2). In acute sprue, unidirectional Na+ and Cl- fluxes were increased in both directions {{as a consequence of the}} decreased resistance. However, short circuit current (ISC) as well as Na+ and Cl- net fluxes were not significantly different from control. Subsequently, the electrogenic Cl- secretory system was investigated. After maximal stimulation with theophylline and prostaglandin E 1, a Cl(-) -dependent increase in ISC was obtained in the sprue mucosa and control jejunum. It showed saturation characteristics and was blockable by serosal bumetanide. When compared with control, neither Km nor Vmax of this electrogenic Cl- secretion was significantly changed in <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue.</b> In conclusion, a miniaturised Ussing device was used for transport measurements on intestinal biopsy specimens. In acute coeliac disease, the epithelial barrier of the jejunum was seriously disturbed. The active electrogenic Cl- secretory transport system was present in the sprue mucosa, but was not activated in the Ussing chamber in vitro when compared with control jejunum...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims {{to review}} the {{prevalence}} and natural history of coeliac disease in patients with type 1 A diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid disorders. These diseases share a similar genetic background. In diabetic children and adults, the prevalence of (mostly asymptomatic) coeliac disease varies form 0. 97 to 6. 4 %. Diabetes is usually diagnosed first. Screening in relatives may also be positive. Recurrent hypoglycaemia in diabetic subjects (indirectly) suggest the development of <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue.</b> Thyroid disorders (thyroiditis and Graves' disease) are also usual in coeliac disease. A common etiopathogenic mechanism for the association CD / diabetes / thyroid disorders, with gluten as the driving antigen, was postulated. Thus, screening program for coeliac disease are recommended in individuals with type 1 A diabetes and/or auto-immune thyroid conditions, {{as well as in}} their first-degree relatives...|$|E
40|$|Coeliac {{disease is}} a chronic {{inflammatory}} disorder of the small bowel that results in malabsorption of nutrients. The disease, also called non-tropical sprue, <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue</b> or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is induced by components in the prolamin fraction of wheat (gliadin), barley (hordein), rye (secalin) and possibly oats (avenin). In addition to nutrient deficiencies, prolonged coeliac {{disease is a}}ssociated with an increased risk of malignancy, especially intestinal T-cell lymphoma. The characteristic histological appearance is that of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltration of the epithelium and lamina propria. The disease has a number of autoimmune-like features which include a strong association with HLA, the occurrence of autoantibodies in patient's sera, association with other autoimmune diseases (IDDM, SLE, RA), responsiveness to corticosteroids and a dense lymphocytic infiltrate in the affected bowel.

40|$|The {{effect of}} fat {{malabsorption}} on the absorption and renal excretion of dietary oxalate was studied in four patients with sprue {{and in two}} patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and sprue-like jejunal histology. Hyperoxaluria was present in all patients with sprue when fat malabsorption was severe. Urinary oxalate excretion decreased {{in two of the}} three patients with <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue</b> when their fat malabsorption had improved after three months of dietary gluten restriction. Neither patient with dermatitis herpetiformis and sprue had steatorrhoea. In these patients, urinary oxalate excretion was always within normal limits. A significant positive linear relationship (y= 28. 25 + 4 - 84 x; r= 0 - 82; P less than 0 - 01) was demonstrated between faecal fat and urinary oxalate excretion. The results of this study support the concept that severe malabsorption of dietary fat plays a primary causative role in enteric hyperoxaluria...|$|E
40|$|<b>Coeliac</b> <b>sprue</b> (CS) {{may occur}} in {{association}} with im-mune complex-mediated diseases, including IgA nephropa-thy, dermatitis herpetiformis and thyroiditis. An associa-tion of CS with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type 1 is rare, with only two prior cases reported. Here we describe a 45 -year-old man with no prior medi-cal history who presented initially with microhaematuria, subnephrotic proteinuria and hypocomplementaemia. A re-nal biopsy revealed MPGN type 1 with negative serologic workup for secondary causes. The patient was treated con-servatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Several months later, he developed daily non-bloody diar-rhoea andwas found to have worsening hypoalbuminaemia, hypophosphataemia and severe iron deficiency anaemia. A diagnosis of CS was established based on elevated tTGA (IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase) antibody and positive IgA antiendomysial antibody titres. Proteinuria resolved completely following the initiation of a gluten-free diet, {{without the use of}} immunosuppressive therapy and de-spite tapering of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. This case illustrates that CS-associatedMPGNmay precede overt clinical evidence of coeliac disease and may respond to gluten-free diet, without resort to immunosuppressive therapy...|$|E
40|$|Antibody assays play an {{important}} role in the diagnosis of coeliac disease (<b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue,</b> gluten-sensitive enteropathy), a condition characterized by immunological intolerance to gluten from wheat and from proteins of related cereals in genetically predisposed persons. Enhanced concentrations of IgA-antibodies against tissue transglutaminase or endomysium under gluten-containing normal diet represent {{an important}} indication for a biopsy from the small intestine. Demonstration of typical changes in the mucose of the small intestine is still required for the definitive diagnosis of coeliac disease. Recently highly specific antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides were detected in serum. These antibodies further improve the reliability of serologic diagnosis. The new assays for IgG-antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides have a very high diagnostic accuracy and are comparable to IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Further investigations have to show whether IgG-antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides are a reliable disease marker also in case of IgA deficiency. Prospective studies are needed to show whether antibody assays could replace biopsy in the diagnosis of coeliac disease in a substantial number of patients...|$|E
40|$|Background and aim.   Antitransglutaminase, {{previously}} considered {{identical to}} antiendomysial in <b>coeliac</b> <b>sprue</b> (CS), {{have been reported}} in end-stage heart failure. To clarify the above-mentioned data, we evaluated these antibodies in a cohort of cardiological patients with respect to troponin I, creatine kinase (CK), MB fraction creatine kinase (CK-MB mass) and myoglobin. Methods.   Forty-one patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 39 with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 45 with CS and 58 blood donors (BDs) were evaluated. Antitransglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies were tested in serum of the patients being studied. Results.   High-positive antitransglutaminase values were found in CS, whilst low-positive values were also found in ACS and DCM. In patients at the second ACS, antibody levels were higher than in those at the first cardiac event. In patients with infarct Q, antitransglutaminase were higher than those in infarct non-Q, in which antibody levels were higher than those in unstable angina. A correlation between antitransglutaminase and troponin I, CK, CK-MB mass and myoglobin was found. Finally, antibody levels rose to reach a peak at 30 days from the cardiac event, whereas after further 150 days, approached the values of BDs. Antiendomysial were detectable only in CS. Conclusions.   Data highlight that antitransglutaminase can occur in cardiological patients, and that these antibodies are related to the severity/extent of the myocardial tissue lesion. This feature suggests a loss of specificity for antitransglutaminase in CS. Furthermore, the possibility of employing these antibodies in the long-term follow-up of ACS, could become an object of interesting discussion...|$|E

Gliadin has been considered to cause wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis. In this work, we used a new mixture of extracted marine proteases to digest gliadin. The enzymes were extracted from epatopancreas of Eriphia verrucosa and Palinurus elephas; the tissues were homogenised and after differential centrifugation the enzymes were used in enzymatic assay. The digestion was performed at low temperature (4 °C). After digestions the substrate was analysed in SDS-PAGE and the allergenic fragments result are completely digested by the action of both different marine species enzymes. At present, we are try to identify the marine prolyl endopeptidases and/or prolyl oligopeptidases, families of serine proteases having the ability to hydrolyse the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of a proline residue. These proline specific enzymes are widely distributed in bacteria, fungi, animals and plants...|$|E
