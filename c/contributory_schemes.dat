40|$|The article {{traces the}} post-war {{history of the}} British {{hospital}} <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes,</b> which had developed during the inter-war years to the point where, through the accumulation of small weekly contributions from a mass membership, they provided substantial proportions of hospital income. A minority of <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> remained in existence post- 1948, but their subsequent development has received little attention. Some evolved into provident associations offering private health insurance; others remained committed to the provision of low-cost benefits to a blue-collar clientele, and continued {{to be known as}} hospital <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes.</b> This article outlines the principal features of the contributory schemes' contemporary history. We first explore why many schemes decided to continue in existence. The next section uses national and individual scheme records to delineate the market niche which they captured and to investigate their role in post-war health provision, relative to the state system. In particular we trace the decline of convalescent home benefit, and the gradual trend towards a more uniform benefit package, of which optical and dental grants were the most popular. We then survey patterns of membership and account for the main trends in support for cash plan products since 1950. Finally, we ask to what extent the schemes were able to retain their character as a ‘movement’ with distinctive mutualist and charitable features, particularly in the more competitive environment of the later twentieth century...|$|E

40|$|Summary: In {{the context}} of {{developments}} in health care arrangements over {{the late nineteenth and}} twentieth centuries, change in the voluntary hospitals is not normally regarded as a major theme. Yet in their relations with each other, with external authorities, and in patterns of funding the hospitals were subjected to change. In particular, the growth of hospital <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> enabled renewed hospital expansion to occur and established a quasi-insurance basis to hospital activity in place of the earlier, largely philanthropic approach. The schemes also involved additional market mechanisms and promoted reorganization, including a degree of co-ordination of hospital services, felt at the local level before the growth of policy making bodies on a national scale and largely independent of central or local government. Focusing upon East Anglia but including other examples, the article examines the growth of hospital collections, the emergence of <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> and their consequences for popular access to hospital facilities. A 'grass roots' approach is adopted, using annual reports of several hospitals and <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> and local Insurance Committee minutes. It appears that the size and impact of the schemes in East Anglia has been understated, though this may not be typical of the situation nationally. The local evidence is also examined in the light of other recent research on the themes of popular participation, employer interest and social control aspects in health care provision at hospital levels. © 1992 The Society for the Social History of Medicine...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} the discussion and rejection {{of a social}} insurance model of funding for the British National Health Service. Specifically it asks why the hospital contributory scheme movement had so little impact on policy debates in the 1940 s. We argue that {{at the start of}} the policy-making process serious consideration was given to the incorporation of this mode of funding, not least because the <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes,</b> with some ten million members, played a major role in financing existing voluntary hospital provision. Early sections describe the growth and nature of the schemes, noting that, despite their large working-class constituency and the presence of labour movement representatives amongst their leadership, they remained peripheral to discussion of reform in the interwar period. We then trace the emergence of the proposal for an insurance-based ‘hotel charge’ in civil servants' discussions about hospital funding following the Beveridge Report. Officials, however, remained sceptical about the contributory schemes' capacity to deliver a comprehensive and efficient funding mechanism, given their lack of uniformity, the gaps in their coverage, and the limited progress of reciprocal arrangements between them. Finally, we note the ineffectiveness of the British Hospital <b>Contributory</b> <b>Schemes</b> Association as a player in the policy community. Its leadership had no clear strategy for influencing events and was reluctant to deploy pressure group tactics such as lobbying through the press or parliament. Crucially, the movement was divided internally between those members who supported the voluntary system and others who welcomed a publicly funded health service...|$|E
40|$|South Africa developed, {{during the}} course of the twentieth century, an {{exceptional}} welfare system based on social assistance rather than social insurance, and focused especially on old-age pensions.   The origins of South Africa’s welfare state lay in the 1920 s, not in the 1930 s as has generally been suggested.   This paper examines the process leading to the 1928 Old Age Pensions Act, paying particular attention to the 1926 - 28 Pienaar Commission on Old Age Pensions and National Insurance.   The introduction of old age pensions enjoyed the support of all parties representing white and coloured voters in Parliament, but for diverse reasons.   For the National Party and Labour Party – partners in the coalition Pact Government of 1924 - 29 – non-contributory old-age pensions were a crucial pillar in the ‘civilised labour’ policies designed to lift ‘poor whites’ out of poverty and re-establish a clear racial hierarchy.   Welfare reform was thus, in significant part, a response to the ‘swartgevaar’ or menace of black physical, occupational and social mobility.   The choice of a system of tax-financed social assistance, in preference to a system of social insurance financed out of contributions by employers and workers, was due to a combination of factors: the perceived need to provide immediate redress against poverty and unemployment (motivating the National Party); the powerful influence of left and liberal thinking from Britain, Australia and New Zealand (on both bureaucrats and the Labour Party); a concern that <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> would add to much to the costs of production (among employers and workers alike); and a worry about the racial coverage of <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|E

An integral part of microfinance, micro-credit {{has emerged as a}} tool for financial inclusion of impoverished segments of society, particularly in developing countries. In Nigeria, micro-credit has its roots in centuries-old traditional practices, involving <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> within a committed group and the subsequent rotation of the receipts of proceeds among members. The informal nature of micro-credit was transformed in the 1980 s, with the emergence of Community Banks. Furthermore, with the intervention of CBN, the Community Banks were integrated into the nation’s financial system as Microfinance Banks. The banks became an effective tool for accessing finance by marginalized groups, including the poor, women and budding entrepreneurs. Therefore, the objective of the paper is to shed light on micro-credit as a tool for financial inclusion.

40|$|Since the 1980 s, two {{alternative}} approaches for financing and organizing pensions {{for older people}} have emerged across developing regions. These are: (1) <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes,</b> taking the form of capitalized individual accounts, usually managed by private firms; (2) government funded non-contributory “social pensions” provided on either a means-tested or universal basis. Both these approaches are influential in Latin America, where they have often come to replace long-standing defined benefit schemes. Indeed, Chile was a pioneer of the first approach, implementing a reform in 1980, {{and it continues to}} be seen as a model for pension reforms in countries as diverse as Nigeria and India. Since the 1960 s, Brazil has developed a substantial social pension programme which runs alongside <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> for protected workers. More recently, social pension programmes have become more widespread in Latin America, including new and enlarged schemes in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. In some countries these two approaches have been developed in tandem, comprising two separate “pillars” of an integrated pension system. Theoretically, social pensions can operate as a welfare safety net for people who fail to accumulate sufficient reserves to obtain a decent contributory pension. Bolivia is a case in point. In 1996 the government implemented a combined reform which saw the conversion of existing schemes into privately run capitalization schemes. At the same time, using finances from the privatization of state-owned enterprises, the government established a new, universal social pension programme: Bono Solidario (Bonosol). Since that time, Bonosol (and its successor Renta Dignidad) has received considerable international attention and is considered by many to be a model of best practice for pension policy in low income countries (Willmore 2007). Less attention has been paid to the new contributory system, but most evaluations are less than positive about its achievements (Fretes-Cibils et al. 2006). This paper compares the effectiveness of Bolivia’s social pension and its contributory system as tools of income security for older people. We focus on several aspects of their performance: coverage of older people, cost and financial sustainability, administrative efficiency and effects on income distribution. The next section summarizes key elements of the two approaches, reviews international experiences and identifies policy challenges. We then provide some relevant context for the Bolivia case study, before examining the performance of each model. Comparing these distinct approaches within a single country provides important policy lessons, particularly for low-income countries.

40|$|The years {{following}} the end of the First World War were a time of great change, not least in the field of healthcare. Rising costs and demand ensured that traditional philanthropic sources of income became increasingly insufficient. This necessitated the emergence of new patterns of funding in Britain’s voluntary hospitals with a greater place for <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes,</b> direct patient payments and arrangements with the public sector. One aspect of such change was that the largely passive role, in which charitable provision had traditionally held the patient, was called into question. This article places this specific issue within context of the various ideological conceptions of healthcare, each defining the role of the patient in a different way. These are briefly outlined before the local case study of Bristol - and the Bristol Royal Infirmary (hereafter the Infirmary) in particular - is used to consider the impact that changes in voluntary hospital funding had on the role in which the patient was cast (here termed the ‘patient contract’). Although there were major changes in funding, most notably the introduction of a patient payment scheme in 1921, the patient contract remained in essence philanthropic. This {{was the result of a}} clear ideological commitment, most obviously on the part of the Faculty, to the treatment of the sick poor. ...|$|E
