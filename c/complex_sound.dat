2500|$|Electronic {{keyboards}} {{are capable}} of recreating {{a wide range of}} instrument sounds (piano, electric piano, Hammond organ, pipe organ, violin, etc.) with less <b>complex</b> <b>sound</b> synthesis. Electronic keyboards are usually dedicated for home users, beginners and other non-professional users. They typically have unweighted keys. The least expensive models do not have velocity-sensitive keys; but mid- to high-priced models do have these feature. Home keyboards typically have little if any sound editing capacity. The user typically selects from a range of preset [...] "voices" [...] or sounds, which include imitations of many instruments and some electronic synthesizer sounds. Home keyboards have a much lower cost than professional synthesizers. Casio and Yamaha are among the leading manufacturers of home keyboards.|$|E
2500|$|The Goon Show was {{recorded}} before a studio audience {{and during the}} audience warm-up session, Milligan would play the trumpet, while Peter Sellers played on the orchestra's drums. For {{the first few years}} the shows were recorded live, direct to 16-inch transcription disc, which required the cast to adhere closely to the script but by Series 4, the BBC had adopted the use of magnetic tape. Milligan eagerly exploited the possibilities the new technology offered—the tapes could be edited, so the cast could now ad-lib freely and tape also enabled the creation of groundbreaking sound effects. Over the first three series, Milligan's demands for increasingly <b>complex</b> <b>sound</b> effects (or [...] "grams", as they were then known) pushed technology and the skills of the BBC engineers to their limits—effects had to be created mechanically (foley) or played back from discs, sometimes requiring the use of four or five turntables running simultaneously. With magnetic tape, these effects could be produced in advance and the BBC engineers were able to create highly complex, tightly edited effects [...] "stings" [...] that would have been very difficult (if not impossible) to perform using foley or disc. In the later years of the series many Goon Show [...] "grams" [...] were produced for the series by members of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, a notable example being the [...] "Major Bloodnok's Stomach" [...] effect, realised by Dick Mills.|$|E

It must be pointed out that the measurements taken so far indicate that the critical bands have a certain width, but that their position on the frequency scale is not fixed; rather, the position can be changed continuously, perhaps by the ear itself."Thus the important attribute of the Bark scale is the width of the critical band at any given frequency, not the exact values of the edges or centers of any band.|$|R

40|$|In {{auditory}} cortex, neural responses decrease with stimulus repetition, {{known as}} adaptation. Adaptation {{is thought to}} facilitate detection of novel sounds and improve perception in noisy environments. Although it is well established that adaptation occurs in primary auditory cortex, {{it is not known}} whether adaptation also occurs in higher auditory areas involved in processing <b>complex</b> <b>sounds,</b> such as speech. Resolving this issue is important for understanding the neural bases of adaptation and to avoid potential post-operative deficits after temporal lobe surgery for treatment of focal epilepsy. Intracranial electrocorticographic recordings were acquired simultaneously from electrodes implanted in primary and association auditory areas of the right (non-dominant) temporal lobe in a patient with complex partial seizures originating from the inferior parietal lobe. Simple and <b>complex</b> <b>sounds</b> were presented in a passive oddball paradigm. We measured changes in single-trial high-gamma power (70 – 150 Hz) and in regional and inter-regional network-level activity indexed by cross-frequency coupling. Repetitive tones elicited the greatest adaptation and corresponding increases in cross-frequency coupling in primary auditory cortex. Conversely, auditory association cortex showed stronger adaptation for <b>complex</b> <b>sounds,</b> including speech. This first report of multi-regional adaptation in human auditory cortex highlights the role of the non-dominant temporal lobe in suppressing neural responses to repetitive background sounds (noise). These results underscore the clinical utility of functional mapping to avoid potential post-operative deficits including increased listening difficulties in noisy, real-world environments...|$|R
40|$|Thresholds for {{detecting}} {{a gap between}} two complex tones were determined for young listeners with normal hearing and old listeners with mild age-related hearing loss. The leading tonal marker was always a 20 -ms, 250 -Hz complex tone with energy at 250, 500, 750, and 1000 thinsp;Hz. The lagging marker, also tonal, could differ from the leading marker with respect to fundamental frequency (f 0), the presence versus absence of energy at f 0, {{and the degree to}} which it overlapped spectrally with the leading marker. All stimuli were presented with steeper (1 thinsp;ms) and less steep (4 thinsp;ms) envelope rise and fall times. F 0 differences, decreases in the degree of spectral overlap between the markers, and shallower envelope shape all contributed to increases in gap-detection thresholds. Age differences for gap detection of <b>complex</b> <b>sounds</b> were generally small and constant when gap-detection thresholds were measured on a log scale. When comparing the results for <b>complex</b> <b>sounds</b> to thresholds obtained for pure-tones in a previous study by Heinrich and Schneider [(2006). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 119, 2316 ndash; 2326], thresholds increased in an orderly fashion from markers with identical (within-channel) pure tones to different (between-channel) pure tones to <b>complex</b> <b>sounds.</b> This pattern of results was true for listeners of both ages although younger listeners had smaller thresholds overall...|$|R
