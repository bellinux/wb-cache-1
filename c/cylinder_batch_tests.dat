40|$|This {{technical}} note describes factors affecting batch leaching of metals from dredged material. Factors evaluated include time of sediment-water contact, sedi-ment salinity regime, and sediment oxidation status. Background Contaminated dredged material is often placed in confined disposal facilities where movement of contaminants by leachate {{is an important}} environmental con-cern. No laboratory testing protocol has been routinely applied to predict leachate quality and quantity from confined dredged material disposal facilities. In 1984, the US Army Corps of Engineers initiated investigations of confined disposal facility (CDF) leachate by developing a theoretical framework for prediction of leachate quality based on mass transport theory. The theoretical framework in-cluded both <b>batch</b> and column <b>testing</b> in an integrated approach. <b>Batch</b> <b>testing</b> provides a quick, relatively easy method for determining the distribution of con-taminants between dredged material and leachate. Equilibrium distribution (partitioning) coefficients derived from <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> can then be used to relate leachate contaminant concentrations to solid phase contaminant concentrations. Column testing more closely approximates contaminant losses under field condi-tions in a CDF than do <b>batch</b> <b>tests.</b> Leachate results predicted by <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> {{can be compared to}} those observed from column leaching experiments by combining column tests results, distribution coefficients from <b>batch</b> <b>tests,</b> and mass transport theory.

Results indicated that activity was evenly distributed within the GAC reactors, whereas in the sand reactor a sludge blanket on top of the sand bed contained approximately 50 % of the activity. The Monod half-velocity constant (Ks) for the acetate-utilizing methanogens in two expanded-bed GAC reactors was searched for by combining steady-state results with <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> data. All parameters necessary to develop a model with Monod kinetics were experimentally determined except for Ks.

Addition of a competitive inhibition term into the Monod expression predicted the dependence of Ks on the effluent 3 -ethylphenol concentration.

The mobile Se oxyanions, Se(IV) and Se(VI), can be adsorbed to mineral phases or reduced biotically or abiotically to Se solid phases, such as Se(0). Microbial analyses and geochemical testing were conducted to determine if Se can be sequestered in anoxic coal waste rock by these mechanisms. Testing was conducted on a waste rock sample collected from the West Line Creek waste rock dump in the Elk Valley and a water sample collected from the rock drain flowing beneath the dump. Microbial analyses included culturing with plate and broth media and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The key finding from these analyses was that bacteria capable of reducing Se(VI) to Se(0) were present in the waste rock sample and bacteria capable of reducing Se(IV) to Se(0) were present in the rock drain water sample. Geochemical <b>tests</b> included abiotic <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> on waste rock and pure minerals, non-sterile <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> on waste rock, and desorption <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> on waste rock, as well as several solids analysis techniques, such as X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. <b>Batch</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted at circumneutral pH in an anoxic glove box to simulate an anoxic zone of a waste rock dump. <b>Batch</b> <b>testing</b> on pure minerals present in the waste rock sample determined that siderite can reduce Se(VI) to Se(IV) and that siderite, pyrite, and sphalerite can adsorb Se(IV) and reduce Se(IV) to Se(0). Under sterile conditions, waste rock did not reduce Se(VI) but it did adsorb Se(IV) and reduce Se(IV) to Se(0). Under non-sterile conditions, Se(VI) was reduced to Se(IV) much faster than the sterile tests with siderite and Se(IV) was removed from solution by a combination of adsorption, biotic reduction, and abiotic reduction.

Since this study {{was based on the}} results of <b>batch</b> and column <b>tests</b> conducted independently, there were limitations to the conclusions derived. The organic com-pounds tested were benzene, methylene chloride, toluene, trichloroethylene, and p-xylene. The results of this study showed that as soil solids concentrations increased, the measured Kp values of these organic compounds strongly decreased. The observed values of Kp stabilized when the soil solids concentration was above a certain value. Typical Kp values obtained from <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> conducted under high soil solids concentrations were close to those obtained from column tests.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{proposes a}} novel and {{rigorous}} substrate characterisation methodology {{to be used}} with ADM 1 to simulate the anaerobic digestion of solid organic waste. The proposed method uses data from both direct substrate analysis and the methane production from laboratory scale anaerobic digestion experiments and involves assessment of four substrate fractionation models. The models partition the organic matter into a mixture of particulate and soluble fractions with the decision on the most suitable model being made on quality of fit between experimental and simulated data and the uncertainty of the calibrated parameters. The method was tested using samples of domestic green and food waste and using experimental data from both short <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> and longer semi-continuous trials. The results showed that in general an increased fractionation model complexity led to better fit but with increased uncertainty. When using <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> data the most suitable model for green waste included one particulate and one soluble fraction, whereas for food waste two particulate fractions were needed. With richer semi-continuous datasets, the parameter estimation resulted in less uncertainty therefore allowing the description of the substrate with a more complex model.

The rate of mineral recovery in a <b>batch</b> flotation <b>test</b> is not only influenced by particle floatability, but also by the amount of air bubble surface area available in the pulp and the recovery of value mineral from the flotation froth. This is given as =.. where k is the rate constant (min- 1), P is a parameter which represents the floatability of a mineral, Rf is the froth recovery factor and Sb bubble surface area flux. A test unit developed for this study (based on the Bikerman foam test) indicated that the fatty acid collector used (Betacol 364) has froth stabilising characteristics and thus may have increased the froth recovery (Rf) during the <b>batch</b> flotation <b>test.</b> The increase {{in the rate of}} pyrrhotite recovery measured can therefore not only be explained by an increase in pyrrhotite floatability. In a case where the <b>batch</b> flotation <b>tests</b> are followed by plant testing and the rate of flotation increase measured during the <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> was only or partially {{as a result of an}} increase in froth recovery (Rf), the <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> would be an unreliable test to predict plant performance. Plant operators have many variables available to manage froth recovery (Rf), for example pulp level and frother dosing rate. For a laboratory scale <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> to be a reliable test for predicting a rate increase in plant recovery, it is necessary that an increase in the rate of recovery will be as a result of an increase in particle floatability (P). It is recommended that {{a collector}} <b>batch</b> flotation <b>test</b> campaign must include a test to measure if the collector has frothing characteristics. The Bikerman froth stability column is demonstrated as a possible test to measure if a collector has froth stabilising characteristics. The Bikerman froth stability column test method confirmed that the fatty acid collector tested (Betacol 364) has froth stabilising properties. Additional tests are therefore recommended to confirm that the rate of recovery increase measured is as a result of an increase in pyrrhotite and pentlandite floatability (P). Micro flotation tests performed on pyrrhotite mineral specimens confirmed that a combination between Xanthate and Betacol 364 increases the particle floatability (P) of pyrrhotite. Laboratory scale flotation tests performed on artificial ores, consisting of a mixture of quartz and pyrrhotite mineral specimens, confirmed that the combination of Betacol 364 and xanthate increases the floatability of pyrrhotite (P).
