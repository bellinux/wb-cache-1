5000|$|His rap {{career began}} in earnest {{with a series of}} mixtapes, <b>Cassette</b> in 2012 {{followed}} by <b>Cassette</b> 2 and <b>Cassette</b> 3 in 2013. Each mixtape was released only on <b>cassette</b> tape and the artwork for each <b>cassette</b> mimicked the trade dress of recognizable products - a pack of Marlboro cigarettes (<b>Cassette),</b> a can of Coca-Cola (<b>Cassette</b> 2) and a first generation iPod (<b>Cassette</b> 3). Philip Morris USA sent a cease and desist letter to Stones Throw alleging that the design of <b>Cassette</b> infringed its trademark in the Marlboro packaging design. Stones Throw agreed to stop producing anymore copies of <b>Cassette,</b> noting that they were [...] "just about out of tapes anyway." [...] In July 2014, a selection of tracks from the three mixtapes was released on vinyl as the compilation <b>Cassette</b> on Vinyl. [...] "Cool Runnings", a track from <b>Cassette</b> 2, was listed by Drowned in Sound as one of the Top Tracks in April 2013. He released Rap Album One on Stones Throw Records later that year. In 2015, Jonwayne collaborated with English alternative electronic band Beak on their Split EP.|$|R
50|$|A more {{expensive}} 1000ZXL Limited was also offered, {{with the same}} specifications as the 1000ZXL but with a gold plated face. Other Nakamichi <b>cassette</b> decks are the <b>Cassette</b> Deck 1 and the <b>Cassette</b> Deck 1 Limited. Like the 1000ZXL Limited, the <b>Cassette</b> Deck 1 Limited is {{more expensive}} than the <b>Cassette</b> Deck 1.|$|R
5|$|After several self-released {{records and}} <b>cassettes,</b> the band signed to Will Records in the US {{and later the}} V2 {{subsidiary}} Big Cat Records in the UK, going on to sign an exclusive deal with V2.

5|$|Chromium(IV) oxide (CrO2) is a {{magnetic}} compound. Its ideal shape anisotropy, which imparts high coercivity and remnant magnetization, {{made it a}} compound superior to the Î³-Fe2O3. Chromium(IV) oxide is used to manufacture magnetic tape used in high-performance audio tape and standard audio <b>cassettes.</b> Chromates can prevent corrosion of steel under wet conditions, and therefore chromates are added to drilling muds.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{in honor}} of the 10th anniversary of Madvillainy, Stones Throw {{released}} special edition of the album on vinyl. The album re-entered Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 117, higher than it did originally. The same year Madvillainy was also released on Compact <b>Cassettes,</b> as part of the Cassette Store Day.|$|E
40|$|A {{particle}} <b>cassette</b> for a needleless syringe is provided, {{the manufacture}} of which avoids the potentially detrimental use of heat when affixing a final membrane to the <b>cassette</b> or otherwise sealing the <b>cassette</b> after a filling procedure has been carried out. The particle <b>cassette</b> is assembled using first and second <b>cassette</b> parts that are attachable together so as to create a chamber for the confinement of particles between two membranes. A third <b>cassette</b> part {{may be used to}} provide for a locking attachment of the first and second parts. A kit of parts for use in {{the manufacture of}} a particle <b>cassette</b> is also provided, as is a method of assembling a particle <b>cassette.</b> In certain <b>cassette</b> embodiments, {{one or both of the}} first and second <b>cassette</b> parts can be annular, tapered and/or have detents or recesses to provide for a snap fit...|$|R

50|$|Occasionally, a <b>cassette</b> single was {{released}} in two <b>cassette</b> formats simultaneously: a traditional <b>Cassette</b> single with two tracks and a <b>cassette</b> maxi-single with four or more tracks, generally remixes. This practice was experimented with in the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, Jessica {{became an}} instant media celebrity. ABC News gave Lloyd {{a video camera}} and blank <b>cassettes</b> to tape the flight; once the journey began, it was vigorously {{followed}} by supporters, media outlets, and others who monitored its progress, reporting each time Dubroff landed or took off.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw the {{increased}} use of audio <b>cassettes</b> and videotapes for the dissemination of bootleg recordings, as the affordability of private dubbing equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. <b>Cassettes</b> were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. Cassette culture and tape trading, propelled by the DIY ethic of the punk subculture, relied on an honour system where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community. For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the Glastonbury Festival sold mass copies of bootleg soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, {{by the end of the}} 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.|$|E
5|$|The {{first home}} media {{release of the}} episode was on VHS {{cassette}} in the United States on September 10, 1996.

It was released on DVD as part of the season one box set on June 3, 2003.|$|E
25|$|Stereo {{recorders}} eventually {{evolved into}} high fidelity and {{were known as}} <b>cassette</b> decks, after the reel-to-reel decks. Hi-Fi <b>cassette</b> decks, in contrast to <b>cassette</b> recorders and <b>cassette</b> players, often didn't have built-in amplification or speakers. Many formats of <b>cassette</b> players and recorders have evolved over the years. Initially all were top loading, usually with <b>cassette</b> on one side, and VU meters and recording level controls on the other side. Older models used combinations of levers and sliding buttons for control.|$|R
50|$|VHS-C <b>cassette</b> {{was larger}} than Video8 <b>cassette,</b> but was {{compatible}} with VHS tape recorders, using a special adapter <b>cassette.</b> The adapter contains a standard full-size engagement hub for the VCR's takeup sprocket, which connected to a gear train to drive the VHS-C <b>cassette</b> takeup gear.|$|R

5|$|A pilot {{programme}} was commissioned in March 1977, and was {{recorded by the}} end of the following June. A second series was commissioned in 1979, transmitted in 1980. Episodes of the first series were re-recorded for release on LP records and audio <b>cassettes</b> and Adams adapted the first series into a best-selling novel in 1979. After the 1980 transmissions of the second radio series, a second novel was published and the first series was adapted for television. This was followed by three further novels, a computer game, and various other media.|$|E
5|$|Some Lucian calypsonians {{recorded}} in the 1980s, mostly on 45-RPM discs which remain largely unavailable today. The Lucian music industry is quite small scale, due to the island's small market, its lack of recording studios and record producers, the widespread bootlegging of <b>cassettes,</b> and the general unavailability of funding for musical ventures. Saint Lucia is home to several radio stations including Radio St. Lucia and Radio Caribbean International, which play a variety of popular music; since 1989, St Lucian radio stations have played {{an increasing number of}} programs about Lucian culture and in the local Creole tongue.|$|E

5|$|The film's soundtrack and {{background}} score were composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Vairamuthu. The soundtrack was released through Star Music. Strips of herbal rejuvenator capsules were sold {{along with the}} film's music <b>cassettes.</b> Before the film's release, Rahman asked Ravikumar if the soundtrack could be released in August 1999. Ravikumar informed Rahman that he had already discussed a release date with the press, and that Rahman would be blamed for any delay. To make the deadline, Rahman did a live re-recording of both the soundtrack and score to finish them on time.|$|E
5|$|The {{first home}} media {{release of the}} episode was a VHS {{cassette}} in the United States on September 29, 1993.

The episode was released on Region 1 DVD as part of the season one box on May 20, 2003, and as part of Fan Favorites: The Best of Cheers on March 6, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{music group}} Chari Jazz formed in 1964 and {{initiated}} Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned {{groups such as}} African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on sai, a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio <b>cassettes</b> featuring Chadian artists. Piracy {{and a lack of}} legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.|$|E
