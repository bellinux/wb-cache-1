50|$|In 1980 and 1981, Collazo, having {{qualified}} as an FMC practitioner, created and filed the Pacific Coast European <b>Conference</b> <b>Tariff</b> FMC-18. That technical correlation of commodity classification {{systems for the}} Brussel's BTN and the United Nation's SITC in FMC-18 provided the private sector technical contribution needed to facilitate a successful implementation of the United States objectives via the CCC and the ITC processes for the creation and adoption of a harmonized international trade commodity classification system. Today, these tariff and commodity classification systems are known as the Harmonized System (HS) for Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. The HS is the international standard for reporting goods to customs and other government agencies. Globally adopted by 180 countries and covering 98% of merchandise trade, the HS has been administered by the Brussels-based World Customs Organization (WCO) since 1988.|$|E
40|$|Service {{contracts}} {{have emerged}} as an important instrument to secure a long-term relationship between carriers in the container shipping industry and shippers requiring scheduled services covering a global market. This contract, entered into largely on an individual and confidential basis, continues to enjoy anti-trust immunity under current United States and European Union regulations. It {{will continue to be}} in place even after the EC Council Regulation 4056 / 86 is repealed in October 2008 although it may operate in a modified way because of the absence of the common external <b>conference</b> <b>tariff.</b> This article examines the implications of this instrument on the international supply chain and explores its future role in defining efficiencies in international trade flows.

5000|$|The {{mainstream}} Liberal Party meanwhile experienced {{difficulties with}} {{its relations with}} the National Government, which was dominated by Conservatives who supported tariffs. On 22 January 1932 the Cabinet announced an [...] "agreement to differ", suspending Cabinet collective responsibility so that the four members of the Cabinet who supported free trade (Liberals Herbert Samuel, Donald Maclean and Sir Archibald Sinclair together with Viscount Snowden who was nominally National Labour) should be [...] "at liberty to express their views by speech and vote". When (in September 1932) the Cabinet endorsed the conclusion of the Ottawa <b>Conference,</b> favouring protective <b>tariffs,</b> all Liberal ministers together with Viscount Snowden resigned but the Liberals continued to support the National Government on all other policies.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, the Tariff Reform League's {{numerous}} branches were {{challenging the}} Conservative National Union. Chamberlain also attempted to secure the Tariff Reform League's representation inside Conservative Central Office. Balfour maintained his programme of retaliatory tariffs and attempted to minimise the obvious differences between Chamberlain and himself. Publicly, Chamberlain claimed that Balfour's stance was the precursor to a fuller policy of Imperial Preference. Now approaching seventy years of age, Chamberlain continued to campaign for tariff reform with zeal and energy. Reconciliation appeared imminent when Balfour agreed to a general election after the 1906 Colonial <b>Conference,</b> in which <b>tariff</b> reform would be discussed. However, threatened by backbench opposition, Balfour rescinded the agreement and demanded party unity. Chamberlain ignored this and intensified his campaign in November 1905, resulting directly in Balfour's resignation on 4 December.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1863 Ayers was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} three South Australian representatives at the inter-colonial <b>conference</b> on uniform <b>tariffs</b> and inland customs duties. He also represented the colony at several other conferences from 1864 to 1877. On 4 July 1863 Ayers became minister without portfolio in the first Dutton cabinet. This ministry resigned just 11 days later however, as council demanded that it should have an executive minister to represent the government and Dutton refused. Ayers formed his first ministry as Premier and Chief Secretary on 15 July 1863. [...] The house was much divided and it was almost impossible to get business done. Ayers reconstructed his ministry on 22 July 1864 but was defeated, and resigned on 4 August 1864. The Blyth ministry which was then formed included Ayers as chief secretary, but did not survive a general election and resigned on 22 March 1865. When Dutton formed his second ministry Ayers had his old position as chief secretary, and still retaining that office, formed his third administration on 20 September 1865 which lasted just over a month. In spite of dissolutions it was found very difficult to get a workable house. There were 18 ministries tween July 1863 and July 1873. Ayers became the premier again from May 1867 to September 1868, October to November 1868, 27 January 1872 to March 1872, and with an entirely new team of ministers, from March 1872 to July 1873. He held the position of chief secretary in the Colton ministry from June 1876 to October 1877, his last term of office.|$|R
50|$|In 1869 Giblin {{was elected}} without {{opposition}} as member for Hobart Town in the Tasmanian House of Assembly, and in February 1870 became attorney-general in the James Milne Wilson ministry. Wilson resigned in November 1872 and was succeeded by Frederick Innes. In August 1873 Giblin carried a motion of {{want of confidence}} but did not desire the premiership, and Alfred Kennerley formed a cabinet with Giblin as his attorney-general. This ministry lasted nearly three years and Giblin {{was able to bring}} in some useful legal legislation. In June 1877 Giblin lost his seat at the general election, but he was soon afterwards elected for Wellington and joined the cabinet of Sir Philip Fysh as attorney-general, exchanging that position for the treasurership a few days later. When Fysh left for London in March 1878 Giblin succeeded him as premier and held office until 20 December 1878. The William Crowther government which followed could do little in the conditions of the period, and when it resigned in October 1879 Giblin realised {{that the only way to}} get useful work done would be to form a coalition ministry. This he succeeded in doing and he became premier and colonial treasurer on 30 October 1879. His government lasted nearly five years and during that period the finances of the colony were put in order and railways and roads were built. Important work was done although the conservative elements in the Tasmanian Legislative Council succeeded in hampering the government to some extent. In December 1881 Giblin exchanged the position of treasurer for that of attorney-general with John S. Dodds. He represented Tasmania at the intercolonial <b>tariff</b> <b>conference</b> at Sydney in 1881 and at the Sydney federal conference in 1883, and took an important part in the debates.|$|R
