Estuarine systems also experience daily, tidal and seasonal swings in temperature, which affect many of the chemical characteristics {{of the water and}} in turn affect the metabolic and calcifying processes of shell-producing organisms. Temperature and salinity affect the <b>carbonate</b> <b>balance</b> of the water, influencing carbonate equilibrium, calcium carbonate solubility and the saturation states of calcite and aragonite. The tidal influences and shallow water of estuaries mean that estuarine organisms experience wide variations in temperature, salinity and other aspects of water chemistry; these fluctuations make the estuarine habitat ideal for studies on the influence of changing physical and chemical conditions on processes such as shell deposition. Changing conditions in estuaries and coastal regions are especially relevant to human interests, because about 50% of global calcification and 90% of fish catch occurs in these locations.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Bioerosion by Cliona delitrix and Cliona lampa was {{assessed}} at 43 sites along the Florida Reef Tract, USA, {{in the summer}} of 2001. Sponge abundances were estimated using rapid visual assessment. Tissue samples of sponges were taken for analysis of δ 15 N. Comparison samples were taken from Belize. Annual trends in sponge abundance were estimated from archived videos covering the period from 1996 - 2001. Sites with the greatest boring sponge size and cover were in the Backcountry and Lower Keys, where total nitrogen, ammonium, and δ 15 N levels were highest. The sites with the largest relative increase of C. delitrix and C. lampa over the 5 year period were in the Upper Keys, where the greatest relative decline in stony coral cover has occurred. Florida sponge δ 15 N values were 5. 2 (± 0. 1) ‰, suggesting the influence of human waste; in comparison, offshore Belize samples were 2. 1 (± 0. 1) ‰. These results suggest sewage contamination of the Florida Reef Tract, shifting the <b>carbonate</b> <b>balance</b> from construction to destruction...|$|E

A new climatic system occur and widespread during the Quaternary and is characterized by glacial and interglacial alternance. To follow the different steps of this crisis, we have choosen a borehole situated in the Cotentin peninsula (Normandy, France) and used ostracodes such as markers. The interpretation of quantitative and qualitative data from the ostracode fauna analysis shows that bathymetry was around 40 and 60 meters with slight fluctuations, excepted during Praetiglian event where the zone was outofwater.

40|$|Corals play a {{key role}} in ocean {{ecosystems}} and <b>carbonate</b> <b>balance,</b> but their molecular response to ocean acidification remains unclear. The only previous whole-transcriptome study (Moya et al. Molecular Ecology, 2012; 21, 2440) documented extensive disruption of gene expression, particularly of genes encoding skeletal organic matrix proteins, in juvenile corals (Acropora millepora) after short-term (3 d) exposure to elevated pCO 2. In this study, whole-transcriptome analysis was used to compare the effects of such 'acute' (3 d) exposure to elevated pCO 2 with a longer ('prolonged'; 9 d) period of exposure beginning immediately post-fertilization. Far fewer genes were differentially expressed under the 9 -d treatment, and although the transcriptome data implied wholesale disruption of metabolism and calcification genes in the acute treatment experiment, expression of most genes was at control levels after prolonged treatment. There was little overlap between the genes responding to the acute and prolonged treatments, but heat shock proteins (HSPs) and heat shock factors (HSFs) were over-represented amongst the genes responding to both treatments. Amongst these was an HSP 70 gene previously shown to be involved in acclimation to thermal stress in a field population of another acroporid coral. The most obvious feature of the molecular response in the 9 -d treatment experiment was the upregulation of five distinct Bcl- 2 family members, the majority predicted to be anti-apoptotic. This suggests that an important component of the longer term response to elevated CO 2 is suppression of apoptosis. It therefore appears that juvenile A. millepora have the capacity to rapidly acclimate to elevated pCO 2, a process mediated by upregulation of specific HSPs and a suite of Bcl- 2 family members...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of soil and}} vadose zone as the drains for carbon sink and proper modeling of the effects and extremes of biogeochemical cycles in the terrestrial biosphere are the key components to understanding the carbon cycle, global climate system, and aquatic and terrestrial system uncertainties. Calcium carbonate equilibrium causes saturation of solution with CaCO 3, and it determines its material composition, migration and accumulation of salts. In a solution electrically neutral ion pairs are formed: CaCO 3 0, CaSO 4 0, MgCO 3 0, and MgSO 4 0, as well as charged ion pairs CaHCO 3 +, MgHCO 3 +, NaCO 3 −, NaSO 4 −, CaOH +, and MgOH +. The calcium carbonate equilibrium algorithm, mathematical model and original software to calculate the real equilibrium forms of ions and to determine the nature of calcium <b>carbonate</b> <b>balance</b> in a solution were developed. This approach conducts the quantitative {{assessment of}} real ion forms of solution in solonetz soil and vadose zone of dry steppe {{taking into account the}} ion association at high ionic strength of saline soil solution. The concentrations of free and associated ion form were calculated according to analytical ion concentration in real solution. In the iteration procedure, the equations were used to find the following: ion material balance, a linear interpolation of equilibrium constants, a method of ionic pairs, the laws of initial concentration preservation, operating masses of equilibrium system, and the concentration constants of ion pair dissociation. The coefficient of ion association γ e was determined as the ratio of ions free form to analytical content of ion γ e [*]=[*] C ass ∕ C an. Depending on soil and vadose zone layer, concentration and composition of solution in the ionic pair's form are 11 – 52 % Ca 2 +; 22. 2 – 54. 6 % Mg 2 +; 1. 1 – 10. 5 % Na +; 3. 7 – 23. 8 HCO 3 −, 23. 3 – 61. 6 % SO 4 2 −, and up to 85. 7 % CO 3 2 −. The carbonate system of soil and vadose zone water solution helps to explain the evolution of salted soils, vadose and saturation zones, and landscape. It also helps to improve the soil maintenance, plant nutrition and irrigation. The association of ions in soil solutions is one of the drivers promoting transformation of solution, excessive fluxes of carbon in the soil, and loss of carbon from soil through vadose zone...|$|E
40|$|The 1982 - 83 El Niño event {{produced}} a high coral mortality (50 - 90 %) in several localities in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, {{which resulted in}} an outbreak of the sea urchin populations of Diadema mexicanum A.

In Costa Rica, El Niño impact varied among three of the most important coral reefs localities, being higher in Cocos Island, moderate in Caño Island, and lower in Culebra Bay; D. mexicanum densities followed the same pattern. To understand the historic role of this sea urchin on the balance between bioerosion and bioacretion, we made a reconstruction of bioerosion impact based on current patterns of carbonate ingestion by the sea urchins, growth rates and skeletal density of the main coral builders, and historical information of sea urchin population density and coral cover. The reconstruction model varied depending on locality. At Cocos Island, the effect on the reef carbonate budget ranged from negative to positive, improving coral recruitment and the recovery of the reef. At Caño Island, there was no apparent effect. In Culebra Bay, the effects ranged from a positive-neutral effect to a negative one, the latter possibly associated with an increase of eutrophic conditions that facilitated bioerosion of the coral framework. The importance of this sea urchin in reef dynamics varies with amount of reef protection, overfishing, and coastal management, and it has a large influence on the <b>carbonate</b> <b>balances</b> of the Pacific Costa Rican coral reefs...|$|R
40|$|The well-exposed Hoogland Member (c. 549 Ma) of the {{northern}} Nama Group (Kuibis Subgroup), Namibia, represents a storm-dominated carbonate ramp developed in a foreland basin of terminal Proterozoic age. The ramp displays facies gradients involving updip grainstones which pass downdip into broad, spatially extensive tracts of microbial laminites and finely laminated mudstones deposited above and below storm wave base. Trough cross-bedded, coarse grainstones are shown to transit downdip into finer-grained calcarenites, irregular microbial laminites and mottled laminites. Siliciclastic siltstones and shales were deposited further downdip. Platform growth was terminated through smothering by orogen-derived siliciclastic deposits. Ramp morphology was controlled by several different processes which acted across many orders of magnitude (millimetres to kilometres), including in situ growth of mats and reefs, scouring by wave-produced currents, and transport and infilling of coarse-grained carbonates and fine-grained carbonates and clastics. At the smallest scale, ‘roughening’ of the sea-floor through heterogeneous trapping and binding by microbial mats was balanced by smoothing of the sea-floor through accumulation of loose sediment to fill the topographic lows within the upward-propagating mat. At the next scale up, parasequence development involved roughening of the sea-floor through shoal growth and grainstone progradation, balanced by sea-floor smoothing through shale infilling of resulting downdip accommodation, {{as well as the}} metre-scale topographic depressions within the mosaic of shoal-water facies. At even larger (sequence/platform) scales, roughening of the sea-floor occurred through aggradation and progradation of thick <b>carbonates,</b> <b>balanced</b> by infilling of the foreland basin with orogen-derived siliciclastic sediments.

40|$|Bioerosion {{is a major}} {{process that}} affects the <b>carbonate</b> <b>balance</b> on coral reefs, and {{excavating}} sponges from the genus Cliona {{are some of the}} most important bioeroders on Caribbean reefs. The orange boring sponge, Cliona delitrix, is an abundant excavating sponge offshore southeast Florida that frequently colonizes dead portions of live stony corals, killing live coral tissue as it grows. With the recent decline in coral cover attributed to combined environmental and anthropogenic stressors, the increasing abundance of excavating sponges poses yet another threat to the persistence of Caribbean coral reefs. In the first part of this study, I explored distributional patterns of C. delitrix offshore southeast Florida and compared yearly sponge growth/corresponding coral tissue loss rates across habitats of different depths. C. delitrix densities and growth rates were significantly higher on the outer reef, where coral colonies also showed some of the fastest tissue retreat rates. More sponge individuals were found on sites with higher coral densities, likely resulting from the higher availability of preferred coral skeleton substrate. C. delitrix showed a clear preference for boulder stony coral species, which could alter the coral community composition in the future and allow an increase in branching and foliose species. The growth rates of C. delitrix offshore southeast Florida are slower compared to rates from other locations, likely a result of intense fouling of the coral-sponge interface by other spatial reef competitors. These results suggest that outer reef sites with high boulder coral density offshore southeast Florida are most vulnerable to C. delitrix colonization and may continue to suffer the greatest impacts of coral bioerosion. Excavating sponges are also strong competitors for space on coral reefs; able to colonize, excavate, and kill entire live stony corals. Despite the known negative effects of excavating sponges on stony corals very few studies have experimentally tested the competitive nature of this interaction. In the second part of this study, I examined the effect of manual removal of the excavating sponge, Cliona delitrix (Pang 1973), on tissue loss of the stony coral Montastrea cavernosa (Linnaeus 1767), and its possibility as a restoration technique. A total of 33 M. cavernosa colonies colonized by small C. delitrix sponges (up to 10 cm in diameter) were examined. Sponges were removed using a hammer and chisel from 22 of the affected colonies, and 11 colonies were left alone as controls. After sponge removal, the resultant cavities in the coral skeletons were filled to minimize future colonization by other bioeroders and promote coral tissue growth over the excavation. Cement was used as fill material on 11 of the colonies, and the remaining 11 cavities were filled with epoxy. Standardized photos of each colony were taken immediately, at 6 months and 12 months after sponge removal. Results show a significant reduction in coral tissue loss in colonies where sponge was removed, and both fill materials performed similarly reducing coral tissue loss. I also found that a majority of experimental corals showed no return of C. delitrix to the colony surface a year after removal. This study demonstrates that eliminating the bioeroding sponge competitor may promote recovery of the affected stony coral. Additionally, the sponge removal technique can be applied to any stony coral colonized by C. delitrix to preserve, or at least slow the loss of, remaining live tissue...|$|E

Although many {{studies have focused on}} large-scale river carbon fluxes, there are few investigations of mechanistic aspects of <b>carbonate</b> mass <b>balance</b> and transport at the catchment scale. We determined elemental and carbonate geochemistry and mass <b>balances</b> for net <b>carbonate</b> dissolution fluxes from the forested, mid-latitude Huron River watershed, established on carbonate-rich unconfined glacial drift aquifers. Shallow groundwaters are near equilibrium with respect to calcite at p CO 2 values up to 25 times atmospheric values. Surface waters are largely groundwater fed and exhibit chemical evolution due to CO 2 degassing, carbonate precipitation in lakes and wetlands, and anthropogenic introduction of road salts (NaCl and CaCl 2). Because the source groundwater Mg 2 + /HCO 3 − ratio is fairly constant, this parameter permits mass balances to be made between carbonate dissolution and back precipitation after groundwater discharge. Typically, precipitation does not occur until IAP/K calcite values exceed 10 times supersaturation. Stream chemistry changes little thereafter even though streams remain highly supersaturated for calcite. Our data taken together with historical United States Geological Survey (USGS) data show that alkalinity losses to carbonate precipitation are most significant during periods of lowest discharge. Thus, on an annual basis, the large carbon flux from carbonate dissolution in soil zones is only decreased by a relatively small amount by the back precipitation of calcium carbonate...|$|R

In addition, the seawater temperature, the irradiance, and the amount and composition of the sediments were determined. The inner and outer reef arcs were compared. CAUs located on the inner reef shelf were under the influence of terrigenous sediments. On the outer reefs, the sediments were composed primarily of marine biogenic carbonates. The mean carbonate production in shallow reefs of Abrolhos was 579 ± 98 g m- 2 y- 1. The builder community was dominated by crustose coralline algae, while the non-builder community was dominated by turf. A marine heat wave was detected during the summer of 2013 - 2014, and the number of consecutive days with a temperature above or below the summer mean was positively correlated with the turf cover increase. The mean carbonate production of the shallow reefs of Abrolhos Bank was greater than the estimated carbonate production measured for artificial structures on several other shallow reefs of the world. The calcimass was higher than the non-calcareous mass, suggesting that the Abrolhos reefs are still in a positive <b>carbonate</b> production <b>balance.</b> Given that marine heat waves produce an increase of turf cover on the shallow reefs of the Abrolhos, a decrease in the cover represented by reef builders and shifting carbonate production are expected in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The {{gradually}} increased atmospheric CO 2 {{partial pressure}} (pCO 2) has thrown the <b>carbonate</b> chemistry off <b>balance</b> {{and resulted in}} decreased seawater pH in marine ecosystem, termed ocean acidification (OA). Anthropogenic OA is postulated to affect the physiology of many marine calcifying organisms. However, the susceptibility and metabolic pathways of change in most calcifying animals are still far from being well understood. In this work, the effects of exposure to elevated pCO 2 were characterized in gills and hepatopancreas of Crassostrea gigas using integrated proteomic and metabolomic approaches. Metabolic responses indicated that high CO 2 exposure mainly caused disturbances in energy metabolism and osmotic regulation marked by differentially altered ATP, glucose, glycogen, amino acids and organic osmolytes in oysters, and the depletions of ATP in gills and the accumulations of ATP, glucose and glycogen in hepatopancreas accounted for the difference in energy distribution between these two tissues. Proteomic responses suggested that OA could not only affect energy and primary metabolisms, stress responses and calcium homeostasis in both tissues, but also influence the nucleotide metabolism in gills and cytoskeleton structure in hepatopancreas. This study demonstrated {{that the combination of}} proteomics and metabolomics could provide an insightful view into the effects of OA on oyster C. gigas. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The gradually increased atmospheric CO 2 partial pressure (pCO 2) has thrown the <b>carbonate</b> chemistry off <b>balance</b> and resulted in decreased seawater pH in marine ecosystem, termed ocean acidification (OA).

The retort water had a neutral pH and an average unfiltered TOC of 2, 900 mg l(- 1). The inorganic composition of the retort water was dominated by NH 4 +. Only 40 % of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the retort water was identifiable, and this was dominated by carboxylic acids.

Objective: In overweight adolescent boys and girls, we aimed to determine the effect of the doubling of habitual calcium intake to the recommended intake from dairy or calcium <b>carbonate</b> on energy <b>balance</b> and purported mechanisms including fecal fat excretion, macronutrient use, and parathyroid hormone suppression. Design: Twenty-five girls with a mean (6 SD) BMI (in kg/m 2) of 33 6 5 and 17 boys with a BMI of 28 6 5, aged 12 – 15 y, partic-ipated in two 3 -wk controlled feeding sessions that used a crossover design in random order as a summer research camp. In one session, 756 mg Ca/d was consumed; in the other session, an additional 650 mg Ca/d was provided as dairy or calcium carbonate supplements that were matched to the control in macronutrient content. Total energy and macronutrient intakes were controlled and were the same for the 2 sessions for each subject. Primary outcome measures were energy balance, fecal fat excretion, lipid oxidation, and post-prandial energy expenditure. Results: There were no effects of quantity or source of calcium on energy or fat balance, despite calcium-induced increases (P, 0. 01) in postprandial serum parathyroid hormone suppression.

40|$|The Gnangara Mound and the {{underlying}} Perth Basin aquifers are the largest source of groundwater for the southwest of Australia, supplying between 35 and 50 % of Perth's potable water (2009 – 2010). However, declining health of wetlands on the Mound coupled with the reduction in groundwater levels from increased irrigation demands and drier climatic conditions means this resource is experiencing increased pressures. The northern Gnangara {{is an area where}} the Yarragadee aquifer occurs at shallow depths (~ 50 m) and is in direct contact with the superficial aquifer, suggesting the possibility of direct recharge into a generally confined aquifer. Environmental isotopes (14 C and 3 H) and hydrochemical modelling were used to assess the presence of a recharge ‘window’ as well as understand the groundwater residence time within different aquifers. Forty-nine groundwater samples were collected from depths ranging from 11 to 311 m below ground surface. The isotopic variation observed in the superficial aquifer was found to be controlled by the different lithologies present, i. e. quartz-rich Bassendean Sand and carbonate-rich sediments of the Ascot Formation. Rainfall recharge into the Bassendean Sand inherits its dissolved inorganic carbon from the soil CO 2. Organic matter throughout the soil profile is degraded by oxidation leading to anoxic/acidic groundwater, which if in contact with the Ascot Formation leads to enhanced dissolution of <b>carbonates.</b> Hydrochemical mass <b>balance</b> modelling showed that carbonate dissolution could contribute 1 – 2 mmol kg− 1 of carbon to groundwaters recharged through the Ascot Formation. The corrected groundwater residence times of the Yarragadee aquifer {{in the northern part of}} the study area ranged from 23 to 35 ka, while waters in the southeastern corner ranged from sub-modern to 2 ka. Groundwater ages increase with distance radiating from the recharge ‘window’. This study delineates a recharge ‘window’ into the commonly presumed confined aquifers of the Perth Basin, highlighting the need for appropriate sustainable management.

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{an approach to}} describe biogeochemical and geobiological processes during carbonate authigenesis at the Kouilou methane seeps on the northern Congo Fan off southwest Africa. The work comprises the analyses of methane derived limestones, the formation of carbonates modified by macroorganisms, and the diagenetic mineralization of vestimentiferan worm tubes. In high agreement with other methane seeps, it could be shown that carbonate formation is initially induced by microbial activity of anaerobic methane oxidizing (AOM) consortia. Aragonite and high-Mg-calcite are the carbonate minerals of these carbonate structures. The principle factors in respect of carbonate formation and mineralogy are i.) methane flux intensity ii.) sulfate concentration and iii.) the aggregation of specific AOM consortia. High methane flux is identified to displace carbonate formation towards the seafloor, and favor, due to chemical and kinetic effects, the formation of aragonite. Highly negative carbon isotopic compositions, nearly seawater equivalent oxygen isotopic compositions and the dominance of ANME - 2 biomarkers are characteristics of these carbonates. High-Mg-calcite carbonates, in contrast, are characterized by more positive carbon isotopic compositions and the dominance of ANME- 1 biomarkers, both a result of moderate methane flux. The positive oxygen isotopic anomalies of the high-Mg-calcites point to reduced seawater access in higher sediment depths, and are very likely {{a result of a}} high proximity to decomposing gas hydrates. The shape of the carbonate structures is directly linked to methane migration and related pathway formation, as well as the subsequent aggregation of AOM consortia. Structures formed within the sediments are of nodular, tubular, or irregularly-complex shape, from which the latter varies highly in size. Structures close to the seafloor are of platy shape, and display, in contrast, rough surfaces and a higher porosity. Modification of carbonate structure formation is observed by benthic bivalves and holothurians. Burrowing activities within the sediments cause seawater infiltration in higher sediment depths and the creation of small-scale niches of highly diverse carbonate chemistry. The assemblage of specific microorganisms and those activities is probably responsible for the local occurrence of protodolomite within some molds. The colonization of chemosymbiotic vestimentiferan tube worms affects carbonate formation conditions in a comprehensive way. Carbonate precipitates occur close to the posterior worm tube which is used as an important metabolism device within the sediment. Tube worms change the chemistry by i.) the uptake of sulfide off the sediment, ii.) the release of sulfate into the sediment and iii.) the release of hydrogen ions. The uptake of sulfide maintains AOM induced carbonate formation and prevents <b>carbonate</b> solution by <b>balancing</b> the pH. Whereas sulfate release, enhances carbonate formation by stimulating the turn over of AOM consortia. Additionally, increasing sulfate concentrations are most likely responsible for the predominant formation of aragonite after tube worm colonization. The elimination of hydrogen ions through the posterior tube prevents carbonate formation directly on the tube surface and avoids a reduction of the respiratory area. This is responsible for the co-occurrence of organic tubes (live), partly (dead) and totally lithified posterior tubes (degraded) within some complex tube worm/carbonate aggregates, formed by tube worm colonies. Nodular high-Mg-calcite carbonates, incorporated within the structures are formed prior to tube worm colonization, and are supposably used for tube fixation. Diagenetic mineralization of posterior vestimentiferan worm tubes finally forms two characteristic mineralization patterns by the carbonate mineral aragonite. The mineralization process starts on the exterior tube and proceeds successively to the interior tube wall. The resulting tube configuration depends on the size and fabric of aragonite crystals. Microcrystalline aragonite crystals do not change the tube wall diameter or its laminar configuration. Whereas tube wall mineralization by inwards growing large-scale aragonite splays results in laminae separation, lateral spreading of the wall and the reduction of the internal tube diameter. Some of the tube walls are rapidly affected by recrystallisation processes. Microcrystalline aragonite crystals get overgrown by radial fibrous aragonite crystals, responsible for the delamination of still unaltered organic laminae and the formation of bulges. Exactly these features were observed in Paleozoic tube fossils, and make it more likely, that these fossil tubes are vestimentiferan...|$|R
