5|$|By 1883, most coins on {{the islands}} were American, due to the close {{economic}} integration between islands and mainland. The laws of Hawaii reflected this, making gold American coins legal tender for an unlimited amount and American silver coins legal tender to $50. In 1879, the kingdom issued its first currency notes, technically <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit,</b> redeemable in silver coin and with denominations ranging from $10 to $500.|$|E
5|$|The central {{government}} soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right {{of several of}} the deposit shops to the issuance of these <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit.</b> By the early 12th century, the amount of banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26million strings of cash coins. By the 1120s the {{central government}} officially stepped in and produced their own state-issued paper money (using woodblock printing). Even before this point, the Song government was amassing large amounts of paper tribute. It was recorded that each year before 1101 AD, the prefecture of Xinan (modern Xi-xian, Anhui) alone would send 1,500,000 sheets of paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng. In that year of 1101, the Emperor Huizong of Song decided to lessen the amount of paper taken in the tribute quota, because it was causing detrimental effects and creating heavy burdens on the people of the region. However, the government still needed masses of paper product for the exchange certificates and the state's new issuing of paper money. For the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories were quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 AD that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day. However, the government issues of paper money were not yet nationwide standards of currency at that point; issues of banknotes were limited to regional zones of the empire, and were valid for use only in a designated and temporary limit of 3-year's time. The geographic limitation changed between the years 1265 and 1274, when the late Southern Song government finally produced a nationwide standard currency of paper money, once its widespread circulation was backed by gold or silver. The range of varying values for these banknotes was perhaps from one string of cash to one hundred at the most. In later dynasties, the use and enforcement of paper currency was a method undertaken by the government {{as a response to the}} counterfeiting of copper coins.|$|E

25|$|Thus a bond {{is a form}} of loan or IOU: {{the holder}} of the bond is the lender (creditor), the issuer of the bond is the {{borrower}} (debtor), and the coupon is the interest. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments, or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure. <b>Certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit</b> (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are considered to be money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is in the length of the term of the instrument.|$|E
25|$|Credit unions offer many of {{the same}} {{financial}} services as banks, but often using a different terminology; common services include share accounts (savings accounts), share draft accounts (checking accounts), credit cards, share term certificates (<b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit),</b> and online banking. Normally, only a member of a credit union may deposit or borrow money. Surveys of customers at banks and credit unions have consistently shown a significantly higher customer satisfaction rate with the quality of service at credit unions. Credit unions have historically claimed to provide superior member service and to be committed to helping members improve their financial situation. In the context of financial inclusion credit unions claim to provide a broader range of loan and savings products at a much cheaper cost to their members than do most microfinance institutions.|$|E
