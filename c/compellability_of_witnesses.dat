40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the practical}} importance of confidentiality and privilege in mediation with {{particular emphasis on}} issues of disclosure of what occurred in a mediation and <b>compellability</b> <b>of</b> mediators in any subsequent litigation. The piece focuses on {{the gap between the}} theory behind confidentiality in mediation – i. e. that it is largely assured in the process – and the reality in which the privacy of mediation, protected by and large by the general without prejudice rules, may be rendered far more porous in practice. The article suggests that mediation would benefit from the statutory development of rules pertaining to confidentiality that undergird the process itself and in this sense analyses two extant provisions that already apply in the UK in relation to cross border mediations, and family mediation in Scotland respectively which could provide a model for more general refor...|$|R
40|$|In 1986 the Australian Law Reform Commission {{found that}} Aboriginal spouses who married {{traditionally}} were compellable witnesses {{against each other}} in criminal trials, despite the privileging of spouses as non‐compellable within the common law. The basis of this was that they were not recognised as husbands and wives according to the laws of evidence. The Commission argued that failure to extend the common law rule of inter‐spousal non‐compellability to traditional spouses gave the impression that the law cared only about the stability of Marriage Act (1961) marriages, despite the continuing importance of traditional marriages. This article traces a debate about the <b>compellability</b> <b>of</b> Aboriginal spouses (wives) back to 1930 s and 40 s Australia. Seeing this as symptomatic of the legal injustices faced by Indigenous people, humanitarians and white women reformers were calling for human rights and legal equality. Now, the Law Reform Commission is arguing that the way to ensure this is to first recognise customary law. Then, reformers came up against a bureaucracy and legal fraternity prepared to recognise neither Indigenous customary law, Indigenous women’s legal equality nor human rights. 16 page(s...|$|R
