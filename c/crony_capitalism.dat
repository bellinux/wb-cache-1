25|$|Shortly {{prior to}} the caucus date, an {{unofficial}} campaign to urge voters to write in Sarah Palin began running radio and television ads in Iowa. The ads argued that Palin is the only candidate who can stop <b>crony</b> <b>capitalism.</b> The final week before the caucus witnessed a surprise surge in the polls for Santorum, who rose from singled digits earlier to 15% behind Paul at 22% and Romney at 24%.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Slovak Republic in January 1993, Slovakia has undergone a transition from a centrally planned economy to a free market economy, a process which some observers were to believe was slowed in the 1994–98 period due to the <b>crony</b> <b>capitalism</b> and other fiscal policies of Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar's government. While economic growth and other fundamentals improved steadily during Mečiar's term, public and private debt and trade deficits also rose, and privatization was uneven. Real annual GDP growth peaked at 6.5% in 1995 but declined to 1.3% in 1999.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Aquino {{joined the}} {{mounting}} calls for Estrada {{to resign from}} office, amid strong allegations of bribery charges and gambling kickbacks {{and a series of}} corruption scandals, which eventually led to his unsuccessful impeachment in December of that year. In her Preface to Frank-Jürgen Richter and Pamela Mar's book Asia's New Crisis, she decries that the unique Asian way of doing business has given rise to much <b>crony</b> <b>capitalism</b> and opacity in Asia, including the Philippines. In January 2001, during the EDSA Revolution of 2001 which ousted Estrada, Aquino enthusiastically supported the ascendancy of another woman, then Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, to power.|$|E
50|$|Given <b>crony</b> <b>capitalism's</b> nature, these dishonest {{business}} practices are frequently (yet not exclusively) found in societies with ineffective legal systems. Consequently, {{there is an}} impetus upon the legislative branch of a government to ensure enforcement of the legal code capable of addressing and redressing private party manipulation of the economy by the involved businessmen and their government cronies.|$|R
40|$|The metonymical {{association}} between 'China’ and 'revolution' is a rhetorical game savoured by contemporary China observers. Ironical references in Western press to Chinese 'consumer revolution 7 and 'pop cultural revolution, made {{a parade of}} global capitalism's victory. Indisputably, vast social, cultural, and economic transformations have swept over China since 1992 when Deng Xiaoping gave his strategic Southern Excursion Talks to salvage a market reform mired in a bottleneck phase. Post- 1992 China witnessed a dramatic release of forces of production and a steady annual GDP growth. Accompanying this economic takeoff is the public's growing craze for consumption. A fully fledged buyers' market has come into being. Chinese consumers, budding desires for music CDs, fast and frozen food, and convertibles may indeed serve to validate the ascendance of a 'counter-revolution' to socialist ideology. Tugging economic and cultural indexes in tandem, Western journalists and pundits have shown us time and again: China illustrates a paramount example of <b>crony</b> <b>capitalism's</b> new conquest...|$|R
25|$|Nationwide protests {{broke out}} against the alleged {{authoritarianism}} of the AKP in 2013, with the party's heavy-handed response receiving international condemnation and stalling the party's once championed EU accession negotiations. Since then, the party has brought about tighter regulations on internet use, abortion and alcohol consumption, having temporarily blocked access to Twitter and YouTube in March 2014. Especially after the government corruption scandal involving several AKP ministers in 2013, the party has been increasingly accused of <b>crony</b> <b>capitalism.</b> The AKP favours a strong centralized leadership, having long advocated a presidential system of government and significantly {{reduced the number of}} elected local government positions in 2013.|$|E
25|$|<b>Crony</b> <b>capitalism</b> was an {{important}} part of American industrialism during this period. Thomas Carnegie, however, was not very adept at it. There is conflicting evidence as to whether he mixed widely in Pittsburgh society, with at least one scholar claiming he did and another that he did not. He was reserved at social gatherings, using his attendance at parties to pick up business gossip and industry buzz. He played cards on a weekly basis with Henry Clay Frick, Philander Knox, Andrew and Richard Mellon, and George Westinghouse. His closest friend was David A. Stewart, a co-partner in the Thomson works, and Stewart readily defended Thomas against the criticisms and jibes of others (particularly Andrew Carnegie).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the rallies {{converging}} on Ayala Avenue {{was characterized by}} the exhaustion of the peculiar <b>crony</b> <b>capitalism</b> that evolved under Marcos' long reign. Following the assassination of Ninoy Aquino nearly a century later in 1983, the downtown area, where the rallies often happened, {{was one of the}} many places of rallies and mass demonstrations that were the basis of the People Power Revolution against the dictatorship of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1986. It was that decade that witnessed the emergence of a so-called moderate opposition, with the Makati Business Club, against Marcos' ailing authoritarian regime. Established in 1980, the MBC, a union of executives from business entities operating in the district, was then a voice of opposition to the dictatorship, {{and it was one of}} the leading organizers of what was then dubbed the Confetti Revolution, so-named due to the yellow confetti from torn phone directories thrown along Ayala Avenue from the buildings in the wide road, whenever the rallies would happen.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{recognizing}} how <b>crony</b> <b>capitalism</b> {{weakened the}} economy due to collusion {{between government and}} big business and adhering to the Catholic social principle of subsidiarity, President Aquino {{set out on a}} course of market liberalization agenda {{while at the same time}} emphasizing solidarity, people empowerment and civic engagement to help alleviate poverty in the country. The Aquino administration also sought to bring back fiscal discipline in order as it aimed to trim down the government's budget deficit that ballooned during Marcos' term through privatization of bad government assets and deregulation of many vital industries. As president, Aquino sought out to dismantle the cartels, monopolies and oligopolies of important industries that were set up by Marcos cronies during the dark days of Martial Law, particularly in the sugar and coconut industries. By discarding these monopolies and allowing market-led prices and competition, small farmers and producers were given a fair chance to sell their produce and products at a more reasonable, competitive and profitable price. This, in a way, also helped a lot in improving the lot of farmers who are in dire need of increasing their personal income and earnings. It was also during Aquino's time that vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act and the Consumer Protection and Welfare Act were enacted.|$|E
