40|$|As a {{consequence}} of migration, family, cultural and landscape markers that map heritage and maintain narratives and representations of continuity are disrupted, and can result in fragmented identity, {{and the loss of}} a sense of place and belonging. This research explores whether in a post-colonial and post-modernist society displacement can be mitigated by the performance of place: imprinting landscape and learning land-culture in personal spaces/places and heritage sites. The point of stability and continuity in a post-colonial context it is proposed can be found in one’s relationship with the landscape/place. My interest is in an embodied experience of the places and landscapes of my heritage in an attempt to work with and through displacement and find an identity that will sustain my living in Australia. This thesis, therefore, intends to make a contribution to the understanding and knowledge of the interdisciplinary studies of migrancy, identity-formation and place-making in the field of Place Studies, with an interwoven arts-practice that expresses an emotional/embodied response to landscape/place experience. I have named the multi-method narrative/experiential, post-qualitative approach as an embodied-kinaesthetic methodology. The implications are that the methods employed have restorative and dynamic capacities as an everyday practice of landscape/place experience in finding belonging and identity as an ongoing practice. The themes that I negotiate focus on landscape/place as the arena where issues of migration, transition and transformation are played out. I explore my heritage as multi-layered: formative and forming of my identity in each of the locations from which my forebears hailed, in Europe, South Africa and Australia, to retrieve snapshots of recorded/archival history and fabricate a new place-story in an embodied performative experience of place-making and identity formation. As I recognise that the processes are contingent and always partial, my interest is in enunciating and testing an approach where the researcher is the researched. The pro-active methods employed include: embodied knowing, visual knowing, and textual/oral knowing and an interwoven arts-practice. My encounters with landscape/place are analysed through the fractal nature of place, with identity and belonging traced thematically in what I call: the Seven Marks of Place: landmarks, placemarks, pathmarks, stretchmarks, <b>crossmarks,</b> stitchmarks and bookmarks; and in the conclusion I discuss benchmarks: where I am up to in my research. Place-story is fabricated/fabric-ated – hyphenated to designate the processes of fabric art and embodied actions that leave an impression beyond the immediate event – with the dual meaning of fabrication: made up and made into, kept open and organic in its interpretation...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} {{the current status of}} a variety of digital standards in medical journals published in Korea in 2016. A total of 256 journals listed as member journals of the Korean Association of Medical Journal Editors were searched to evaluate the following items: an independent journal homepage domain; an e-submission system; the use of digital object identifiers (DOIs), <b>CrossMark,</b> and FundRef; the availability of text and data mining; the presence of Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) information, an open access declaration, and the language of the journal. The search was carried out from July 29 to 30, 2016. Independent journal homepage domains were found for 190 of the 256 journals (74. 1 %). Of the journals, 216 were equipped with an e-submission system (84. 4 %), and 218 journals used DOIs (85. 2 %). <b>CrossMark</b> and FundRef were used in 105 journals (41. 0 %), text and data mining were available for 31 journals (11. 1 %), ORCID identifiers were present in 24 journals (9. 4 %), and an open access declaration according to a Creative Commons license was present for 199 journals (77. 8 %). The number of English-language journals was 130 (50. 8 %). Open access journals and English-language journals were found to have implemented more digital standards than non-open access journals and Korean-language journals respectively. The above results demonstrate that digital standards have been rapidly implemented by a considerable number of medical journals in Korea. In order to facilitate the more active promotion of journals to the international level, more journals should utilize these standards. The use of full-text JATS (journal article tag suite) XML is recommended for the easy adoption of DOIs, <b>CrossMark,</b> FundRef, and ORCID...|$|R

40|$|In {{the final}} vision {{session of the}} 2009 NASIG Annual Conference, Geoffrey Bilder from CrossRef {{discussed}} {{the problem of how}} to identify trustworthy scholarly information on the Internet. This problem is exacerbated by readers’ growing distrust of intermediaries such as publishers and librarians, by the fact that the Internet lacks the traditions that have developed in scholarly communication to ensure trust, and by the sheer amount of information now readily available. Paratext is understood as anything outside of a text that sets expectations about that text. In the past, paratext, for example a publisher logo, provided important clues as to the trustworthiness of information. In the context of the Internet, Bilder suggested creating a meta-brand to serve as paratext. CrossRef is developing a meta-brand called <b>CrossMark</b> that would certify for the reader that the online content to which it is attached has been vetted by processes of scholarly review and is therefore trustworthy...|$|R
40|$|In {{the era of}} {{information}} technology, scholarly journals cannot escape {{the rising tide of}} technological advancement. To be exposed more easily to readers, the web forms of scholarly journals and articles become more important year after year. Furthermore, there is a trend of print journals closing, and a significant emergence of online journals. Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) extensible markup language (XML) became an National Information Standards Organization standard language in online journal publishing in 2012. It is an essential format to present readers with a more user-friendly interface. JATS XML was developed by PubMed Central (PMC) XML, which was a deposit form of articles to PMC. Editors and other publishing-related personnel should be able to understand the concept and production process of XML files. When JATS XML is produced, a variety of web presentation views can be generated, such as PubReader and epub 3. 0. Further, JATS XML can be easily converted to digital object identifier CrossRef XML, <b>CrossMark</b> XML, and FundRef XML. Small scholarly society journal editors and publishers can promote the visibility of their journals by depositing JATS XML files to PMC or ScienceCentral. Owing to these benefits of JATS XML, publishers and editors should now adopt JATS XML for journal publishing...|$|R
40|$|FrancophonesCanadaOfficial-Language MinoritiesHealth Care UsageWe test Landry's (2012) ethno-linguistic {{community}} development {{model in the}} context of Canadian Francophone minorities, using two social responses as indicators of social development. These minorities are spread over 12 Canadian Provinces and Territories and represent a broad spectrum of minority levels. The social responses are the offer and the demand for health care services in French and they are derived from Statistics Canada's 2006 Survey on the Vitality of Official-Language Minorities. As predicted by Landry, we observe a strong association between the two social responses and the Francophones/Anglophones linguistic vitality ratio. A phase diagram analysis indicates that minorities have more control over local model dynamics whereas the majority has more control over global model constraints. This suggests practical lessons for fostering the development of minority communities. Giguere, L., & Power, S. (2015).

40|$|OBJECTIVES The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{prognostic}} value and attainability of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) Levels in young and elderly acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients. 0 <b>CrossMark</b> BACKGROUND Less-effective NT-proBNP-guided therapy in chronic heart failure (HF) has been reported in elderly patients. Whether this can be attributed to differences in prognostic value of NT-proBNP or to differences in attaining a prognostic value is unclear. The authors studied this question in ADHF patients. METHODS Our study population comprised 7 ADHF cohorts. We defined absolute (30 %, > 50 %, and > 70 %). Six-month all-cause mortality after discharge was studied for each level in Cox regression analyses, and compared between elderly (age > 75 years) and young patients (age 75 years of age) was studied. Admission levels of NT-proBNP were significantly higher in elderly versus younger patients. The prognostic value of absolute and relative NT-proBNP levels was similar in elderly and young patients. Attainability was significantly lower in elderly patients for all absolute levels and a > 50 % relative reduction, but not for > 30 % and > 70 %. For absolute levels, attainability differences between age groups were decreased to a large extent after correction for admission NT-proBNP and anemia at discharge. For relative levels, attainability differences disappeared after correction for HF etiology and anemia at discharge. CONCLUSIONS In young and elderly ADHF patients, it is not the prognostic value of absolute and relative NT-proBNP levels that is different, but the attainability of these levels that is lower in the elderly. This can largely be attributed to factors other than age. 2016 by the American College of Cardiology Foundatio...|$|R
