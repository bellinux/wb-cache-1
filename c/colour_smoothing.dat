40|$|Abstract In {{industrial}} {{quality inspection}} of colour texture surfaces, such as ceramic tiles or fabrics, {{it is important}} to maintain a consistent colour shade or tonality during pro-duction. We present a multidimensional histogram method using a novelty detection scheme to inspect the surfaces. The image noise, introduced by the imaging system, is found mainly to affect the chromatic channels. For colour tonality inspection, the difference between images is very subtle and comparison in the noise dominated chromatic channels is er-ror prone. We perform vector-ordered <b>colour</b> <b>smoothing</b> and extract a localised feature vector at each pixel. The resulting histogram represents an encapsulation of local and global information. Principal component analysis (PCA) is per-formed on this multidimensional feature space of an auto-matically selected reference image to obtain reliable colour shade features, which results in a reference eigenspace. Then unseen product images are projected onto this eigenspace and compared for tonality defect detection using histogram comparison. The proposed method is compared and evalu-ated on a data set with groundtruth...|$|E
