5000|$|Piston {{rings are}} subject to wear as they {{move up and down}} the {{cylinder}} bore due to their own inherent load and due to the gas load acting on the ring. To minimize this, they are made of wear-resistant materials, such as cast iron and steel, and are coated or treated to enhance the wear resistance. Two-stroke port design is critical to ring life. Newer modern motorcycle manufacturers have many single function but serrated ports to retain the ring. Typically, top ring and oil control rings will be coated with chromium, or Nitrided, possibly plasma sprayed [...] or have a PVD (physical vapour deposition) ceramic coating. For enhanced scuff resistance and further improved wear, most modern diesel engines have top rings coated with a modified <b>chromium</b> <b>coating</b> known as CKS or GDC, a patent coating from Goetze which has aluminium oxide or diamond particles respectively included in the chrome surface. The lower oil control ring is designed to leave a lubricating oil film, a few micrometres thick on the bore, as the piston descends. Three piece oil rings, i.e. with two rails and one spacer, are used for four-stroke gasoline engines.|$|E

In the initial {{part of the}} reactions in the oxidation process, carbon atoms combined with chromium on the outer part of the coating layer react with the oxygen in air, effectively up to 120 min. After that, the chromium atoms react with oxygen {{in the air and}} produce Cr 2 O 3 phase on the coating layer. The higher the temperature and the longer the treatment time, the more the Cr 2 O 3 phases became. The kinetic study was realized for the reactions of carbon and chromium with oxygen, individually. The kinetic study of oxidation was calculated by weight changing of the coated samples at the temperatures of 973 K, 1073 K and 1273 K up to 720 min.
