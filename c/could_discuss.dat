5|$|A second county {{bill was}} passed by the 1903 {{legislature}} and approved by Governor Dole, forming Maui County and four other counties on the main Hawaiian Islands. The first local territorial elections for the county boards of Maui and the other counties were held on November3. In this election, White ran as the Home Rule candidate for Sheriff of Maui County and defeated the Republican candidate Lincoln M. Baldwin, who had held the previously appointed position of sheriff. The Home Rule Party ended up dominating in the local elections on Maui. Shortly after his election, White and David Haili Kahaulelio, the elected county clerk for Maui, wrote to Dole's successor, Governor George R. Carter, asking him to assemble a conference where the newly elected county officials across the territory <b>could</b> <b>discuss</b> how the county governments should be conducted.|$|E
25|$|As a pacifist Quaker, Penn {{considered}} {{the problems of}} war and peace deeply. He developed a forward-looking project for a United States of Europe through the creation of a European Assembly made of deputies that <b>could</b> <b>discuss</b> and adjudicate controversies peacefully. He is therefore {{considered the}} very first thinker to suggest the creation of a European Parliament.|$|E

25|$|Robertson was {{contemptuous of}} the House Grey Memorandum (early 1916) and of President Woodrow Wilson’s offer to mediate in May 1916. Robertson and Hankey were sent {{from the room}} on 24 May 1916 so the {{politicians}} <b>could</b> <b>discuss</b> the offer, and McKenna (Exchequer) later told Hankey that he, Asquith, Grey and Balfour, but not Bonar Law or Lloyd George, had been in favour of accepting because of “the black financial outlook”. The plan was stopped when the entire Army Council, including Kitchener and Robertson, threatened to resign.|$|E
25|$|WBI {{has four}} major {{strategies}} to approach development problems: innovation for development, knowledge exchange, leadership and coalition building, and structured learning. World Bank Institute(WBI) was {{formerly known as}} Economic Development Institute (EDI), established on 11 March 1955 {{with the support of}} the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. The purpose of the institute was to serve as provide an open place where senior officials from developing countries <b>could</b> <b>discuss</b> development policies and programs. Over the years, EDI grew significantly and in 2000, the Institute was renamed as the World Bank Institute. Currently Sanjay Pradhan is the Vice President of the World Bank Institute.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of UNCTAD in 1964 {{was based on}} concerns of developing countries over the international market, multi-national corporations, and great disparity between developed nations and developing nations. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was established to provide a forum where the developing countries <b>could</b> <b>discuss</b> the problems relating to their economic development. The organisation grew from the view that existing institutions like GATT (now replaced by the World Trade Organization, WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank were not properly organized to handle the particular problems of developing countries. Later, in the 1970s and 1980s, UNCTAD was {{closely associated with the}} idea of a New International Economic Order (NIEO).|$|E

25|$|Goldhaber was in {{high demand}} as a speaker at {{scientific}} conferences due to her mastery of her field, and her ability to express herself beautifully. Goldhaber gave a seminal talk at the 1965 Rochester Conference that marked the transition from cosmic ray based experiments to particle accelerator base experiments {{in the study of}} strange particles. In the fall of 1965 the Goldhabers took a sabbatical to travel around the world visiting high energy laboratories and giving lectures. They first stopped at Oxford for the biennial European conference on high energy physics, and then CERN so that Goldhaber <b>could</b> <b>discuss</b> methods of making automatic film measurements with Berkeley's Hough-Powell device. The Goldhabers then traveled to Ankara to lecture, and spent a month at the Weizmann Institute in preparation for the lectures Sulamith was to give in Madras, India.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of the {{original}} Star Wars (1977), series creator George Lucas hired science fiction author Leigh Brackett to write the sequel with him. They held story conferences and, by late November 1977, Lucas had produced a handwritten treatment. The treatment is similar to the final film, except that Vader does not reveal he is Luke's father. In the first draft that Brackett would write from this, Luke's father appears as a ghost to instruct Luke. Lucas was disappointed with the script, but Brackett died of cancer before he <b>could</b> <b>discuss</b> it with her. With no writer available, Lucas had to write the next draft himself. In this draft, he made use of a new plot twist: Vader claiming to be Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the year-long struggles writing the first film.|$|E
25|$|Laake reached {{minister}} Ljungberg {{by telephone}} at 0200hrs and discussed mobilizing the army. Laake suggested mobilizing the 1st to the 4th Brigades of the army, meaning {{most of the}} forces ready for mobilization in Eastern, Southern and Western Norway. This was the most wide-ranging of the mobilization alternatives that Laake had proposed on 8 April. Ljungberg quickly received approval from the government, and relayed the message to Laake. The government had agreed with a mobilization and left it to the military {{to decide on the}} details. After the telephone conversation, an argument quickly broke out between Laake and Hatledal. Hatledal viewed the mobilization in question was inadequate and wanted a total and open mobilization, rather than the silent and partial mobilization by mail that Laake was organizing. Laake stated that if Hatledal wanted an open mobilization then he <b>could</b> <b>discuss</b> it with minister Ljungberg when the minister arrived at the general staff at Akershus Fortress.|$|E

25|$|Causes for {{the high}} female {{dismissal}} rate were studied at Jimma University. Students re-admitted in 2007-08 and staff completed questionnaires and took part in focus groups. Only 37% of female students had been taught by female teachers. The advantages of having female teachers were that female teachers were better than male teachers at understanding their problems, they could share their experiences of the challenges they had to overcome, they <b>could</b> <b>discuss</b> their problems freely and find solutions. In class, female students felt free to ask and answer questions and female teachers showed them {{that it was possible}} for them to attain higher levels if they worked hard like men. Only 27% of female students had received assertiveness training. However, female students had received informal orientation advice from senior female students in their first year. Lack of assertiveness training encourages female students to feel inferior about their abilities and to lack confidence in speaking up when conflict arises. This contributes to low achievement, dismissal and dropping out. Feelings of powerlessness make them dependent on others such as male students. Some students (46%) had not chosen their university and 74.1% had not chosen their department. The former increased homesickness when they were too far away to visit their parents, and the latter reduced interest in the university and in attending lessons. There was a guidance and counseling service but only 22% of students were aware of its existence and none had attended. Poor time management could be another reason for dropping out. When female students first arrived, their time was wasted by male students repeatedly trying to start love affairs. If a love affair did start, it was the man who decided when they would meet so interrupting the woman's studies. The women agreed with the man's decisions to maintain the relationship and avoid losing the academic benefits the relationship provided. Many students were from poor families and could not afford necessities for education and university life. They might try to resolve their economic difficulties through high risk sexual activity. There was widespread sexual harassment and discrimination from male students and, sometimes, male teachers. Both consensual and non-consensual sex could result in HIV, pregnancy and drop out.|$|E

Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal. The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season. Soon after Liverpool lost 2–1 to non-league Worcester City in the 1958–59 FA Cup, Bill Shankly was appointed manager.

[...] Blassingame {{asserts that the}} most significant instance revolved around Protestant Christianity (primarily Baptist and Methodist churches): [...] "The number of blacks who received religious instruction in antebellum white churches is significant because the church was the only institution other than the plantation which {{played a major role}} in acculturating the slave." [...] Christianity and enslaved black ministers slowly replaced African religious survivals and represented another aspect of slave culture which the slaves used to create their own communities.

500|$|There {{has been}} a {{difference}} between Marine Le Pen's and her father's views concerning the Holocaust and Jews.

Jean-Marie Le Pen received fines for this sentence, Bruno Gollnisch was found not guilty by the Court of Cassation.

500|$|Washington, Jefferson, and James Madison, then a {{representative}} from Virginia, all supported a permanent capital on the Potomac; Hamilton backed a temporary capital in New York City, and a permanent one in Trenton, New Jersey. At the same time, Hamilton's funding proposal, a plan in which {{the federal government would}} assume debts incurred by states in waging the Revolutionary War was failing to garner enough support to pass. Jefferson, understanding that Hamilton needed southern votes to pass his funding plan, and keenly aware that the Potomac capital concept would fail without additional northern support, made use of an opportunity provided by a chance encounter with Hamilton to an informal dinner meeting at which interested parties <b>could</b> <b>discuss</b> a [...] "mutual accommodation." [...] The deal subsequently struck, known as the Compromise of 1790, cleared the way for passage, in July 1790, of the Residence Act. The act transferred the federal capital to Philadelphia for 10 years, while a permanent capital along the Potomac was under construction. Hamilton's debt assumption plan became law {{with the passage of the}} Funding Act of 1790.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, footage taken from the [...] "No Russian" [...] level was leaked on the Internet.

The Daily Telegraph Tom Hoggins felt that while he could not properly judge the level without having played it, he still questioned whether Infinity Ward had approached the level from the wrong direction by letting the player use grenades to [...] "treat these civilians as human bowling pins". Writing for The Guardian, Keith Stuart criticized the skip feature, describing it as a [...] "cop-out" [...] for a level that the developer intended players to experience. Jim Sterling of Destructoid however was fully supportive of the level, as he thought that it was a statement that video games <b>could</b> <b>discuss</b> controversial topics, which he felt that many developers would often shy away from.
