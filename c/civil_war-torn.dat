The eponymous Madlax is a legendary mercenary and assassin in the fictional <b>civil</b> <b>war-torn</b> country of Gazth-Sonika, who cannot remember her past or indeed her real name before twelve years ago, when the war started. The other main character is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner Margaret and her mother were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who led the rescuers, have been missing ever since.

5000|$|Here {{also was}} the old second {{building}} of the famous Maryland Institute (then a college founded 1826, of various curriculums including mechanical arts besides today's art and design {{for which it is}} now world-famous), which was built on brick arches above a second markethouse with two large clock towers at each end in 1851, and held an additional large assembly hall/auditorium and classrooms on the second floor. This was {{one of the largest and}} notable buildings in America at that time, and was the site of several pre-Civil War national political party conventions (when Baltimore preceded Chicago as the common compromise city for presidential nominations, where both candidates Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce were nominated to be President. Another famous President, Abraham Lincoln gave his [...] "Liberty Speech" [...] (also known as the [...] "Baltimore Address") on April 18, 1864, at the [...] "Sanitary Fair" [...] event, one of several held throughout the <b>Civil</b> <b>War-torn</b> nation, to raise money for the support and assistance of wounded soldiers, widows and orphans and other domestic needs by the United States Sanitary Commission, (a precursor to the later American Red Cross). Although he passed through Baltimore numerous times, it was the only occasion that the 16th President spoke in the city. He noted the calmer differences in the southern-oriented city, especially then three years after the secessionist tumult resulting in the disastrous Pratt Street Riots of April 19, 1861 which had solidified Baltimore's reputation and nickname as [...] "Mobtown". It was also the only time that he spoke alive in the city although having traveled through several times in his earlier brief congressional career and presidential administration. The Maryland Institute and the second markethouse below was unfortunately destroyed and lost near the end of the Great Baltimore Fire of February 7-8, 1904, on the eastern edge of the blaze along with the rest of the downtown Baltimore business district in the Nation's third largest conflagration ever to hit an American city (Chicago's Great Fire of 1871 was first, followed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire).|$|E
40|$|On August 17, Sri Lanka’s 15 million strong {{electorate}} went to {{the national}} polls {{for the second time}} this year. Among analysts, {{there is no doubt that}} this was not only a ‘popular vote’, which decided over the new composition of the country’s 225 -seat-parliament, it was also a referendum regarding the basic nature of Sri Lanka’s political culture. Furthermore it was a choice of destiny over the future course of national reconciliation, the need for political revamping to fix political-administrative aberrations, and the pledge of the minorities in a <b>civil</b> <b>war-torn</b> country. More concretely, it was a decision whether the authoritarian strongman and former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa representing the vision of a ‘strong state’ based on an extreme, ethnic exclusive brand of nationalism, should be allowed to return to power or not. In sharp contrast, there was the alternative option to continue the notion of democratic political reforms and inclusive, consensual-based politics in order to improve good governance in multi-ethnic and multi-religious Sri Lanka- despite the fact that it started slow and tenacious – personified in President Maithripala Sirisena and incumbent Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

40|$|James Abijah Brooks (1855 - 1944) {{was one of}} {{the four}} Great Captains in Texas Ranger history, others {{including}} Bill McDonald, John Hughes, and John Rogers. Over the years historians have referred to the captain as “John” Brooks, because he tended to sign with his initials, but also because W. W. Sterling’s classic Trails and Trials of a Texas Ranger mistakenly named him as Captain John Brooks. Born and raised in <b>Civil</b> <b>War-torn</b> Kentucky, a reckless adventurer on the American and Texas frontier, and a quick-draw Texas Ranger captain who later turned in his six-shooter to serve as a county judge, Brooks’s life reflects the raucous era of {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth-century American West. As a Texas Ranger, Brooks participated in the high profile events of his day, from the fence-cutting wars to the El Paso prizefight, from the Conner Fight–where he lost three fingers from his left hand–to the Temple rail strike, all with a resolute demeanor and a fast gun. A shoot-out in Indian Territory nearly cost him his life and then jeopardized his career, and a lifelong bout with old Kentucky bourbon did the same. With three other distinguished Ranger captains, Brooks witnessed and helped promote the transformation of the elite Frontier Battalion into the Ranger Force. As a state legislator, he brokered the creation of a South Texas county that bears his name today, and where he served for twenty-eight years as county judge. He was the quintessential enforcer of frontier justice, scars and all...|$|E
40|$|Post-conflict {{reconstruction}} and development is a challenge for many <b>civil</b> <b>war-torn</b> countries. The commonly used {{reconstruction and}} development strategies such as peace building provide temporary relief {{from the effects of}} war but fail to address the long-term issue of economic development of a country. Scholars are now recognising that entrepreneurship is the solution to sustainable post-conflict reconstruction and economic development. Local entrepreneurship provides employment opportunities, sustains livelihoods and reduces poverty. Most importantly entrepreneurship creates employment opportunities for ex-combatants’ reintegration into civil society. This research contributes to the literature on post-conflict {{reconstruction and development}}. It focuses on post-conflict Bougainville in Papua New Guinea. Entrepreneurs seem to be driving the economic reconstruction of post-conflict Bougainville. However, entrepreneurship and development seem to be occurring only in North Bougainville, while South Bougainville remains marginalised. In addition, many South Bougainvilleans entrepreneurs are migrating from their homes to North Bougainville in order to establish businesses. The study looks at the factors or motivation behind this phenomenon. The research used mixed methods research which consisted of a survey questionnaire for the quantitative component and in-depth interviews for its qualitative component. The survey questionnaire was conducted on a sample of Bougainville entrepreneurs, while the sample for the in-depth interviews comprised South Bougainville entrepreneurs. The research was conducted in the Buka and Kokopau towns of North Bougainville. Data from the survey questionnaire was analysed using SPSS. An inductive reasoning approach was used to analyse qualitative data for emerging themes. Analysis showed that market size, proximity to government services and transport infrastructure are some motivational factors attracting South Bougainvillean entrepreneurs to Buka and Kokopau. The result also shows ‘push factors’. The lack of employment opportunities is pushing people into entrepreneurship. Security is also shown to be important factor in determining the business location. The main constraint businesses face is lack of funds or access to funding. Another problem for the Bougainville-owned retail businesses is the Chinese-owned shops whose cheaper prices are driving the Bougainvilleans out of business. In conclusion, the research emphasises that in order to encourage entrepreneurship the following factors need to be addressed: building transport infrastructure; establishing security; and providing funding. Future research needs to focus on how to stimulate entrepreneurship in South Bougainville...|$|E
40|$|After the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States launched a "war on terror" to retaliate against the perpetrators of these attacks. As a consequence, the Bush Administration launched a military campaign against Iraq, and end up occupying the country. To rationalize its military action, especially when the stated justification for the occupation, searching and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, proven to be bogus, and after five years of failure in capturing and bringing into trial the actual perpetrators of the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration shifted its propaganda toward creating a new Middle East by building a new and democratic Iraq that will serve as model and permeates its democratic experiments to other countries in the region. When Bush's democracy façade evaporated {{with the collapse of the}} experiment in Iraq and the emerging of a failed, violent, and <b>civil</b> <b>war-torn</b> Iraq, the administration shifted its attempt toward blaming Islam for the problem and faulting it as the source of the conflict and the obstacle for progress. In doing so, the administration began to depart from the traditional fact-based policy in the United States and utilize a utopian faith-based political approach toward world conflicts. In this utopian world, facts are irrelevant, and reality is reconstructed in order to serve a political ideology. The world itself then is divided into two camps, those who are with the new reconstructed reality, and those who are against it. Within this clash of civilizations, history ends and the war on terror begins in order to redraw the map of the world and America's leadership in it in directing its crusade against "the others. " This paper examines the ideological significance and impact of the Bush crusade and its utopian faith-based foreign policy. The examination will focus on the policy's categorization of the world according to "us versus them", and shifting the blame toward Islam as a fascist ideology in order to justify the current war in Iraq and the possible future war with Iran. It will also look at this crusade and its political resurrection of an outdated and outmoded medieval practice and belief that demonstrated its fatality and ill notion when deposited to the trash bins of history.
