40|$|<b>Cetocycline</b> (formerly chelocardin or cetotetrine) is {{structurally}} {{related to}} the tetracyclines. It {{was found to be}} more active than tetracycline against many clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, but is less active against staphylococci, and has no activity against Pseudomonas. It is bactericidal against susceptible enteric gram-negative bacteria at concentrations two to four times higher than the minimal inhibiting concentrations. The drug is highly lipid soluble; more than 80 % is bound to serum, and it is more avidly taken up by susceptible bacteria than tetracycline. A direct correlation between drug uptake and susceptibility of bacteria was not noted, except with a strain of Proteus vulgaris...|$|E
