50|$|Above is {{the basic}} {{building}} block of a carry-select adder, where the block size is 4. Two 4-bit ripple carry adders are multiplexed together, where the resulting carry and sum bits are selected by the <b>carry-in.</b> Since one ripple carry adder assumes a <b>carry-in</b> of 0, and the other assumes a <b>carry-in</b> of 1, selecting which adder had the correct assumption via the actual <b>carry-in</b> yields the desired result.|$|E

5000|$|For {{all but a}} few shows a season, {{tables are}} set up in the pit and lower part of the {{orchestra}} section. Tables seat six, and all six tickets must be purchased together. Those who do not purchase table seats are allowed to bring in tray-sized tables. Also for the table setup shows, food and drinks, including alcohol, are allowed to be brought in for consumption. Elaborate setups with nice food, tablecloths and candles are common. However, there are a small number of shows each season with a [...] "rock" [...] setup. Here there are no tables or <b>carry-ins.</b> Instead of tables in the pit, only rows of chairs are set up. Parking is limited, and traffic can be heavy on nights when the show is sold out.|$|R

50|$|The carry-select adder {{generally}} {{consists of}} two ripple carry adders and a multiplexer. Adding two n-bit numbers with a carry-select adder is done with two adders (therefore two ripple carry adders). In order to perform the calculation twice, one time with the assumption of the <b>carry-in</b> being zero and the other assuming it will be one. After the two results are calculated, the correct sum, {{as well as the}} correct carry-out, is then selected with the multiplexer once the correct <b>carry-in</b> is known.|$|E
5000|$|For each operand input bit pair [...] the propagate-conditions [...] are {{determined}} using an XOR-Gate (see [...] ). When all propagate-conditions are true, then the <b>carry-in</b> bit [...] determines the carry-out bit.|$|E
50|$|Subtractors {{are usually}} {{implemented}} within a binary adder {{for only a}} small cost when using the standard two's complement notation, by providing an addition/subtraction selector to the <b>carry-in</b> and to invert the second operand.|$|E

50|$|The lake has {{no public}} boat launch, {{although}} parking {{at the state}} park can allow <b>carry-in</b> boats, sailboats, kayaks and other small boats. The lake has restricted hours that allow for boats to go above 10 mph, but has no horsepower limit.|$|E
50|$|A potluck is a {{gathering}} where each guest contributes {{a different and}} unique dish of food, often homemade, to be shared. Synonyms include: potluck dinner, spread, Jacob's join, Jacob's supper, faith supper, covered dish supper, dish party, bring and share, shared lunch, pitch-in, bring-a-plate, dish-to-pass, fuddle, and <b>carry-in.</b>|$|E
50|$|The summands {{are reduced}} using a common 1-bit full adder that accepts two 1-bit terms and a <b>carry-in</b> bit. It {{produces}} a sum and a carry-out. The full adders are arranged {{such that the}} sum remains in the same column of summands, but the carry-out is shifted left. In each round of reduction, three bits in a single column are used as the two terms and <b>carry-in</b> for the full adder, producing a single sum bit for the column. This reduces the bits in the column {{by a factor of}} 3. However, the column to the right will shift over carry-out bits, increasing the bits in the column by a third of the number of rows of summands. At worst, the reduction will be 2/3 the number of rows per round of reduction.|$|E
50|$|Breaking {{this down}} into more {{specific}} terms, {{in order to}} build a 4-bit carry-bypass adder, 6 full adders would be needed. The input buses would be a 4-bit A and a 4-bit B, with a <b>carry-in</b> (CIN) signal. The output would be a 4-bit bus X and a carry-out signal (COUT).|$|E
50|$|There is a 750 ha provincial park reserve at Lake Charlotte {{that offers}} backcountry hiking and camping, <b>carry-in</b> and boat launch {{potential}} and winter recreation.

5000|$|The Kettle River is a {{destination}} for canoeing and kayaking. Within the park there are two <b>carry-in</b> access points and two boat ramps. Much of the river is Class I, with portages around the rapids. [...] Fishing is also available along the Kettle River, which has held and produced state-record sturgeon.|$|E
50|$|Above is {{an example}} of a Kogge-Stone adder with sparsity-4. Elements {{eliminated}} by sparsity shown marked with transparency. As shown, power and area of the carry generation is improved significantly, and routing congestion is substantially reduced. Each generated carry feeds a multiplexer for a carry select adder or the <b>carry-in</b> of a ripple carry adder.|$|E
50|$|The park offers hiking along a {{mountain}} brook with a waterfall, {{fishing in the}} Ramapo River, Scarlet Oak Pond, MacMillan Reservoir, and tent camping. Trails connect to the network of trails in the adjoining state forest and state park. The park also affords <b>carry-in</b> access to the Ramapo River for canoe, kayak and raft owners.|$|E
5000|$|The n-bit-carry-skip adder {{consists}} of a n-bit-carry-ripple-chain, a n-input AND-gate and one multiplexer.Each propagate bit , that {{is provided by the}} carry-ripple-chain is connected to the n-input AND-gate. The resulting bit is used as the select bit of a multiplexer that switches either the last carry-bit [...] or the <b>carry-in</b> [...] to the carry-out signal [...]|$|E
50|$|A 16-bit carry-select adder with {{a uniform}} block size of 4 {{can be created}} with three of these blocks and a 4-bit ripple carry adder. Since <b>carry-in</b> is known at the {{beginning}} of computation, a carry select block is not needed for the first four bits. The delay of this adder will be four full adder delays, plus three MUX delays.|$|E
50|$|Police {{protection}} {{within the}} park {{is provided by the}} park's Law Enforcement Ranger staff and local Maine IF&W Wardens. Fire protection provided by the Maine Forest Service; waste disposal and recycling is addressed through the park's <b>Carry-In,</b> Carry-Out policy. Maintenance is done by the many volunteer workers and paid employees of the park. The current Park Director is Jensen Bissell.|$|E
50|$|Serial binary {{addition}} {{is done by}} a flip-flop and a full adder. The flip-flop {{takes the}} carry-out signal on each clock cycle and provides its value as the <b>carry-in</b> signal on the next clock cycle. After all of the bits of the input operands have arrived, all of the bits of the sum {{have come out of}} the sum output.|$|E
50|$|Signal Hill {{was once}} a {{seasonal}} camp for paleo-Americans who settled the Neponset River Valley after the last glacial retreat. It is currently abutted by industrial and suburban land {{to the east and}} river floodplain to the west. The preserve is open to non-motorized <b>carry-in</b> boating, hiking, picnicing, fishing, and similar pursuits. A trailhead is located on University Road in Canton.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{instruction}} is register-to-register, a different extension word is used. This includes a [...] "ZC" [...] flag which suppresses <b>carry-in</b> (useful for instructions like DADD which always use the carry bit), and a repeat count. A 4-bit {{field in the}} extension word encodes either a repeat count (0-15 repetitions {{in addition to the}} initial execution), or a register number which contains a 4-bit repeat count.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles {{are charged}} an {{entrance}} fee, however pedestrians may enter for free through several gates along the park's perimeter. A permit {{is required for}} horseback riding within the park. The park is a <b>carry-in</b> carry-out facility, as there are no garbage bins along the trails. Additionally there are no picnic facilities or play areas for children. Anglers possessing proper permits may fish for brook, brown, and rainbow trout within the park.|$|E
50|$|The serial binary adder or bit-serial adder is {{a digital}} circuit that {{performs}} binary addition bit by bit. The serial full adder has three single-bit inputs for {{the numbers to}} be added and the carry in. There are two single-bit outputs for the sum and carry out. The <b>carry-in</b> signal is the previously calculated carry-out signal. The addition is performed by adding each bit, lowest to highest, one per clock cycle.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a 4-bit Kogge-Stone adder {{is shown in the}} diagram. Each {{vertical}} stage produces a [...] "propagate" [...] and a [...] "generate" [...] bit, as shown. The culminating generate bits (the carries) are produced in the last stage (vertically), and these bits are XOR'd with the initial propagate after the input (the red boxes) to produce the sum bits. E.g., the first (least-significant) sum bit is calculated by XORing the propagate in the farthest-right red box (a [...] "1") with the <b>carry-in</b> (a [...] "0"), producing a [...] "1". The second bit is calculated by XORing the propagate in second box from the right (a [...] "0") with C0 (a [...] "0"), producing a [...] "0".|$|E
50|$|Nolte State Park is a 117 acre Washington {{state park}} located 6 mi {{northeast}} of Enumclaw and {{just south of}} Cumberland at {{the western edge of}} the Cascade Mountains, with 7174 ft of shoreline on Deep Lake near the Green River Gorge. The property was a resort for many years before it was donated to the state by Minnie Nolte in the early 1970s. There are rainbow trout, coastal cutthroat trout, kokanee, crappie, and brown bullhead in the lake. The lake has a public fishing pier, beach area, and a hiking trail around the lake. The boat launch is <b>carry-in</b> only with limited parking. Deep Lake has a surface area of 39 acre and reaches a depth of 76 ft.|$|E
50|$|Enhancements to the {{original}} implementation include increasing the radix and sparsity of the adder. The radix of the adder refers to how many results from the previous level of computation are used to generate the next one. The original implementation uses radix-2, although it's possible to create radix-4 and higher. Doing so increases the power and delay of each stage, but reduces the number of required stages. The sparsity of the adder refers to how many carry bits are generated by the carry-tree. Generating every carry bit is called sparsity-1, whereas generating every other is sparsity-2 and every fourth is sparsity-4. The resulting carries are then used as the <b>carry-in</b> inputs for much shorter ripple carry adders or some other adder design, which generates the final sum bits. Increasing sparsity reduces the total needed computation and can {{reduce the amount of}} routing congestion.|$|E
50|$|The City of Monticello and Wright County have partnered in {{an effort}} to acquire 1,200 acres of open space in Wright County, known as the Bertram Chain of Lakes. The 1,200 acres of the Bertram Chain of Lakes {{property}} represents 4 lakes, acres of undisturbed shoreline, natural habitat, and oak forest. Currently, the park features 812 acres open for public enjoyment. The park provides users access to 4 miles of hiking trails, 10 miles of single track mountain biking trails, beach at Bertram Lake for swimming , and <b>carry-in</b> access to Long Lake which allow the opportunity to paddle Long, Mud and First Lakes. Winter activities include fat-biking, snow shoeing, cross country skiing, and the Frostbite Days Fishing Contest in January. Summer activities include paddle board classes, canoeing excursions, kids fishing programs, guided moonlight hiking, and more.|$|E
5000|$|In most computers, the carry {{from the}} most {{significant}} bit of an arithmetic operation (or bit shifted out from a shift operation) is placed in a special carry bit {{which can be used}} as a <b>carry-in</b> for multiple precision arithmetic or tested and used to control execution of a computer program. The same carry bit is also generally used to indicate borrows in subtraction, though the bit's meaning is inverted due to the effects of two's complement arithmetic. Normally, a carry bit value of [...] "1" [...] signifies that an addition overflowed the ALU, and must be accounted for when adding data words of lengths greater than that of the CPU. For subtractive operations, two (opposite) conventions are employed as most machines set the carry flag on borrow while some machines (such as the 6502 and the PIC) instead reset the carry flag on borrow (and vice versa).|$|E
