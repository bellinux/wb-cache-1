Heavy crude oil has been defined as any liquid petroleum with an API gravity less than 20°. Physical properties that differ between heavy crude oils and lighter grades include higher viscosity and specific gravity, as well as heavier molecular composition.

Following the conclusions and recommendations of the report two aspects {{of the study were}} investigated and are described herein. The first aspect (Part II) was an investigation of the flooding characteristics of a one inch diameter pulse column used to extract uranium from relatively viscous, high density feed solutions of aluminum and uranium nitrates.

' The deposition of polyvinyl alcohol in the intima of the aorta and the carotid and femoral arteries differed from that in the media, as was reported later in the same year. In the latter coat it was free, as could be shown by specific staining, and it did not greatly swell the media. The intima, on the other hand, showed nodular protrusions due to the accumulation of polyvinyl alcohol-containing monocytes, simulating the well-known lipid-laden cell accumulations of the intima in human atheromatosis. 2 The next year he announced that 2 and 5 per cent methyl cellulose solutions with a viscosity of 400 <b>centipoises</b> produced similar intimal changes when injected into dogs and rabbits. 3 The studies to be reported here were undertaken in the spring of 1941 at the instigation of Dr. K.

The main objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the effects of the physical properties of the liquid (surface tension, angle of contact, and viscosity) and the pore structure of the starch-based solid (porosity, and pore size distribution) on the infusion process. ^ Chessmen Butter Cookies (Pepperidge Farms) and Wonder White Sandwich Bread (ITT Continental Baking Co.) were selected as the starch-based porous solid food materials. Bread is a highly expanded product (porosity = 0. 92), while cookies are relatively dense products (porosity = 0. 58). Safflower oil (surface tension = 32 dyn/cm; viscosity = 47 <b>centipoises)</b> and silicone oil (surface tension = 20 dyn/cm) of the same viscosity were selected to study the effect of surface tension. Silicone oils of 47 and 490 <b>centipoises</b> viscosity were chosen to study the effect of viscosity. Chocolate syrup was selected to assess the effect of nonNewtonian behavior. ^ Both bread and cookies contain pores larger than 200 μm pores which do not offer resistance to flow. Pore diameters measured from SEM micrographs proved the existence of pores with diameters up to 650 μm for bread. The smallest pore size for both bread and cookies was found as 6 μm by mercury porosimetry. Therefore, in order to achieve uniform infusion of liquid food materials containing particulate solids, it is necessary to use starch-based porous food materials with a controlled minimum pore size which is greater than the particle size of the particulate solids integrated with the infusing liquid. ^ Infusion of oils into starch-based food materials is a very efficient process which occurs between vacuum and 200, 000 dyn/cm 2, since surface tension of oil-based liquid foods are low. Moreover, the process is aided by the oil absorption capacity of starch-based foods indicated by partial wetting behavior.
