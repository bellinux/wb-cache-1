50|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1865 and was {{initially}} named the Power Loom Brussels <b>Carpet</b> <b>Weavers</b> Defence Association. In its early days, it advocated for the emigration of unemployed <b>carpet</b> <b>weavers,</b> in order that they could find alternative work elsewhere, and competition in the industry would be reduced. This idea was soon abandoned, and in 1869 the union began admitting tapestry weavers in the area, changing {{its name to the}} Power Loom <b>Carpet</b> <b>Weavers</b> Mutual Defence and Provident Association.|$|R

40|$|Background: Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} (MSDs) are {{a common}} problem among <b>carpet</b> <b>weavers.</b> This study was undertaken to introduce affecting personal and occupational factors in developing the number of MSDs among <b>carpet</b> <b>weavers.</b> Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed among 862 weavers in seven towns with regard to workhouse location in urban or rural regions. Data were collected by using questionnaires that contain personal, workplace, and information tools and the modified Nordic MSDs questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed by applying Poisson and negative binomial mixed models using a full Bayesian hierarchical approach. The deviance information criterion was used for comparison between models and model selection. Results: The majority of weavers (72 %) were female and carpet weaving was the main job of 85. 2 % of workers. The negative binomial mixed model with lowest deviance information criterion {{was selected as the}} best model. The criteria showed the convergence of chains. Based on 95 % Bayesian credible interval, the main job and weaving type variables statistically affected the number of MSDs, but variables age, sex, weaving comb, work experience, and carpet weaving looms were not significant. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it can be concluded that occupational factors are associated with the number of MSDs developing among <b>carpet</b> <b>weavers.</b> Thus, using standard tools and decreasing hours of work per day can reduce frequency of MSDs among <b>carpet</b> <b>weavers...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Very early Islamic carpets, i.e. those {{before the}} 16th century, are {{extremely}} rare.

[...] The most natural and easy designs for a <b>carpet</b> <b>weaver</b> to produce consist of straight lines and edges, and the earliest Islamic carpets to survive or be shown in paintings have geometric designs, or centre on very stylized animals, made up in this way. Since the flowing loops and curves of the arabesque are central to Islamic art, the interaction and tension between these two styles was long a major feature of carpet design.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} stated that near work can cause myopia {{progression}} 1 - 3 and carpet weaving {{is included in}} that frame of work. Carpet weaving is a meticulous and very fine handwork which is performed from a very near distance {{for hours and hours}} each day and for many years in life-time. A precise visual attention and concentration is needed in this job. In this current issue of Iranian Journal of Ophthalmology, Yekta et al 4 have investigated five workshops of carpet weaving, 269 <b>carpet</b> <b>weavers</b> in Mashhad, north-east of Iran and they claim that myopia is much more frequent among <b>carpet</b> <b>weavers</b> compared with the general population of Iran. In those five centers 67 % of the <b>carpet</b> <b>weavers</b> had myopic eyes versus 3 % of hyperopia. In an investigation performed in Mashhad the prevalence of myopia in high school students was reported to be 24. 1 %. 5 In a report concerning the elderly population in the same town the incidence of myopia was shown to be 27. 2 %. 6 This very high percentage of myopia reported in this issue of the IrJO among <b>carpet</b> <b>weavers</b> (67 % versus 24. 1 % of high school students and 24. 1 % of the elderly population at the same geographical area) raises two questions...|$|R

50|$|Attracted to the {{benefits}} associated with an organist position, Pleyel moved to Strasbourg, France in 1783 to work alongside Franz Xaver Richter the maître de chapelle at the Strasbourg Cathedral. The Cathedral was extremely appealing to Pleyel as it possessed a full orchestra, a choir, and a large budget devoted to performances. After establishing himself in France, Pleyel voluntarily called himself by the French version of his name, Ignace. While he was the assistant maître de chapelle at Strasbourg Cathedral, he wrote more works than during any other period in his musical career (1783-1793). At the cathedral, he would organize concerts that featured his symphonies concertantes and liturgical music. After Richter's death in 1789, Pleyel assumed the function of full maître de chapelle. In 1788 Pleyel married Françoise-Gabrielle Lefebvre, {{the daughter of a}} Strasbourg <b>carpet</b> <b>weaver.</b> The couple had four children, the eldest being their son Camille.

This have hurt the industry significantly which the export of the Persian rugs has been reducing year by year after the revolution.

Robert Aitken, the first settler, was appointed by the government as first postmaster in 1851. A tannery was established in 1851, and then a second tannery in 1853. Other additional businesses included a blacksmith shop, a grist mill, a <b>carpet</b> <b>weaver,</b> and an inn, erected in 1852 and eventually became a hotel.

Methods: 28 <b>Carpet</b> <b>weaver</b> women were under optometric eye examinations.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{economic}} globalization has winners and losers. Iran’s carpet industry {{provides a good}} illustration of the adverse side of this process. As the production costs of its rivals have fallen, surging international trade has reduced the market share of Iran's labor-intensive products, especially Persian carpets. This paper reports the findings of an informal survey of <b>carpet</b> <b>weavers</b> conducted {{in and around the}} Iranian city of Kashan, showing how harsh international competition has reduced the weavers’ real wages and restructured the labor force of the industry in Iran. Middle-income families have left the industry, and poor Afghan immigrant householders and their children are increasingly taking the place of Iranian weavers. Furthermore, weaving is consistent with the subordinate position of women <b>carpet</b> <b>weavers</b> within the household; as a form of employment, it has hardly affected the social status quo. ...|$|R
