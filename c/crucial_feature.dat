5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger {{and the threat of}} its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a <b>crucial</b> <b>feature</b> of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.|$|E
25|$|It {{was soon}} noted by other mathematicians, {{prominent}} among these being Hermann Weyl, Jan Arnoldus Schouten, and Élie Cartan, that a covariant derivative could be defined abstractly without {{the presence of}} a metric. The <b>crucial</b> <b>feature</b> was not a particular dependence on the metric, but that the Christoffel symbols satisfied a certain precise second order transformation law. This transformation law could serve {{as a starting point for}} defining the derivative in a covariant manner. Thus the theory of covariant differentiation forked off from the strictly Riemannian context to include a wider range of possible geometries.|$|E

2500|$|George {{developed}} {{what he saw}} as a <b>crucial</b> <b>feature</b> of his own {{theory of}} economics in a critique of an illustration used by Frédéric Bastiat in order to explain the nature of interest and profit. Bastiat had asked his readers to consider James and William, both carpenters. James has built himself a plane, and has lent it to William for a year. Would James be satisfied with the return of an equally good plane a year later? Surely not! He'd expect a board along with it, as interest. The basic idea of a theory of interest is to understand why. Bastiat said that James had given William over that year [...] "the power, inherent in the instrument, to increase the productivity of his labor," [...] and wants compensation for that increased productivity.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} critics argued that {{analytical}} Marxism proceeded {{from the wrong}} methodological and epistemological premises. [...] While the analytical Marxists dismissed [...] "dialectically oriented" [...] Marxism as [...] "bullshit", others maintain that the distinctive character of Marxist philosophy is lost if it is understood [...] "non-dialectically". The <b>crucial</b> <b>feature</b> of Marxist philosophy {{is that it is}} not a reflection in thought of the world, a crude materialism, but rather an intervention in the world concerned with human praxis. According to this view, analytical Marxism wrongly characterizes intellectual activity as occurring in isolation from the struggles constitutive of its social and political conjuncture, and at the same time does little to intervene in that conjuncture. For dialectical Marxists, analytical Marxism eviscerated Marxism, turning it from a systematic doctrine of revolutionary transformation into a set of discrete theses that stand or fall on the basis of their logical consistency and empirical validity.|$|E
40|$|Our goal is {{to develop}} a system for {{coaching}} human motions (e. g., for rehabilitation and daily health maintenance). This paper focuses on how to coach a user so that his/her motion gets closer to the good template of a target motion. It is important to efficiently advise the user to emulate the <b>crucial</b> <b>features</b> that define the good template. The proposed system (1) automatically mines the <b>crucial</b> <b>features</b> of any kind of motion from a set of motion features and (2) gives the user feedback about how to modify the motion through an intuitive interface. The <b>crucial</b> <b>features</b> are mined by feature sparsification through binary classification between the samples of good and other motions. An interface for motion coaching is designed to give feedback via different channels (e. g., visually, aurally), {{depending on the type of}} error. To use the total system, all the user must do is just move and then get feedback on the motion. Following experimental results, open problems for future work are discussed...|$|R
