40|$|It {{is known}} {{that there is no}} {{analytical}} formula for pricing <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> Asian options. Hull and White (1993) proposed feasible tree-based algorithm to solve this problem, in which each node keeps an identical number of representative average prices calculated via equally-spaced placement between the range of the corresponding maximum and minimum <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> prices, and the piece-wise linear interpolation method is applied to derive the corresponding continuation value of each representative average price in the backward induction phase. In this paper, the above classic algorithm is modified to minimize the interpolation error. First, the representative average price are determined by the zeros of Chebyshev polynomial to minimize the Lagrange interpolation error for each node. Second, the optimal allocation of the number of representative average prices is derived to further minimize the accumulated interpolation error for European <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> options. Numerical results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed model.

Then, two new aggregation operators: the interval grey uncertain linguistic correlated ordered <b>arithmetic</b> <b>averaging</b> (IGULCOA) operator and the induced interval grey uncertain linguistic correlated ordered <b>arithmetic</b> <b>averaging</b> (I-IGULCOA) operator are developed and some desirable properties of the I-IGULCOA operator are studied, such as commutativity, idempotency, monotonicity, and boundness. Furthermore, the IGULCOA and I-IGULCOA operators based approach is developed to solve the MAGDM problems, in which both the attribute weights and the expert weights are correlative and the attribute values {{take the form of}} the interval grey uncertain linguistic variables.

40|$|This paper {{measures}} the mean, standard deviation, alpha and beta of venture capital investments, using a maximum likelihood estimate that corrects for selection bias. Since firms go public {{when they have}} achieved a good return, estimates that do not correct for selection bias are optimistic. The selection bias correction neatly accounts for log returns. Without a selection bias correction, I find a mean log return of about 100 % and a log CAPM intercept of about 90 %. With the selection bias correction, I find a mean log return of about 7 % with a - 2 % intercept. However, returns are very volatile, with standard deviation near 100 %. Therefore, <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> returns and intercepts are much higher than geometric averages. The selection bias correction attenuates but does not eliminate high <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> returns. Without a selection bias correction, I find an <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> return of around 700 % and a CAPM alpha of nearly 500 %. With the selection bias correction, I find <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> returns of about 53 % and CAPM alpha of about 45 %. Second, third, and fourth rounds of financing are less risky. They have progressively lower volatility, and therefore lower <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> returns. The betas of successive rounds also decline dramatically from near 1 for the first round to near zero for fourth rounds. The maximum likelihood estimate matches many features of the data, in particular the pattern of IPO and exit {{as a function of}} project age, and the fact that return distributions are stable across horizons. ...|$|R
