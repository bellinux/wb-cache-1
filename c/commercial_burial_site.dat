40|$|The University of Georgia {{recognizes that}} {{laboratory}} waste may have {{adverse effects on}} the environment. A university-wide program has been directed at reducing the improper storage and disposal of toxic chemical wastes. The program extensively utilizes the Code of Federal Regulations 49, Transportation Parts 100 and 199. This code serves {{as a guide for}} the packaging and disposal, in an approved <b>commercial</b> <b>burial</b> <b>site,</b> of the waste chemicals generated at the university. The chemical waste program at the University of Georgia is effective, relatively inexpensive, and requires minimal manpower. The need for adequate and appropriate hazardous waste disposal is demonstrated by the fact that probably only 10 % of waste material considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (ignitable, corrosive, reactive or toxic) is disposed of {{in a manner consistent with}} proposed federal regulations (7). By varying estimates, there are from 800 (8) to 34, 000 (7) potentially harmful disposal sites in the United States. Nearly 70, 000 commercial chemical substances are manufactured or processed in up to 115, 000 establishments nationwide (6). This production results in an estimated 35 million metric tons of hazardous waste annually (8). Although the quantities of hazardous chemical waste generated by multidisciplinary research at universities and colleges is small, the potential damage to health and the environ...|$|E

50|$|Princess Hwahyeop's tomb was {{discovered}} in August 2015, in Sampae-dong, Namyangju, Gyonggi-do (京畿道南杨州市三牌洞).

In the 1970s, the coffins of the couple was shifted to another <b>burial</b> <b>site</b> in Jingeon-myeon (真乾邑), Namyangju, by their descendants for an unknown reason. Therefore, only traces of their coffins were found in this original <b>burial</b> <b>site.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Most <b>burial</b> <b>sites</b> for {{children}} were not as elaborate as adult <b>burial</b> <b>sites.</b> [...] "Infants/toddlers generally lacked offerings… {{for children}} who died before reaching the age of five, the only elaboration or special treatment consisted of inclusion within a probable family group…" [...] However, some <b>burial</b> <b>sites</b> for children did contain more gifts than other youngsters. This suggests that the family {{had a great deal}} of remorse, and/or the child had high standings.|$|R
40|$|Theses {{is focused}} on {{analysis}} of early bronze age <b>burial</b> <b>sites</b> excavated during the rescue excavation caused by highway construction around the town of Kolín. Two <b>burial</b> <b>sites</b> {{in a range of}} 70 and 13 burials were examined. Information from both of these <b>burial</b> <b>sites</b> were analyzed on the basis of fieldwork research from years 2008 - 2009. The larger <b>burial</b> <b>site</b> was ascribed to late Únětice Culture by material finds, the smaller <b>burial</b> <b>site</b> was recognized as early Únětice Culture. Burial rite had a same standard characteristic as in other Únětice regions. Local differences in burial rite dwelled in a specific finds, which are not common in an eastern part of Middle Bohemia (amber, animal blade bone). Secondary burial disturbances was traced in all kind of burials of men, women and children. The reason why was secondary burial disturbance not connected to only one group of burials, but to all of them is not clear. Types of ceramic shapes support connection with Moravian region. Thanks to new knowledge about Únětice culture {{in the eastern part of}} Middle Bohemia, we can observe, that settlement concentration was in late Únětice culture same as in other Únětice regions.

40|$|Among many {{disposal}} {{options of}} animal carcasses due to animal diseases including foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and avian influenza (AI), on-farm burial {{has been the}} most frequently used one in Korea. Animal carcasses generate contaminants such as ammonium-N and chloride. This study aimed at testing biochar (BC) as a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) material in combination with fast growing tree species (Populus euramericana) to mitigate groundwater pollution from animal <b>burial</b> <b>sites.</b> For this, a PRB filled with BC was installed and 400 poplar tree (P. euramericana) seedlings were planted. Tested BC was obtained from rice husk and its efficiency to mitigate contaminant migration from a <b>burial</b> <b>site</b> of pig carcasses was tested using ammonium-N, chloride, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH as monitoring parameters. Monitoring wells downstream from the <b>burial</b> <b>site</b> were used. Leachates from a monitoring well, three wells inside the <b>burial</b> <b>site</b> close to PRB and three wells outside the <b>burial</b> <b>site</b> close to PRB were sampled and analyzed for ammonium-N, Cl−, EC, and pH for four years from PRB installation. The pH, EC, and ammonium-N of leachate fluctuated during the test period depending on precipitation. pH, EC, and ammonium-N of the leachate samples collected from outside of the <b>burial</b> <b>site</b> close to PRB decreased compared to those from inside of the <b>burial</b> <b>site</b> close to PRB. The concentrations of ammonium-N in the leachate from the monitoring well kept under the threshold value of 10 mg·L− 1 for two years from PRB construction. In addition, the growth of poplar plants appeared to be increased via uptaking available N and P released from the <b>burial</b> <b>sites.</b> Achieved results suggest that BC PRBs can be used to in situ mitigate contaminant release from buried animal carcasses...|$|R

5000|$|Several times, laymen have unsuccessfully {{tried to}} prove what they {{consider}} {{important aspects of the}} Götaland theory.

Later, professional archaeologists drilled into the barrow to extract a sample for C14 dating. The barrow was from around 700 A.D., about 150 years too late for being a candidate for Beowulf's <b>burial</b> <b>site.</b>|$|R
