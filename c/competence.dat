Skilled users of AAC show communicative <b>competence</b> in four interrelated areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic. Linguistic <b>competence</b> refers to language skills in the person's native language {{as well as the}} linguistic code of the symbol system selected. Operational <b>competence</b> involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication, while social <b>competence</b> and strategic <b>competence</b> reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Transformation, unlike {{transduction}} or conjugation, {{depends on}} numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process. In {{order for a}} bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed <b>competence</b> (see Natural <b>competence).</b> In Bacillus subtilis, about 40 genes are required {{for the development of}} <b>competence.</b> The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation.

The basic {{objective was to}} measure the mathematical <b>competences</b> or mathematical knowledge, skills and abilities in mathematical education. Mathematical <b>competences</b> were grouped in the following areas: Arithmetic and Geometry. Statistical set consisted of 59 children, 65 to 85 months of age, from the Kindergarten Milan Sachs from Zagreb. The authors describe 13 variables for measuring mathematical <b>competences.</b> Five measuring variables were described for the geometry, and eight measuring variables for the arithmetic. Measuring variables are tasks which children solved with the evaluated results. By measuring mathematical <b>competences</b> the authors make causal Bayes model using free software Tetrad 5. 2. 1 - 3.

A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social <b>competence</b> at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social <b>competence</b> scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E

The purposes of this research were to investigate; first, what are Teacher professional <b>competences</b> of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; second, what is Teacher work-autonomy of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; third, what relationships can be found between teacher professional <b>competences</b> and Teacher Work-Autonomy and of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; fourth, is there any difference in Teacher professional <b>competences</b> based on gender, school location, classroom teacher/subject teacher, grade level or teaching experiences; and, fifth, is there any difference in Teacher Work-Autonomy based on gender, school location, classroom teacher/subject teacher, grade level or teaching experiences. The thesis presents a quantitative research study carried in Aceh, Indonesia in 2016. The research data were collected through questionnaires. Seventy teachers participated in providing information for this research work. The participants completed two questionnaires on teachers work-autonomy and teacher professional <b>competences.</b> Friedman s teacher work-autonomy construct measured teacher perceived autonomy, while Niemi s teachers professional <b>competences</b> construct measured teacher perceived professional <b>competences.</b> Research results indicate that most teachers of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa in Aceh occupied moderate degree of teacher professional <b>competences</b> {{and most of the}} teachers attained a moderate degree of work-autonomy. This study results also claim that there was a moderate and positive correlation between teacher work-autonomy and teachers professional <b>competences.</b> The direction of correlation was positive and there was evidence found of correlation between Teacher work-autonomy and Teacher professional <b>competences.</b> The results indicate that when level of teacher autonomy increase, the level of teacher professional <b>competences</b> escalated, and lower level of teacher autonomy is associated with lower level of teacher professional <b>competences.</b> Supplying teacher with high level of work autonomy is one obvious way to upsurge teacher professional <b>competences.</b> As degree of autonomy increased, degree of <b>competences</b> increased. On the opposite, when the score of autonomy decreased the score of professional <b>competences</b> is decreased. Teacher autonomy was associated with teacher professional <b>competences.</b> Research results also indicate that a degree to which teachers perceived work-autonomy and a degree to which teachers perceived professional <b>competences</b> were diverse based on gender, classroom/subject teacher, experience, level of school and location of school, even though the differentiations were not statistically significant. This research suggests that one way to increase teachers levels of professional <b>competences</b> is by enhancing teachers degrees of autonomy in the schools.
