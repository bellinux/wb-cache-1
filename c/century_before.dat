5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} the Earth rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean.

Al-Sijzi also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis.

5|$|By {{the early}} 14th <b>century,</b> <b>before</b> the {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, the town of Clare had a population of around 600. The de Clares continued to own estates across England, but in Suffolk their possessions were concentrated in estates clustered around Clare Castle. The castle was passed through the de Clare line until Gilbert de Clare died at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314, when the estate passed onto his sisters. Elizabeth de Clare, whose husband John de Burgh had died the previous year, acquired the castle; the combined estates made Elizabeth one of the wealthiest women in England. Elizabeth used the castle as her main residence between 1322 and 1360.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs are {{a varied}} {{group of animals}} from taxonomic, {{morphological}} and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living species, are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through {{the first half of}} the 20th <b>century,</b> <b>before</b> birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that egg laying and nest building are additional traits shared by all dinosaurs.|$|E

Feira was founded by missionaries from Portugal in about 1720, but by 1887 it was a ghost town.

5|$|In 1863, a new {{railroad}} {{bridge was}} constructed {{adjacent to the}} Long Bridge {{as part of a}} plan to strengthen the logistics of the Army of the Potomac as it operated in northern Virginia.

Owing to the weight of the railroad and the weak strength of the bridge, no locomotives were allowed on the bridge. Prior to crossing the Potomac, the train would detach its locomotive and be pulled across the bridge by a team of horses.|$|E
