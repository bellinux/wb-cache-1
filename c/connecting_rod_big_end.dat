5000|$|The CD175 had a 360Â° crankshaft, wasted spark ignition, single carburetor, a {{parallel}} twin high revving engine, 16" [...] wheels and a 100 mph speedometer. Each <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> had roller bearings. In 1979 it {{was replaced by}} Honda CD185.|$|E
50|$|In {{more modern}} practice, the {{crankshaft}} and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearings {{in a modern}} automobile engine are made of a replaceable steel shell, keyed to the bearing caps. The inner surface of the steel shell is plated with a coating of bronze which is in turn coated with {{a thin layer of}} Babbitt metal as the bearing surface.|$|E
50|$|In {{a splash}} {{lubrication}} system no oil pump is used. Instead the crankshaft dips into {{the oil in}} the sump and due to its high speed, it splashes the crankshaft, connecting rods {{and bottom of the}} pistons. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> caps may have an attached scoop to enhance this effect. The valve train may also be sealed in a flooded compartment, or open to the crankshaft {{in a way that it}} receives splashed oil and allows it to drain back to the sump. Splash lubrication is common for small 4-stroke engines.|$|E
50|$|These {{locomotives}} {{conformed to}} SAR requirements {{as far as}} practicable but also incorporated the latest American railway engineering practices. The engines introduced several features which were new to the SAR at the time, such as top feeds to the boiler, self-cleaning smokeboxes, Sellar's drifting valves, and grease lubrication to the coupled wheel axle boxes, crank pins and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The WHE-DR design {{eliminated}} the spider bearing by having each cylinder offset {{from the others}} longitudinally so that the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>ends</b> can fit on a shared crankpin side by side. It {{has been reported that}} [...] "Initial testing has demonstrated significantly smoother and quieter operation." [...] Elimination of the spider bearing was the only design change that would have led to this improvement.|$|R
50|$|Soon after {{entering}} service, problems were experienced with failing <b>connecting</b> <b>rods,</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearings breaking {{up as well}} as cracks developing in the motion girder of the Alligator crossheads. After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the crossheads, slide bars and coupling rods were modified. The crossheads were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional single coupling rod with knuckle joints.|$|R
50|$|Reciprocating mass - Piston mass {{needs to}} be {{accelerated}} and decelerated, resisting a smooth rotation of a crankshaft. In addition to the up-down movement of a piston, a <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> swings left and right {{and up and down}} while it rotates. In order to simplify the motion of a crank slider mechanism, the connecting rod/piston assembly is generally divided into two mass groups, a reciprocating mass, and a rotating mass. The big end of the rod is generally said to be rotating while the small end is said to be reciprocating. In truth, however, both ends both reciprocate and rotate.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{suffered}} from an abbreviated development period due to Rolls-Royce {{being required to}} suspend Vulture development in 1940 during the Battle of Britain to concentrate its work on the Merlin, which powered the RAF's two main fighters, the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire, {{and as a consequence}} the reliability of the Vulture when it entered service was very poor. Apart from delivering significantly less than the designed power, the Vulture {{suffered from}} frequent failures of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearings, which was found to be caused by a breakdown in lubrication, and also from heat dissipation problems. Rolls-Royce were initially confident that they could solve the problems, but in part because of its accelerated development in 1940, the company's much smaller Merlin was already nearing the same power level as the Vulture's original specification, and so production of the Vulture was discontinued after only 538 had been built.|$|E
50|$|Ring oilers {{were used}} for speeds up to around 1,000 rpm. Above this, the oil tended to be thrown {{centrifugally}} from the ring, rather than carried by it (although it is still currently applied on steam turbines with speeds around 3200 rpm). The bearing must also remain horizontal and stable, so although suitable for crankshaft main bearings, {{they could not be}} used on <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearings. They were not used on vehicles for similar reasons, although the engines concerned at this time were anyway too large and heavy for practical mobile use. Automatic ring oilers were particularly useful for large engines with multiple horizontally opposed cylinders, where it was otherwise difficult to access the central main bearings. Ring oilers were most suited where bearing side-loads were relatively light, but the bearing capacity required more lubrication than could be supplied by a drip feed oiler. For this reason they were widely used on larger electric motors and generators.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{redesigned}} frame under the firebox, these locomotives {{were very similar}} to the Class 15C in proportions and appearance. They also had Coale pop type safety valves, a Schmidt type superheater and a combustion chamber in the firebox, which was equipped with flexible side stays and water siphon arch tubes. Their coupled wheel axleboxes, crank pins and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>ends</b> were grease lubricated. These engines used the same Type KT tenders with a coal capacity of 14 lt t and a water capacity of 6000 imp gal.|$|R
2500|$|In {{common with}} the London & North Eastern Railway Gresley Pacifics from which its valve gear design was derived, the centre {{cylinder}} and centre <b>connecting</b> <b>rod's</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearing were located beneath the steam chest and boiler where they were exposed to great heat. This problem was exacerbated by [...] reduced ventilation following the fitting of streamlining and the faster running associated with their Spirit of Progress service from 1937 onwards.

50|$|Soon {{after being}} placed in service, {{problems}} were experienced with failing <b>connecting</b> <b>rods,</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearings breaking up as well as cracks developing in the motion girder of the Alligator crossheads. After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the crossheads, slide bars and coupling rods were modified. The crossheads were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars, a more sophisticated method of filtering out the cylinder and valve lubricant from the exhaust steam replaced the original centrifuge while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional single coupling rod with knuckle joints.|$|R
50|$|On its bottom, the sump {{contains}} an oil intake {{covered by a}} mesh filter which is connected to an oil pump then to an oil filter outside the crankcase, from there it is diverted to the crankshaft main bearings and valve train. The crankcase contains at least one oil gallery (a conduit inside a crankcase wall) to which oil is introduced from the oil filter. The main bearings contain a groove through all or half its circumference; the oil enters to these grooves from channels connected to the oil gallery. The crankshaft has drillings which take oil from these grooves and deliver {{it to the big}} end bearings. All big end bearings are lubricated this way. A single main bearing may provide oil for 0, 1 or 2 big end bearings. A similar system may be used to lubricate the piston, its gudgeon pin and the small end of its connecting rod; in this system, the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> has a groove around the crankshaft and a drilling connected to the groove which distributes oil from there {{to the bottom of the}} piston and from then to the cylinder.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} of component dynamics {{is one of}} the main tasks of internal combustion engine (ICE) simulation. This prediction is important in order to understand complex loading conditions, which happen in a running ICE. Due to the need for fuel saving, mechanical friction, in particular in radial slider bearings, is one important investigation target. A generic friction modeling approach for radial slider bearings, which can be applied to lubricated contact regimes, will be presented in this paper. Besides viscous friction, the approach considers in particular boundary friction. The parameterization of the friction model is done using surface material and surface roughness measurement data. Furthermore, fluid properties depending on the applied oil additives are being considered. The application of the model will be demonstrated for a typical engineering task of a <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> study to outline the effects of contact surface texture. AlSn-based and polymer coated bearing shells will be analyzed and compared with respect to friction reduction effects, running-in behavior and thermal load capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts of an engine system. It fits in between the crosshead and the crankshaft and converts the pistonâs reciprocating motion to rotary motion with the crankshaft. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is subjected to a complex state of loading. High compressive loads and high tensile loads are due to combustion and <b>connecting</b> <b>rodâs</b> mass of inertia, respectively. This is why the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is the most stressed part of an engine system. If the engine is operating, <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> fails, this could cause a critical situation. Therefore, the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> should be able to withstand tremendous load and transmit a great deal of power smoothly. In general, the failure occurs at the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> of <b>connecting</b> <b>rod.</b> Hence, the <b>connecting</b> <b>rodâs</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> corner radius was taken as a design variable. Also, three dimensional finite element analyses were performed. From these results, the stress distribution was estimated and the value of the corner radius was optimized...|$|R
5000|$|The HiPo {{engine was}} {{engineered}} to increase performance and high-RPM reliability over standard 289 fare. It had solid lifters with hotter cam timing; 10.5:1 compression; a dual point, centrifugal advance distributor; smaller combustion chamber heads with cast spring cups and screw-in studs; low-restriction exhaust manifolds; and a bigger, manual-choke 595 CFM carburetor (the standard 289-4V was 480 CFM). The water pump, fuel pump, and alternator/generator pulleys were altered, fewer vanes, extra spring, and larger diameter, respectively; to help handle the higher engine speeds. Even the HiPoâs fan was unique. Bottom-end improvements included a flaw-free selected standard block, thicker {{main bearing caps}} and crankshaft damper/balancer, larger-diameter rod bolts, a crankshaft made from 80% nodular iron {{as opposed to the}} regular items at 40%, all were checked for correct 'nodularity' by polishing an area of the rear counterweight and comparing that surface using a magnification arrangement against a picture datum, increased crankshaft counterweighting to compensate for the heavier <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>ends,</b> the increased external counter weighting at the front was split between the crankshaft damper and a supplementary counterweight place adjacent to the front main bearing journal (all designed to reduce the 'bending moment' in the crankshaft at high-rpm), all for high-rpm reliability. The HiPo carried SAE gross ratings of [...] at 6,000 rpm and 312 lbft Nm at 3,400 rpm. About 25,000 were manufactured at CEP1 between March 1963 and June 1967.|$|R

The oil injection system was substantially changed with two separate sets of injection lines, unlike the earlier models with one set of lines. Oil was injected into the carburetors on a separate line with a branch to each carburetor. The oil injection to the bottom end bearings (both main and <b>rod</b> <b>big</b> <b>ends)</b> was retained as a set of three separate lines as before. A longer swingarm improved stability.

5000|$|When {{building}} a high-performance engine, great {{attention is paid}} to the <b>connecting</b> <b>rods,</b> eliminating stress risers by such techniques as grinding the edges of the rod to a smooth radius, shot peening to induce compressive surface stresses (to prevent crack initiation), balancing all connecting rod/piston assemblies to the same weight and Magnafluxing to reveal otherwise invisible small cracks which would cause the rod to fail under stress. In addition, great care is taken to torque the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> bolts to the exact value specified; often these bolts must be replaced rather than reused. The <b>big</b> <b>end</b> of the <b>rod</b> is fabricated as a unit and cut or cracked in two to establish precision fit around the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> bearing shell.

Harry Schoell, inventor of the WHE, also invented {{what he called a}} 'spider bearing', which is a disk that can rotate around the crankpin, and has one bearing journal around its periphery for each of the six <b>connecting</b> <b>rods.</b> While this design eliminates the need for a separate master rod, it introduces one uncontrolled degree of freedom, i.e., the spider bearing itself can rotate in one direction until its motion is stopped by impacting with the <b>connecting</b> <b>rods,</b> then rotate in the other direction through some angle before it is stopped by again impacting <b>connecting</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
