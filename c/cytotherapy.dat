40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{combined}} interferon (IFN) and hydroxyurea (HU) treatment, intensive chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) in newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia patients aged below 56 years, not eligible for allogeneic SCT. Patients who had an HLA-identical sibling donor and no contraindication went for an allogeneic SCT (related donor, RD). After diagnosis, patients not allotransplanted received HU and IFN to keep WBC and platelet counts low. After 6 months patients with Ph-positive cells still present in the bone marrow received 1 - 3 courses of intensive chemotherapy. Those who became Ph-negative after IFN+HU or after 1 - 3 chemotherapy courses underwent autologous SCT. Some patients with poor cytogenetic response were allotransplanted with an unrelated donor (URD). IFN+HU reduced the percentage of Ph-positive metaphases in 56 % of patients, and 1 patient became Ph-negative. After one or two intensive <b>cytotherapies</b> 86 and 88 % had a Ph reduction, and 34 and 40 % became Ph-negative, respectively. In patients receiving a third intensive chemotherapy 92 % achieved a Ph reduction and 8 % became Ph-negative. The median survival after auto-SCT (n= 46) was 7. 5 years. The chance of remaining Ph-negative for up to 10 years after autologous SCT was around 20 %. The overall survival for allo-SCT RD (n= 91) and URD (n= 28) was almost the same, i. e. &AP; 60 % at 10 years.

40|$|The use of {{cellular}} therapy {{in the treatment}} of dermal wounds is currently an active area of investigation. Multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC) are an attractive choice for <b>cytotherapy</b> because they have a large proliferative potential, the ability to differentiate into different cell types and produce a variety of cytokines and growth factors important to wound healing. Whole bone marrow (BM) was one of the initial attempts to treat impaired wounds. While it has shown some promise, the low frequency of progenitor cell populations in BM and the large number of inflammatory cells make it less attractive. Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and endothelial progenitor cells are populations of BM-derived progenitor cells that have been isolated and used to treat chronic wounds with some success. Skin-derived MAPC are another heterogeneous population of progenitor cells present in the skin with the potential to differentiate into skin elements and participate in wound healing.

40|$|Abstract: Stem cell based {{therapy has}} {{significant}} potential to treat various diseases including primary and metastatic cancers. The umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSC) derived from human umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly (also termed WJMSC) {{have been shown}} to exhibit low immunogenicity, which potentially negates immune consequences after <b>cytotherapy.</b> The homing ability of human and rat UCMSC to inflammatory tissues, including cancer tissues, further confers upon these cells the potential for targeted cancer therapy. Our previous studies demonstrated that un-engineered human and rat UCMSC significantly attenuated the growth of multiple cancer cell lines in vivo and in vitro through multiple mechanisms. We have also demonstrated that these cells can be engineered to express cytotoxic cytokines before being delivered to the tumor and can be preloaded with nanoparticle payloads and attenuate tumors after homing to them.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether the chromosomes of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) change following in vitro culture for several generations. In the present study, umbilical cords from two healthy infants following cesarean delivery were collected aseptically and hUCMSCs were isolated by digestion with collagenase and trypsin, and then cultured in vitro. hUCMSCs with fibroblastic morphology were presented from the human umbilical cord tissue after 7 days of adherent culture. When cultured for 6 passages in vitro, the hUCMSCs maintained a stable spindle-shaped morphology. Cells reached the loga-rithmic growth phase after 3 - 4 days of culture. In addition, CD 13, CD 29, CD 44, CD 90 and CD 105 were highly expressed in generations P 3 -P 6. The expression of CD 31, CD 34, CD 45 and HLA-DR was negative. Furthermore, karyotype analysis revealed a normal diploid karyotype with 46 chromosomes and no abnormal changes were found in chromosome struc-ture.

40|$|Bone {{disease is}} a major {{morbidity}} factor in patients with multiple myeloma and significantly affects their overall survival. A complex interplay between malignant plasma cells and other marrow cells results in the generation of a microenvironment capable of enhancing both tumor growth and bone destruction. Bisphosphonates have consistently reduced the incidence of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma and other osteotropic tumors as well. However, their use is burdened with side-effects, including the risks of osteonecrosis of the jaw and kidney failure, suggesting {{that they should be}} discontinued after prolonged administration.

The authors recently developed a novel, adipose-tissue-derived, injectable extracellular matrix/stromal vascular fraction gel (ECM/SVF-gel) for stem cell therapy. This {{study was designed to}} assess the therapeutic effects of ECM/SVF-gel on wound healing and potential mechanisms. ECM/SVF-gel was prepared for use in nude mouse excisional wound healing model. An SVF cell suspension and phosphate-buffered saline injection served as the control. The expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) in ECM/SVF-gel were analyzed at different time points. Angiogenesis (tube formation) assays of ECM/SVF-gel extracts were evaluated, and vessels density in skin was determined. The ECM/SVF-gel extract promoted tube formation in vitro and increased the expression of the angiogenic factors VEGF and bFGF compared with those in the control. The expression of the inflammatory chemoattractant MCP- 1 was high in ECM/SVF-gel at the early stage and decreased sharply during the late stage of wound healing. The potent angiogenic effects exerted by ECM/SVF-gel may contribute to the improvement of wound healing, and these effects could be related to the enhanced inflammatory response in ECM/SVF-gel during the early stage of wound healing...|$|E

In this study, we confirmed that HIF- 1 a gene transfection could enhance mRNA expression of osteogenic genes in BMCs in vitro. Alkaline phosphatase activity assay and alizarin red-S staining indicated HIF- 1 a transgenic BMCs had enhanced osteogenic differentiation capacity in vitro. Furthermore, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for VEGF revealed HIF- 1 a transgenic BMCs secreted more VEGF as compared to normal BMCs.

Sca- 1 is the “stem cell antigen” marker used to identify the primitive murine HSC population, the expression of which decreases upon differentiation to other mature cell types. Sca- 1 + HSCs maintain the bone marrow stem cell pool throughout the life. Aplastic anemia is a disease considered to involve primary stem cell deficiency and is characterized by severe pancytopenia {{and a decline in}} healthy blood cell generation system. Studies conducted in our laboratory revealed that the primitive Sca- 1 + BM-HSCs (bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell) are significantly affected in experimental Aplastic animals pretreated with chemotherapeutic drugs (Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide) and there is increased Caspase- 3 activity with consecutive high Annexin-V positivity leading to premature apoptosis in the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell population in Aplastic condition. The Sca- 1 bright, that is, “more primitive” BM-HSC population was more affected than the “less primitive” BM-HSC Sca- 1 dim⁡ population. The decreased cell population and the receptor expression were directly associated with an empty and deranged marrow microenvironment, which is evident from scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Methods: Using a recently described chemical design, {{we set out to}} functionalize, optimize and characterize a new set of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to efficiently label macrophages for magnetic resonance imaging–based cell tracking in vivo. Results: A series of cell health and iron uptake assays determined that positively charged SPIONs (+ 16. 8 [*]mV) could safely label macrophages more efficiently than the formerly approved ferumoxide (− 6. 7 [*]mV; Endorem) and at least 10 times more efficiently than the clinically approved SPION ferumoxytol (− 24. 2 [*]mV; Rienso).

However, due to the occurrence of some restrictions on the production and use of embryonic stem cells (which are continuing to try to fix them) in the last few years, a new wave of research on adult stem cells began and continue. Adult stem cells in many organs and tissues of the body have been separated, {{but the important thing is}} that there are very few of these cells in each tissue in a specific area such as living tissue for years, until the advent of activated textural injury and illness.

Scientists in many laboratories are trying to ensure that adult stem cells into specific cell types in cell culture so that they can use for the treatment of diseases tissue damage. Stem cells can be used to reconstruct the cells or tissues that have been damaged by disease or injury. This type of treatment is known as cellular therapy. The use of cell therapy in multiple areas of vascular surgery is: 1 - Chronic limb ischemia.

This report demonstrates a system that uses tumor homing cells to actively carry iron/iron oxide nanoparticles into tumor tissue for alternating magnetic field treatment. Paramagnetic iron/iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized and loaded into RAW 264. 7 cells (mouse monocyte/macrophage-like cells), which have been shown to be tumor homing cells. A murine model of disseminated peritoneal pancreatic cancer was then generated by intraperitoneal injection of Pan 02 cells. After tumor development, monocyte/macrophage-like cells loaded with iron/iron oxide nanoparticles were injected intraperitoneally and allowed to migrate into the tumor. Three days after injection, mice were exposed to an alternating magnetic field for 20 minutes to cause the cell-delivered nanoparticles to generate heat.

40|$|Human mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (hMSCs) from bone marrow are {{regarded}} as putative osteoblast progenitors in vivo and differentiate into osteoblasts in vitro. Positive signaling by the canonical wingless (Wnt) pathway is critical for the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts. In contrast, activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) -mediated pathway results in adipogenesis. We therefore compared the effect of glycogen-synthetase-kinase- 3 β (GSK 3 β) inhibitors and PPARγ inhibitors on osteogenesis by hMSCs. Both compounds altered the intracellular distribution of β-catenin and GSK 3 β {{in a manner consistent}} with activation of Wnt signaling. With osteogenic supplements, the GSK 3 β inhibitor 6 -bromo-indirubin- 3 ′-oxime (BIO) and the PPARγ inhibitor GW 9662 (GW) enhanced early osteogenic markers, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) by hMSCs and transcriptome analysis demonstrated up-regulation of genes encoding bone-related structural proteins. At higher doses of the inhibitors, ALP levels were attenuated, but dexamethasone-induced biomineralization was accelerated. When hMSCs were pretreated with BIO or GW and implanted into experimentally induced nonself healing calvarial defects, GW treatment substantially increased the capacity of the cells to repair the bone lesion, whereas BIO treatment had no significant effect. Further investigation indicated that unlike GW, BIO induced cell cycle inhibition in vitro. Furthermore, we found that GW treatment significantly reduced expression of chemokines that may exacerbate neutrophil- and macrophage-mediated cell rejection.

However, the innate immune response {{and its effect on}} human cell xenotransplantation in these mouse models are mainly unknown. The aim {{of this study is to}} characterise the myeloid populations in the spleen and blood of CB 17 scid beige (CB 17 sb) mice, and to study the inflammatory cell responses to xenogeneic implantation of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) -labelled human bone marrow fibroblastic (HBMF) cells into CB 17 sb mice. The results indicate that even though CB 17 sb mice are deficient in B- and T-cells, they exhibit some increases in their monocyte (Mo), macrophage (Mphi) and neutrophil (Neu) populations. NK cell and eosinophil populations show no differences compared with wild-type Balb/C mice. An innate immune response, identified by CR 3 (CD 11 b/CD 18) -positive myeloid inflammatory cells and F 4 / 80 -positive macrophages, was evident in the tissues where HBMF cells were implanted. As a consequence, the majority of implanted HBMF cells were eliminated by 4 weeks after implantation. Interestingly, the mineralised matrix formed by osteogenic HBMF cells was also eroded by multinuclear Mphi-like giant cells. We conclude that CB 17 sb mice retain active innate immune cells, which respond to HBMF cell xenotransplantation.

40|$|Transplantation of {{embryonic}} stem cell (ESC) -derived precursors holds great promise for treating various disease conditions. Tracing of precursors derived from ESC after transplantation is important to determine their migration and fate. Chemical labeling, as well as transfection or viral-mediated transduction of tracer genes in ESC or in ESC-derived precursors, which are the methods {{that have been used}} in the generation of the vast majority of labeled ESCs, have serious drawbacks such as varying efficacy. To circumvent this problem we generated endogenously traceable mouse (m) ESC clones by direct derivation from blastocysts of transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under control of the housekeeping ß-actin promoter. The only previous report of endogenously EGFP-labeled mESC derived directly from transgenic EGFP embryos is that of Ahn and colleagues (Ahn et al, 2008. <b>Cytotherapy</b> 10 : 759 – 769), who used embryos from a different transgenic line and used a significantly different protocol for derivation. Cells from a high-expressing EGFP-mESC clone, G 11, retain high levels of EGFP expression after differentiation into derivatives of all three primary germ layers both in vitro and in vivo, and contribution to all tissues in chimeric progeny. To determine whether progenitor cells derived from G 11 could be used in transplantation experiments, we differentiated them to early neuronal precursors and injected them into syngeneic mouse brains. Transplanted EGFP-expressing cells at different stages of differentiation along the neuronal lineage could be identified in brains by expression of EGFP twelve weeks after transplantation.

Rat UCMSCs were then administered intratracheally five days later or intravenously on days 5 and 7. The tumor burdens were determined by measuring lung weight three weeks after the treatment. Results Co-culture of rat UCMSCs with LLC significantly attenuated the proliferation of LLC cells as monitored by MTT (3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide), a tetrazole cell proliferation assay, thymidine uptake, and direct cell counts. In vitro colony assays with rat UCMSCs as feeder layers markedly reduced LLC colony size and number. Co-culture of rat UCMSCs with LLCs causes G 0 /G 1 arrest of cancer cells. This is evident in the decrease of cyclin A and CDK 2 expression. The in vivo studies showed that rat UCMSC treatment significantly decreased tumor weight and the total tumor mass. Histological study revealed that intratracheally or systemically administered rat UCMSCs homed to tumor areas and survived for at least 3 weeks without any evidence of differentiation or adverse effects. Conclusions These results indicate that rat UCMSCs alone remarkably attenuate the growth of lung carcinoma cells in vitro and in a mouse syngeneic lung carcinoma graft model and could be used for targeted <b>cytotherapy</b> for lung cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|Much {{interest}} currently {{surrounds the}} emerging field of regenerative medicine. Cell-based therapies represent a novel therapeutic {{platform for the}} treatment of ischaemic diseases, shifting the focus clinically from the management of disease symptoms to their potential cure. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to vascular repair and angiogenesis. Despite controversy surrounding the heterogeneous nature of these cells in vitro and in vivo, their vasoreparative functions suggest that EPCs have potential clinical value. The aim of this thesis is to further define the precise phenotype, angiogenic properties and potential clinical development of two EPC subtypes and to further elucidate the optimal myeloid angiogenic cell (MAC) or outgrowth endothelial cell (OEC) transplant regimen that is safe and effective prior to large-scale clinical application of these cells for therapeutic angiogenesis. EPCs were isolated from human peripheral blood and cord blood by density gradient centrifugation. Mononuclear cells were cultured on fibronectin or collagen and two different isolation protocols were utilised to obtain MACs and OECs respectively. MACs, previously referred to as early EPCs (eEPCs), were found to be M 2 alternatively activated macrophages, which induced angiogenesis via release of IL 8 in a paracrine manner both in vitro and in vivo. OECs were also assessed in a similar manner, and the effect of high glucose conditions and senescence on their vasoreparative function was evaluated. The effect of cell density on MAC secretome and vascular contribution was also investigated in vitro, as this represents an important Issue in the clinical and commercial development of a <b>cytotherapy</b> This study has provided a complete analysis of both types of EPCs and shed further light {{on a number of issues}} associated with the development of a cell-based treatment strategy for autologous or allogeneic therapy. These findings have imp 011 ant implications in relation to the harnessing of these cells as a cell therapy for vascular repair of ischaemic tissues.

40|$|Background: Mesenchymal/stromal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) are favorably {{regarded}} in anti-cancer cytotherapies for their spontaneous chemotaxis toward inflammatory and tumor environments {{associated with an}} intrinsic cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Placenta-derived or TRAIL-engineered adipose MSCs {{have been shown to}} exert anti-Tumor activity in both in-vitro and in-vivo models of multiple myeloma (MM) while TRAIL-Transduced umbilical cord (UC) -MSCs appear efficient inducers of apoptosis in a few solid tumors. However, apoptosis is not selective for cancer cells since specific TRAIL receptors are also expressed by a number of normal cells. To overcome this drawback, we propose to transduce UC-MSCs with a bicistronic vector including the TRAIL sequence under the control of IL- 6 promoter (pIL 6) whose transcriptional activation is promoted by the MM milieu. Methods: UC-MSCs were transduced with a bicistronic retroviral vector (pMIGR 1) encoding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and modified to include the pIL 6 sequence upstream of the full-length human TRAIL cDNA. TRAIL expression after stimulation with U- 266 cell conditioned medium, or IL- 1 Î±/IL- 1 Î², was evaluated by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, real-Time PCR, western blot analysis, and ELISA. Apoptosis in MM cells was assayed by Annexin V staining and by caspase- 8 activation. The cytotoxic effect of pIL 6 -TRAIL+-GFP+-UC-MSCs on MM growth was evaluated in SCID mice by bioluminescence and ex vivo by caspase- 3 activation and X-ray imaging. Statistical analyses were performed by Student's t test, ANOVA, and logrank test for survival curves. Results: pIL 6 -TRAIL+-GFP+-UC-MSCs significantly expressed TRAIL after stimulation by either conditioned medium or by IL- 1 Î±/IL- 1 Î², and induced apoptosis in U- 266 cells. Moreover, when systemically injected in SCID mice intratibially xenografted with U- 266, those cells underwent within MM tibia lesions and significantly reduced the tumor burden by specific induction of apoptosis in MM cells as revealed by caspase- 3 activation. Conclusions: Our tumor microenvironment-sensitive model of anti-MM <b>cytotherapy</b> is regulated by the axis pIL 6 /IL- 1 Î±/IL- 1 Î² and appears suitable for further preclinical investigation not only in myeloma bone disease in which UC-MSCs would even participate to bone healing as described, but also in other osteotropic tumors whose milieu is enriched of cytokines triggering the pIL 6...|$|E
40|$|This work utilises {{models of}} normal and {{abnormal}} human hematopoiesis {{to improve the}} ex vivo expansion of cord blood hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) for therapeutic use and to increase our understanding of ERG in human leukemogenesis. The majority of experimental work in this study has been published in peer reviewed journals <b>Cytotherapy</b> and Leukemia. HSPC transplantation remains the most effective curative therapy for leukemia, and cord blood HSPC have considerable advantages compared to other sources, however their use {{is limited by the}} low number of cells harvested. Therefore, improvements to the ex vivo expansion of cord blood HSPC have high clinical relevance. This study addresses both the limited investigation of the combinatorial effects of growth factors and oxygen level, and the difficulty in translating laboratory research into clinical practice. Systematic investigation using phenotypic markers, colony forming assays and gene expression identified enhanced HPC ex vivo expansion with growth factor combination TSFI in 10 % oxygen. Additionally, through use of clinically approvable methods and reagents, this study established a baseline methodology for the assessment of additional factors to increase cord blood transplantable cell dose. Ets transcription factor ERG is a member of self-sustaining transcriptional networks that maintain human and murine HSPC, and ERG is a prime human leukemogenic candidate. High ERG expression is prognostic of poor patient outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Tcell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and high ERG expression induces both AML and T-ALL in murine models. However, no human model of high ERG expression in normal HSPC exists. This study established a human model of high ERG expression in cord blood CD 34 + HSPC, which allowed investigation of the effect of high ERG expression in primitive HSPC and lineage committed progenitors. High ERG expression induced a gene expression signature that recapitulated hematopoietic stem cells and signatures of both AML and T-ALL. This signature was associated with enhanced expansion of functional progenitors, which potentially provide the opportunity for the acquisition and propagation of mutations that may lead to the development of leukemia. As such, high ERG may mark a pre-disposition to development of high risk leukemia...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In {{the last}} decades, adipose tissue (AT) has {{attracted}} {{attention of the}} scientific and industrial communities for its high therapeutic potential. When focusing on the clinical translation of such type of cells, aspects such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) compliance, scalability, reproducibility, and protocol validation must be ensured. Manufacturing of cells must warrant high quality concerning cell viability, cell yield immunophenotype, and absence of any microbial or pathological contamination. This project focused {{on the development of}} a complete manufacturing and cryopreservation process of therapeutic cells for human clinical delivery, ensuring all parameters and characteristics listed above. Materials and Methods The new protocol developed is particularly compact and ensures economies of scale when increasing the volume of processed AT, which reduces manufacturing cost. In this project 100 - 200 g AT/human donor, obtained from liposuction or lipectomy procedures (n= 15) were processed under GMP conditions. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolation and cryopreservation was performed using xeno-free and GMP grade reagents. Cell number and viability, before and after cryopreservation, was determined by trypan blue exclusion dye by three operators. Immunophenotype of SVF subpopulations was evaluated by flow cytometry (FACSCanto and FACSDiva software) for the expression of mesenchymal, endothelial, hematopoietic and pericytic markers: CD 31, CD 34, CD 45, CD 73, CD 90, CD 105, CD 146 and HLA-DR. Mesenchymal trilineage differentiation was performed to demonstrate potential of the isolated cells. Results The developed xeno-free cGMP procedure for isolation of clinical grade SVF cells resulted in a cell yield of 2. 4 x 105 ± 0. 9 cells/g AT, and cell viability of 85. 4 %± 7. 1, which demonstrated differentiation into mesodermal lineages. After xeno-free cryopreservation cell viability was 80. 0 %± 10. 1. Regarding immunophenotype of SVF subpopulations (Fig. 1), when considering mesenchymal markers co-expressed with CD 341, 12 %± 5 of the cells presented the CD 90 +CD 34 +CD 73 +CD 105 + phenotype, while 1. 3 %± 0. 8 of cells expressed concomitant mesenchymal markers in the absence of CD 34. Regarding endothelial markers, 15 %± 6 of the cells are CD 45 -CD 34 +CD 31 +. Preliminary analysis of samples demonstrated no significant difference of phenotypic expression before and after xeno-free cryopreservation. Discussion and Conclusions To {{the best of our knowledge}} this project is pioneer in providing clinical grade cryopreserved hSVF, ensuring extremely high viability post-thaw, and maintenance of immunophenotypic characteristics of its sub-populations. This achievement is of great relevance for therapeutic use of adipose tissue regenerative cells. References 1 Scherberich A. et al.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of ChemistryStefan BossmannA novel type of supramolecular aggregate, named "nanosponge" was {{synthesized}} {{through the}} interaction of novel supramolecular building blocks with trigonal geometry. The cholesterol-(K/D) [subscript n]DEVDGC) ₃-trimaleimide unit consists of a trigonal maleimide linker to which homopeptides (either K or D) of variable lengths (n = 5, 10, 15, 20) and a consensus sequence for executioner caspases (DEVDGC) are added via Michael addition. Upon mixing in aqueous buffer, cholesterol-(K) [subscript n]DEVDGC) ₃-trimaleimides, {{as well as a}} 1 : 1 mixture of cholesterol-(K/D) [subscript n]DEVDGC) ₃-trimaleimides form stable nanosponges, whereas cholesterol-(D) [subscript n]DEVDGC) ₃-trimaleimide is unable to form supramolecular aggregates by itself. The structure of the novel nanosponges was revealed through explicit solvent and then coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The nanosponges are between 80 nm and several micrometers in diameters and virtually non-toxic to monocyte/macrophage-like cells. Furthermore, the structure of novel binary nanosponges consisting of cholesterol-(K/D) [subscript n]DEVDGC) ₃-trimaleimide units possessing a trigonal maleimide linker, to which either lysine (K) ₂₀ or aspartic acid (D) ₂₀ are tethered, has been elucidated by means of TEM. A high degree of agreement between these findings and structure predictions through explicit solvent and then coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been found. Based on the nanosponges’ structure and dynamics, caspase- 6 mediated release of the model drug 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein has been demonstrated. Moreover, the binary (DK 20) nanosponges have been found virtually non-toxic in cultures of neural progenitor cells. Additionally, DK 20 nanosponges were taken up efficiently by leucocytes (WBC) in peripheral blood within 3 h of exposure. The percentage of live cells among the WBC was not significantly decreased by the DK 20 nanosponges. Therefore, this novel material holds great promise for improved cell-mediated therapy. Two different nanosponges loaded with the anticancer agent perillyl alcohol (POH) were developed to test the suitability of nanosponges for cell-based cancer therapy. Drug-loaded nanoshuttles featuring trigonal supramolecular building blocks, type (D-POH) ₁₀K₂₀ and (D-POH) ₁₀R₂₀ were synthesized, purified, and characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). They were then tested in cell cultures of murine glioma cells (GL 26) and murine neural progenitor cells (NPC). The two nanosponges exhibited significantly different biophysical properties (size distribution and zeta potentials). Consequently, different efficacies in killing GL 26 and NPC were observed in both, serum free and serum containing culture media. The results from these experiments confirmed that type (D-POH) ₁₀K₂₀ nanosponge is an excellent candidate for the <b>cytotherapy</b> of glioblastoma...|$|E
40|$|The {{strategy}} of suicide gene therapy in cancer {{is based on}} the idea of enabling tumour cells, by gene transfer, to convert a non-toxic pro-drug into a toxic product. Previous work has shown that the combination of herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase gene (HSV 1 -tk) transfer with the pro-drug ganciclovir (GCV) to be a promising suicide gene therapy in cancer. Unlike several other gene therapy systems, early-phase clinical trials of this strategy have shown encouraging results. Therefore, methods to improve its therapeutic efficacy are urgently sought. The thymidine analogue 5 -iodo- 2 ’-fluoro- 2 ’-deoxy- 1 -ß-D-arabino-furonosyluracil (FIAU) is an alternative substrate of the HSV 1 -TK enzyme. The iodine atom of FIAU can be substituted with radioactive iodine, for example; [123 I]-iodine, and thereby utilised for the delivery of ionising radiation into tumour cells expressing the viral tk gene. The aim of this study was primarily to investigate the therapeutic potential of combining HSV 1 -tk gene transfer and [123 I]FIAU for the targeted radiation <b>cytotherapy</b> of prostate cancer cells alone or in combination with GCV. The HSV 1 -tk gene was cloned into the plasmid vector pcDNA 3. 1. This plasmid, driven by the ubiquitous promoter of CMV, was then used to transfect the prostate cancer cell line DU 145 and the glioma cell line UVW. A viral TK positive, commercially available cell line derived from osteosarcoma (143 B-TK) along with its TK-negative clone were also used for comparison. The viral tk gene transfection efficiency was assessed by three independent methods. Firstly, the uptake of [123 I]FIAU normalised to the uptake of tritiated thymidine ([methyl- 3 H]TdR); secondly, GCV sensitivity, assessed by the MTT assay; and thirdly, by the detection of HSV 1 -tk gene by RT-PCR. The highest specific activity of [123 I]FIAU was obtained by the use of a no-carrier added method of synthesis. The cytotoxicity of [123 I]FIAU was assessed by clonogenic assay after incubating monolayers of parental and TK-positive clones of the cell lines with a range of doses of [123 I]FIAU for the periods of 4 h, 8 h and a period equal to their doubling times. The effect of this treatment on cell cycle progression was assessed by FACS analysis after staining the cellular DNA with propodium iodide. Combination therapy using GCV and [123 I]FIAU for the treatment of TK-positive clones of the prostate cancer cell line DU- 145 and the osteosarcoma cell line 143 B was assessed by the method of median effect analysis and combination index. Monolayers were treated with a constant ratio of various doses of [123 I]FIAU for 4 h or GCV for 72 h. The combination therapy followed three different timing schedules of GCV-before-[123 I]FIAU, [123 I]FIAU-before-GCV, or simultaneous therapy. The expression of HSV 1 -tk gene by the three cell lines was confirmed by the three methods described above. For instance, the TK positive clone of the cell line DU 145 exhibited 4. 25 ± 0. 15 times higher [123 I]FIAU/ [methyl- 3 H]TdR uptake ratio and 43 times higher sensitivity to GCV compared with the parental cell line. The three cell lines demonstrated sensitivity to radiolabelled FIAU, which was significantly enhanced by HSV 1 -tk gene expression. This sensitivity was time-, dose-, and proliferation-dependent. Maximum cell kill was achieved when the monolayers were exposed to [123 I]FIAU for a period equavelant to the cellular doubling time. For example, the sensitivity enhancement factor by tk gene expression of the cell line DU 145 increased from 5. 2 to 7. 6 when the treatment period was prolonged from 4 h to 26 h (doubling time of DU 145). Following the treatment with [123 I]FIAU for a period equal to the doubling time, cells were arrested at G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle. For instance, 49 % of DU 145 -TK cells treated with 1 MBq/ml for 26 h were at G 2 /M phase compared with 21. 9 % of the untreated cells. In contrast, incubation of DU 145 -TK or 143 B-TK cell lines with lethal doses of [123 I]FIAU for 4 h and GCV for 72 h had no significant effect on cell cycle progression. Comparison of the effectiveness of [123 I]FIAU in the monolayer and spheroid cultures indicated that clonogenic cell kill resulting from Auger electron bombardment was restricted to targeted rather than bystander cells. The combination therapy of [123 I]FIAU and GCV of the cell line DU 145 -TK resulted in antagonistic effect throughout the examined dose range of the schedules of FIAU-before-GCV and simultaneous therapy and the low toxicity concentration range (lower surviving fractions) of the GCV-before-FIAU schedule. The high toxicity concentration range of the latter schedule has shown evidence of additive effect. For the osteosarcoma cell line 143 B-TK, synergistic effect was observed at the high toxicity concentration range of the three combination schedules and antagonism at the low toxicity concentration range of the combinations. We concluded from this in vitro study that the combination of HSV 1 -tk gene transfer and the delivery of radiolabelled FIAU is a promising strategy for targeted radiation <b>cytotherapy</b> of prostate cancer. This proliferation-dependent therapy has caused significant cell cycle arrest that warrants further investigation. Furthermore, the combination of GCV and radiolabelled FIAU for the treatment of tumour cells expressing the gene of viral TK resulted in a dose- and schedule-dependent synergism. We believe that these encouraging results should be substantiated by in vivo experiments in the near future...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The skin is {{the largest}} organ of mammals. The loss of skin {{integrity}} may induce important dysfunctions or even death. For superficial wounds, the endogenous healing mechanisms in combination with traditional wound care are sufficient to achieve functional repair. In contrast, in larger wounds, like third and fourth degree burns, chronic wound or deep ulcers {{it is difficult to}} obtain the restitutio ad integrum and fibrosis and/or scar tissue develops 1, 2. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the efficacy of conventional and innovative topic treatments on skin regeneration, induced experimentally in sheep. To achieve this goal different types of investigations (clinical, molecular, histological, immunohistochemical) were performed. METHODS: Six skin lesions (4 x 4 cm) were surgically created on the back of six healthy adult sheep; every single wound was destined, in a randomized way, to one of the following treatments: Acemannan gel, Manuka Honey, hyaluronic acid, Plasma 3 (ionized gas), allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells isolated from peripheral blood (PB-MSCs). The sixth wound was the placebo. Biopsies were collected with a surgical punch (0, 6 x 0, 6 cm) at time T 0, T 15 and T 40 days. Lesions were clinically evaluated considering the presence and color of wound fluid, the state of hydration, the wound surface/surroundings and other parameters. Histological examinations considered crust formation, re-epithelization and epidermal thickness, dermis edema, extension of granulation tissue, acute and chronic inflammation. Immunohistochemistry for evaluation of inflammation, vascularization and cell proliferation was performed using CD 3, CD 20, MHCII, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and KI 67 antibodies. Furthermore, Real time-PCR investigated genes as V ascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ 1), Vimentin (VIM), Collagen 1 α 1 (Col 1 α 1) and hair Keratin (hKER). RESULTS: Clinically, the lesions treated with plasma healed more rapidly respect to other treatments and a reduced bacterial load was observed. At T 7 wounds treated with stem cells and plasma were less macerated than lesions treated with other therapies. At T 15 the wounds treated with hyaluronic acid showed a normal state of hydration while lesions treated with Manuka Honey exhibited a normal hydration from the third week only (Acemannan gel at fourth week). From the second week onwards all wounds did not show presence of fluid and exhibited a dry and clean secondary layer. All lesions, excluded wounds treated with acemannan gel, presented a red (hyaluronic acid and plasma) and dark red (Manuka Honey, PB-MSCs) granulation tissue starting from the first week. Molecular analysis showed a correspondence between clinical and molecular/histologic results. For instance, VEGF mRNA expression confirms angiogenetic events observed at histological level while TGF-β, CD 3 and CD 20 mRNA/protein expression indicated the presence/absence of inflammation in the used treatments. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: Innovative therapies led to surprising results regarding regeneration of mammalian skin. Indeed, on the basis of clinical analysis, wounds treated with plasma and MSC healed more rapidly. Further examinations are ongoing in order to elucidate possible mechanisms explaining these differences. REFERENCES: 1 S. Y. Broeckx, S. Maes, T.
