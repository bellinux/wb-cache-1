The consortium are scheduled to be paid £800m to maintain the Doughnut for 30 years. The creation of the Doughnut was the largest PFI project to date for the British government.

5|$|Brough Castle is {{a ruined}} castle {{in the village}} of Brough, Cumbria, England. The castle was built by William Rufus around 1092 within the old Roman fort of Verterae to protect a key route through the Pennine Mountains. The initial motte and bailey castle was {{attacked}} and destroyed by the Scots in 1174 during the Great Revolt against Henry II. Rebuilt after the war, a square keep was <b>constructed</b> <b>and</b> the rest of the castle converted to stone.|$|E

The {{early twentieth century}} saw a period of increased urbanization of the area; in the period from the First World War to 1937, 312 council houses were built, and public services, such as electricity supplies and sewerage, were completed. The steep gradient of the Rath was at this time <b>constructed,</b> <b>and</b> in 1939 a Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath.|$|E

This study explored <b>and</b> factorized the <b>constructs</b> <b>and</b> dimensions of employability skills which can predict the job performance of Malaysian electric and electronic polytechnic graduates in the electrical and electronics industry. A qualitative approach {{was used in}} the development of the research Employability Skills Work Performance Prediction (ESWPP) <b>constructs</b> <b>and</b> dimensions starting from relevant document analysis and expert interviews. The ESWPP <b>constructs</b> <b>and</b> dimensions were then validated by content experts from academic institutions. Finally, the findings were analyzed using the Fleiss Kappa reliability analysis to determine the overall approval index for each of the ESWPP <b>constructs</b> <b>and</b> dimensions. Results of the analysis revealed an overall Kappa coefficient value of 0. 989 which indicated a very good level of agreement. The ESWPP <b>constructs</b> <b>and</b> dimensions which were found to be job performance predictors were communication skills, personal qualities, teamwork skills, critical thinking and problem solving skills, technology skills, organizational skills, and continuously learning skills...|$|R
