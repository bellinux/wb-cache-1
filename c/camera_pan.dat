25|$|India {{currently}} has 10 remote sensing satellites in orbit. Though most {{are not meant}} to be dedicated military satellites, some have a spatial resolution of 1 metre or below which can be also used for military applications. Noteworthy satellites include the Technology Experiment Satellite (TES) which has a panchromatic <b>camera</b> (<b>PAN)</b> with a resolution of 1-metre, the RISAT-2 which is capable of imaging in all-weather conditions and has a resolution of one metre, the CARTOSAT-2, CARTOSAT-2A and CARTOSAT-2B which carries a panchromatic camera which has a resolution of 80 centimetres (black and white only).|$|E
25|$|The Fellowship of the Ring makes {{extensive}} use of digital, practical and make-up special effects throughout. One noticeable illusion that appears in almost every scene involves setting a proper scale so that the characters are all the correct height. Elijah Wood, who plays Frodo, is 5ft 6 in (1.68m) tall in real life, but the character of Frodo Baggins is barely four feet in height. Many different tricks were used to depict the hobbits (and Gimli the Dwarf) as being of diminutive stature. (In a happy coincidence, John-Rhys Davies– who played Gimli– is as tall compared to the Hobbit actors as his character needed to be compared to theirs, so {{he did not need}} to be filmed separately as a third variation of height, and is quite taller than Orlando Bloom, who played Legolas.) Large- and small-scale doubles were used in certain scenes, while entire duplicates of certain sets (including Bag End in Hobbiton) were built at two different scales, so that the characters would appear to be the appropriate size. At one point in the film, Frodo runs along a corridor in Bag End, followed by Gandalf. Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen were filmed in separate versions of the same corridor, built at two different scales, and a fast <b>camera</b> <b>pan</b> conceals the edit between the two. Forced perspective was also employed, so that it would look as though the short Hobbits were interacting with taller Men and Elves. Even the simple use of kneeling down, to the filmmakers' surprise, turned out to be an effective method in creating the illusion.|$|E
500|$|Chakotay's {{inclusion}} in the main cast of Voyager was seen by critics as one of several who was used to highlight the diversity within the series. This was highlighted during the episode [...] "" [...] in which one scene showed Janeway, Tuvok, Harry Kim, and Chakotay in a single <b>camera</b> <b>pan.</b> Chakotay's individual position {{was that he was}} [...] "continually positioned as an exotic native other in relation to the white female Captain Janeway", and was used to [...] "help the white protagonist and progress the internal narrative." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{moment in}} which {{the first half of}} the movie {{transitions}} into the second is punctuated by the rising score and <b>camera</b> <b>pan</b> to an ostensibly meaningless point of reflected light on an ornament. According to Rostock, the meaning behind this movement is clear: it marks the spot when Berti's spree ends and Neal's rampage begins. Argento uses the shift in focus to comment on the shaping of the film itself, until that moment a typical, [...] "clichéd and remote" [...] giallo. Neal, previously passive, begins to control what happens in his own story, which is more personal with [...] "weight and meaning". According to Rostock, this structure allows Argento equal scope to play with the narrative while commenting upon it, all without having to deviate from the advancement of plot. According to Kim Newman, the use of a sculpture as a weapon makes literal one of the themes of the film: [...] "art that kills people". Rostock concurs, saying that as the film is a commentary on art, the only weapon that can end the narrative is art itself.|$|E
500|$|When {{originally}} {{submitted to}} the Motion Picture Association of America rating board, But I'm a Cheerleader received an NC-17 rating. In {{order to get a}} commercially viable R rating, Babbit removed a two-second shot of Graham's hand sweeping Megan's clothed body, a <b>camera</b> <b>pan</b> up Megan's body when she is masturbating, and a comment that Megan [...] "ate Graham out" [...] (slang for cunnilingus). Babbit was interviewed by Kirby Dick for his 2006 documentary film This Film Is Not Yet Rated. A critique of the MPAA's rating system, it suggests that films with homosexual content are treated more stringently than those with only heterosexual content, and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher criticism from the board than those of male sexuality. It compares this movie to American Pie (also released in 1999), which features a teenage boy masturbating and was given an R rating (though American Pie also originally received an NC-17 rating and also required cuts to its masturbation scene to reduce its rating to R). Babbit says that she felt discriminated against for making a gay film. The film was rated as M (for mature audiences) in Australia and in New Zealand, 14A in Canada, 12 in Germany and 15 in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Ward {{noted that}} EA's snowboarding video game series SSX was an {{influence}} for Burnout 3s bolder and brasher nature. There was {{an emphasis on}} making the game more aggressive than previous instalments. Ward described Burnout 3 as a game about [...] "fighting through traffic" [...] rather than [...] "racing through traffic". This approach to the game's design led {{to the introduction of}} Takedowns, a feature that rewarded the player with boost and points for knocking their opponents off the track. The Takedown mechanic became a focal point of Burnout 3s design and led to other innovations. At first, the team were not convinced by the idea of having the game's <b>camera</b> <b>pan</b> to show the crash of a taken out vehicle while the player was driving; however, once it was implemented, they agreed that the feature worked well. From there, they decided to show a player's crash as well, which gave rise to the aftertouch mechanic. The crash mode from Burnout 2 was expanded and redesigned to be more puzzle-based; aftertouch control, crashbreakers, and multiplayer support were added to the mode. They wanted to include ramps in crash events so that vehicles could fly into traffic, however the game's physics system was designed to push cars down on the track to prevent them from taking off during a race. This caused vehicles to descend immediately after driving off a ramp. To bypass this issue they [...] "killed" [...] the vehicle once it hit the ramp, leaving it a wreck that was unaffected by the driving physics.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Michael Parks. It begins with the <b>camera</b> <b>panning</b> across the landscape, the song starts to play as the <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> down {{to the right and}} we see a steer sitting on the ground. The <b>camera</b> <b>pans</b> up to the sky and we see a 3 dimensional steer flying in space, it shows a shot of the blue Camaro is driving while the duo are playing a shot of a girl driving and another shot of a girl and Kix Brooks singing. A close-up shot of the Camaro and him {{standing in front of a}} camera, and Ronnie Dunn on a space shuttle, scenes also feature girls dancing.

2500|$|Film {{critics have}} often noted De Palma's penchant for unusual camera angles and {{compositions}} throughout his career. He often frames characters {{against the background}} using a canted angle shot. Split-screen techniques {{have been used to}} show two separate events happening simultaneously. To emphasize the dramatic impact of a certain scene De Palma has employed a 360-degree <b>camera</b> <b>pan.</b> Slow sweeping, panning and tracking shots are often used throughout his films, often through precisely-choreographed long takes lasting for minutes without cutting. Split focus shots, often referred to as [...] "di-opt", are used by De Palma to emphasize the foreground person/object while simultaneously keeping a background person/object in focus. Slow-motion is frequently used in his films to increase suspense.|$|E

50|$|Motion {{interpolation}} {{on certain}} brands of TVs is sometimes accompanied by visual anomalies in the picture, described by CNET's David Carnoy as a 'little tear or glitch' in the picture, appearing {{for a fraction}} of a second. He adds the effect is most noticeable when the technology suddenly kicks in during a fast <b>camera</b> <b>pan.</b> Television and display manufacturers refer to this phenomenon as a type of digital artifact. Due to the improvement of associated technology over time, such artifacts appear less frequently with modern consumer TVs, though they have yet to be eliminated entirely.|$|E
