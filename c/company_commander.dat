5|$|In an {{adjacent}} sector, a short truce {{to bury the}} dead between the lines led to official repercussions; a <b>company</b> <b>commander,</b> Sir Iain Colquhoun of the Scots Guards, was court-martialled for defying standing orders to the contrary. While he was found guilty and reprimanded, the punishment was annulled by General Haig and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official leniency may perhaps have been because he was related to H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|On August 20, the NK 6th Division {{intensified}} {{its efforts}} to attack Battle Mountain, and began sending stronger attacks to capture the two peaks. In the face of these, all of C Company except the <b>company</b> <b>commander</b> and about 25 men abandoned their position on Battle Mountain. Upon reaching {{the bottom of the}} mountain those who had fled reported erroneously that the <b>company</b> <b>commander</b> had been killed and their position surrounded, then overrun by the North Koreans. On the basis of this misinformation, American artillery and mortars fired concentrations on C Company's former position, and fighter-bombers, in 38 sorties, attacked the crest of Battle Mountain, using napalm, fragmentation bombs, rockets, and machine guns. This action forced the <b>company</b> <b>commander</b> and his remaining 25 men off Battle Mountain after they had held it for 20 hours, having declined a call to surrender from the North Koreans. A platoon of E Company, except for about 10 men, also left its position on the mountain as soon as the attack progressed. On the regimental left, an ROK patrol from K Company's position on Sobuk-san captured the commanding officer of the NK 15th Regiment, but he was killed a few minutes later while trying to escape. The patrol removed several intelligence documents from his body. During the day of fighting on Battle Mountain and P'il-bong, the North Koreans drove off the ROK police from the 24th Infantry's left flank on Sobuk-san. 24th Infantry troops continued to straggle from their positions, ignoring commands from officers to stay in place. Both African American and white officers, infuriated by the disobedience, wrote sworn statements implicating the deserters. The situation was so severe that those who stayed in their positions were often given Bronze Star Medals with Valor Devices because they were so far outnumbered in the fighting.|$|E

5|$|Virtually all the Turkish Army commanders, down to <b>company</b> <b>commander</b> level, {{were very}} experienced, being {{veterans}} of the Balkan Wars. But their command structure was weaker at the non-commissioned officer (NCO) level, with only one NCO in each company. One advantage that the Turkish Army had over the New Zealanders, at the time, was their hand grenades, which were not used by the British forces.|$|E
