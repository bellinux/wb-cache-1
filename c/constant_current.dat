5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. <b>Constant</b> <b>current</b> power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E

The analytical approach based on the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation of a mean-field model allows us to study the effects of noise without approximations only by dealing with deterministic nonlinear dynamics. We find the similarity, with respect to the occurrence of oscillations involving subcritical Hopf bifurcations, between the systems of an excitable element with applied <b>constant</b> <b>currents</b> and mean-field coupled excitable elements with noise.

50|$|This simple {{realization}} requires rather high voltages (~100 V) to {{keep the}} load <b>current</b> <b>constant</b> with sufficient approximation for all practical purposes. Therefore, more complex versions of galvanostats, using electronic amplifiers with feedback and lower voltages, have been developed and produced. These instruments are capable to feed <b>constant</b> <b>currents</b> in the ranges from few picoamperes (pA) to several amperes (A); typical construction {{for use in the}} lower range of feed currents uses operational amplifiers.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} uses a <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> power source, {{meaning that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of GTAW are manual or semiautomatic, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{power supply}} used in SMAW has <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> output, {{ensuring}} that the current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the current is not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the arc length to cause minor fluctuations in the current.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new smoke detector is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E
5|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope is {{a device}} for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on {{each of which is}} an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a <b>constant</b> <b>current.</b> The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the Fermi level local density of states.|$|E

40|$|AbstractConstant {{electric}} {{fields and}} <b>constant</b> ion <b>currents</b> are often considered in theories of ion transport. Therefore, {{it is important}} to understand the validity of these helpful concepts. The constant field assumption requires that the charge density of permeant ions and flexible polar groups is virtually voltage independent. We present analytic relations that indicate the conditions under which the constant field approximation applies. Barrier models are frequently fitted to experimental current-voltage curves to describe ion transport. These models are based on three fundamental characteristics: a constant electric field, negligible concerted motions of ions inside the channel (an ion can enter only an empty site), and concentration-independent energy profiles. An analysis of those fundamental assumptions of barrier models shows that those approximations require large barriers because the electrostatic interaction is strong and has a long range. In the <b>constant</b> <b>currents</b> assumption, the current of each permeating ion species is considered to be constant throughout the channel; thus ion pairing is explicitly ignored. In inhomogeneous steady-state systems, the association rate constant determines the strength of ion pairing. Among permeable ions, however, the ion association rate constants are not small, according to modern diffusion-limited reaction rate theories. A mathematical formulation of a <b>constant</b> <b>currents</b> condition indicates that ion pairing very likely has an effect but does not dominate ion transport...|$|R

25|$|Digital instruments, which {{necessarily}} incorporate amplifiers, use {{the same}} principles as analog instruments for resistance readings. For resistance measurements, usually a small <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> is passed through the device under test and the digital multimeter reads the resultant voltage drop; this eliminates the scale compression found in analog meters, but requires a source of precise current. An autoranging digital multimeter can automatically adjust the scaling network so the measurement circuits use the full precision of the A/D converter.|$|E
25|$|The {{dielectric}} is then formed {{over all}} the tantalum particle surfaces by the electrochemical process of anodization. To achieve this, the “pellet” is submerged into a very weak solution of acid and DC voltage is applied. The total dielectric thickness {{is determined by the}} final voltage applied during the forming process. Initially the power supply is kept in a <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> mode until the correct voltage (i.e. dielectric thickness) has been reached; it then holds this voltage and the current decays to close to zero to provide a uniform thickness throughout the device and production lot.|$|E
25|$|A diode {{can be used}} as a {{temperature}} measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon bandgap temperature sensor. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a positive temperature coefficient (at a <b>constant</b> <b>current),</b> but usually the variation of the reverse saturation current term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins.

Rather, a short dipole in real life has a current equal to the feedpoint current at the feedpoint but falling linearly to zero over the length of that short conductor. By placing a capacitive hat, such as a metallic ball, {{at the end of the}} conductor, it is possible for its self capacitance to absorb the current from the conductor and better approximate the <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> assumed for the Hertzian dipole. But again, the Hertzian dipole is meant only as a theoretical construct for antenna analysis.|$|E
25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} image {{intensifier}} tubes manufactured for military purposes after 2006, though it {{has been around for}} some time. Autogated tubes gate the image intensifier within so as to control the amount of light that gets through to the microchannel plate. The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the duty cycle to maintain a <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> draw from the microchannel plate, it is possible to operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to premature failure. Auto-gating of image intensifiers is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|E
25|$|Numerical {{solution}} of either {{is performed using}} the moment method solution which requires expansion of that current into a set of basis functions; one simple (but not the best) choice, for instance, is {{to break up the}} conductor into N segments with a <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> assumed along each. After setting an appropriate weighting function the cost may be minimized through the inversion of a NxN matrix. Determination of each matrix element requires at least one double integration involving the weighting functions, which may become computationally intensive. These are simplified if the weighting functions are simply delta functions, which corresponds to fitting the boundary conditions for the current along the conductor at only N discrete points. Then the NxN matrix must be inverted, which is also computationally intensive as N increases. In one simple example, Balanis performs this computation to find the antenna impedance with different N using Pocklington's method and finds that with N>60 solutions have approached their limiting values to within a few percent.|$|E
40|$|Eccentric {{cells of}} Limulus respond with {{repetitive}} firing to sustained depolarizing currents. Following stimulation with {{a step of}} current, latency is shorter than first interval and later intervals increase progressively. A shock of intensity twice threshold can evoke firing 25 msec. after an impulse. But in the same cell, a current step twice rheobase evokes a second impulse more than 50 msec. after the first, and current intensity must be raised to over five times rheobase to obtain a first interval of about 25 msec. Repetitive firing was evoked by means of trains of shocks. With stimuli of moderate intensity, firing was evoked by {{only some of the}} shocks and intervals between successive impulses increased with time. This is ascribed to accumulation of refractoriness with successive impulses. Higher frequencies of firing are obtained with shocks of intensity n x threshold than with <b>constant</b> <b>currents</b> of intensity n x rheobase. It is concluded that prolonged currents depress the processes leading to excitation and that (in the cells studied) repetitive firing is controlled both by the after-effects of firing (refractoriness) and by the depressant effects of sustained stimuli (accommodation). Development of subthreshold "graded activity" is an important process leading to excitation of eccentric cells, but is not the principal factor determining frequency of firing in response to <b>constant</b> <b>currents...</b>|$|R
