As a result, three main perspectives of BI have been identified, namely the management aspect, the technological aspect, and the product aspect. This categorization gives researchers, practitioners, and BI vendors a better idea of how different parties have approached BI thus far and is valuable in their, design, planning, and implementation of a contemporary BI system in the future. The categorization may even be a first effort towards a <b>commonly</b> <b>agreed</b> definition of BI...|$|R
