40|$|We {{consider}} evaluating improper priors in {{a formal}} Bayes setting according to {{the consequences of their}} use. Let Φ be a class of functions on the parameter space and consider estimating elements of Φ under quadratic loss. If the formal Bayes estimator of every function in Φ is admissible, then the prior is strongly admissible with respect to Φ. Eaton’s method for establishing strong admissibility is based on studying the stability properties of a particular Markov chain associated with the inferential setting. In previous work, this was handled differently depending upon whether ϕ ∈ Φ was bounded or unbounded. We consider a new Markov chain which allows us to unify and generalize existing approaches while simultaneously broadening the scope of their potential applicability.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} the system architecture <b>for</b> a terminal-based <b>location</b> service enabler in the 3 rd Generation (3 G) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). A location service enabler provides {{data about the}} geographical position of mobile terminals to requesting clients. Since location data {{can be regarded as}} a type of presence information, we propose an architecture that builds on the IMS presence specifications. We show that several mechanisms for processing presence like notification handling, access control and privacy management apply to location data as well. It is therefore possible to reuse {{a large part of the}} IMS presence infrastructure. Based on the observation that the processing of trigger <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>location</b> information and creating notification messages should be done in the terminal itself, we propose a terminalbased location enabler. The terminal uses a built-in method to determine its geographical position such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) module. We argue that the proposed architecture scales better and is more accurate, efficient and cost effective than current network-based location enablers. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} and empirical innovation literature {{stresses the importance of}} regional fac-tors and locational <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>location</b> choice of firms and their innovation success. Innovation activities are not equally distributed in space because agglomeration effects and specific regional infrastructures may promote innovation success. Concerning environmentally oriented innovations, the so-called eco-innovations, there is a widespread empirical literature analyzing their determinants but - {{because of the lack of}} adequate data - the inclusion of regional and locational factors has been neglected. This paper tries to close this gap by using the establishment panel of the German Institute for Employment Research in Nuremberg combined with data at the regional level. To explore specific regional determinants of eco-innovations compared to other innovations including variables at the firm and the regional level, a two-level mixed effects logistic regression has been applied. Our econometric results show that external knowledge sources such as the regional proximity to research centers and universities are more important for eco-innovations compared to other innovations. Eco-innovations seem to be a chance for under-developed, disadvantaged regions because especially regions characterized by a high unemployment rate are more likely to adopt eco-innovations.

The data safety on the Internet {{is known to be}} a {{challenge}} due to frequent hacker attacks and data tampering during transmission. In addition to encryption schemes, data hiding has an important role in secret message transmission, authentication, and copyright protection. This thesis presents in-depth state-of-the-art data hiding schemes evaluation, and based on the conducted analysis describes the proposed method, which seek the maximum improvement. We utilize a causal predictor and a local activity indicator with two embedding possibilities based on difference expansion and histogram shifting. Moreover, the secret data from Galois ﬁeld GF(q),q ≤ 2 in order to embed more than one bit per pixel in a single run of the algorithm is considered. We extend our data hiding technique to the transform domain complaint with JPEG coding. In the experimental part, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art reversible data hiding schemes on a vast set of test images, where our approach produces better embedding capacity versus image quality performance. We conclude that proposed scheme achieves efﬁciency in terms of redundancy, which is decreased due to the derived <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>location</b> map free data embedding, invariability to the choice of predictor, and high payload capacity of more than 1 bit per pixel in a single run of the algorithm...|$|R

A model for investment in crop sowing machinery draws on these simulated yield relationships at each location and is used to determine a farmer’s optimal investment in crop sowing work rate capacity under current and projected climate regimes. The key finding is that at most locations the projected change in climate has marked impacts on profit distributions from grain production, yet mostly modest changes in the farmer’s investment in machinery work rate form part of the profit-maximising response to climate change at each location. There is also a divergence in machinery investment response between high versus low rainfall locations, with increases and decreases in work rates respectively being forecast.

The simulated values were utilized as threshold values and compared to daily, gridded SMMR and SSM/I passive microwave data, in order to reveal regions experiencing melt. The spatial extent of the area classified as melting was examined on a daily, monthly and seasonal (May through August) basis for 1979 to 1991. The typical seasonal cycle of melt coverage shows melt beginning in late April, a rapid increase in the melting area from mid May to mid July, a rapid decrease from late July through mid August, and cessation of melt in late September. Seasonal averages of the daily melt extents demonstrate an apparent increase in melt coverage during the 13 -year period of approximately 3. 8 percent annually (significant at the 95 % confidence interval). This apparent increase is dominated by statistically significant positive trends in melt coverage during July and August {{in the west and}} southwest portions of the ice sheet. ^ The melt extent values were compared to several mid-tropospheric teleconnection indices during May 1979 to June 1989. The teleconnection indices were derived by performing a rotated principal components analysis on a 100 -point subset of the 700 hPa heights from the NMC octagonal grid. The component scores were used as predictor variables in a multiple regression analysis of surface melt extent. The results from the regression analysis show that the circulation accounts for 56 percent of the trend identified in melt extent between 1979 and 1989. ^ Nine common synoptic patterns of 700 hPa heights were extracted by performing cluster analysis on the component scores. The mean melt extents for eight topographically defined regions of the ice sheet were compared among the nine different synoptic patterns, demonstrating the importance of synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation on the regional variations in melt extent. ...|$|R
