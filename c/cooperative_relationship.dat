Selective breeding for traits including an ability to form a <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationship</b> with humans created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This article aims to {{investigate}} the influence of cooperative relations {{in the performance of}} companies in the supermarket sector, comparing the companies associated networks with companies not associated. Design/methodology/approach – The research method employed was a survey research with 31 companies. Findings – The results indicate that the <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationships</b> with suppliers {{have a positive impact on}} companies of performance, while the <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationships</b> with competitors and local institutions do not influence the performance. Moreover, it appears that there is no relationship between participation in a network of cooperation and achieving superior performance. However, companies linked to the network present better <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationships</b> with suppliers, which positively impacts the performance and therefore have competitive advantages over companies not associated to networks. Originality/value – The <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationships</b> with suppliers can provide benefits such as reducing logistics costs, improved product portfolio, better negotiating prices and terms, partnership for conducting marketing strategies among others, thus increasing the competitiveness of companies in the supermarket sector...|$|R

25|$|Unfortunately for Beaulieu, his {{government}} warned {{him of the}} possibility that Sardinia might make peace with France or even switch sides. This ruined any chance of a <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationship</b> between the two allies. The situation was further aggravated {{by the fact that the}} lines of communications of the two armies ran in divergent paths. Beaulieu also had at his disposal 1,500 allied cavalry from the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily. The Austrian soldiers had suffered severely that winter. The new army commander notified {{his government}} that a shocking total of 927 soldiers had died of sickness in February. Altogether, the allied armies counted 17,000 Sardinians and 32,000 Austrians. Of this total, Colli's army included 4,000 Austrians under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Giovanni Marchese di Provera in the Auxiliary Corps. The paper strength of Beaulieu's army was 32,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry, and 148 artillery pieces, but these were not the actual numbers.|$|E

25|$|The al-Husayni {{family were}} {{a major force}} in rebelling against Muhammad Ali who governed Egypt and Palestine in {{defiance}} of the Ottoman Empire. This solidified a <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationship</b> with the returning Ottoman authority. The family took part in fighting the Qaisi family in an alliance with a rural lord of the Jerusalem area Mustafa Abu Ghosh, who clashed with the tribe frequently. The feuds gradually occurred in the city between the clan and the Khalidis that led the Qaisis, however these conflicts dealt with city positions and not Qaisi-Yamani rivalry. The Husaynis later led resistance and propaganda movements against the Young Turks who controlled the Ottoman Empire and more so against the British Mandate government and early Zionist immigration. Jamal al-Husayni was the founder and chairman of the Palestine Arab Party (PAP) in 1935. Emil Ghoury was elected as General Secretary, a post he held {{until the end of the}} British Mandate in 1948. In 1948, after Jordan had occupied Jerusalem, King Abdullah of Jordan removed Hajj Amīn al-Husayni from the post of Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and banned him from entering Jerusalem.|$|E

In her first major speech as secretary, Solis pleased community forum attendees at Miami's Greater Bethel AME Church by vowing more aggressive enforcement of workplace protection laws, saying [...] "You can rest assured {{that there is a}} new sheriff in town." [...] In late March 2009, Solis vowed to add 250investigators to the department's Wage and Hour Division after a Government Accountability Office report showed the division's enforcement of wage laws was quite inadequate; the staffing up was completed {{by the end of the}} year. [...] In late May 2009, Solis suspended immigrant guest worker regulations related to H‑2A visas adopted in the final days of the Bush administration; the move earned plaudits from the United Farm Workers. [...] In July 2009, she expressed concern about workplace deaths among Hispanics, which she said they were especially vulnerable to (her continuing attention to issues such as this during her tenure would lead to Hispanic workers considering her their champion). In October 2009, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration levied the largest fine in its history on BP plc for failing to fix safety problems following the 2005 Texas City Refinery disaster. [...] Business groups such as the National Federation of Independent Business complained that Solis was forging a less <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationship,</b> one that departed from the Bush administration's [...] "compliance assistance" [...] approach; the Labor Department said that compliance assistance was still an important part of the new strategy.|$|E

That the formal submission served as little more than modest alliance or non-aggression pact, however, was not an issue for the early Zhou rulers. For them, it was already beneficial if there were no threats from the south, while they were consolidating their new realm.

The two disagreed over policy issues, including the proposed purchase of low-floor buses to benefit elderly and disabled passengers: Moscoe supported the purchase, while Gunn {{argued that it was}} beyond the TTC's budget. Gunn also accused Moscoe of interfering in TTC management issues, particularly after Moscoe renegotiated a contract for condominium development at the TTC's Bayview station. Gunn threatened to resign in mid-1998 if Moscoe was not removed, but retracted this threat when the TTC reaffirmed its confidence in Moscoe's leadership. Gunn eventually stepped down in April 1999, saying that Moscoe was [...] "ruining his reputation". His replacement, Rick Ducharme, was openly critical of his predecessor's management style and initially had a more <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationship</b> with Moscoe and other elected officials.|$|E

2500|$|Laxalt {{then decided}} to {{challenge}} two-term Governor Grant Sawyer. Although the election would not take place until November 1966, Laxalt launched his campaign {{in the middle of}} 1965. One of the most hotly debated issues during the campaign was the Federal government's involvement in Nevada gaming operations. [...] The FBI and Justice Department had deep suspicions about organized crime's involvement in the gambling industry. Sawyer took the position that the Federal government should stay out of Nevada's affairs. Laxalt took the position that Nevada had to cooperate with [...] "the Feds" [...] in order {{to be in a position}} to regulate gambling credibly. (In fact, one of Laxalt's first moves after his election was to meet with J. Edgar Hoover to express Nevada's desire to establish a <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationship.)</b> During the gubernatorial campaign, Laxalt also led a movement to purge members of the John Birch Society from the state Republican Party. [...] Sawyer was defeated by an unexpectedly wide margin (nearly 6,000 votes). Laxalt served one term as governor, from January 1967 to January 1971.|$|E

25|$|In the past, simple {{game theory}} models, {{such as the}} classic {{cooperative}} hunting and Prisoner's dilemma models, {{were used to determine}} decisions made by animals in <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationships.</b> However, complicated interactions between animals have required the use of more complex economic models such as the Nash equilibrium. The Nash equilibrium is a type of non-cooperative game theory that assumes an individual's decision is influenced by its knowledge of the strategies of other individuals. This theory was novel because it took into consideration the higher cognitive capabilities of animals. The evolutionarily stable strategy is a refined version of the Nash equilibrium in that it assumes strategies are heritable and are subject to natural selection. Economic models are useful for analyzing <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationships</b> because they provide predictions on how individuals act when cooperation is an option. Economic models are not perfect, but they provide a general idea of how <b>cooperative</b> <b>relationships</b> work.|$|R
