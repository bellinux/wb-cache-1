A 200-ton capacity surge bunker was installed to avoid delays in the event of stoppage at the shaft. A minor re-organisation and efficiency scheme was completed in 1967 which concentrated all production and coal winding in the Nos. 3 and 4 shafts, leaving Nos. 1 and 2 shafts for ventilation purposes.|$|E
50|$|Lisco {{is among}} the largest {{companies}} in Libya, having an annual production capacity of approximately 1,324,000 tons of liquid steel. Lisco’s operations are primarily supplied by imported iron ore pellets from Brazil, Canada, and Sweden for use as raw materials. Natural gas is used to manufacture sponge iron and hot briquetted iron. Hot-briquetted iron (HBI) became a significant Libyan mineral export since the LISCO II plant began producing it in 1997. About 54% of Lisco’s exports (by weight) in 2000 was HBI. Bars and rods shipped to Egypt and Tunisia accounted for about 23% of the company’s exports. Lisco has its own captive port with specialized facilities, such as a telescopic ship-loading conveyor for loading HBI into ships. The <b>conveying</b> <b>system</b> extends from the HBI plant to the port, about 1,500 meters away.|$|E

40|$|Pneumatic <b>conveying</b> <b>systems</b> {{are used}} at {{pharmaceutical}} manufacturing sites to transport granular materials. These materials — {{the active ingredient}} and various inactive ingredients — are combined to produce granules and then are transported to tablet presses, where pills are formed.

Even for a dilute mixture, attrition can reduce characteristic particle sizes by as much as 50 percent [1] leading to a deterioration in the granule properties and potentially compromising the quality attributes of the pharmaceutical product.
