25|$|After {{leaving the}} {{first-class}} game, Wilkinson {{continued to play}} minor cricket, and {{was part of the}} highly successful Old Hill Cricket Club side of the mid-1980s, playing in victorious William Younger Cup and <b>Cockspur</b> Cup finals in 1984, 1985 and 1987.|$|E
25|$|On 29 June 2007, in London, two {{car bombs}} were {{discovered}} and disabled {{before they could}} be detonated. The first device was left near the Tiger Tiger nightclub in Haymarket at around 01:30, and the second was in <b>Cockspur</b> Street, {{in the same area}} of the city.|$|E
25|$|Since {{becoming}} a limited company, directorship was conditional on holding {{at least five}} hundred shares. Just two years after incorporation {{it was pointed out}} to William Day Junior that he no longer fulfilled this criterion. He refused to leave the board and after the resulting row he left the company and for a short time started business in <b>Cockspur</b> Street.|$|E
25|$|The larger part {{of rural}} Pelotas {{is made up}} of grasslands, with low and {{herbaceous}} vegetation (pampa). Small groves of cultivated trees (Babylon willow, eucalyptus, pine, cypress, acacia, poplar and platanus) and native trees (<b>Cockspur</b> coral tree and araucaria angustifolia) are also found. Pelotas is 55km (34mi) from the Atlantic Ocean, and possesses a beach along the Lagoa dos Patos, called Laranjal. In the vicinity of the beach one can find quagmires and sand dunes.|$|E
25|$|A second {{bomb was}} later {{found in a}} blue Mercedes-Benz 280E {{believed}} to have been left in the same area at around the same time. The illegally parked car received a parking ticket in <b>Cockspur</b> Street at 02:30. At about 03:30 the car was transported to the Park Lane car pound. Staff left the car in a public area after smelling petrol fumes and alerted police on hearing about the first bomb.|$|E

25|$|On 23 July 1901, the 3rd County of London Imperial Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) {{was formed}} from South African War {{veterans}} {{to perpetuate the}} 18th, 21st and 23rd Battalions, Imperial Yeomanry. Headquarters was at <b>Cockspur</b> Street, London, and the regiment was organised in four squadrons and a machine gun section. In 1902, the HQ moved to Regent's Park. On 1 April 1908, the regiment was renamed as the 3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) and transferred to the Territorial Force, trained and equipped as hussars. In 1912, the regiment moved to St John's Wood.|$|E
25|$|On August 11, 1829, Brigadier General Charles Gratiot ordered Lee to <b>Cockspur</b> Island, Georgia. The {{plan was}} to build a fort on the marshy island which would command the outlet of the Savannah River. Lee was {{involved}} {{in the early stages of}} construction as the island was being drained and built up. In 1831, it became apparent that the existing plan to build what became known as Fort Pulaski would have to be revamped, and Lee was transferred to Fort Monroe at the tip of the Virginia Peninsula (today in Hampton, Virginia).|$|E
25|$|He died on 4 September 1813 as {{the result}} of an {{accident}} to the carriage in which he was travelling over the Marlborough Downs with his friend and employer, Christopher Codrington of Dodington Park. He was buried in Westminster Abbey; he left a widow and four sons, of whom the eldest, Benjamin Dean, and the youngest, Philip, were notable architects. Matthew Cotes (1777–1862), the second son, became a well-known sculptor, whose best work is the bronze statue of George III in <b>Cockspur</b> Street off Trafalgar Square. Charles, the third son, was for a time {{in the service of the}} East India Company at Calcutta, but returned to England in 1801. Nothing is known of his later career.|$|E
25|$|Once the Union battery at Venus Point was disclosed, Confederate gunboats {{engaged in}} gunnery duels, {{but they were}} driven off. Over the next week, the besiegers {{completely}} surrounded the Fort. Federals built another battery on the Savannah River across from Venus Point. They threw a boom across Tybee Creek and cut the telegraph line between Savannah and <b>Cockspur</b> Island. Two infantry companies entrenched nearby to ward off Confederate raiding activity and a gunboat was detailed to patrol the channel and support the infantry. By late February 1862, no supplies or reinforcements could get in; the Confederate garrison could not get out. The last link of communications was a weekly swamp swimming courier.|$|E
500|$|After the clearance, {{development}} progressed slowly. The National Gallery {{was built}} on the north side between 1832 and 1838 to a design by William Wilkins, and in 1837 the Treasury approved Wilkins' plan for the laying out of the square, but it was not put into effect. In April 1840, following Wilkins' death, new plans by Charles Barry were accepted, and construction started within weeks. For Barry, as for Wilkins, a major consideration was increasing the visual impact of the National Gallery, which had been widely criticised for its lack of grandeur. He dealt with the complex sloping site by excavating the main area {{to the level of the}} footway between <b>Cockspur</b> Street and the Strand, and constructing a [...] high balustraded terrace with a roadway on the north side, and steps at each end leading to the main level. Wilkins had proposed a similar solution with a central flight of steps. Plinths were provided for sculpture and pedestals for lighting. All the stonework was of Aberdeen granite. In 1841 it was decided that two fountains should be included in the layout. The estimated budget, excluding paving and sculptures, was £11,000. The earth removed was used to level Green Park. The square was originally surfaced with tarmacadam, which was replaced with stone in the 1920s.|$|E
500|$|At Broughton Island, {{orders were}} given to {{transfer}} slaves away from a rice barn upon indications of a storm's arrival; however, efforts to do so were not undertaken promptly, and more than seventy slaves drowned, leading the plantation owner to sell the property following financial losses. Similar events transpired at St. Catherines Island, where two slaves died. At Darien, meanwhile, a tannery was destroyed, and flood waters ruined its tanning baths. At Sunbury, intense winds and high waves uprooted trees and wrecked three houses, of which two were newly built, and five slaves died after being impaled by flying wreckage or drowning. The hurricane also ruined most boats under the possession of plantation owners, and also devastated crops, storage houses, stables, and slave residences. Meanwhile, at <b>Cockspur</b> Island, Fort Greene was obliterated with all its buildings destroyed and thirteen men killed. Muskets, canisters, bars of lead upward of , and cannons weighing [...] littered the island, which was completely inundated during the storm. The fort was never rebuilt; Fort Pulaski was later built in its former location. Meanwhile, at Wilmington Island, one house collapsed and swaths of farmland were flooded. North-to-northeast winds surrounded Hutchinson Island, producing tides [...] above normal, submerging rice crops, sweeping away plantation buildings, and drowning nearly a hundred slaves.|$|E
2500|$|The blight, named <b>cockspur</b> {{due to the}} {{appearance}} of infected grains, was identified and named by Denis Dodart, who reported the relation between ergotized rye and bread poisoning {{in a letter to}} the French Royal Academy of Sciences in 1676 (John Ray mentioned ergot for the first time in English the next year). [...] "Ergotism", in this modern sense, was first recorded in 1853.|$|E
2500|$|Fort Pulaski {{is located}} on <b>Cockspur</b> Island, Georgia, {{near the mouth of}} the Savannah River. The fort {{commanded}} seaward approaches to the City of Savannah. It was commercially and industrially important as a cotton exporting port, railroad center and the largest manufacturing center in the state, including a state arsenal and private shipyards. [...] Two southerly estuaries led to the Savannah River behind the fort. Immediately east of Pulaski, and in sight of Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, lay Tybee Island with a lighthouse station.|$|E
60|$|I think I like to {{speculate}} on the young men best. Their play is opener. You know the cards in their hand, as it were. Take, for example, Messrs. Spavin and <b>Cockspur.</b>|$|E

60|$|When Jarvis, therefore, had safely {{deposited}} {{his charge}} at Morley's Hotel, in <b>Cockspur</b> Street, and extorted from them an extra shilling, {{in consideration of}} their evident rustication, he bent his course towards the Opera House; for clouds were gathering, and, with the favour of Providence, there seemed a chance about midnight of picking up some helpless beau, or desperate cabless dandy, the choicest victim, in a midnight shower, of these public conveyancers.|$|E
60|$|The traffic stopped, and the sun, {{no longer}} sprayed {{out by the}} breeze, became almost too hot. But the {{procession}} passed; the banners glittered --far away down Whitehall; the traffic was released; lurched on; spun to a smooth continuous uproar; swerving round the curve of <b>Cockspur</b> Street; and sweeping past Government offices and equestrian statues down Whitehall to the prickly spires, the tethered grey fleet of masonry, and the large white clock of Westminster.|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} think how people get work. Ought she to walk into some of these places {{and tell them what}} she could do? She hesitated at the window of a shipping-office in <b>Cockspur</b> Street and at the Army and Navy Stores, but decided that perhaps there would be some special and {{customary}} hour, {{and that it would be}} better for her to find this out before she made her attempt. And, besides, she didn't just immediately want to make her attempt.|$|E
6000|$|What {{strikes me}} {{especially}} in the outward demeanour of sporting youth is their amazing gravity, their conciseness of speech, and careworn and moody air. In the smoking-room at the 'Regent,' when Joe Millerson will be setting the whole room in a roar with laughter, you hear young Messrs. Spavin and <b>Cockspur</b> grumbling together in a corner. 'I'll take your five-and-twenty to one about Brother to Bluenose,' whispers Spavin. 'Can't {{do it at the}} price,' <b>Cockspur</b> says, wagging his head ominously. The betting-book is always present in the minds of those unfortunate youngsters. I think I hate that work even more than the 'Peerage.' There is some good in the latter--though, generally speaking, a vain record: though De Mogyns is not descended from the giant Hogyn Mogyn; though half the other genealogies are equally false and foolish; yet the mottoes are good reading--some of them; and the book itself a sort of gold-laced and livened lackey to History, and in so far serviceable. But what good ever came out of, or went into, a betting-book? If I could be Caliph Omar for a week, I would pitch every one of those despicable manuscripts into the flames; from my Lord's, who is 'in' with Jack Snaffle's stable, and is over-reaching worse-informed rogues and swindling greenhorns, down to Sam's, the butcher-boy's, who books eighteenpenny odds in the tap-room, and 'stands to win five-and-twenty bob.' ...|$|E
60|$|In a turf transaction, either Spavin or <b>Cockspur</b> {{would try}} to get the better of his father, and, to gain a point in the odds, victimise his best friends. One day we shall hear of one or other levanting; an event at which, not being {{sporting}} men, we shall not break our hearts. See--Mr. Spavin is settling his toilette previous to departure; giving a curl in the glass to his side-wisps of hair. Look at him! It is only at the hulks, or among turf-men, that you ever see a face so mean, so knowing, and so gloomy.|$|E
6000|$|Everywhere {{there were}} the flags of the Allies; in shop windows, over doors, on the bonnets of automobiles, on people's breasts, {{and there was a}} great {{quantity}} of recruiting posters on the hoardings and in windows: [...] "Your King and Country Need You" [...] was the chief text, and they still called for [...] "A Hundred Thousand Men" [...] although the demand of Lord Kitchener had risen to half a million. There were also placards calling for men on nearly all the taxicabs. The big windows of the offices of the Norddeutscher Lloyd in <b>Cockspur</b> Street were boarded up, and plastered thickly with recruiting appeals.|$|E
60|$|As for King William Island, the Makambo, on {{the former}} run of the <b>Cockspur,</b> stopped there every ten weeks; but the direst threat Daughtry ever held over him was the putting ashore of him {{at the place where}} the two active young men still mourned their pig. In fact, it was their regular programme, each trip, to paddle out and around the Makambo and make ferocious grimaces up at Kwaque, who grimaced back at them from over the rail. Daughtry even {{encouraged}} this exchange of facial amenities for the purpose of deterring him from ever hoping to win ashore to the village of his birth.|$|E
60|$|As my omnibus goes lumbering up <b>Cockspur</b> Street {{through the}} clatter rattle of the cabs and carriages, there comes another fancy in my mind.... Could one but realise an apocalyptic image and suppose an angel, such as {{was given to}} each of the seven churches of Asia, given for a space to the service of the Greater Rule. I see him as a towering figure of flame and colour, {{standing}} between earth and sky, with a trumpet in his hands, over there above the Haymarket, against the October glow; and when he sounds, all the samurai, all who are samurai in Utopia, will know themselves and one another....|$|E
