Agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by marine invertebrates. They are then passed up the food chain.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{exchangers}} in direct-combustion furnaces, typical in many residences, are not 'coils'.

40|$|An optical {{polarization}} (ellipsometric) technique {{was developed for}} measuring rapidly growing and evaporating transparent liquid condensate films (e. g., boric oxide) on solid surfaces exposed to <b>combustion</b> <b>product</b> gases.

25|$|The term {{black powder}} was coined {{in the late}} 19th century, {{primarily}} in the United States, to distinguish prior gunpowder formulations from the new smokeless powders and semi-smokeless powders.

25|$|Frozen fog (also {{known as}} ice fog) is {{any kind of}} fog where the {{droplets}} have frozen into extremely tiny crystals of ice in midair. Generally this requires temperatures at or below , making it common only in and near the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is most often seen in urban areas where it is created by the freezing of water vapor present in automobile exhaust and <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> from heating and power generation. Urban ice fog can become extremely dense and will persist day and night until the temperature rises. Extremely small amounts of ice fog falling from the sky form a type of precipitation called ice crystals, often reported in Barrow, Alaska. Ice fog often leads to the visual phenomenon of light pillars.|$|E
25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with <b>combustion</b> <b>products</b> carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years.

The volume of the mixture in the combustion chamber was discretized at the level of a control micro volume, with precise initial and boundary conditions. Simulation results in the dependencies of compounds of the combustion gases according to the polytropic exponent, at a random regime.
