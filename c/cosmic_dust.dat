The Tanpopo experiment is taking place at the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of Kibo module of the International Space Station. The mission will collect <b>cosmic</b> <b>dusts</b> and other particles for three years by using an ultra-low density silica gel called aerogel. The purpose is to assess the panspermia hypothesis {{and the possibility of}} natural interplanetary transport of life and its precursors.

40|$|<b>Cosmic</b> <b>dusts</b> {{are mostly}} {{responsible}} for polarization {{of the light}} that we ob- serve from astrophysical objects. They also lead to color-extinction, thermal re- emission and other scattering related phenomena. Dusts are made of small particles which are characterised by their size (radius), composition (matter), and structure (morphology, including porosity). In the present work, we {{address the question of}} the role of the dust particle porosity on light polarization and color, using Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) light scattering code. To answer this question, we developed an algorithm to generate solid particles of arbitrary values of porosity. In brief, the model considers a given homogeneous structure made of touching dipoles. The dipoles are randomly removed one by one, such that the remaining structure remains connected. We stop the removal process when the desired poros- ity is obtained. Then we study the optical properties of the porous particle. That way, we show how the proper value of the porosity affects the polarization and color of the light scattered by these porous particles. In addition to polarization, porosity has important effects on photometric color. Considering an important application, we emphasize the possible role of the porosity of the cometary dust particles on polarization and color of the light scattered by cometary coma.

The observations indicated a disk of fine-grained <b>cosmic</b> <b>dust</b> was orbiting the star; this debris disk has since been extensively studied. Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in the dust distribution {{could be explained by}} gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting just inside the dust ring.|$|E

Jackson is then shown {{sitting on top of}} a planet in outer space, wearing a {{bodysuit}} adorned with jewelry, long ponytail, and mask. Various asteroids and dancers mounting planets in black latex attire and helmets are shown. Jackson flips her ponytail, revealing her face as <b>cosmic</b> <b>dust</b> is tossed about. Several dancers leap to other planets as Jackson descends to a cratered surface, performing abstract choreography with two dancers. Jackson jumps to another setting, shown in slow motion as the audio is filtered, landing on a white liquid surface with a crimson atmosphere. Backed by eight dancers, Jackson performs the song's choreography as various objects crash into the liquid. Jackson and the dancers fall into the liquid, with Jackson reemerging in a red catsuit. Jackson then performs a dance routine with six glowing spheres. The final sphere ascends upward as fourteen white liquid objects explode.|$|E

40|$|We propose {{and examine}} {{a new form}} of {{high-density}} neutral composite of Λ⁎≡K−p=(su¯) ⊗(uud), which may be called anti-Kaonic Proton Matter (KPM), or simply, Λ⁎-Matter, where substantial shrinkage of baryonic bound systems originating from the strong attraction of the (K¯N) I= 0 interaction takes place, providing a ground-state neutral baryonic system with a large energy gap. The mass of an ensemble of (K−p) m, where m, the number of the K−p pair, becomes larger than m≈ 10, is predicted to drop down below that of its corresponding neutron ensemble, (n) m, since the attractive interaction is further increased by the Heitler–London type molecular covalency as well as by chiral symmetry restoration of the QCD vacuum. Since the seed clusters (K−p, K−pp and K−K−pp) are short-lived, the formation of such a stabilized relic ensemble, (K−p) m, may be conceived during the Big-Bang Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) period in the early universe. At the final stage of baryogenesis a substantial amount of primordial (u¯,d¯) 's are transferred and captured into KPM, where the anti-quarks find places to survive forever. The expected KPM state may be cold, dense and neutral q¯q-hybrid (Quark Gluon Bound (QGB)) states, [s(u¯⊗u) ud]m, to which the relic of the disappearing anti-quarks plays an essential role as hidden components. KPM may also be produced during the formation and decay of neutron stars in connections with supernova explosions, and other forms may exist as strange quark matter in <b>cosmic</b> <b>dusts...</b>|$|R

25|$|In astronomy, the {{interstellar}} medium (or ISM) is the gas and <b>cosmic</b> <b>dust</b> that pervade interstellar space: the matter that exists between the star systems within a galaxy. It fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding intergalactic medium. The interstellar medium consists of an extremely dilute (by terrestrial standards) mixture of ions, atoms, molecules, larger dust grains, cosmic rays, and (galactic) magnetic fields.

25|$|Other proofs of {{explosive}} nucleosynthesis are {{found within the}} stardust grains that condensed within the interiors of supernovae as they expanded and cooled. Stardust grains are one component of <b>cosmic</b> <b>dust.</b> In particular, radioactive 44Ti {{was measured to be}} very abundant within supernova stardust grains at the time they condensed during the supernova expansion. This confirmed a 1975 prediction of the identification of supernova stardust (SUNOCONs), which became part of the pantheon of presolar grains.

The tails of comets are produced by emissions of dust and ionized gas {{from the body of}} the comet. Dust also covers solid planetary bodies, and vast dust storms occur on Mars that cover almost the entire planet. Interstellar dust is found between the stars, and high concentrations produce diffuse nebulae and reflection nebulae.|$|E

50|$|According to {{theories}} of stellar formation, {{as in other}} stellar nurseries, the stars in Henize 206 were created after a dying star, or supernova, exploded, sending intense shockwaves through clouds of <b>cosmic</b> gas and <b>dust.</b> The gas and dust were subsequently compressed into large groups, then gravity further condensed them into massive objects, and stars were born. Eventually, some of the stars are expected {{to die in a}} fiery blast, triggering another cycle of stellar birth and death. This recycling of stellar dust and gas appears to occur throughout the Universe. Earth's own Sun is considered to have descended from multiple generations of stars, as evidenced by heavy elements found, in the Solar System, in concentrations too large for a first-time star.|$|R

25|$|To {{meteorite}} researchers, {{the term}} presolar grains {{has come to}} mean presolar grains found in meteorites, which consist overwhelmingly of stardust. Many other types of <b>cosmic</b> <b>dust</b> have not been detected in meteorites. Presolar stardust grains comprise only about 0.1 {{percent of the total}} mass of particulate matter found in meteorites. Such grains are isotopically-distinct material found in the fine-grained matrix of meteorites, such as primitive chondrites. Their isotopic differences from the encasing meteorite require that they predate the Solar System. The crystallinity of those clusters ranges from micrometer-sized silicon carbide crystals (up to 1013 atoms), down to that of nanometer-sized diamond (about 1000 atoms), and unlayered graphene crystals of fewer than 100 atoms. The refractory grains achieved their mineral structures by condensing thermally within the slowly cooling expanding gases of supernovae and of red giant stars.|$|E
25|$|The first direct {{proof that}} {{nucleosynthesis}} occurs in stars was the astronomical observation that interstellar gas has become enriched with heavy elements as time passed. As a result, stars that were born from it {{late in the}} galaxy, formed with much higher initial heavy element abundances than those that had formed earlier. The detection of technetium in the atmosphere of a red giant star in 1952, by spectroscopy, provided the first evidence of nuclear activity within stars. Because technetium is radioactive, with a half-life {{much less than the}} age of the star, its abundance must reflect its recent creation within that star. Equally convincing evidence of the stellar origin of heavy elements, is the large overabundances of specific stable elements found in stellar atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch stars. Observation of barium abundances some 20-50 times greater than found in unevolved stars is evidence of the operation of the s-process within such stars. Many modern proofs of stellar nucleosynthesis are provided by the isotopic compositions of stardust, solid grains that have condensed from the gases of individual stars and which have been extracted from meteorites. Stardust is one component of <b>cosmic</b> <b>dust,</b> and is frequently called presolar grains. The measured isotopic compositions in stardust grains demonstrate many aspects of nucleosynthesis within the stars from which the grains condensed during the star's late-life mass-loss episodes.|$|E
500|$|Orbital {{inclination}} has a 100 ka periodicity, while eccentricity's 95 and 125ka periods could inter-react {{to give a}} 108ka effect. While it {{is possible}} that the less significant, and originally overlooked, inclination variability has a deep effect on climate, the eccentricity only modifies insolation by a small amount: 1–2% of the shift caused by the 21,000-year precession and 41,000-year obliquity cycles. [...] Such a big impact from inclination would therefore be disproportionate in comparison to other cycles. One possible mechanism suggested to account for this was the passage of Earth through regions of <b>cosmic</b> <b>dust.</b> Our eccentric orbit would take us through dusty clouds in space, which would act to occlude some of the incoming radiation, shadowing the Earth.|$|E
40|$|Clustering of the {{abundant}} SiO molecules {{has been discussed}} as a possible mechanism of seed particle formation for silicate dust in stellar outflows with an oxygen rich element mixture. Previous results indicated that condensation temperatures based on this mechanism are significant lower than what is really observed. This negative result strongly rests on experimental data on vapour pressure of SiO. New determinations show the older data to be seriously in error. Here we aim to check with improved data the possibility that SiO nucleation triggers the <b>cosmic</b> silicate <b>dust</b> formation. First we present results of our measurements of vapour pressure of solid SiO. Second, we use the improved vapour pressure data to re-calibrate existing experimental data on SiO nucleation from the literature. Third, we use the re-calibrated data on SiO nucleation in a simple model for dust-driven winds to determine the condensation temperature of silicate in stellar outflows from AGB stars. We show that onset of nucleation under circumstellar conditions commences at higher temperature than was previously found. Calculated condensation temperatures are still by about 100 K lower than observed ones, but {{this may be due}} to the greenhouse effect of silicate dust temperatures. The assumption that the onset of silicate dust formation in late-type M stars is triggered by cluster formation of SiO is compatible with dust condensation temperatures derived from IR observations.

In this work the Schutz’s variational formalism is applied for radiation, <b>dust,</b> <b>cosmic</b> string, and domain wall dominated Universes with positive, negative, and zero constant spatial curvature. In this approach the notion of time can be recovered. These give rise to Wheeler-DeWitt equations for the scale factor. We find their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions by using Spectral Method. After that, we use the eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets for each case and evaluate the time-dependent expectation value of the scale factors, which are found to oscillate between finite maximum and minimum values. Since the expectation values of the scale factors never tends to the singular point, we have an initial indication that these models may not have singularities at the quantum level. Pacs: 98. 80.
