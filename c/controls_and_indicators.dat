50|$|LabVIEW {{integrates}} {{the creation}} of user interfaces (termed front panels) into the development cycle. LabVIEW programs-subroutines are termed virtual instruments (VIs). Each VI has three components: a block diagram, a front panel, and a connector panel. The last is used to represent the VI in the block diagrams of other, calling VIs. The front panel is built using <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicators.</b> Controls are inputs: they allow a user to supply information to the VI. Indicators are outputs: they indicate, or display, the results based on the inputs given to the VI. The back panel, which is a block diagram, contains the graphical source code. All of the objects placed on the front panel {{will appear on the}} back panel as terminals. The back panel also contains structures and functions which perform operations on controls and supply data to indicators. The structures and functions are found on the Functions palette and can be placed on the back panel. Collectively controls, indicators, structures, and functions will be referred to as nodes. Nodes are connected to one another using wires, e.g., two controls and an indicator can be wired to the addition function so that the indicator displays the sum of the two controls. Thus a virtual instrument can be run as either a program, with the front panel serving as a user interface, or, when dropped as a node onto the block diagram, the front panel defines the inputs and outputs for the node through the connector pane. This implies each VI can be easily tested before being embedded as a subroutine into a larger program.|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} and disadvantages of fiscal federalism are widely discussed in economics and political science. While some authors argue that federalism favors individual initiatives and serves as a market preserving device, others emphasize the dangers arising from an increasing corruption and local capture due to decentralization. In this paper, we empirically study the impact of different instruments of fiscal federalism on economic performance measured by GDP per capita using panel data for the 26 Swiss cantons from 1980 to 1998. In our econometric production function approach, the impact of fiscal federalism, tax competition and grants on economic performance is analyzed by additionally using controls for physical and human capital investment as well as further <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicators</b> of fiscal federalism. According to our results, the intensity of tax competition, which is measured by the difference between a cantons tax rate and the average of its neighbors ’ tax rates, is at least not harmful for economic performance. Moreover, the fragmentation of cantons in communities does not affect real GDP per capita indicating that economies of scale do not necessarily provide...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} the nursing manpower requirements for humanitarian and civic assistance missions performed by Navy hospital ships. The qualitative analysis component of this thesis includes a comprehensive literature review performed on doctrines, guidances, past humanitarian mission studies, and nurse staffing models. In contrast, the quantitative analysis component includes an Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis to estimate patient length of stay. Various model constructions are reviewed, utilizing different patient <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicators</b> in an effort to identify a reasonable estimation approach and to validate the integrity of the available empirical data from the USNS MERCY 2006 deployment. Furthermore, a Chi-square test is conducted to review the statistical significance between the observed patient ICD- 9 classification frequencies in an effort to better understand the types of capabilities that a future mission should expect to provide. The results of these analyses are applied in the development of an estimation calculator to define shipboard inpatient nursing manpower requirements. The thesis also provides suggestions for areas of future research that will provide insight regarding additional staffing requirements in other areas such as MEDCAPS, which is necessary for developing a more robust calculator.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A key {{objective}} of cognitive modeling {{research at the}} Air Force Research Laboratory’s Warfighter Training Research Division {{is to be able}} to explore the effects of background knowledge and task strategies on performance and learning of skills relevant to accomplishing the Air Force mission. In pursuit of that objective, this paper compares three variants of a computational process model of basic aircraft maneuvering. All three variants are embodied performance models implemented in the ACT-R cognitive modeling architecture. The model variants operate a Predator UAV Synthetic Task Environment (STE). Each model variant implements a different combination of background knowledge and task strategy for completing the basic maneuvering task. The three variants of the model are called Model Variant P (Performance only), Model Variant CP (<b>Control</b> <b>and</b> Performance) and Model Variant CFP (<b>Control</b> Focus <b>and</b> Performance). Model Variant P lacks the knowledge of control instrument settings typically available to expert pilots and only considers performance indicators in completing the basic maneuvering task. Model Variant CP has knowledge of control instrument settings needed to accomplish various performance objectives and uses that knowledge as part of a crosscheck strategy which includes attending equally to <b>control</b> <b>and</b> performance <b>indicators.</b> Model Variant CFP also has knowledge of control instrument settings, but has a different crosscheck strategy which includes focusing on control instruments until they are correctly set, in addition to normal crosschecking across <b>control</b> <b>and</b> performance <b>indicators.</b> This paper documents efforts to use these model variants to explore the relative effects of differences in knowledge and task strategy on pilot performance in UAV basic maneuvering...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes {{the process}} of {{investigating}} the changes of capacitance value due to the changes of permittivity distribution of a different dielectric materials such as water and oil in a conveying pipeline using twelve externally Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) sensor. Electrical capacitance tomography system is a system which can be used for imaging industrial multi–component processes involving non-conducting fluids in pipeline. Therefore, in this research, a 12 electrodes electrical capacitance tomography system is developed. This system can provide more data for processing to obtain more precise images of the pipeline. In order to reduce the noise in the system, on–plate signal conditioning board is applied in this research to eliminate certain noise source from the analogue transmission line. Then, various of accapacitance measuring circuits has been developed in terms of performance and sensitivity to achieve low noise level, wide dynamic range and high immunity stray capacitance to suits the appropriate design for system development.

It {{features}} a Range switch for high slider resolution in the ± 6 dB mode, equivalent resolution to 45 mm sliders found on double rack-space models. The ± 12 dB mode provides {{a wide range of}} control over system audio. The active filter sections feature Rane’s innovative constant-Q (constant bandwidth) design. Constant-Q means the bandwidth of each individual filter is guaranteed to be narrow enough to prevent unwarranted interaction between filters, yet wide enough to produce exactly the type of correction curve demanded by even the most unusual acoustic surroundings. This differs dramatically from conventional designs of the past, encumbered with the unfortunate characteristic of changing bandwidth when changing boost/cut amounts. Front panel <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicators</b> include an overall rotary Level control for each channel as well as Overload indicators. Passive pushbutton Bypass switches feature LED indicators, avoiding ambiguity by being on when the unit is Bypassed. (A passive Bypass switch requires no power to operate.

40|$|Introduction When {{properly}} maintained, cyclotrons often {{remain in}} operation for 20 years and more. However, {{as the years}} pass the control systems in particular become challenging to support. The I/O cards and other hardware eventually become obsolete, making spare parts difficult or even impossible to find. And the knowledge and ability to reload and configure the software also gets lost as operating systems and media storage technology change. This obsolescence {{is true of the}} Siemens RDS- 112 cyclotron, which is controlled using a 486 computer, connected to an external STD card rack containing up to 15 I/O cards. These I/O cards were last manufactured in the 1990 ’s, and the iRMX-based control programs malfunction on computers newer than a 486 processor. A control system upgrade for the RDS- 112 cyclotron has been developed by PET Technical Consulting Inc. This commercially available control system reduces operator training time, requires less maintenance, and supports new targets and custom product processes. Material and Methods The availability of high channel count I/O cards, and the decision not to support the old CPCU synthesis units, means the entire STD card rack can be replaced with 5 National Instruments (NI) I/O cards. The replacement computer is an industrial grade rack mounted PC with RAID 1 mirrored pair hard drives in front panel access quick swap bays. Two NI PCI- 6509 Digital I/O cards connect directly to the RDS electronics, channel assignments are mapped using software configuration. Three NI PCI- 6229 Multifunction I/O cards connect to the RDS electronics through a cable breakout interface plate, the terminal blocks are wired as needed to map the channels. The new control software was created using National Instruments LabVIEW. The new control sequences have a core based on the original RDS- 112 FORTRAN control programs. Then hundreds of improvements were made to simplify operation, increase flexibility, minimize user involvement and mistakes, and clearly display key parameters and fault conditions. System control has been combined into a comprehensive Graphical User Interface, with <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>indicators</b> grouped together onto subsystem pages. Commands that once needed to be typed-in have been replaced with a clickable control for each function. Bar graphs display target and slit currents. Status is obvious with red faults against normally green indicators. Audio alarms cue the operator for process interaction, warn if target current or pressure drifts from setpoint, or if faults occur with power supplies, vacuum, or water cooling. Improvements in sequences and beam algorithms have reduced the time to achieve full beam on dual targets from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes. Results and Conclusion This new control system has been installed on (5) five RDS- 112 cyclotrons used for commercial isotope distribution. The total combined operation time of these systems after receiving the upgrade is now over 17 years, during this time the control system operation has been nearly problem free. UPDATE: The Siemens RDS- 111 cyclotron is controlled by a VME computer that is now end-of-life. The VM 30 and VM 42 CPU boards and many of the I/O modules are no longer manu-factured.
