40|$|For {{historical}} {{reasons and}} space considerations, the two rotary juice screens at South Johnstone mill are mounted over the # 2 intercarrier that feeds # 3 mill. <b>Cush</b> is deposited directly {{down into the}} intercarrier. As part of an investigation to identify opportunities to increase extraction, the option of diverting the <b>cush</b> back to the # 1 intercarrier that feeds # 2 mill (the common approach in Australia) was considered. Recent modelling work, as well as encouraging advice from international technologists, suggested significant benefit in doing so. To test this concept, a screw conveyor was installed to convey the <b>cush</b> to the # 1 intermediate carrier. An experiment to measure {{the effect of this}} <b>cush</b> diversion on extraction was conducted. Because of capacity limitations with the installed screw conveyor, the full <b>cush</b> loading from both screens could not be reliably conveyed and so the experiment considered only the diversion of the <b>cush</b> from the # 1 mill expressed juice stream. The results indicated an increase in extraction of 0. 3 units by diverting the <b>cush</b> from this one screen. A greater increase can be expected through the diversion of <b>cush</b> from both screens...|$|R
50|$|The name Kush, {{since at}} least the time of Josephus, has been {{connected}} with the biblical character <b>Cush,</b> in the Hebrew Bible (Hebrew: כוש), son of Ham (Genesis 10:6).

According to the Bible, Nimrod, a son of <b>Cush,</b> was the founder and king of Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in Shinar (Gen 10:10).
