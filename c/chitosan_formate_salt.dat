The change from the acid media to the alkaline can dramatically improve kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and also formate oxidation. Additionally, lower overpotential is required to oxidize the fuel in alkaline environment and the anode catalyst does not poison during formate oxidation as it does during oxidation of formic acid. Furthermore, <b>formate</b> <b>salts</b> are stable, have low toxicity, are easily handled and relatively inexpensive and is a carbon-neutral fuel which can be produced from reduction of carbon dioxide [18, 19, 21, 22, 23].

40|$|CO 2 is an {{abundant}} C 1 building block {{that has the}} potential to be utilized in the synthesis of many commodity chemicals and fuels that are currently derived from fossil feedstocks. Methanol in particular is produced annually on a multimillion metric ton scale, primarily from CO/H 2 at elevated temperatures (240 – 260 ºC). However, because the hydrogenation of CO 2 is entropically unfavorable, the ability to operate at lower reaction temperatures is expected to lead to an overall higher theoretical yield of methanol. Herein we report the use of homogeneous catalysts in tandem for the hydrogenation of CO 2 to CH 3 OH at substantially lower temperatures (135 ºC). Chapter 2 details the first system established for the direct homogeneous hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol. A combination of ruthenium and scandium catalysts is employed to undergo the one pot stepwise reduction of CO 2 to formic acid, methyl formate, and finally methanol. Incompatibilities between catalysts and cascade system components are introduced and are further evaluated in detail in later chapters. Chapter 3 describes potential deactivation pathways involving components of the cascade system with the Ru pincer ester hydrogenation catalyst applied in the cascade system. A new mode of activation of CO 2 and carbonyl compounds (esters, ketones, and aldehdyes) by this Ru pincer complex is discussed. Additionally, the relevance of these organometallic compounds under cascade catalysis conditions is studied. Chapter 4 explores the idea of using a single catalyst for the cascade conversion of CO 2 to CH 3 OH. A Ru pincer complex is tested for the CO 2 conversion to <b>formate</b> <b>salts</b> where the mechanism is investigated and catalytic conditions are established. Furthermore, these conditions are applied to a second-generation cascade system comprised of <b>formate</b> <b>salt</b> and amide intermediates, where the later is reduced to CH 3 OH using a single catalyst.

More specifically we have concerned ourselves with the hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds using both stable deuterium and radioactive tritium isotopes. Initial chapters describe the use of commercially available rhodium and iridium based homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts, for labelling a variety of substrates using deuterium gas. Labelling patterns and mechanistic details are discussed with reference to common heterogeneous catalysts such as Pd/C. In the following chapters the use of solid hydrogen sources {{and the concept of}} hydrogen transfer hydrogenation are discussed as an alternative approach to labelling compounds. The benefits of using formates as hydrogen sources and the results of labelling studies are shown, together with novel labelling patterns observed with selected substrates.

30|$|In literature, it {{has been}} {{described}} that glycosidase mutants lacking the nucleophilic residue can be reactivated by addition of external <b>formate</b> <b>salts,</b> and this reactivation can be exploited for performing the glycosidation of appropriate acceptors properly added in the reaction mixture (Trincone et al. 2010). The term glycosynthase has been introduced to refer to such a kind of application. In an attempt to support the expected pivotal {{role played by the}} 449 residue, glycosynthase activity of mutant E 449 was assessed by exposing pNPA to an excess of formate and an excess of ethylene glycol, the latter being the most effective α-arabinosyl acceptor according to the above described experiments on the PoAbf wild-type (Fig.  1). This experiment furnished a reaction mixture containing an approximately equimolar mixture of l-arabinose and ethylene glycol α- arabinofuranoside 3 (Fig.  2). The generation of the ethylene glycol α- arabinofuranoside represents a further evidence that formate can react as the replaced glutamic residue to give a β-configured intermediate wich in turn can react with ethylene glycol to yield the α-glycoside. As previously shown, under otherwise identical conditions but in the absence of formate, no appreciable hydrolytic event occurred (with recovery of pNPA 1), and combination of all these results clearly points to a direct participation of formate in the reaction path and its stereocontrolled attack to pNPA to yield a β-configured intermediate.|$|R

When the substrate {{is allowed to}} react with a defect of <b>formate</b> <b>salt</b> and {{in the presence of}} a relatively large amount of catalyst, the yield, with respect to the formate, is practically quantitative. Since it is known that Pd/C catalyzes the decomposition of alkali formates, this result suggests that the hydrogen transfer to the substrate is much faster than the hydrogen evolution or that there are no catalytic sites able to absorb only the formate anions and water, and that the chemisorption of the substrate PhCOCH=CHCOOH is relatively fast and occurs in the first step of the catalytic cycle. Moreover, water, at low concentration, has a beneficial effect on the reaction rate, which passes through a maximum with changes in its concentration. The reaction rate increases also with the increasing concentration of formate and of substrate. These results suggest that water competes with the other reacting molecules for activation on only one type of active centers. It is also proposed that the catalytic cycle then proceeds through the adsorption of the hydrogen donors, followed by a hydride abstraction from absorbed formate.

The total salt concentration in the reaction mixture was varied up to the solubility limit. The experimental equilibrium data were interpreted by taking the nonideality of the aqueous electrolyte solution into account according to the multicomponent, extended Pitzer model. Calculation of the activity coefficients was based on parameters of the single electrolyte subsystems. From the experimental results, the values of the standard Gibbs energy and enthalpy change of the reaction could be derived, namely − 0. 72 and − 20. 5 kJ mol− 1, respectively. Determination of the standard Gibbs energy and enthalpy of formation of the aqueous formate ion yielded values of, successively, − 350. 5 and − 426. 7 kJ mol− 1.

These fluids are essentially composed of water, a freeze point depressant (FPD) usually glycol, a surfactant or wetting agent and a corrosion inhibitor. All commercial fluids are qualified to SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) specifications, which test for aerodynamic acceptance, anti-icing endurance, corrosion inhibition, material compatibility, fluid stability and environment. However, these tests have been built around a fluid with a glycol FPD. More recently, with environmental pressure, fluids with other FPDs have been developed and qualified. The other FPDs include: acetates and <b>formate</b> <b>salts,</b> sorbitol, and other undisclosed FPDs. The acetates and formates, which {{came out in the}} early 1990 s led to suspected corrosion problems. This led to the additional requirement for corrosion tests for non-glycol deicing fluids in paragraph 3. 1. 1 of AMS 1424. This is essentially only a relevant for such a salt based non-glycol fluid. Next, came a sorbitol, or sugar, based fluid in the early 2000 s. As with the <b>formate</b> and acetate <b>salts,</b> it passed all the required tests of AMS 1424 including the additional corrosion test. But then in field tests, where the fluid was heated as per usual use, there were problems with foam, sticky and slippery residues. All standard specification laboratory tests are conducted on cold fluids, since this is the worst case for glycol-based fluids, where they are most viscous. However, other FPDs may have the fluid increase in viscosity with heating and evaporation. Following the failed field tests, tests were conducted in the laboratory which showed that when the fluid was heated to high levels of evaporation, the aerodynamic acceptance test was not met and with further evaporation, the fluid solidified. This does not occur with glycol-based fluids since glycol is a liquid. Furthermore, in the lab, mold developed on some exposed fluid left out in a Petri dish. The FAA has since removed this fluid from their list of qualified fluids in the official FAA Holdover Time Tables [1]. More recently, there have been newer fluids that are non-glycol-based, or have another FPD along with the glycol (low-glycol). These fluids all are qualified at least for aerodynamic performance and anti-icing endurance and two are on the current FAA list of qualified fluids. However, the specification has no tests to address stickiness, solidification or tendency for mold to form. For the foam, a test was added to the specification since this issue was arising equally with glycol-based fluids. As part of a grant from the FAA, AMIL is developing test protocols {{to be added to the}} test specifications to address the new potential issues that may be required of non-glycol fluids before their use on aircraft. Beyond the corrosion and foam issues for which tests currently exist in the specification, test for aerodynamic acceptance on evaporated heated and sheared fluids, tendency to from mold and slipperiness are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Cyclodepsipeptides of the enniation-, PF 1022 - and verticilide-family {{represent}} a diverse class of highly interesting natural products {{with respect to}} their manifold biological activities. However, until now no practicable solid-phase synthesis of these compounds has been accomplished, probably due to the problematic combination of N-methyl amino acids and hydroxycarboxylic acids. The first part of this work deals with the development of synthetic methods to get access to the building blocks needed for the solid-phase synthesis of the anthelmintic PF 1022 A, its commercial analogue emodepside and a library of PF 1022 - and bassianolide analogues. The building blocks except the (R) -(p-morpholinophenyl) -lactic acid (morphPhLac) were available via standard procedures. Subsequently two enantioselective methods were developed. One is using an enzymatic procedure consisting of a cofactor regenerating redox system working with the enzymes D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH). The enzymatic system reduces α-oxocarboxylic acid derivatives enantioselectively to the corresponding lactic acid derivatives. The cofactor (NADH) is regenerated by reducing NAD in the presence of FDH and a <b>formate</b> <b>salt.</b> The enzymes can be reused by using a membrane reactor. The other method is based on a metal catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation to reduce enol esters enanti-oselectively. Both methods provide several derivatives in high yields and enantiomeric purities. In the second part the building blocks were used to develop different methods for a solid-phase synthesis of PF 1022 A, its commercial analogue emodepside and other PF 1022 - and bassianolide-analogues on Kaiser- and Wang-resin. One method, using didepsipeptide building blocks, could be developed on Kaiser- and Wang-resin. The Kaiser-resin has the advantage that a cyclizative cleavage of the linear depsipeptide to the final cyclooctadepsipeptide is possible. PF 1022 A and emodepside could be synthesized in excellent overall yields. For PF 1022 A it was also developed on Wang-resin. The Wang-resin was chosen because of its more stable linkage to the substrate. So it’s possible to choose the solid support, dependent on the properties of the building blocks needed for the cyclodepsipeptide derivative. In a second method single building blocks were used for a stepwise solid-phase synthesis of PF 1022 A on Wang-resin. This method allows structural variations in each step and it was possible to synthesize PF 1022 A, emodepside and three PF 1022 -analogues. Both methods provide the basis for the solid-phase synthesis of cyclodepsipeptide libraries with a high probability of anthelmintic, antibacterial or insecticidal activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} {{molecules}} adsorbed on high surface catalysts {{have been studied}} with infrared absorbance and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The well-separated infrared vibrational spectra have been used mainly to identify the various surface species by comparison with known compounds. The frequency shifts in the molecular stretching modes indicate the strengthening or weakening of the bonds of the molecules upon adsorption. The NMR spectra {{have been used to}} quantify the distributions among the surface states and to describe the motional properties of the adsorbed molecules. The NMR data were obtained through the application of several recently developed multiple-pulse techniques. By analyzing the spin-lattice relaxation times, the dipolar interactions, and the chemical shift anisotropies, it has been possible to separate the overlapping NMR spectra and determine the molecular symmetries, bond lengths, {{and the nature of the}} adsorption site. The results of these two techniques were combined to describe the adsorbed states of CO on Rh dispersed on Al 2 O 3, and the distribution of formic acid on zeolite surfaces. The infrared spectroscopy confirmed the previous indentification of three surface CO states; linear and bridged sites that form on Rh atoms in clusters on the Al 2 O 3, and dicarbonyl species on isolated Rh atoms. The desorption rate at 295 K is very slow. All three states readily exchange with CO(g) at 295 K, but only the dicarbonyl species exchanges at temperatures below 200 K. H 2 CO decomposed on the dispersed Rh into adsorbed CO states, with no evidence of any HxCO surface states, though there was further demonstration of isolated Rh atom sites. The 13 C NMR results quantified the distribution of the three surface sites, and thus calibrated the infrared absorbances, as well as the local motions on the three sites. The infrared spectra of formic acid on the Y zeolites suggested the presence of unidentate and bidentate formate species on the surface. The bidentate structure was the dominant species on the more catalytically active zeolite. The combination of the results of several multiple-pulse NMR techniques are analyzed to measure the site distribution between the unidentate and bidentate species, as well as to further describe the bidentate formate ion.

This range is evaluated in simulant tests at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). A minimum range of allowable acid additions is needed to provide operational flexibility and to handle typical uncertainties in process and analytical measurements used to set acid additions during processing. The range of allowable acid additions {{is a function of}} the composition of the feed to DWPF. Feed changes that lead to a smaller range of allowable acid additions have the potential to impact decisions related to wash endpoint control of DWPF feed composition and to the introduction of secondary waste streams into DWPF. A limited program was initiated in SRNL in 2001 to study the issue of {{hydrogen generation}}. The program was reinitiated at the end of fiscal year 2004. The primary motivation for the study is that a real potential exists to reduce the conservatism in the range of allowable acid additions in DWPF. Increasing the allowable range of acid additions can allow decisions on the sludge wash endpoint or the introduction of secondary waste streams to DWPF to be based on other constraints such as glass properties, organic carbon in the melter off-gas, etc. The initial phase of the study consisted of a review of site reports and off-site literature related to catalytic hydrogen generation from formic acid and/or <b>formate</b> <b>salts</b> by noble metals. Many things are already known about hydrogen generation during waste processing. This phase also included the development of an experimental program to improve the understanding of hydrogen generation. This phase is being documented in WSRC-TR- 2002 - 00034. A number of areas were identified where an improved understanding would be beneficial. A phased approach was developed for new experimental studies related to hydrogen generation. The first phase of new experimental work consisted of six simulations of the DWPF Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT). This phase had four objectives, but the primary focus was on the effect of mercury on hydrogen generation and SRAT processing. These objectives were to: (1) Obtain SRAT processing data at three different mercury concentrations. (2) Obtain comparable data for mercury added as HgO or as Hg(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 }.

In Chapter 1 the applications of radioactive isotopes in biological and clinical research is surveyed, with {{particular emphasis on}} the value of #beta#-emitting tritium and positron-emitting carbon- 11. In Chapter 2 we report the use of the non-radioactive hydrogen isotope, deuterium, as a surrogate for tritium in the development of microwave-enhanced labelling procedures, based on catalytic hydrogen transfer to olefins (e. g. styrene, styrene derivatives, cinnamic acid and its derivatives). Hydrogen or deuterium donors (e. g. <b>formate</b> <b>salts)</b> were used alone or in combination with other sources (e. g. D_ 2 O). The method was found to give fully hydrogenated products using very short microwave irradiation times (#approx# 2 min) and was highly reproducible. Importantly, the method is environmentally clean, as when extended to tritiated formates little or no radioactive waste is produced. In Chapter 3 we explored the labelling of CGP 62349 #left brace# 3 -[1 -(R) -[3 -(4 -methoxybenzyl) phosphinyl- 2 -(S) -hydroxy-propyl-amino]ethyl]benzoic acid#right brace#, a #gamma#-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA_B) receptor antagonist, with carbon- 11 in order to provide a prospective radioligand for medical imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). Labelling agents, [" 1 " 1 C]iodomethane and [" 1 " 1 C]methyl triflate, prepared by improved methods, were used in the rapid methylation of desmethyl-CGP 62349. Substantially higher radiochemical yields (78 %) of [" 1 " 1 C]CGP 62349 were achieved by the new methods compared to that produced in a previously published procedure (9 %). In addition, the use of [" 1 " 1 C]methyl triflate rather than [" 1 " 1 C]iodomethane has the advantage of giving a high radiochemical yield and a lower amount of carrier. In Chapter 4 we report on the use of [" 1 " 1 C]carbon monoxide as a labelling agent. This has been done in two ways, namely by investigating, (i) the direct insertion of the carbonyl group into amines and (ii) by the palladium(II) -mediated cross coupling carbonylations of organostannanes with either aryl iodides or diaryliodonium salts. [" 1 " 1 C]Carbon monoxide insertion into lithiated amines was found to be impractical. Palladium(II) -mediated cross coupling " 1 " 1 C-carbonylation was found to provide an efficient means to label substituted benzophenones. High radiochemical yields were achieved under very mild reaction conditions and in short reaction times (1 min). When various substituted diaryliodonium salts were used to partner phenyltributylstannane, the expected [" 1 " 1 C]ketones were produced in moderate radiochemical yields (30 - 43 %). By the use of variously substituted arylstannanes with diphenyliodonium bromide, several [" 1 " 1 C]ketones were rapidly synthesised in exceptionally high radiochemical yields (typically 98 %).

According to Fleming [2], “Leg and gait disorders have been a considerable problem for the broiler industry, and although recent genetic, management and nutritional approaches have improved the situ-ation, there remains scope for further improve-ment ” (p. 179).

40|$|SUMMARY: An organism, {{resembling}} Microbacterium lacticum, {{was found}} to be stimulated by liver or yeast extract in a medium composed of glucose, amino acids, vitamins, adenine, guanine, uracil, ammonium <b>formate,</b> and mineral <b>salts.</b> These complex materials could be replaced by comparable concentrations of porphyrin-containing compounds and by extremely low concentrations of ferrichrome, coprogen, or terregens factor, which are thought to act as intracellular ‘iron transport factors’. In 1952 the discoveries of three new organic compounds of biological interest were announced. These were coprogen (Hesseltine et al. 1952), ferrichrome (Neilands, 1952), and terregens factor (Lochhead, Burton & Thexton, 1952). Coprogen, an essential growth factor for the fungus Pilobolus, is produced by various bacteria (including actinomycetes) and fungi (Hesseltine et al. 1953). Ferrichrome was isolated from Ustilago sphaerogena and can replace coprogen in the nutrition of Pilobolus. Terregens factor is produced by Arthrobacter pascens and promotes the growth of A. terregens, a requirement which can also be met by coprogen and ferrichrome (Burton, Sowden & Lochhead, 1954) ...|$|R
50|$|Major {{oxidative}} {{degradation products}} of MDEA include monoethanol amine (MEA), methyl-aminoethanol (MAE), diethanolamine (DEA), amino acids bicine, glycine and hydroxyethyl sarcosine (HES), formyl amides of MAE and DEA, ammonia, and stable <b>salts</b> <b>formate,</b> glycolate, acetate, and oxalate. In an industrial plan that utilizes MDEA, oxidative degradation {{is most likely}} to shift to the cross exchanger where temperatures are greater than 70 °C. Higher temperatures and higher CO2 loading accelerate the rate of degradation, resulting in an increase of alkalinity loss as well as total formate production. While MDEA is more resistant to degradation as a standalone compared to MEA, MDEA is preferentially degraded when in an MDEA/MEA blend. Because of the formation of DEA and MAE, which could form nitroso-compounds or diethylnitrosamine and diethylnitraine, the blend could potentially have an adverse impact in terms of atmospheric admissions. In the Boundary Dam plant, emissions increased when CO2 loading of lean amine increased for the blend and MEA. However, decreasing the lean loading increases the reboiler heat duty, which results in an obvious tradeoff between emissions and heat duty or energy costs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSupercritical fluid {{chromatography}} (SFC) {{is frequently}} {{used for the}} analysis and separation of non-polar metabolites, but remains relatively underutilised {{for the study of}} polar molecules, even those which pose difficulties with established reversed-phase (RP) or hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographic (HILIC) methodologies. Here, we present a fast SFC-MS method for the analysis of medium and high-polarity (− 7 ≤cLogP≤ 2) compounds, designed for implementation in a high-throughput metabonomics setting. Sixty polar analytes were first screened to identify those most suitable for inclusion in chromatographic test mixtures; then, a multi-dimensional method development study was conducted to determine the optimal choice of stationary phase, modifier additive and temperature for the separation of such analytes using SFC. The test mixtures were separated on a total of twelve different column chemistries at three different temperatures, using CO 2 -methanol-based mobile phases containing a variety of polar additives. Chromatographic performance was evaluated with a particular emphasis on peak capacity, overall resolution, peak distribution and repeatability. The results suggest that a new generation of stationary phases, specifically designed for improved robustness in mixed CO 2 -methanol mobile phases, can improve peak shape, peak capacity and resolution for all classes of polar analytes. A significant enhancement in chromatographic performance was observed for these urinary metabolites on the majority of the stationary phases when polar additives such as ammonium <b>salts</b> (<b>formate,</b> acetate and hydroxide) were included in the organic modifier, and the use of water or alkylamine additives was found to be beneficial for specific subsets of polar analytes. The utility of these findings was confirmed by the separation of a mixture of polar metabolites in human urine using an optimised 7 min gradient SFC method, where the use of the recommended column and co-solvent combination resulted in a significant improvement in chromatographic performance...|$|R
40|$|Blocking of {{petroleum}} producing pipelines with clathrate hydrates of natural gases {{is a large}} issue in the industry. It causes loss of income in addition with health, safety and environmental concerns. This master thesis considers inhibition and dissociation of clathrate hydrates of natural gases with the thermodynamic inhibitor potassium formate. Potassium <b>formate</b> is a <b>salt</b> frequently used during drilling operations, but the writer has not found information about the usage of the salt as a thermodynamic inhibitor in petroleum production. Its application as a thermodynamic inhibitor is of large interest due to its properties, especially for shut-in wells as the salt is considered very heavy and has a large solubility in water. The distribution of the salts sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium formate (HCOOK) in a two-meter vertical pipe was investigated to simulate a shut-in well or riser. The salt solutions {{were added to the}} top of the distilled water filled pipe. Pycnometers were used to measure the brine densities at different heights in the pipe. Higher densities corresponded with more salt. The hypothesis about the heavy HCOOK salt accumulating at the bottom of the pipe was not confirmed, when it was found that both salts became almost homogeneously dispersed in the pipe after short time for all brine concentrations investigated. It means that the salt would inhibit the whole water phase and not only the lower or upper part, as the conventional hydrate inhibitors in the petroleum industry are known to do. Potassium formate s quick distribution to a homogeneous mix could improve flow assurance in production wells. It is an advantage for producing wells to have a homogeneous salt distribution, because the whole water phase gets protected against hydrates. But it is a disadvantage for hydrate dissociation in the bottom a pipe if the inhibitor should be used to penetrate the water phase and accumulate at the bottom to dissociate hydrates...|$|R
30|$|The {{preservation}} of the wellbore stability has fundamental importance during oil and gas well drilling. About 75  % of the side walls {{of oil and gas}} wellbores consist of shale and mud rocks, which are responsible for 90  % of the wellbore instability problems (Corrêa and Nascimento 2005; Jiang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Huang et al. 2007). Several types of shales with a significant amount of clay minerals are very reactive once they come into contact with water, and they can cause serious wellbore instability during drilling, like hole shrinkage and hole sloughing and caving (Hisham 2006; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Zhang et al. 2013 a, b). Wellbore stability has been studied for a long time using mainly two quite different approaches. Some authors consider the problem exclusively {{from the point of view}} of rock mechanics and others from the point of view of chemical interactions between shales and fluids (Wu et al. 1993; Corrêa and Nascimento 2005). Based on the second approach, a variety of water-based drilling fluids and non-aqueous fluids have been applied; meanwhile, many types of wellbore stabilizers have been developed. These wellbore stabilizers have been classified into several groups, including inorganic <b>salts,</b> <b>formate,</b> polymers with special shale affinity, asphalts, sugars and sugar derivatives, glycerol, polyalcohol, and silicates (Van Oort 2003; Guo et al. 2006; Khodja et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2011; Zhong et al. 2011). Among of them, asphalts as one type of cheap and effective stabilizer can improve wellbore stabilization mainly through plugging or sealing, and they have been divided into four varieties according to modification methods: natural asphalt (no modification, mined from deposit), oxidized asphalt (oxidation by air blown to heighten softening point), sulfonated bitumen (changed into asphalt sulfonate partly to enhance water solubility), and emulsified asphalt (oil in water emulsion to improve dispersion in the drilling fluid and adsorption on the rock surface) (Sharma and Wunderlich 1987; Wang et al. 2005). All types of emulsified asphalts are mostly produced by shearing and thinning a mixture of asphalt, water, and emulsifier using an emulsion machine or a colloid mill. Ionic surfactants are often used as emulsifier, so the emulsified asphalt droplets are mostly charged and possess an electric double layer structure, according to the Stern model (Xie et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2014). Cationic emulsified asphalts have taken the place of anionic ones in drilling fluids to promote inhibition and adsorption (Shi et al. 2003; Wang and Xia 2006). In this paper, a novel cationic emulsified asphalt was investigated to overcome serious instability problems during drilling hydratable shale formations. It had good colloidal stability, particle size distribution, compatibility, sealing property, and flexible adaptability.|$|R
