40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{extraction}} temperature,extraction time,alcohol concentration, ratio of material to liquid (g/ml) on extraction yield of <b>natural</b> <b>yellow</b> pigment from waste almond shell were studied. The optimum conditions {{were determined by}} L 9 (3 4) the orthogonal test. The optimum extraction conditions are the extraction temperature at 75 ℃;the extraction time for 2 h; the extraction agent concentration of 20 %ethanol; the material-liquid ration (g/ml) 1 : 15. The extraction yield of <b>natural</b> <b>yellow</b> pigment from almond shell is 6. 25 %,The order of effects are extraction temperature> extraction time> ratio of material to liquid(g/ml) > alcohol concentration. This research provides the theoretical basis for the industrial production of the extraction of natural almond shell pigment and provides a new way for the re-use of the abandoned almond shell...|$|R

50|$|With the {{addition}} or elimination of certain impurities under controlled conditions, diamonds of various color can be produced. Since nitrogen is {{abundant in the}} atmosphere, the HPHT process {{is more likely to}} produce bright yellow diamonds than any other color (although <b>natural</b> <b>yellow</b> diamonds often have higher value than white diamonds). The yellow tint occurs when approximately five out of each 100,000 carbon atoms in the diamond crystal lattice are replaced with nitrogen atoms.|$|R
