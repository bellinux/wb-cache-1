5|$|The early Svetambara canons and teachings {{do not use}} {{the terms}} anekāntavāda and syādvāda, but contain teachings in {{rudimentary}} form without giving it proper structure or establishing it as a separate doctrine. Śvētāmbara text, Sutrakritanga contains references to Vibhagyavāda, which, according to Hermann Jacobi, {{is the same as}} syādvāda and saptibhaṅgī. For example, Jacobi in his 1895 translation interpreted vibhagyavada as syadvada, the former mentioned in the Svetambara Jain <b>canonical</b> text Sutrakritanga.

5|$|When the B1 <b>canonical</b> {{labeling}} is lost {{through a}} transformation, {{the result is}} relabeled to the <b>canonical</b> B1 usage and then catalogued under this ID. This approach generated 416 equivalence classes, somewhat less effective than the theoretical 336 minimum limit for a full reduction. Application of counting symmetry patterns for duplicate paired digits achieved reduction to 174 and then to 71 equivalence classes. The introduction of equivalence classes based on band counting symmetry (subsequent to Felgenhauer/Jarvis by Russell) reduced the equivalence classes to a minimum generating set of 44.|$|E

5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{preserved}} in fragments quoted or summarized by various early Church Fathers. The {{full extent of}} the original gospel is unknown; according to a list of <b>canonical</b> and apocryphal works drawn up in the 9th century known as the Stichometry of Nicephorus, the gospel was 2200 lines, just 300 lines shorter than Matthew. Based on the surviving fragments, the overall structure of the gospel appears to have been similar to the <b>canonical</b> ones. It consisted of a narrative of the life of Jesus which included his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, last supper, crucifixion, and resurrection. The gospel also contained sayings of Jesus. The events in the life of Jesus have been interpreted in a way that reflects Jewish ideas present in a Hellenistic cultural environment.|$|E

5|$|The four <b>canonical</b> gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) are the {{foremost}} {{sources for the}} life and message of Jesus. However, {{other parts of the}} New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23. Acts of the Apostles (Acts 10:37–38 and Acts 19) refers to the early ministry of Jesus and its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1–11 says more about the Ascension of Jesus (also mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16) than the <b>canonical</b> gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the gospels, the words or instructions of Jesus are cited several times (1 Corinthians 7:10–11, 9:14, 11:23–25, 2 Corinthians 12:9).|$|E

5|$|The term anekāntavāda is {{not found}} in early texts {{considered}} <b>canonical</b> by Shwetambara tradition of Jainism (denied by Digambara tradition as <b>canonical).</b> However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Shwetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective. The word anekantavada was coined by Acharya Siddhasen Divakar to significant the teaching of Mahavira that truth can be expressed in infinite ways. The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine {{is found in the}} Tattvarthasutra of Umasvati, and is considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects.
