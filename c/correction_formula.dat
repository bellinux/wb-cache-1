40|$|Objective: The use of {{reported}} instead of measured {{height and weight}} induces a bias in prevalence rates for overweight and obesity. Therefore, <b>correction</b> <b>formulas</b> are necessary. Methods: Self-reported and measured height and weight were available from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) baseline study (2003 - 2006) from 3, 468 adolescents aged 11 - 17 years. With regression analyses, <b>correction</b> <b>formulas</b> for height and weight were developed. Cross-validation was conducted in order to validate and compare the formulas. Corrected BMI was calculated, and corrected prevalence rates were estimated. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for overweight and obesity were calculated. Results: Through the correction procedure, the mean differences between reported and measured height and weight become remarkably smaller and thus the estimated prevalence rates more accurate. The corrected proportions for overweight and obesity are less under-reported, while the corrected proportions for underweight are less over-reported. Sensitivity for overweight and obesity increased after correction. Specificity remained high. Conclusion: The validation process showed that the <b>correction</b> <b>formulas</b> are an appropriate tool to correct self-reports on an individual level in order to estimate corrected prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in adolescents for studies which have collected self-reports only...|$|R

40|$|In validating a {{selection}} test (x) {{as a predictor}} of y, an incomplete xy data set must often be dealt with. A well-known <b>correction</b> <b>formula</b> is available for estimating the xy correlation in some total group using the xy data of the selected cases and x data of the unselected cases. The formula yields the r[subscript yх] correlation (1) when the regression of y on x is linear and homoscedastic and (2) when selection can be assumed to be based on x alone. Although previous research has considered the accuracy of the <b>correction</b> <b>formula</b> when either Condition 1 or 2 is violated, no studies have considered the most realistic case where both Conditions 1 and 2 are simultaneously violated. In the present study six real data sets and five simulated selection models were used to investigate the accuracy of the <b>correction</b> <b>formula</b> when neither assumption is satisfied. Each of the data sets violated the linearity and/or homogeneity assumptions. Further, the selection models represent cases where selection is not a function of x alone. The results support two basic conclusions. First, the <b>correction</b> <b>formula</b> is not robust to violations in Conditions 1 and 2. Reasonably small errors occur only for very modest degrees of selection. Secondly, although biased, the <b>correction</b> <b>formula</b> can be less biased than the uncorrected correlation for certain distribution forms. However, for other distribution forms, the corrected correlation can be less accurate than the uncorrected correlation. A description of this latter type of distribution form is given...|$|E
30|$|We {{are aware}} of two studies {{addressing}} the question how to correct SUVs for variable scan time [10, 11].

A second investigation of the scan time variability effect and an empirical formula how to correct for it has been reported in [11]. This investigation was restricted to breast cancer patients, and the proposed <b>correction</b> <b>formula</b> resulted from purely empirical observation of how SUV varied in these patients over time without explicitly considering the influence of the AIF shape. Here, the important observation was made that the rate of SUV change over time is approximately proportional to the magnitude of the SUV itself.|$|E

40|$|Univariate {{and multivariate}} {{corrections}} for range restriction were compared using Navy applicant {{scores on the}} Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). Two Navy school ASVAB selector composites were used separately and together to simulate three selection situations for nine selection ratios (SRs). The selectors then were used as predictors. Composite validities (the ASVAB Mechanical Comprehension test was the criterion) were corrected using the univariate and the general multivariate formulas. In general, multivariate corrections were more accurate than univariate corrections, notably when the univariate explicit selection variable was negatively skewed and correction violations (linearity and homoscedasticity) did not offset each other. Multivariate correction accuracy was attributed to the inclusion of variables with adequate distributional properties, the compensatory effects of regression weights, and the related psychometric principle that differentially weighting {{a large number of}} correlated predictor variables has little impact on a multiple correlation.

40|$|Objectives: The inverse {{relationship}} between QT interval variability (QTV) and T wave amplitude potentially confounds QT variability assessment. We quantified {{the influence of the}} T wave amplitude on QTV in a comprehensive dataset and devised a <b>correction</b> <b>formula.</b> Methods: Three ECG datasets of healthy subjects were analyzed to model the relationship between T wave amplitude and QTV. To derive a generally valid <b>correction</b> <b>formula,</b> linear regression analysis was used. The proposed <b>correction</b> <b>formula</b> was applied to patients enrolled in the Evaluation of Defibrillator in Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Treatment Evaluation trial (DEFINITE) to assess the prognostic significance of QTV for all-cause mortality in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Results: A strong {{inverse relationship}} between T wave amplitude and QTV was demonstrated, both in healthy subjects (R 2 = 0. 68, p < 0. 001) and DEFINITE patients (R 2 = 0. 20, p < 0. 001). Applying the T wave amplitude correction to QTV achieved 2. 5 -times better group discrimination between patients enrolled in the DEFINITE study and healthy subjects. Kaplan-Meier estimator analysis showed that T wave amplitude corrected QTVi is inversely related to survival (p < 0. 01) and a significant predictor of all-cause mortality. Conclusion: We have proposed a simple <b>correction</b> <b>formula</b> for improved QTV assessment. Using this correction, predictive value of QTV for all-cause mortality in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy has been demonstrated...|$|E
