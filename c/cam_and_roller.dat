40|$|The {{automotive}} {{industry and the}} design of engines are strongly ruled by performance and legislation demands. First order aspects defining the main functions of a component are well known and new challenges appear at a lower scale. Wear reduction {{is defined as a}} second order problem and requires decreasing the scale of observation of components down to roughness. This thesis work and its aim lie within the scope of wear improvements and are focused on the injection cam/roller contact of heavy duty diesel engines. In order to reach the aim several material and methods are used: a valve train rig test, roughness characterisation and different manufacturing processes. It is shown by experiments that the flank and nose of injection cams are specific areas with specific roughness (higher density of summits Sds) compared {{to the rest of the}} cam. The wear is characterized by rounded-off of summits (Ssc). From those results and since wear processes are strongly linked to the pressure generated between the mating surfaces, the development of a rough contact model is of great interest. An elastic rough contact model is implemented and improved later on by an elasto-plastic description of materials. The simulations are validated by a wear test and are used to rank the ability of surfaces (both <b>cam</b> <b>and</b> <b>roller)</b> to face wear problems. The ratio of plastically deformed peaks shows that the flank and nose of the cam are reacting badly to pressures. Additionally the rough contact allows ranking/optimization of different machining processes with respect to their expected functional contact performance. Future work will be to use such a model to choose a good combination of surfaces (<b>cam</b> <b>and</b> <b>roller)</b> in order to reduce wear...|$|E

Drivers also reported that, when the engines were standing or moving at very slow speed, it was difficult to reverse since the cam rollers were not readily able to climb over the inclined surfaces leading from one cam to another. Trouble was also experienced with steam leaking past the tappet spindles into the cam boxes where it boiled up the oil and caused it to overflow from the cam boxes. This was overcome by serrating the collars of the spindle bushes to allow the steam to escape and prevent entry into the cam boxes.|$|R
40|$|Epicyclic {{mechanisms}} {{have found}} wide applications in industry, especially in automobiles and robotics. Low efficiency {{due to the}} high gearing power occurring in an epicyclic train is an important problem. This thesis develops a novel family of epicyclic transmissions, based on <b>cams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rollers.</b> This kind of cam-based mechanical transmissions, Speed-o-Cam (SoC), offers features such as high stiffness, low backlash, and high efficiency. We develop multi-lobbed cam profiles, the sun <b>cam</b> <b>and</b> the ring <b>cam,</b> which comprise an epicyclic cam train (ECT) with the roller follower. New design criteria are established: the generalized transmission index (GTI) and the contact ratio in cam transmissions. The GTI is an index that quantifies the force transmission quality in a mechanism, thereby generalizing the pressure angle, the transmission angle, and the transmission index (TI) proposed by Sutherland and Roth in 1973. The contact ratio is an index of the quantity of overlap occurring between two conjugate cams during transmission. A contact ratio greater than unity guarantees smooth motion during operation. In order to avoid "poor" transmission, we apply an undercutting technique on the cam profile to achieve a smooth motion. We introduce two new concepts, virtual power and virtual power ratio, and derive an original algorithm to compute the efficiency in an epicyclic train upon the assumption that power loss is due only to friction upon meshing. The results show that friction has a larger effect on the total efficiency of an epicyclic train than on a simple train. Examples are given to validate this algorithm, by comparison of our results with previous works. The dual-wheel transmission (DWT), proposed elsewhere using epicyclic gear trains (EGTs), is designed here with epicyclic trains of <b>cams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rollers.</b> We optimize the DWT to achieve a compact design and a high transmission performance. Furthermore, we define the total transmission index (TTI), which allow us to evaluate the final DWT design. Two virtual prototypes of the DWT, the central and the offset versions, are generated: the former is capable of quasi-omnidirectional mobility, the latter of full omnidirectional mobility. Finally, we include a general kinematic analysis of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) with single-wheel drives and apply this method to WMRs with DWT units; then, we obtain symbolic solutions to the direct kinematics (DK) and inverse kinematics (IK) problems, for both central and offset types of units...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{a method}} for the dynamic {{optimization}} of a mechanical manipulator is proposed. A mechanical manipulator is, in general, a device able to load, to unload or to move objects automatically and rapidly, acting by its own or as a module of more complex mechanisms (parallel manipulators, pallets chargers, dischargers, etc.). This kind of manipulator executes the desired movement by virtue of a conjugate cams transmission, which assures a pre-fixed trajectory during the whole position cycle of the end-effector. If the accuracy {{at the end of}} motion is always very high, backlash effects and elasticity in the kinematic chain can cause excessive vibration phenomena and, consequently, overstress effects, which can damage the <b>cam</b> <b>and</b> <b>roller</b> surfaces in brief time. This paper, after a framing of the problem, suggests a motion profile which appears particularly suitable to improve the dynamic behaviour caused by system compliances (mainly backlash) ...|$|E
40|$|Engine {{development}} is now driven by cost, performance, governmental regulations and customer demands. Several {{of the requirements}} have tribological associations. Tribological improvements which consist in lowering friction and improving wear resistance in engines, will {{play a major role}} to increase reliability and life cycle. The components studied here are parts of the valvetrain mechanism of heavy-duty Diesel engines. The injection cam {{is one of the most}} problematic parts of the camshaft, as it is subjected to high pressures from the fuel injector. Lubrication is of significant importance in the prevention of cam failure caused by wear. However, the satisfactory lubrication of the <b>cam</b> <b>and</b> <b>roller</b> contact has proved to be one of the most difficult tribological design challenges to take up. For a lubricated contact, the degree of separation between surfaces has a very strong influence on the type and amount of wear. This degree of separation is termed as specific film thickness; its value provides a measure of the severity of asperities interaction in the lubricated contact. In this report, attention is drawn on the evaluation of oil film thickness in the cam-roller contact, in order to predict regimes of lubrication and thus to identify the probable wear zones of the injection cam. Then, confrontation with experimental results is performed(observation of worn cam surfaces). Future work to achieve is to discover the influence of the different parameters on oil film thickness, by performing a multivariate analysis. The next step will focus on modelling the wear of injection cams, and finally establishing quantified correlations between wear and specific film thickness...|$|E
40|$|Modelling and {{simulation}} of friction {{is a research}} issue that still requires an extensive amount of input from the scientific community. In a lubricated system, the dissipation of energy {{is connected to the}} direct contact between the surfaces, or more precisely the tribofilms, {{as well as of the}} shearing of the lubricant film. Elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) is a lubrication regime which is characteristic for contacts found in machine components such as in roller bearings, gears and cam mechanisms. These contacts have in common that they carry load on a very small/concentrated area and exhibit elastic deformations that are much greater than the thickness of the hydrodynamically formed film. There are a vast number of parameters that affect the friction in EHL contacts and it is a challenge to include other than the most basic ones in the model. The most advanced and sophisticated models are very complex with millions of degrees of freedom and are, therefore, not yet feasible to conduct parametric studies with. The extreme conditions associated with EHL, i. e., nm thin films, with phase transition from liquid to solid, GPa pressure, temperature increase with considerable implications on lubricant flow and surface chemistry, etc., makes it even more difficult to model these systems. The shape of the contacting parts further complicates modeling of EHL. More precisely, an EHL contact can geometrically be either of a line, circular, elliptic or truncated contact type. Since the line contact appears between two cylindrical shaped bodies of infinite length, it permits a 2 D-model for the flow and there are analytical solutions, in the most elementary cases. The circular and the elliptic contacts more are complicated. The case when the surfaces are fully separated by the lubricant film has, however, been addressed by many researchers, who also have presented numerical predictions validated by experimental data. The finite line contact appears to be the most challenging type, but it is also the only physically reasonable model for EHL contacts where the edge effects cannot be neglected. In this work, both steady state and time dependent, fully deterministic models are utilized and further developed to enable the study edge effects under variable operating conditions in <b>cam</b> <b>and</b> <b>roller</b> follower systems. The numerical investigations were specified so that generic knowledge about friction in these systems would be generated and also to provide validation data for the development of a semi-analytical, low degree freedom model, for rapid estimation of friction. The main objective was to design such a low degree of freedom model so that it can be employed in a multibody dynamic model, requiring friction estimation in milliseconds. The semi-analytical low degree of freedom model developed in this work, takes thermal effects into account and is built on an advanced and well-characterized rheological model, including lubricant shear thinning, in order to estimate the viscosity and volume of the lubricant. The model was utilized to perform friction prediction covering a range of operating conditions, which were also run in an experimental investigation using a ball-on-disk test device. The results turned out to compare well, suggesting that it constitutes a suitable foundation for further developments.

40|$|The {{automotive}} {{industry and the}} design of engines are strongly ruled by performance and legislation demands. In the valve train, mechanical components such as camshafts and rollers are defined by specifications including more and more constraints concerning their ability to face wear thus prolonging lifetime. The aim of the thesis is to develop tools facilitating the choice between different manufacturing processes for wear optimization purposes of <b>cam</b> <b>and</b> <b>roller</b> components for IC engine valve trains. Tools are both experimental and theoretical. For the experimental part, statistical and relocated studies of wear have been performed. It is shown that measuring the very same surface before and after experiments is preferable to understand wear mechanisms of cams and rollers. A set of analysis tools for describing changes between unworn and relocated worn surfaces is developed. As results, {{it is found that}} the predominant mechanism of wear for cams and rollers is a flattening of asperities: surfaces are pressed and plastic deformations occur. In parallel, simulations have been developed to explain theoretically the wear observed. Micro and macro simulations are developed to predict the ability of a given manufacturing process to resist wear. For the microscopic simulation, a rough contact model including elasto-plastic behavior of materials is used and shows good correlations with experiments. Concerning the macroscopic simulation, a model including form deviations due to manufacturing is developed and computes oil film thicknesses and deformations. The different parameters computed by both simulations are indicators of the wear performance of different surfaces. It is shown that such simulation can rank different manufacturing processes in terms of ability to face wear...|$|E
40|$|Surfaces {{subjected}} to rolling and sliding contacts may suffer from contact fatigue. The <b>cam</b> <b>and</b> <b>roller</b> follower mechanism {{is a typical}} rolling and sliding contact. This thesis deals with the running in aspects to avoid high stress variation that leads to fatigue wear and the aspect {{of what happens to}} indentation damages that occurs on the surface if there are any particles in the lubricant. The particles can be both self generated and be present from dirt. This thesis also deals with how the oil and the additives in the oil affect the contact properties. The thesis contains six papers. One of the papers that presents the test apparatus used for all the experiments is already published on the Nordtrib conference in June 2004 and the other papers, which deal with all the experiments done, are sent in for publication. The experiment of the running in behaviour with steel rollers has also been presented at the Leeds-Lyon-conference in August 2005. It is seen from the results that the running in occurs fast and there is a difference in the running in behaviour depending on if steel rollers or ceramic rollers are used. The ceramic roller has lower inertia that makes the roller easier to accelerate to get higher percentage of rolling in the contact. Higher amount of rolling and smoother surfaces, as the ceramic rollers have, give better lubrication properties and therefore the running in wear is smaller. The damage progress experiments show better ?healing? of the surface if there is some hardness difference. When combustion gases were used around the contacts, less visible tribolfilms were created on the cam surface. The tribofilms that were created consisted of Ca, P and Zn. The possible states of Zn inside the tribofilms are many, including zinc-phosphate, zinc-iron-phosphate, zinc-oxide and zinc-sulfide. The contact conditions had not been so tough that pure EP-films, mainly consisting of FeS, were formed. The tribofilms shown were blue and brown and the blue marks withstood a longer period of sputtering time until a clear iron signal, originating from the cam substrate, was detected than {{in the case of the}} brown marks...|$|E
40|$|Due to dynamic effects, clearances, {{manufacturing}} and assembly errors in form-closed cam mechanisms, the follower jump can also occur. For conjugate cam mechanisms {{a technique to}} avoid the follower jump {{without the use of}} a spring involves making the conjugate cam profiles bigger than the kinematical ones by adding an external offset. This strategy produces an interference fit between the conjugate <b>cam</b> profiles <b>and</b> the follower train. This paper presents an ordered procedure to study the influence that the planned interference fit has on the evaluation of the contact forces, the expected fatigue life of the <b>rollers,</b> contact pressures <b>and</b> the lubrication conditions. The study is based on a conjugate cam mechanism with translational roller followers used in a real automatic process for manufacturing muselets. A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model is proposed and the Hertzian theory for general profiles is used to model the nonlinear contact stiffness between the <b>cams</b> <b>and</b> the crowned <b>rollers.</b> The dynamic model predicts {{that it is difficult to}} obtain conjugate cam mechanisms with an infinite expected fatigue life of the rollers just by considering typical achievable manufacturing errors or clearances, and as happens in reality, a set-up process is highly recommended. The procedure is also tested with measured manufacturing errors on a coordinate measure machine—CMM—and with measured radial internal clearances for the rollers measured by an experimental apparatus. Also, to evaluate lubrication conditions, surface finishing measurements have been taken of the <b>cams</b> <b>and</b> the <b>rollers</b> with a surface profiler. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and validation of interactive computer software that aids the design procedures for cam mechanism design, thereby facilitating the optimised design of the mechanism. Attention is focussed on the disc cam-translating roller follower mechanism with respect to which a series of analytical programs have been developed which addresses the design of the complete mechanism. This broad view of the mechanism design as opposed to concentrating on specific features thereof as has hitherto been the case, has been a major objective of the work reported in this thesis. Each analytical program shows the means adopted to satisfy the limiting conditions imposed by kinematic constraints and strength limitations encountered in cam design. The software enables the establishment of the design specification for the manufacture of the cam itself along with as much data on the other features of the mechanism (i. e. the spring, follower, <b>and</b> <b>roller</b> on follower) as project time could permit.

40|$|Considering their {{tribological}} advantage, rolling/sliding contacts like gears, <b>cams</b> <b>and</b> <b>rollers</b> {{have adopted}} polymer-metal pairs in several engineering and domestic applications (copy machine, toys, pumps, etc.). The tribological behaviour of these applications is generally studied using real components or by standardized tribotests (ASTM). Although {{closer to the}} real application, investigations using real components are less effective because of the dynamicity involved in transfer layer, wear process, micro and macro slip characteristics and also due to the complexity in the contact geometry. In the current research, a twin-disc model representing the Hertzian line contact replicates the micro-slip whereas the macro-slip of the tribological system is achieved using different slip ratios. Efforts are made for microstructural characteristic through online imaging of contact surface to explore interaction between the mating surface and the dynamic behavior from transfer layer deposition. A computer vision system was developed for acquiring online micrographs of contact surface where a high-speed camera in concurrence with a microscope is used. Wear tests were conducted using polymer-metal pairs for offline and online investigations. Micrographs of the composite contact surface were acquired online at 7000 fps – 35000 fps. Transition of wear mechanisms observed {{during the course of}} wear elucidates the interaction level at different stages of wear. From the view point of wear mechanism a clear distinction between run-in (ploughing) and steady state (adhesion and plastic deformation) was observed. The online micrograph of contact surface at different intervals validates the back transfer of polymer to the parent material. The unsteady stage is dominated by abrasion on the other hand, as the wear proceeds a transition to adhesion occurs. The initially unfilled (rough) steel surface without transfer layers gains advantage from the asperity geometry to plough the polymer surface. However, after gaining transfer layer in the steel surface, adhesion becomes the dominant mechanism. Finally, a combination of adhesion and abrasion is evident due to the dynamic behavior of transfer layer. Thus online computer vision is an effective tool to characterize the stages of wear process and to understand the mechanism underneath. Understanding the mechanism in a parametric way gives a chance to make necessary alterations for effective design of tribological system. However, the adhesion coefficient between transfer layer and the polymer-steel pairs has to be validated...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} project investigates {{edge contact}} influence on pressure, lubricant film thickness, temperature, and stress distribution of finite line contacts under an elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) regime. This type of contact represents a common source {{of problems in}} engineering structures such as gears, <b>cams</b> <b>and</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, since non-conforming contact surfaces in such structures undergo intense stresses while transferring loads through relatively small contact areas. Additionally, they induce stressconcentration zones at their extremities; as a result, profile modification becomes necessary. The present study investigates influence of free edges on EHL characteristics of finite line contacts. The initial stage of the research develops a 3 D numerical model for the thermal, non-Newtonian EHL of general contact problems. A semi-analytical method (SAM), based on the Boussinesq half-space theory, is combined with a free boundary correction process to provide a fast and precise description of edge contact conditions. A modified finite difference expansion of the Couette term of the Reynolds equation guarantees computational stability, while the Carreau expression defines the shear-thinning response of the lubricant. Free boundary impact on tridimensional stress distribution is also investigated by extending the free-edge correction procedure to evaluate the levels of surface and subsurface stresses using SAM. The stress distribution data derived from this procedure are then contrasted with Finite Element Method (FEM) results using a two-level factorial comparison. Three dimensionless factors — contact slenderness, contact length ratio, and load — are examined. The comparison shows that the new model developed in this thesis provides {{a high level of}} precision in the evaluation of stress distributions, while computing more than 125 times faster than FEM simulations. This powerful model is then used to investigate and establish the influence of different roller profile modifications on EHL film shape, pressure and temperature distributions. Based on a series of detailed analyses of different roller profile corrections, it is found that a large radius crowning combined with rounding corners provides the most effective profile adjustment. In the last step of this study, this newly developed model is combined with a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) to arrive at formulas establishing crowning and corner rounding radii, which {{can be applied to the}} rapid design of optimal rollers. The formulas take into account three dimensionless factors — slenderness, load, and lubricant viscosity — and coefficients for the formulas are derived from the PSO results using a five-level factorial design. By concurrently optimizing three objective functions — contact pressure uniformity, film thickness stability, and maximum load capacity — the predictions of these formulas guarantee optimal profile modifications. This study contributes to the understanding of edge influence on EHL characteristics of finite line contacts, while offering a robust model for axial profile corrections of lubricated contact problems...|$|R

40|$|To {{solve the}} indetermination of forces {{existing}} in a form-closed cam mechanism formed by conjugate cams, where the {{contact between the}} <b>cams</b> <b>and</b> the follower <b>rollers</b> is constantly ensured by only the geometry of the elements, dynamic models that consider the elasticity of the elements must be proposed. Because the stiffness {{of the main elements}} is associated with the elasticity of the solids, tight variations in manufacturing and assembly errors modify the effective interference fit, which significantly affects the expected fatigue life of the mechanism, leading to a premature failure of the elements due to surface fatigue. Based on a real industrial application of a conjugate <b>cam</b> mechanism <b>and</b> using lumped-parameter models, the objectives of this paper are: first, to show {{that it is difficult to}} achieve a pure form-closed conjugate cam mechanism, with the expected fatigue life of the mechanism, by using only standard tolerance specifications; second, to compare the expected fatigue life and motor torque with other cam mechanism design strategies such as force-closed and the combination of force-closed and form-closed strategies, known as force-closed conjugate cam strategy. This paper based on simulation results demonstrates that this latest strategy can, thanks to a better control of the preload, easily achieve results very similar to the theoretical ones of a form-closed conjugate cam mechanism. A prototype of the mechanism of the force-closed conjugate cam strategy is also built. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|R
40|$|An {{electromagnetic}} brake/clutch device {{includes a}} drive shaft supported {{by at least}} one bearing for transmitting torque, a housing, affixed to prevent its rotation, surrounding the drive shaft, and an electromagnetically activated device within the housing to selectively prevent and allow rotation of the drive shaft. The electromagnetically activated device includes a plurality of cammed rollers to prevent counter-clockwise rotation of the drive shaft. The drive shaft includes a circumferential disk and the housing includes a reaction ring for engagement with the plurality of cammed rollers. The plurality of cammed rollers are released from engagement with the circumferential disk and the reaction ring by a plurality of tripping mechanisms within the housing. The tripping action uses the locking force to act as a release force merely by changing the boundary conditions of the roller interface angles. The tripping mechanisms include trippers for disengaging the plurality of <b>cammed</b> <b>rollers</b> <b>and</b> an anvil shaped portion for providing lateral movement of the trippers. The plurality of cammed rollers is preloaded to engagement with the circumferential disk and reaction ring by a spring, and is located with respect to an adjacent tripping mechanism with another spring...|$|R
40|$|As {{many other}} machines, the radial piston {{hydraulic}} motor contains {{a lot of}} tribological interfaces. One important area is the piston assembly and the journal bearing contact between the piston <b>and</b> <b>cam</b> <b>roller.</b> There exists good models to describe the performance of simpler geometries such as journal bearings, but when put into a system or when having a more complex geometry, the models do not apply very well. To be able to predict the tribological performance of such components, {{it is important to}} have a model that is able to include the real geometry and the properties of the system. A simulation model of the piston assembly in Hägglunds Compact hydraulic motor was built using FE software which made it easy to include the complex geometries. The model includes the deformation of the piston. The hydrodynamics is solved by using Reynolds equation. Density/pressure and viscosity/pressure dependency for the oil are included. The whole model was solved with the built in solvers in the software. Simulation results such as friction, hydrodynamic pressure and oil leakage was compared with test results. Good agreement between simulation and tests shows that this kind of model can be a useful tool in development and optimization of tribological systems.
