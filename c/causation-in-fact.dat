5|$|The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was {{established}} in 1988 in the United States by {{the passing of the}} National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, and is funded by a 75-cent tax on each vaccine dose. The program's aims were to maintain a steady supply of vaccines while, at the same time, allowing victims of vaccine injury to be compensated more efficiently than was previously possible. The program operates according to a no-fault principle. The family of Michelle Cedillo sought compensation from this program. Cedillo, a then 12-year-old female wheelchair user from Yuma, Arizona, was involved in the first of three test cases chosen by the government to represent the approximately 4,900 other vaccine-autism cases that had been brought before the court. Michelle Cedillo was born on August 30, 1994, and received thimerosal-containing vaccines during the first fifteen months of her life. On December 20, 1995, she received an MMR vaccine. Theresa and Michael Cedillo filed a vaccine injury claim on behalf of their daughter on December 9, 1998 for encephalopathy, but on January 14, 2002, changed their petition to a <b>causation-in-fact</b> claim, meaning they were arguing that Michelle developed autism {{as a result of the}} combined effects of thimerosal and the MMR vaccine. They did this as a result of a meeting that had taken place the previous year, between Theresa Cedillo and Andrew Wakefield, at a Defeat Autism Now! conference.|$|E

Having explained that the most recent approaches in this regard tend toward the recognition of the contractual nature of medical liability, the Author discusses the implications of such a solution, making specific reference to the following is sues: 1) the assignment of the burden of proof (along with the distinction between obligations of means and obligations of result) : 2) proof of causation (along with further reference to the difference between civil and criminal standards of proof regarding <b>causation-in-fact)</b> : 3) the role of informed consent: 4) the prescription regime. The final part of the Article investigates the rapid increase in medical malpractice litigation as a side-effect of the 2 ̆ 2 contractualization 2 ̆ 2 of medical liability, focusing on the strategies to follow in order to minimize expense claims [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Chicago Kent Law Review is the property of Chicago Kent Law Review and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder 2 ̆ 7 s express written permission.
