5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to <b>component</b> <b>failure.</b> The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E
25|$|Most {{in-flight}} shutdowns are harmless {{and likely}} to go unnoticed by passengers. For example, it may be prudent for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing {{in the event of}} a low oil pressure or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a compressor surge — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine’s inlet and tailpipe. A compressor surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine’s inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal <b>component</b> <b>failure</b> such as a broken blade. While this situation can be alarming, the engine may recover with no damage.|$|E
25|$|After the French Grand Prix on 1 July {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at various circuits across Europe between 3–6 July {{to prepare for}} the British Grand Prix. The Jordan, McLaren, Sauber, BAR and Jaguar teams tested at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza circuit. Heinz-Harald Frentzen set the fastest time on the first day, two-tenths of a second in front of Heidfeld. McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz recorded the fastest lap time on the second day. Irvine pulled out of the test sessions early because of reoccurring neck pains he had been suffering since June and was replaced by the team's test driver André Lotterer from the afternoon of the second day. Coulthard was quickest on the third day's running. Testing was suspended when Jordan test driver Ricardo Zonta spun off into a gravel trap after his car sustained a <b>component</b> <b>failure</b> and sustained heavy damage. Kimi Räikkönen for the Sauber team was fastest on the fourth and final day of testing. A crash by Häkkinen and a spin by Olivier Panis in the afternoon of the fourth day brought out the red-flags.|$|E

2500|$|For larger {{heat sinks}} and higher preloads, push pins with {{compression}} springs are very effective.

40|$|A {{survey of}} the subject of network {{reliability}} is presented. Network reliability {{is the study of}} network performance when components of the network are subject to failures. The problem can be divided into two main parts: the modeling of <b>component</b> <b>failures</b> and the corresponding reliability calculations. In the modeling of <b>component</b> <b>failures,</b> the assumption that <b>component</b> <b>failures</b> are statistically independent is often made to simplify the problem. But this assumption is unrealistic in most real-world situations. In this survey, special attention is given to recent developments in modeling statistically dependent <b>failures</b> of network <b>components.</b> For reliability calculations, only analytical techniques are considered, and simulations are excluded. A classification of existing techniques is given. Since most network reliability problems are NP-hard, exact techniques to calculate network reliability can only handle problems of limited sizes, and therefore approximate techniques are of practical importance. Both exact and approximate techniques are covered. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Bayesian {{reliability}} {{requires the}} development of a prior distribution to represent degree of belief about the value of a parameter (such as a <b>component's</b> <b>failure</b> rate) before system specific data become available from testing or operations. Generic failure data are often provided in reliability databases as point estimates (mean or median). A <b>component's</b> <b>failure</b> rate is considered a random variable where all possible values are represented by a probability distribution. The applicability of the generic data source is a significant source of uncertainty that affects the spread of the distribution. This presentation discusses heuristic guidelines for quantifying uncertainty due to generic data applicability when developing prior distributions mainly from reliability predictions...|$|R

The aim is to model simultaneously two important aspects of gas transmission infrastructure: (1) modelling of gas flows in network and (2) modelling of <b>component</b> <b>failures</b> and other constrains and limitations. In our approach, gas transmission network is expressed by a flow network, i. e. by a directed graph from graph theory. Reliability aspects, i. e. effects of <b>component</b> <b>failures</b> in the transmission infrastructure are simulated by Monte Carlo technique.

Decisions can then be taken according to those risks. We demonstrate the approach through application to an industrial case study system in which <b>component</b> <b>failures</b> are sensed and monitored. The system has been deployed for some time.
