40|$|The {{problem of}} how to {{efficiently}} maintain a large number (say millions) of statistics counters that need to be incremented at very high speed has received considerable research attention recently. This problem arises in a variety of router management algorithms and data streaming algorithms, where a large array of counters is used to track various network statistics and to implement various counting sketches respectively. While fitting these <b>counters</b> entirely <b>in</b> SRAM meets the access speed requirement, a large amount of SRAM may be needed with a typical counter size of 32 or 64 bits, and hence the high cost. Solutions proposed in recent works have used hybrid architectures where small <b>counters</b> <b>in</b> SRAM are incremented at high speed, and occasionally written back (“flushed”) to larger <b>counters</b> <b>in</b> DRAM. Previous solutions have used complex schedulers with tree-like or heap data structures to pick which <b>counters</b> <b>in</b> SRAM are about to overflow, and flush them to the correspondin...|$|R

25|$|Benefits aside, however, {{orlistat}} is {{notorious for}} its gastrointestinal side effects (sometimes {{referred to as}} treatment effects), which can include steatorrhea (oily, loose stools). They decrease with time, however, and are the most frequently reported adverse effects of the drug. In Australia, the United States and the European Union, orlistat is available for sale without a prescription. Over-the-counter approval was controversial in the United States, with consumer advocacy group Public Citizen repeatedly opposing it on safety and efficacy grounds. Generic formulations of orlistat are available in some countries. In Australia it is listed as an S3 medication and so is available over the <b>counter</b> <b>in</b> pharmacies.|$|E
25|$|Their {{research}} proved {{valuable to}} {{teams in the}} US and Soviet Union, where missile programs slowly developed in the immediate post-war era. As the Cold War started, the Soviets found themselves facing massive USAF and Royal Air Force strategic bomber fleets they could not hope to <b>counter</b> <b>in</b> the air. In response they dramatically increased their efforts in SAM development, deploying the S-25 Berkut system around Moscow as early as 1955. This {{was followed by the}} dramatically improved and semi-mobile S-75 Dvina, a weapon that remained in service in the 2000s. Similar US and UK weapons soon followed. By the late 1950s, as missiles developed both in quality and number, the ability for the US air fleet to penetrate Soviet airspace was increasingly at risk.|$|E
