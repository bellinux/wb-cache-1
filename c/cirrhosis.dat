5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic <b>cirrhosis,</b> elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary <b>cirrhosis,</b> while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and <b>cirrhosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|More than 40% {{of people}} with <b>cirrhosis</b> develop hepatic encephalopathy. More {{than half of those}} with <b>cirrhosis</b> and {{significant}} HE live less than a year. In those who are able to get a liver transplant, the risk of death is less than 30% over the subsequent five years. The condition has been described since at least 1860.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} the most common from a group of {{hereditary}} diseases that cause copper overload in the liver. All can cause <b>cirrhosis</b> at a young age. The other members of the group are Indian childhood <b>cirrhosis</b> (ICC), endemic Tyrolean infantile <b>cirrhosis</b> and idiopathic copper toxicosis. These are not related to ATP7B mutations: for example, ICC has been linked to mutations in the KRT8 and the KRT18 gene.|$|E
5|$|Dietary supplementation with {{branched-chain}} {{amino acids}} has shown improvement of encephalopathy and other complications of <b>cirrhosis.</b> Some {{studies have shown}} benefit of administration of probiotics ("healthy bacteria").|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally <b>cirrhosis.</b> In some cases, those with <b>cirrhosis</b> will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that McCarthy suffered from <b>cirrhosis</b> of the liver and was frequently hospitalized for alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|On September 14, 2013, {{at the age}} of 33, Monique Bradley died at Encino Hospital Medical Center. A death {{certificate}} dated October 10 lists the causes as cryptogenic <b>cirrhosis</b> of the liver, hemorrhagic shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|The {{infectious}} disease hepatitis C {{is caused by}} the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which affects the liver and is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact, or by exposure to another person's infected blood. The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can cause inflammation of the liver (chronic hepatitis). This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (<b>cirrhosis).</b> In some cases, those with <b>cirrhosis</b> go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} tests are available to determine the degree of <b>cirrhosis</b> present. Transient elastography (FibroScan) is the test of choice, but it is expensive. Aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index may be used when cost is an issue.|$|E
5|$|Chronic copper {{toxicity}} {{does not}} normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to Wilson's disease with copper accumulation and <b>cirrhosis</b> {{of the liver}} in persons who have inherited two defective genes.|$|E
5|$|Ellis was {{diagnosed}} with <b>cirrhosis</b> in 2007 and {{was placed on the}} list for a liver transplant. Though he had no health insurance, friends from his baseball career helped him to pay his medical bills. However, Ellis suffered heart damage in his last weeks of life, which made a transplant impossible.|$|E
5|$|Hanneman died {{of liver}} failure on May 2, 2013, in a Southern California {{hospital}} near his home. On May 9, 2013, the official {{cause of death}} was announced as alcohol-related <b>cirrhosis.</b> Hanneman and his family had apparently been unaware of the extent of the condition until shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|Hepatorenal {{syndrome}} (often abbreviated HRS) is {{a life-threatening}} medical condition {{that consists of}} rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with <b>cirrhosis</b> or fulminant liver failure. HRS is usually fatal unless a liver transplant is performed, although various treatments, such as dialysis, can prevent advancement of the condition.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary copper {{accumulation}} {{has been}} described in Bedlington Terriers, where it generally only affects the liver. It is due to mutations in the COMMD1 (or MURR1) gene. Despite this findings, COMMD1 mutations could not be detected in humans with non-Wilsonian copper accumulation states (such as Indian childhood <b>cirrhosis)</b> to explain their genetic origin.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} {{job in the}} majors Hartnett worked as a coach and scout for the Kansas City Athletics {{for two years in}} the mid-1960s. Hartnett died of <b>cirrhosis</b> in Park Ridge, Illinois on his 72nd {{birthday}} in 1972, and is interred in All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In {{those with}} <b>cirrhosis,</b> {{the risk of}} {{developing}} hepatic encephalopathy is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with <b>cirrhosis</b> exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing overt encephalopathy in the future. Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused <b>cirrhosis</b> of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with <b>cirrhosis</b> have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Other liver-related {{complications}} (portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) {{are treated}} with the same modalities as used in <b>cirrhosis,</b> although the use of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt treatment is discouraged {{due to the lack}} of documented benefit.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{circulated}} {{of a brain}} haemorrhage, {{followed by}} competing reports {{that he had been}} mugged and even that he had drunk himself to death. Later, there was speculation about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death– pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite his heavy drinking his liver showed no sign of <b>cirrhosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Suffering from hepatic <b>cirrhosis,</b> Neild died at {{his home}} in Woollahra on 8 March 1911, aged 65, survived by his second wife and their two children. He {{received}} a military funeral before being buried with Anglican rites at Waverley Cemetery in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of these}} patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival. The severity of liver disease (as evidenced by the MELD score) {{has been shown to}} be a determinant of outcome. Some patients without <b>cirrhosis</b> develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|Timmons was {{strongly}} associated with the soul jazz style that he helped initiate; this link to apparently simple writing and playing, coupled with drug and alcohol addiction, led {{to a decline in}} his career. Timmons died, aged 38, from <b>cirrhosis.</b> Several critics have commented that his contribution to jazz remains undervalued.|$|E
5|$|According to saxophonist Jimmy Heath, Timmons joined Clark Terry's {{big band}} {{for a tour}} of Europe in 1974. He was unwell and drank on the plane to Sweden, and fell while {{drinking}} at the bar before the band's first concert, in Malmö. Susceptible to blood clotting, he was flown back to the US. On March 1, 1974, he died from <b>cirrhosis,</b> {{at the age of}} 38, at St Vincent's Hospital in New York. He had been in hospital for a month. He was buried in Philadelphia, and was survived by his wife, Estelle, and son, also Bobby.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from racing, {{he continued to}} work for Daimler-Benz as a salesman, targeting NATO troops stationed in Europe. He organised shows and demonstrations which toured military bases, leading in part {{to an increase in}} Mercedes-Benz sales during that period. In early 1959, he became sick and developed signs of jaundice, which worsened despite treatment. Later in the year he was diagnosed with advanced <b>cirrhosis.</b> On 28 September 1959, in Kassel, Germany, he suffered liver failure and died, aged 58. He was buried in his home town of Lugano.|$|E
5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with <b>cirrhosis</b> of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement {{between the first and}} later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Benchley's drinking, {{already a}} problem, worsened {{and he was}} {{diagnosed}} with <b>cirrhosis</b> of the liver. (Ironically, when younger, he had been an adamant teetotaler.) While he completed his year's work, his condition continued to deteriorate, and Benchley died in a New York hospital on November 21, 1945. His family opted for a private funeral service, and his body was cremated and interred in a family plot on the island of Nantucket.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if used {{in children and}} in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals. Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The use of alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., <b>cirrhosis),</b> severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol).|$|E
5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from <b>cirrhosis</b> or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, <b>cirrhosis</b> and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|In September 1898, Hannah was {{committed}} to Cane Hill mental asylum – she had developed a psychosis seemingly brought on by an infection of syphilis and malnutrition. For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent {{to live with their}} father, whom the young boys scarcely knew. Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic, and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from <b>cirrhosis</b> of the liver.|$|E
5|$|Once other {{investigations}} have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is {{the removal of}} {{a small amount of}} liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and <b>cirrhosis,</b> and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.|$|E
5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver <b>cirrhosis,</b> biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|Certain {{parasitic}} liver diseases may be {{risk factors}} as well. Colonization with the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) {{has been associated}} with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic liver disease, whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis B or hepatitis C), alcoholic liver disease, or <b>cirrhosis</b> of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. hepatitis C infection) were responsible for the association.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, <b>cirrhosis</b> is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{competition}} from nearby bars and Victor Morris' deteriorating health {{led to the}} decline and fall of his enterprise. During this time, due to his worsening constitution, Morris delegated most of the bartending to his employees. Adding to the problem, nearby competitors, such as the Hotel Bolívar and the Hotel Lima Country Club, housed bars which took clientele away from Morris' Bar. Moreover, Toro-Lira discovered that Morris accused four of his former bartenders of intellectual property theft after they left to work {{in one of these}} competing establishments. In 1929, Morris declared voluntary bankruptcy and closed his saloon. A few months later, on June 11, Victor Vaughen Morris died of <b>cirrhosis.</b>|$|E
