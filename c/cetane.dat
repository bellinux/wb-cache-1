25|$|Alkanes from nonane to, for instance, {{hexadecane}} (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids {{of higher}} viscosity, {{less and less}} suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel. Diesel fuels are characterized by their <b>cetane</b> number, <b>cetane</b> being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel has {{promising}} lubricating {{properties and}} <b>cetane</b> ratings compared to low sulfur diesel fuels. Depending on the engine, this might include {{high pressure injection}} pumps, pump injectors (also called unit injectors) and fuel injectors.|$|E
25|$|Oils and fats can be {{hydrogenated}} to give {{a diesel}} substitute. The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high <b>cetane</b> number, low in aromatics and sulfur and does not contain oxygen. Hydrogenated oils can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{first four}} names {{were derived from}} methanol, ether, propionic acid and butyric acid, {{respectively}} (hexadecane is also {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>cetane).</b> Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix -ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel (-a or -o) from the basic numerical term. Hence, pentane, C5H12; hexane, C6H14; heptane, C7H16; octane, C8H18; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example nonane, use the Latin prefix non-. For a more complete list, see List of alkanes.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also a}} {{promising}} fuel in diesel engines, petrol engines (30% DME / 70% LPG), and gas turbines. For diesel engines, an advantage is the high <b>cetane</b> number of 55, {{compared to that of}} diesel fuel from petroleum, which is 40â€“53. Only moderate modifications are needed to convert a diesel engine to burn dimethyl ether. The simplicity of this short carbon chain compound leads during combustion to very low emissions of particulate matter, NOx, and CO. For these reasons as well as being sulfur-free, dimethyl ether meets even the most stringent emission regulations in Europe (EURO5), U.S. (U.S. 2010), and Japan (2009 Japan). Mobil uses dimethyl ether in their methanol to gasoline process.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that during {{atomization}} biodiesel and its blends produced droplets were greater in diameter than the droplets produced by traditional petrodiesel. The smaller droplets were attributed to the lower viscosity and surface tension of traditional petrol. It was found that droplets at {{the periphery of the}} spray pattern were larger in diameter than the droplets at the center this was attributed to the faster pressure drop {{at the edge of the}} spray pattern; there was a proportional relationship between the droplet size and the distance from the injector tip. It was found that B100 had the greatest spray penetration, this was attributed to the greater density of B100. Having a greater droplet size can lead to; inefficiencies in the combustion, increased emissions, and decreased horse power. In another study it was found that there is a short injection delay when injecting biodiesel. This injection delay was attributed to the greater viscosity of Biodiesel. It was noted that the higher viscosity and the greater <b>cetane</b> rating of biodiesel over traditional petrodiesel lead to poor atomization, as well as mixture penetration with air during the ignition delay period. Another study noted that this ignition delay may aid in a decrease of NOx emission.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{measure of}} diesel fuel quality is its <b>cetane</b> number. A <b>cetane</b> number {{is a measure}} of the delay of ignition of a diesel fuel. A higher <b>cetane</b> number indicates that the fuel ignites more readily when sprayed into hot compressed air. European (EN 590 standard) road diesel has a minimum <b>cetane</b> number of 51. Fuels with higher <b>cetane</b> numbers, normally [...] "premium" [...] diesel fuels with additional cleaning agents and some synthetic content, are available in some markets.|$|E
2500|$|... Diesel fuel is {{not used}} in a {{gasoline}} engine, so its low octane rating is not an issue; the relevant metric for diesel engines is the <b>cetane</b> number ...|$|E
2500|$|The rest of {{the group}} is classed {{according}} to the functional groups present. [...] Such compounds can be [...] "straight-chain", branched-chain or cyclic. [...] The degree of branching affects characteristics, such as the octane number or <b>cetane</b> number in petroleum chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, more {{stringent}} emission standards {{have been adopted}} with the transition to [...] ULSD starting in 2006, and becoming mandatory on June 1, 2010 (see also diesel exhaust). U.S. diesel fuel typically also has a lower <b>cetane</b> number (a measure of ignition quality) than European diesel, resulting in worse cold weather performance and some increase in emissions.|$|E
2500|$|As a fuel, {{methanol}} and ethanol {{both have}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} over fuels such as petrol (gasoline) and diesel fuel. In spark ignition engines, both alcohols can run {{at a much higher}} exhaust gas recirculation rates and with higher compression ratios. [...] Both alcohols have a high octane rating, with ethanol at 109 RON (Research Octane Number), 90 MON (Motor Octane Number), (which equates to 99.5 AKI) and methanol at 109 RON, 89 MON (which equates to 99 AKI). Note that AKI refers to 'Anti-Knock Index' which averages the RON and MON ratings (RON+MON)/2, and is used on U.S. gas station pumps. [...] Ordinary European petrol is typically 95 RON, 85 MON, equal to 90 AKI. [...] As a compression ignition engine fuel, both alcohols create very little particulates, but their low <b>cetane</b> number means that an ignition improver like glycol must be mixed into the fuel with approx. 5%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetane</b> index {{calculations}} can {{not account}} for <b>cetane</b> improver additives and therefore do not measure total <b>cetane</b> number for additized diesel fuels. Diesel engine operation is primarily related to the actual <b>cetane</b> number, and the <b>cetane</b> index is simply an estimation of the base (unadditized) <b>cetane</b> number. <b>Cetane</b> number should equal or exceed <b>cetane</b> index, depending on the amount of additive used. The most common additive is 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (2EHN).|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetane</b> is the {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula n-C16H34, today named hexadecane according to IUPAC rules. It is an unbranched alkane, a saturated hydrocarbon chain with no cycles. <b>Cetane</b> ignites very easily under compression, {{so it was}} assigned a <b>cetane</b> number of 100, while alpha-methyl naphthalene was assigned a <b>cetane</b> number of 0. All other hydrocarbons in diesel fuel are indexed to <b>cetane</b> as to how well they ignite under compression. The <b>cetane</b> number therefore measures how quickly the fuel starts to burn (auto-ignites) under diesel engine conditions. Since {{there are hundreds of}} components in diesel fuel, with each having a different <b>cetane</b> quality, the overall <b>cetane</b> number of the diesel is the average <b>cetane</b> quality of all the components (strictly speaking high-cetane components will have disproportionate influence, hence the use of high-cetane additives).|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetane</b> {{is often}} used as a {{shorthand}} for <b>cetane</b> number, {{a measure of the}} detonation of diesel fuel. <b>Cetane</b> ignites very easily under compression; for this reason, it is assigned a <b>cetane</b> number of 100, and serves as a reference for other fuel mixtures.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cetane</b> {{index is}} used as a {{substitute}} for the <b>cetane</b> number of diesel fuel. The <b>cetane</b> index is calculated based on the fuel's density and distillation range (ASTM D86). There are two methods used, ASTM D976 and D4737. The older D976, or [...] "two-variable equation" [...] is outdated and should no longer be used for <b>cetane</b> number estimation. It is, however, still required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an alternative method for satisfying its aromaticity requirement for diesel fuel. D4737 is the newest method and is sometimes referred to as [...] "the four-variable equation". D4737 is the same method as ISO 4264. <b>Cetane</b> index in some crude oil assays {{is often referred to as}} <b>Cetane</b> calcule, while the <b>cetane</b> number is referred to as <b>Cetane</b> measure.|$|E
50|$|Isocetane (2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane) is {{a highly}} {{branched}} alkane used as a reference in determining the <b>cetane</b> number of diesel. It is given a <b>cetane</b> number of 15. Isocetane replaced 1-methylnaphthalene as the lower reference for <b>cetane</b> number (1-methylnaphthalene has <b>cetane</b> number zero) owing to the expense of 1-methylnaphthalene, and difficulty in safe handling.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method that}} fuel-users control quality is {{by using the}} <b>cetane</b> index (CI), which is a {{calculated}} number based on the density and distillation range of the fuel. There are various versions of this, depending on whether metric or Imperial units are used, and how many distillation points are used. These days most oil companies use the '4-point method', ASTM D4737, based on density, 10% 50% and 90% recovery temperatures. The '2-point method' is defined in ASTM D976, and uses just density and the 50% recovery temperature. This 2-point method tends to overestimate <b>cetane</b> index and is not recommended. <b>Cetane</b> index calculations {{can not account for}} <b>cetane</b> improver additives and therefore do not measure total <b>cetane</b> number for additized diesel fuels. Diesel engine operation is primarily related to the actual <b>cetane</b> number and the <b>cetane</b> index is simply an estimation of the base (unadditized) <b>cetane</b> number.|$|E

50|$|In Europe, diesel <b>cetane</b> {{numbers were}} {{set at a}} minimum of 38 in 1994 and 40 in 2000. The current {{standard}} for diesel sold in European Union, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland is set in EN 590, with a minimum <b>cetane</b> index of 46 and a minimum <b>cetane</b> number of 51. Premium diesel fuel can have a <b>cetane</b> number as high as 60.|$|E
5000|$|A fuelâ€™s <b>cetane</b> {{number is}} {{measurement}} of the combustion quality of diesel fuel during compression ignition. Fuels with higher <b>cetane</b> number have shorter ignition delays, providing more time for the fuel combustion process to be completed. Generally, diesel engines operate well with a CN from 40 to 55, whereas LS9 UltraClean has a CN of 70.In North America, most states adopt ASTM D975 as their diesel fuel standard and the minimum <b>cetane</b> number is set at 40, with typical values in the 42-45 range. In Europe, with a minimum <b>cetane</b> index of 46 and a minimum <b>cetane</b> number of 51. Premium diesel fuel can have a <b>cetane</b> number as high as 60 ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetane</b> number (or CN) is {{an inverse}} {{function}} of a fuel's ignition delay, and the time period between the start of injection and the first identifiable pressure increase during combustion of the fuel. In a particular diesel engine, higher <b>cetane</b> fuels will have shorter ignition delay periods than lower <b>Cetane</b> fuels. <b>Cetane</b> numbers are only used for the relatively light distillate diesel oils. For heavy (residual) fuel oil two other scales are used, CCAI and CII.|$|E
50|$|In North America, No. 2 {{diesel fuel}} is recommended, {{since it has}} a higher <b>cetane</b> number than No. 1 fuel, and has lower {{viscosity}} (better ability to flow) than heavier fuel oils. Some owners in North America, where <b>cetane</b> levels are generally poor (as low as 40), use additives, or premium diesel, to get <b>cetane</b> numbers closer to the standard levels found in the European market (at least 51) where the engine is designed. Improved <b>cetane</b> reduces emissions while improving performance, and may increase fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Cetane</b> Improver imâ€²prÃ¼vÂ·É™r is a {{chemical}} {{which has the}} effect of increasing a diesel fuel's <b>Cetane</b> number. A few examples are nitrates, nitroalkanes, nitrocarbonates and peroxides.|$|E
50|$|Alkyl nitrates (principally {{2-ethylhexyl}} nitrate) and {{di-tert-butyl peroxide}} {{are used as}} additives to raise the <b>cetane</b> number.

5000|$|With {{the rise}} of {{environmental}} concerns, the fuel industry has been driven to lessen emissions and increase performance. Europe, for instance, has implemented a minimum <b>Cetane</b> Index (46) and <b>Cetane</b> Number (51) in its Diesel specification (EN590) ...|$|E
5000|$|Biodiesel from {{vegetable}} oil sources {{have been recorded}} as having a <b>cetane</b> number range of 46 to 52, and animal-fat based biodiesels <b>cetane</b> numbers range from 56 to 60. [...] Dimethyl ether is a potential diesel fuel as it has a high <b>cetane</b> rating (55-60) and can be produced as a biofuel.

Premium diesels {{may or may not}} have higher <b>cetane,</b> depending on the supplier. Premium diesel often use additives to improve CN and lubricity, detergents to clean the fuel injectors and minimize carbon deposits, water dispersants, and other additives depending on geographical and seasonal needs.. California diesel fuel has a minimum <b>cetane</b> of 53. Under the Texas Low Emission Diesel (TxLED) program there are 110 counties where diesel fuel must have a <b>cetane</b> number of 48 or greater, or else must use an approved alternative formulation or comply with the designated alternative limits.|$|E
5000|$|... 1-Methylnaphthalene is a {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH). It has a <b>cetane</b> number of zero, and was previously used as the lower reference for <b>cetane</b> number. However, due to the expense and handling difficulty of 1-methylnaphthalene, it was replaced in this capacity by isocetane, with a CN of 15.|$|E
50|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of the <b>cetane</b> number are rather difficult, as it requires burning the fuel in a rare diesel engine called a Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine, under standard test conditions. The operator of the CFR engine uses a hand-wheel to increase the compression ratio (and therefore the peak pressure within the cylinder) of the engine until the time between fuel injection and ignition is 2.407ms. The resulting <b>cetane</b> number is then calculated by determining which mixture of <b>cetane</b> (hexadecane) and isocetane (2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane) {{will result in the}} same ignition delay.|$|E
