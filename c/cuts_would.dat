5|$|The {{collapse}} {{focused attention}} on the Harper government's cancellation of the Joint Emergency Preparedness Program, which provides funds to Canada's five HUSAR teams. The province and the National Fire Protection Association denounced the cuts. The Canadian Centre for Emergency Preparedness suggested that such <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> necessitate Canada asking for assistance from the United States in similar situations. Also cancelled by the Conservative federal government was the Canadian Emergency Management College, established in 1954 to train first responders. A spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews deflected criticism of the cuts, noting that 90 per cent of emergencies are managed municipally or provincially.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
25|$|The CBO {{estimated}} in January 2009 that the Bush tax <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> add approximately $3.0 trillion to the debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels, including interest.|$|E
50|$|The battle {{ultimately}} {{ended when}} Rush suffered a near-fatal {{heart attack and}} became hospitalized. Months later, after Rush recovered, he compromised with Vajna that the producer's <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> be released theatrically and that the director's <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> see a video release.|$|R

50|$|It {{is thought}} that a {{downward}} <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> be highly inefficient and unbalanced, throwing a great strain upon the wrist. Pandat are well balanced for upward <b>cut,</b> but this <b>would</b> perhaps not be a very effective form of attack.The Pandat's typically bent blade {{is very similar to}} Parang Latok which, unlike the Pandat, is used as a tool.|$|R
25|$|The Liberals {{announced}} that they would cut 20,000 administrative positions from the public sector through natural attrition. Labor made this promise a particular focus for their advertising campaign, warning that such deep <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> compromise service delivery: the advertising implied that the Liberals planned to sack teachers, nurses and police.|$|E
25|$|Campbellton to Ste-Flavie on July 1, 1876. The main {{obstacle}} involved {{running the}} {{line through the}} Matapedia River valley where deep <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> {{prove to be a}} problem for years during the winter months. Problems with clearing snow in some of these areas were resolved with the construction of extensive snow sheds—the only ones in eastern Canada.|$|E
25|$|Another PETA {{undercover}} video, reportedly {{taken on}} August 13, 2008, showed {{violations of the}} Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter Act, {{including the use of}} saw-like, multiple, hacking cuts in the necks of still-conscious animals. Dr. Grandin said the second <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> “definitely cause the animal pain.” The episode led Grandin to state that slaughterhouse visits were useless for determining proper animal treatment. Grandin suggested that Agriprocessors install internet video cams on the killing floor for constant, independent, oversight.|$|E
50|$|The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 would delay until March 2015 any {{cuts in the}} Medicare {{reimbursement}} rate. Without this {{or similar}} legislation, a 24 percent <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> go into effect on April 1, 2014.|$|R
5000|$|On June 26, 1980, Cimino previewed a {{workprint}} for {{executives at}} United Artists that reportedly ran five hours and twenty-five minutes (325 minutes), which Cimino said was [...] "about 15 minutes {{longer than the}} final <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> be." ...|$|R
50|$|College Point {{would be}} served by an {{extension}} of the IRT Flushing Line; the construction of a tunnel, an embankment and an open <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> extend the line to Bell Boulevard, with the final section to College Point being an elevated.|$|R
25|$|The {{contention}} of the proponents, {{that the tax}} rate <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> more than cover any increases in federal debt, was influenced by a theoretical taxation model based on the elasticity of tax rates, known as the Laffer curve. Arthur Laffer's model predicts that excessive tax rates actually reduce potential tax revenues, by lowering the incentive to produce; the model also predicts that insufficient tax rates (rates below the optimum level for a given economy) lead directly {{to a reduction in}} tax revenues.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 Donnelly {{voted against}} H.R. 2219 {{which would have}} cut the U.S. {{military}} budget by $8.5 billion, stipulating that no cuts were to be taken from pay or benefit programs supporting members and veterans of the armed forces. These <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> have reduced the emphasis of the U.S. budget on weapons programs. Donnelly also voted against the failed Polis amendment, cutting $640 Million in a 2% across-the-board reduction in spending from the 2012 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill.|$|E
25|$|In January 2001, HP {{laid off}} 1,700 {{marketing}} employees. In June 2001, Fiorina asked employees to either take pay cuts or use their allotted vacation time to cut additional costs, resulting {{in more than}} 80,000 people signing up and saving HP 130 million. Despite these efforts from employees, in July Fiorina announced that 6,000 jobs would be cut, the biggest reduction in the company's 64-year history, but those <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> not actually occur until after the Compaq merger was announced. In September 2001, Fiorina said she intended to cut an additional 15,000 jobs {{in the event of}} a merger with Compaq.|$|E
2500|$|Bush {{argued that}} such a tax <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> stimulate the economy and create jobs. In the end, five Senate Democrats crossed party lines to join Republicans in {{approving}} a $1.35 trillion tax cut program [...] {{one of the largest}} in U.S. history.|$|R
5000|$|Overall, the Department of Energy {{would receive}} $24.9 billion in funding. [...] A $1 billion <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> {{result from the}} {{combination}} of several offices - electrical delivery, energy reliability, energy efficiency and renewables - into one office that would received $982.6 million in funding.|$|R
50|$|Pro Bowl Center Kevin Mawae was {{released}} on March 5. Mawae disagreed with the assertion that his release was for salary cap reasons, as his <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> only be a savings of $1.1 million, and {{felt that it was}} simply a change in direction for the team.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Krugman {{repeatedly}} criticized the Bush tax cuts, {{both before and}} after they were enacted. Krugman argued that the tax cuts enlarged the budget deficit without improving the economy, and that they enriched the wealthy – worsening income distribution in the US. Krugman advocated lower interest rates (to promote investment and spending on housing and other durable goods), and increased government spending on infrastructure, military, and unemployment benefits, arguing that these policies would have a larger stimulus effect, and unlike permanent tax <b>cuts,</b> <b>would</b> only temporarily increase the budget deficit. In addition, he was against Bush's proposal to privatize social security.|$|E
25|$|On May 24, 2012, the paper's owner, Advance Publications, {{announced}} that the print edition of the Times-Picayune would be published {{three days a week}} (Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday) beginning at the end of September. News of the change was first revealed the night before in a blog post by New York Times media writer David Carr. A new company, NOLA Media Group, was created to oversee both the paper and its website, NOLA.com. Along with the change in its printing schedule, Advance also {{announced that}} significant <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> be coming to the newsroom and staff of the Picayune. A second new company, Advance Central Services Louisiana, was created to print and deliver the newspaper.|$|E
25|$|A {{second group}} put their main {{emphasis}} {{on tax cuts}} rather than spending cuts or debt reduction. Many embrace supply-side economics, arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment, tax <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues. These additional government revenues, would {{in the long term}} reduce debt, they also argue for reducing taxes even if it were to lead to short term increases in the deficit. Some supply-siders have even advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary. However, the Congressional Budget Office has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the Bush tax cuts added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002-2011 and would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} {{was said to}} be unbearable for those submitted to it. The body was often lowered into a hole, itself often filled with excrement at the bottom. Typically, a <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> be made in the forehead in order to let blood pressure decrease in the area around the head.|$|R
5|$|The {{scene where}} Saul Tigh has {{the vision of}} {{shooting}} William Adama was not filmed in one shot, but was edited {{in such a way}} that the <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> only become noticeable if one looks at the scene closely.

50|$|On March 20, 2008, at the HP Pavilion in San Jose, California, Ward {{defeated}} Rubin Williams by seventh-round TKO. Ward hit Williams with jabs {{and straight}} left hands almost at will, opening a bad cut over Williams' left {{eye in the}} process. The <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> force the referee to stop the fight.|$|R
25|$|Speculation {{mounted in}} 2009 that the UK {{government}} would switch from the F-35B to the F-35C model, with its greater range and payload. The UK would require fewer F-35Cs and save about $25 million for each aircraft ordered. In October 2010, press reports {{suggested that the}} Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government were considering reducing the order for the F-35 from 138 to a currently unspecified but lower number as of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. This was confirmed by a MoD spokeswoman in 2012. The proposed <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> also close RAF Lossiemouth, chosen as the main operating base for the F-35. On 19 October 2010 Prime Minister David Cameron announced in the Strategic Defence and Security Review that the UK would procure an unspecified number of F-35Cs, to fly from a Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier, instead of the F-35B. This change would require the aircraft carrier to be equipped with catapults and arresting gear.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives {{argued that}} the GST <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> benefit all Canadians, {{including}} low-income earners and those outside the workforce who do not pay income tax. The first GST cut went into effect on July 1, 2006, and no provinces have raised provincial sales tax yet. In addition, the Conservatives rolled back the income tax cut on the lowest tax bracket, restoring it back to 15.5% from 15%, increased and added tax exemption rates and introduced a $100 monthly child care allowance for families with children at or {{under the age of}} six. The Liberals and NDP voiced disapproval over the Conservatives following through on their election promise to replace the Liberal's proposed child care policy with their own, and for replacing Canada's $4 billion environmental policy with a $2 billion Conservative plan. The budget passed third reading without dissent on June 6, 2006 when the members of the Opposition accidentally failed to stand after the Deputy Speaker of the House called for debate.|$|E
25|$|Users of the Trent and Mersey Canal, the Loughborough Canal and the Erewash Canal next demanded major {{improvements}} to the river down to Gainsborough, including new cuts, locks, dredging and a towing path suitable for horses. The Dadfords, who were engineers on the Trent and Mersey Canal, estimated the cost at £20,000, but the proposal was opposed by landowners and merchants on the river, while the Navigator, published in 1788, estimated that around 500 men who were employed to bow-haul boats would have lost their jobs. Agreement could not be reached, and so William Jessop was asked to re-assess the situation. He suggested that dredging, deepening, and restricting {{the width of the}} channel could make significant {{improvements to the}} navigable depth, although <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> be required at Wilford, Nottingham bridge and Holme. This proposal formed the basis for an Act of Parliament obtained in 1783, which also allowed a horse towing path to be built. The work was completed by September 1787, and dividends of 5 per cent were paid on the capital during 1786 and 1787, increasing to 7 per cent, the maximum allowed by the Act, after that. Jessop carried out a survey for a side cut and lock at Sawley in 1789, and it was built by 1793.|$|E

50|$|The Wolf of Wall Street was {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray on March 25, 2014. On January 27, 2014, {{it was revealed that}} a four-hour director's <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> be attached to the home release.

50|$|Felling {{of large}} trees such as redcedar before the {{introduction}} of steel tools was a complex and time-consuming art. Typically the bark was removed {{around the base of}} the tree above the buttresses. Then some amount of cutting and splitting with stone adzes and mauls would be done, creating a wide triangular cut. The area above and below the <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> be covered with a mixture of wet moss and clay as a firebreak. Then the <b>cut</b> <b>would</b> be packed with tinder and small kindling and slowly burned. The process of cutting and burning would alternate until the tree was mostly penetrated through, and then careful tending of the fire would fell the tree in the best direction for handling. This process could take many days. Constant rotation of workers was involved to keep the fires burning through night and day, often in a remote and forbidding location.|$|R
25|$|During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney said {{he would}} seek income tax law reforms that he said would help lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. Among the series of tax changes he proposed were: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20 percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15 percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 percent to 25 percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax <b>cuts</b> <b>would</b> be offset by closing loopholes and reining in tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, so that his tax plan would not raise federal deficits. Non-partisan analyses of Romney’s tax plan estimated that it could have added more than $3 trillion to the federal deficit, and would have favored the highest-earning Americans, possibly raising annual taxes on middle-class earners by as much as $2,000. Romney and supporters of his tax plan said that such analyses were unreliable because they were based on assumptions about specific measures that were not detailed in the plan and because they had not adequately accounted for the positive effects on economic growth that Romney said his plan would generate. And that lower tax rates would lower rates of Tax evasion.|$|E
