500|$|These human remains, {{including}} body parts, tissues, and two partial torsos, totaled 13. All were unidentifiable, but one partial torso {{was that}} of a Caucasian woman as indicated by auburn hair on a partial skull, and one partial body was of an Asian child (with glass embedded). There was no luggage recovered. Of the non-human remains that the Japanese recovered were various items including dentures, newspapers, seats, books, eight KAL paper cups, shoes, sandals, and sneakers, a <b>camera</b> <b>case,</b> a [...] "please fasten seat belt" [...] sign, an oxygen mask, a handbag, a bottle of dish washing fluid, several blouses, an identity card belonging to 25-year-old passenger Mary Jane Hendrie of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, and the business card of passenger Kathy Brown-Spier. These items generally came from the passenger cabin of an aircraft. None of the items found generally came from the cargo hold of a plane, such as suitcases, packing boxes, industrial machinery, instruments, and sports equipment.|$|E
60|$|For answer Ernest tied {{a bit of}} {{driftwood}} to {{the rope}} {{and put it into}} Laddie's mouth. The next minute the dog was swimming out to me. As soon as he came close I caught the rope. It was just long enough to stretch from shore to rock, allowing for a couple of hitches which Ernest gave around a small boulder on the ledge. I tied my <b>camera</b> <b>case</b> on my head by means of some string I found in my pocket, then I slipped into the water and, holding to the rope, went hand over hand to the shore with Laddie swimming beside me. Ernest held on to the shoreward end of the rope like grim death, a task that was no light one for his small arms. When I finally scrambled up beside him, his face was dripping with perspiration and he trembled like a leaf.|$|E

50|$|A {{transit case}} is a hard-sided case {{intended}} for protecting defined contents during transportation. In some forms, the interior is filled with foam which has pockets molded or cut into it that equipment specifically fits into. Some transit cases are provided with foam inserts that completely fill the interior and the user can pluck out pieces {{to make the case}} fit a particular application. Many <b>camera</b> <b>cases</b> are built in this fashion allowing the user to tailor the interior foam to their particular equipment. The outside of the transit case provides protection against the environment and a first level of protection against mechanical damage such as shock. The interior foam or other structure cushions the equipment against shock and vibration and some protection against rapid temperature changes.|$|R

50|$|Nikon makes a {{leatherette}} soft <b>camera</b> <b>case,</b> the CS-13 (NIK446), which suppresses sound somewhat, but {{is designed}} {{primarily for the}} film advance of film cameras, and provides little effective suppression for digital cameras. A similar solution was Minolta's Insulation Case (6081-660, 43325-74196-8), primarily designed for film SLRs used at low temperatures, but also advertised to reduce camera sound.|$|E
5000|$|This {{redesign}} {{made a new}} <b>camera</b> <b>case</b> design necessary, leaving additional {{space for}} the frame counter, and the frame reset slider.

50|$|One major {{contributor}} to E18 lens errors is the improper use of <b>camera</b> <b>cases,</b> or the carrying of cameras in pockets. An inadvertent activation of the camera while in the case or pocket may cause the lens to extend with the lens restricted in its movement, causing the error. Another cause is that sand, dust, and dirt will accumulate {{in the bottom of}} the case if it is not cleaned regularly (and lint for pockets). These materials readily cling to the camera by electrostatic build-up from the camera rubbing against the side of the case, especially for those cases with soft fibrous interiors. The lens error will occur once these materials work their way into the lens mechanism. Another {{major contributor}} is sand in general. Extra care should be utilized when taking a camera to the beach. Sand can cling to the lens barrel, again by electrostatic attraction. This may jam the lens mechanism when it tries to close. When at the beach, always inspect the lens barrel prior to closing to ensure that no sand particles are clinging to it (a single grain can jam the camera).|$|R
5000|$|The bomb is {{believed}} to have been hidden in an aluminum <b>camera</b> <b>case,</b> and planted by an individual carrying a stolen Danish passport. According to witnesses, the bomber used the name Per Anker Hansen and claimed he was a Danish photographer. Afterwards, bombing survivors commented that they found it odd that [...] "Hansen" [...] had so zealouly guarded his [...] "camera equipment", wrapping the unwieldy aluminum box in plastic. [...] "Hansen" [...] {{is believed}} to have deposited the <b>camera</b> <b>case</b> containing the bomb underneath the table. News footage later showed the suspected bomber gesturing to his camera as if to indicate an equipment malfunction as a pretext to leave the room. The bomber is suspected to have detonated the bomb remotely using a walky-talky signal as a detonator. Seconds after [...] "Hansen" [...] left the room, an explosion ripped through the hut, leaving the injured and dying crying out in pain and calling for help in sudden darkness.|$|E

50|$|The Crown {{alleged that}} Lindy Chamberlain had cut Azaria's throat {{in the front}} seat of the family car, hiding the baby's body in a large <b>camera</b> <b>case.</b> She then, {{according}} to the proposed reconstruction of the crime, rejoined the group of campers around a campfire and fed one of her sons a can of baked beans, before going to the tent and raising the cry that a dingo had taken the baby. It was alleged that at a later time, while other people from the campsite were searching, she disposed of the body.|$|E
50|$|The prosecution's {{theory was}} that, in a five- to ten-minute {{absence from the}} camp fire, Lindy {{returned}} to her tent, did whatever was necessary to stop her young son Aidan from following her, changed into track suit pants, took Azaria to her car, obtained and used scissors to cut Azaria's throat, waited for Azaria to die (options were carotid arteries or jugular - all experts said there was an absence of evidence of arterial bleeding on the jump suit blood stains {{and it would take}} up to 20 minutes if the death was from cutting the jugular), hid the body in a <b>camera</b> <b>case</b> in the car, cleaned up blood on everything including the outside of the <b>camera</b> <b>case,</b> removed the tracksuit pants, obtained baked beans for her son from the car, returned to the tent, did something to leave blood splashes there and brought her son Aidan back to the campfire without ever attracting the attention of other campers except for camper Greg Lowe who gave evidence that he observed her to go to the tent with Azaria and Aidan and then walk to the car with her left arm around Aidan and her right arm unimpeded. She also counted on her son not noticing she had taken Azaria and returned without her and asking her publicly where she had taken Azaria. She then later returned to the tent and immediately claimed that she saw a dingo taking her baby with evidence implicating a dingo being purely coincidental. No-one noticing alleged blood on Mrs Chamberlain's clothes in the hours after the disappearance was purely fortunate. Mrs Chamberlain opening the car where the body was allegedly hidden to give a dog the scent of Azaria from the clothes in the car was a daring act. She also must have somehow done it without her husband's knowledge or he was also incredibly daring given that he left his children in her care afterward and he told the police that he had given them the wrong <b>camera</b> <b>case</b> and then gave them the one that was allegedly used to conceal the body.|$|E
50|$|A {{company called}} Polytech Enterprise Limited {{acquired}} used disposable cameras {{which had been}} manufactured by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. and sold by Fuji to consumers. Fuji owned several patents on the technology used in the cameras. Polytech refurbished the cameras through a process which included fitting the camera with new film, {{and in some instances}} with new flash batteries, repairing the <b>camera</b> <b>case</b> to exclude light following the film reloading operation, repackaging, and relabeling under the trademark of Jazz Photo Corp. The cameras were brought to China to be refurbished, and Jazz Photo then reimported them into the United States for sale.|$|E
