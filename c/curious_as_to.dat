Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also <b>curious</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 1502, {{during his}} fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, {{one of the}} Bay Islands {{off the coast of}} Honduras. He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island. As Bartholomew {{explored}} the island with two boats, a large canoe approached from the west, apparently en route to the island. The canoe was carved from one large tree trunk and was powered by twenty-five naked rowers. <b>Curious</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the visitors, Bartholomew Columbus seized and boarded it. He found it was a Maya trading canoe from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo that included ceramics, cotton textiles, yellow stone axes, flint-studded war clubs, copper axes and bells, and cacao. Also among the cargo were a small number of women and children, probably destined to be sold as slaves, as were a number of the rowers. The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly Maya captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes.|$|E

25|$|Development of the 959 (originally {{called the}} Gruppe B) started in 1981, {{shortly after the}} company's then-new Managing Director, Peter Schutz, took his office. Porsche's head {{engineer}} at the time, Helmuth Bott, approached Schutz with some ideas about the Porsche 911, or more aptly, a new one. Bott knew that the company needed a sports car that they could continue to rely on {{for years to come}} and that could be developed as time went on. <b>Curious</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how much they could do with the rear-engined 911, Bott convinced Schutz that development tests should take place, and even proposed researching a new all wheel drive system. Schutz agreed, and gave the project the green light. Bott also knew through experience that a racing program usually helped to accelerate the development of new models. Seeing Group B rally racing as the perfect arena to test the new mule and its all wheel drive system, Bott again went to Schutz and got the go ahead to develop a car, based on his development mule, for competition in Group B.|$|E
25|$|Lt. General Vernon A. Walters, a {{military}} attaché of Dwight Eisenhower and later military attaché in France from 1967–1973, noted the {{strong relationship between}} de Gaulle and Eisenhower, de Gaulle's unconditional support of Eisenhower during the U-2 incident, and de Gaulle's strong support of John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Thus Walters was intensely <b>curious</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the great contrast between de Gaulle's close relations with two United States presidents during notable Cold War crises and de Gaulle's later decision to withdraw France from NATO's military command, and Walters spoke with many close military and political aides of de Gaulle. Walters' conclusion, based upon de Gaulle's comments to many of his aides (and to Eisenhower during a meeting at Ramboullet Castle in 1959), is that de Gaulle feared that later United States presidents after Eisenhower would not have Eisenhower's special ties to Europe and would not risk nuclear war over Europe. Also, de Gaulle interpreted the peaceful resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis without fighting to take back Cuba from communism a mere 90 miles from the United States as {{an indication that the}} United States might not fight for Europe's defense 3,500 miles away following Soviet aggression in Europe, but would only go to war following a nuclear strike against the United States itself. De Gaulle told Eisenhower that France did not seek to compete with the Strategic Air Command or army of the United States, but believed that France needed a way to strike the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be <b>curious</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

The adjudicators awarded him first prize, believing he was a professional musician. In 1865, Parry again prepared an entry, {{but this time he}} travelled to the contest in Aberystwyth. Parry's anthem entry was lost in the post, so it could not be judged. Instead, he was given a seat in the Gorsedd and the title [...] "Pencerdd America" [...] ("Chief Musician of America").|$|E

500|$|In May 2013, Morrow {{spoke with}} Michael Logan of TV Guide, {{revealing}} {{that the question}} of Summer's paternity would be visited, as Nick's [...] "game-changing deception" [...] would be uncovered. It later revealed onscreen that Summer may in fact not be his daughter; the paternity results read only by Nick years ago were inconclusive. Logan called it [...] "messy development", stating that his character may be [...] "trashed forever". According to Morrow, after Cassie's death, Nick withheld the fact that the results were corrupted because [...] "he just couldn't bear the thought of losing Summer, too", but called it [...] "out of character". [...] "But now he's freaking out because there's a good likelihood that Summer and Kyle are brother and sister," [...] he stated. Nick later secretly does another test using hair from Summer's hairbrush, which comes back conclusive.

He stated that Nick is [...] "terrified" [...] of the potential repercussions and the reactions, from Jack, Sharon, Noah, and most importantly Summer. However, months later it was revealed that the paternity test results were actually switched by Nick's ex-wife Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), while she was off her bipolar medication, in a ploy to win Nick back, meaning that he is in fact Summer's biological father after all. Sharon's secret has yet to be revealed. Speaking of the forthcoming reveal, King stated, [...] "I'm very <b>curious</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how they're going to play it out with Summer.
