40|$|A diet {{containing}} 65 {{per cent}} sucrose with added cholesterol resulted in hypercholestere-mia and increased tissue <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> in rats. Ten per cent corn oil with added cholesterol in Purina laboratory chow had {{no apparent effect}} on the serum total choles-terol but increased <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> in tissues. Ovarieetomy was without significant effect. Thyroidectomy or hypophysectomy aggravated the hypercholesteremia and the increased tissue <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> induced by the sucrose diet. The effect of hypo-physeetoniy was not due {{to the loss of}} thyrotrophie hormone alone. Addition of vitamin D aggravated hypercholesteremia and increased liver <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> in normal, thyroidectomized or hypophysectomized rats fed the sucrose diet. In ovarieetomized rats, the tissue <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> was also augmented. When corn oil diet was fed, the supplementary vitamin D increased the serum total cholesterol level of the thyroidecto-mized rat. PORTMAN et al. 1 observed that rats main-tained on a diet containing sucrose as the carbohydrate source excreted about half the amount of total bile acids as did animals fed a commercial diet. This led to further stud-ies 2 which showed that the sucrose diet pro-duced hypercholesteremia in the rat, but that the rise in serum cholesterol level was very slight without the addition of cholate in the diet. Interest in studying a highly athero-genic diet regimen without the use of cholate led to a diet containing a high proportion of sucrose. The effect of corn oil on serum and tissue total cholesterol concentrations was also studied. Pfleiderer 3 observed in 1932 that the devel-opment of arterio- and atherosclerosis was stimulated by the combined administration of vitamin D and cholesterol. Others 4 " 6 reported that vitamin D 2 and D 3 intensified the degree and increased the rate of development of hypercholesteremia in rabbits on a cholesterol diet. To study agents that may enhance the hypereholesteremic effect of sucrose diet, vita-min D was added.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol exits the endocytic circuits are not well understood. The process is defective in Niemann–Pick type C (NPC) disease in which cholesterol and sphingolipids accumulate in late endosomal compartments. This is accompanied by defective cholesterol esterification in the endoplasmic reticulum and impaired ATP-binding cassette transporter A 1 (ABCA 1) -dependent cholesterol efflux. We show here that overexpression of the recycling/exocytic Rab GTPase Rab 8 rescued the late endosomal <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> and sphingolipid mistrafficking in NPC fibroblasts. Rab 8 redistributed cholesterol from late endosomes to the cell periphery and stimulated cholesterol efflux to the ABCA 1 -ligand apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) without increasing cholesterol esterification. Depletion of Rab 8 from wild-type fibroblasts resulted in <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> within late endosomal compartments. This cholesterol accumulation was accompanied by impaired clearance of LDL-cholesterol from endocytic circuits to apoA-I {{and could not be}} bypassed by liver X receptor activation.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> in {{arterial}} wall drives atherosclerosis. The key {{goal of this}} study was to examine the relationship between plaque cholesterol content and patient characteristics that typically associate with disease state and lesion vulnerability. Quantitative assays for free cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, triglyceride, and protein markers in atherosclerotic plaque were established and applied to plaque samples from multiple patients and arterial beds (Carotid and peripheral arteries; 98 lesions in total). Results We observed a lower cholesterol level in restenotic than primary peripheral plaque. We observed a trend toward a higher level in symptomatic than asymptomatic carotid plaque. Peripheral plaque from a group of well-managed diabetic patients displayed a weak trend of more free <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> than plaque from non-diabetic patients. Plaque triglyceride content exhibited less difference in the same comparisons. We also measured cholesterol in multiple segments within one carotid plaque sample, and found that cholesterol content positively correlated with markers of plaque vulnerability, and negatively correlated with stability markers. Conclusions Our results offer important biological validation of cholesterol as a key lipid marker for plaque severity. Results also suggest cholesterol is a more sensitive plaque marker than routine histological staining for neutral lipids. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Vitamin E as an {{antioxidant}} prevents to LDL oxidation, while HDL {{levels in}} the blood can be increased. Intake of high cholesterol causes high LDL levels low High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and results the <b>deposition</b> of <b>cholesterol</b> in the blood vessels. <b>Cholesterol</b> <b>depositions</b> in the blood vessels can lead to Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). CHD is a disorder caused by a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Purpose: The study aimed to know the correlation intake of vitamin E and cholesterol with HDL level in coronary heart disease patient at Dr. Moewardi Hospital. Method of the Research: The research used observational cross-sectional. The data of vitamin E and cholesterol intake were obtained by using a 24 -hour recall during 3 days. HDL level was obtained from medical record of each patient. Pearson Product Moment correlation was used to measured if any correlation between intake of vitamin E and HDL as well as intake of cholesterol and HDL level. The sampling technique used consecutive sampling. Results: Most were male (88. 6 %). The subjects with vitamin E intake is not good category of 100 % and the subjects who good in cholesterol were 61. 4 %. The subjects with abnormal HDL levels were 95. 5 %. The correlation result of vitamin E intake and HDL obtained p = 0. 510 which means {{that there was no}} correlation between vitamin E intake and HDL levels.

40|$|Background-—Literature {{supports}} the “response-to-retention ” hypothesis—that during insulin resistance, impaired metabolism of remnant lipoproteins {{can contribute to}} accelerated cardiovascular disease progression. We used the JCR:LA-cp rat model of metabolic syndrome (MetS) {{to determine the extent}} of arterial accumulation of intestinal-derived remnants ex vivo and potential mechanisms that contribute to exacerbated <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> in insulin resistance. Methods and Results-—Arteries from control and MetS (insulin-resistant) JCR:LA-cp rats were perfused ex vivo with Cy 5 -labeled remnant lipoproteins, and their arterial retention was quantified by confocal microscopy. Arterial proteoglycans were isolated from control and MetS rats at 6, 12, and 32 weeks of age. There was a significant increase in the arterial retention of remnants and in associated cholesterol accumulation in MetS rats as compared to control rats. Mechanistic studies reveal that increased <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> is a result of greater arterial biglycan content; longer glycosaminoglycans and increased production of cholesterol-rich intestinal-derived remnants, as compared to controls. Additionally, perfusion of vessels treated with ezetimibe, alone or in combination with simvastatin, with remnants isolated from the respective treatment group reduced ex vivo arterial retention of remnant-derived cholesterol ex vivo as compared to untreated controls. Conclusions-—Increased progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in MetS and type 2 diabetes mellitus might be explained in part by an increase in the arterial retention of cholesterol-rich remnants. Furthermore, ezetimibe alone or in combination treatment with simvastatin could be beneficial in ameliorating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in insuli...|$|E

However, the major loci of enhanced synthesis of subfractions of CER-VLDL, their interaction with macrophages, and their relative contribution to atherogenesis {{have not yet been}} elucidated. To determine whether anabolism is hepatic or intestinal, subfractions of CER-VLDL were characterized at selected intervals from day 0 to 60 of cholesterol feeding. Rate zonal ultracentrifugation of CER-VLDL from rabbits fed cholesterol for 4 and 60 d demonstrated an early increase of the proportion of cholesterol carried in the intestinally-derived fraction (designated as Fx-I) of VLDL compared with that in hepatically-derived particles (Fx-H). Quantification by size exclusion HPLC also demonstrated that Fx-I was a prominent CER-VLDL component at day 4, while Fx-H particles became increasingly prominent with further cholesterol feeding. At both 4 and 60 d Fx-I stimulated cholesterol esterification and intracellular cholesterol content in macrophages more than the corresponding Fx-H did. In fact, Fx-H harvested at 4 d produced no <b>cholesterol</b> ester <b>deposition.</b> In contrast, Fx-H harvested at 60 d markedly stimulated cholesterol esterification and intracellular cholesterol content.

40|$|Tangier {{disease is}} a {{familial}} disorder characterized by orange tonsils, <b>cholesterol</b> ester <b>deposition</b> in reticuloendothelial cells, abnormal chylomicron remnants, and a marked reduction in high density lipoproteins. Plasma concentrations of the apolipoproteins apo-A-I and apoA-II in patients with Tangier disease are approximately 1 % and 7 % of those in normal subjects, respectively. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the low plasma concentrations of apoA-I and apoA-II are due to increased fractional catabolism with a relatively normal apoA-I and apoA-II synthesis. Plasma apoA-I and apoA-II were isolated to electrophoretic homogeneity from delipidated plasma lipoproteins from a patient with Tangier disease. ApoA-I Tangier differed from apoA-I from control subjects in amino acid composition, electrophoretic mobility, apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and heterogeneity of isoforms on isoelectric focusing. ApoA-II Tangier, however, appeared to be identical to normal apoA-II in amino acid composition and in immunological as well as chemical properties. These results have been interpreted as indicating that apoA-I Tangier has a different covalent structure than does normal apoA-I, and apoA-II Tangier is identical to normal apoA-II. This structural change in apoA-I Tangier is associated with rapid catabolism of apoA-I Tangier-and apoA-II Tangier-containing plasma lipoproteins, and it leads to the deficiency in high density lipoproteins, abnormal chylomicron remnants, and the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol ester characteristic of Tangier disease...|$|R
40|$|Inflammation of {{the middle}} ear cavity (otitis media) and the {{abnormal}} deposition of bone at the otic capsule are common causes of conductive hearing impairment in children and adults. Although a host of environmental factors can contribute to these conditions, a genetic predisposition has an important role as well. Here, we analyze the Tail-short (Ts) mouse, which harbors a spontaneous semi-dominant mutation that causes skeletal defects and hearing loss. By genetic means, we show that the Ts phenotypes arise from an 18 -kb deletion/insertion of the Rpl 38 gene, encoding a ribosomal protein of the large subunit. We show that Ts mutants exhibit significantly elevated auditory-brain stem response thresholds and reduced distortion-product otoacoustic emissions, in the presence of normal endocochlear potentials and typical inner ear histology suggestive of a conductive hearing impairment. We locate the cause of the hearing impairment to the middle ear, demonstrating over-ossification at the round window ridge, ectopic <b>deposition</b> of <b>cholesterol</b> crystals in the middle ear cavity, enlarged Eustachian tube, and chronic otitis media with effusion all beginning at around 3 weeks after birth. Using specific antisera, we demonstrate that Rpl 38 is an ∼ 8 -kDa protein that is predominantly expressed in mature erythrocytes. Finally, using an Rpl 38 cDNA transgene, we rescue the Ts phenotypes. Together, these data present a previously uncharacterized combination of interrelated middle ear pathologies and suggest Rpl 38 deficiency as a model to dissect the causative relationships between neo-ossification, <b>cholesterol</b> crystal <b>deposition,</b> and Eustachian tubes in the etiology of otitis media...|$|R

A lipid profile was obtained immediately before starting LDL-apheresis, a second profile was obtained within four hours after LDL-apheresis. Chit activity and anti-oxLDL levels were determined with appropriate methods in all patients before and after LDL- apheresis. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL- cholesterol and triglycerides decreased significantly after LDL-apheresis, while the variations of Chit activity and anti-oxLDL were not significant after LDL-apheresis. The correlation between Chit and total cholesterol was negative (r= – 0. 44 and – 0. 50 res- pectively) before and after LDL-apheresis as between Chit and LDL-cholesterol (r= – 0. 45 and – 0. 55 respectively). Anti-oxLDL concentration before and after LDL-apheresis positively correlated with Chit activity (r= 0. 52 and r = 0. 63 respectively), negatively with total cholesterol (r= – 0. 33 and r = – 0. 35 res- pectively) and with LDL (r = – 0. 32 and r = – 0. 21 respectively). We think that removing LDL with LDL-apheresis the anti-oxLDL/oxLDL ratio could increase and the excess of anti-oxLDL could induce macrophage activation through the surface Fc receptors. Alternatively {{with high levels of}} LDL- <b>cholesterol,</b> the <b>deposition</b> of foam cells represent the characteristic evolution of atherosclerosis process.

In diabetes, the prevalence of rheumatological diseases is high, {{mainly because of the}} deleterious effects of advanced glycation end products that deteriorate the biological and mechanical functions of tendons and ligaments. In heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, most patients develop Achilles xanthomatosis, a marker of high risk for cardiovascular disease caused by <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> in the tendons. Tendon degeneration has also been observed in non-familial hyper-cholesterolaemia. Monosodium urate crystal deposition in soft tissues is a hallmark of chronic gouty arthritis. In this group of diseases, the mobilization of cholesterol and uric acid crystals is presumably followed by low-grade inflammation, which is responsible for tendon degeneration. Adiposity may con-tribute to tendon disorders via two different mechanisms: increased weight on the load-bearing tendons and systemic dysmetabolic factors that trigger subclinical persistent inflammation.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{variables}} that influence lipid deposition on conventional and silicone hydrogel contact lens materials and to build a physiologically relevant in vitro model of lipid deposition on contact lenses. Methods: Lipid deposition on contact lens materials can lead to discomfort and vision difficulty for lens wearers. Using a variety of radiochemical experiments and two model lipids (cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine), a number of clinically significant parameters that may influence lipid deposition were examined. •	The optimization and characterization of a novel artificial tear solution (ATS) was examined (Chapter 3) •	Optimization of an extraction system to remove deposited cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine from various contact lens materials (Chapter 4) •	The influence of different tear film components on lipid deposition was researched (Chapter 5) •	The efficiency of hydrogen peroxide disinfecting solutions to remove deposited lipid from contact lenses was investigated (Chapter 6) •	The effect of intermittent air exposure on lipid deposition was examined {{through the use of}} a custom built “model blink cell” (Chapter 7) Results: A novel complex ATS designed for in-vial incubations of contact lens materials was developed. This solution was stable and did not adversely affect the physical parameters of the contact lenses incubated within it. An efficient extraction protocol for deposited cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine was optimized based on chloroform and methanol with the addition of water and acetic acid for phosphatidylcholine extraction. Overall, <b>cholesterol</b> and phosphatidylcholine <b>deposition</b> is cumulative over time and found to deposit in greater masses on silicone-containing hydrogels. <b>Cholesterol</b> and phosphatidylcholine <b>deposition</b> is influenced by the composition of the incubation medium and air exposure which occurs during the inter-blink period.

40|$|Atherosclerosis is an {{inflammatory}} disease linked to elevated blood cholesterol concentrations. Despite ongoing {{advances in the}} prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease remains {{the leading cause of}} death worldwide. Continuous retention of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in the subendothelial space causes a local overabundance of free cholesterol. Because <b>cholesterol</b> accumulation and <b>deposition</b> of <b>cholesterol</b> crystals (CCs) trigger a complex inflammatory response, we tested the efficacy of the cyclic oligosaccharide 2 -hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CD), a compound that increases cholesterol solubility in preventing and reversing atherosclerosis. We showed that CD treatment of murine atherosclerosis reduced atherosclerotic plaque size and CC load and promoted plaque regression even with a continued cholesterol-rich diet. Mechanistically, CD increased oxysterol production in both macrophages and human atherosclerotic plaques and promoted liver X receptor (LXR) -mediated transcriptional reprogramming to improve cholesterol efflux and exert anti-inflammatory effects. In vivo, this CD-mediated LXR agonism was required for the antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effects of CD as well as for augmented reverse cholesterol transport. Because CD treatment in humans is safe and CD beneficially affects key mechanisms of atherogenesis, it may therefore be used clinically to prevent or treat human atherosclerosis...|$|R

Both diseases are characterized by the lowering or lack of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low serum cholesterol. The murine ABCA 1 −/− phenotype corroborates the human TD linkage to ABCA 1. Similar to TD in humans, HDL-C is virtually absent in ABCA 1 −/− mice accompanied by a reduction in serum <b>cholesterol</b> and lipid <b>deposition</b> in various tissues.

Furthermore, the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from P. gingivalis on cholesterol transport and the related gene expression was examined in peritoneal macrophages. Alveolar bone resorption and elevation of systemic inflammatory responses were induced in both strains. Despite early changes in the expression of key genes involved in cholesterol turnover, such as liver X receptor and ATP-binding cassette A 1, serum lipid profiles did not change with short-term infection. Long-term infection was associated with a reduction in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol but not with the development of atheroscleroti...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{hundred and}} eighty, sexed (White Leghorn) chicks were divided {{so that each}} sex was fed one of eight rations to {{determine}} the effect of sex, dietary cholesterol, and stearic, oleic, and/or linoleic acid on <b>cholesterol</b> <b>deposition</b> in blood, liver and aortic tissues. After 5 months on the dietary regimen, 3 cockerels from each of the rations were orally administered 100 mC. sodium-l-Cl 4 -acetate and 200 mC. cholesterol-l, 2 -H 5 to determine whether body tissues contained cholesterol from endogenous or exogenous origin. After 5 months on the experimental rations it was observed that male birds had higher free cholesterol levels than did females. The addition of cholesterol (2 %) and fatty acids (6 %) to ration increased free cholesterol levels in liver and aorta. Cholesterol stored in livers and aortas occurs principally as free cholesterol while blood cholesterol was in esterified form. Cholesterol levels in both liver and aorta are primarily of endogenous origin. POULTRY SCIENCE 54 : 1036 - 1042, 1975 CHOLESTEROL, found almost exclu-sively in the animal organism, is present in most cells and fluids of the body. Values for intact animals range from 0. 12 to 0. 3 gra...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), an {{autosomal}} recessive lipid-storage hereditary disorder, {{is caused by}} mutations in the sterol 27 -hydroxylase gene (CYP 27). A 24 -year-old female Japanese CTX patient and her parents were studied for a CYP 27 mutation. Multiple xanthomas were the main complaint of the patient and plasma cholestanol level was markedly elevated. Sterol analysis of a xanthoma biopsy confirmed <b>cholesterol</b> and cholestanol <b>deposition,</b> and the cholestanol accounted for 8. 1 % of the total setrols. Sterol 27 -hydroxylase activity in fibroblasts derived from the patient was undetectable, while the activities in fibroblasts from {{her mother and father}} were 54 % and 41 % of the normal level, respectively. Direct sequence analysis showed a missense mutation of A for G substitution in the CYP 27 gene at codon 362 (CGT 362 Arg to CAT 362 His) with a homozygous pattern in the patient, and a heterozygous pattern in the parents. The mutation, which eliminates a normal HgaI endonuclease site at position 1195 of the cDNA and is located at the adrenodoxin binding region of the gene, is most probably responsible for the decreased sterol 27 -hydroxylase activity in this Japanese CTX family. The combined data strongly support that the primary enzymatic defect in CTX is the disruption of sterol 27 -hydroxylase and that the disease is inherited in an {{autosomal recessive}} trait...|$|R
40|$|Arterial elastin {{appears to}} be a proteinlipid complex with the lipid {{component}} being bound to elastin peptide groups. In atherosclerotic lesions the lipid content of elastin increases progressively with increasing severity of atherosclerosis. The increases in the lipid content of plaque elastin are mainly due to large increases in cholesterol with about 80 % of the cholesterol being <b>cholesterol</b> ester. This <b>deposition</b> of <b>cholesterol</b> in elastin accounts for a substantial part of the total cholesterol accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions of all stages. The present in vitro study suggests that the mechanism involved in the deposition of lipids in arterial elastin may be an interaction of the elastin protein with serum or arterial low density or very low density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) resulting in a transfer of lipids, but not of lipoprotein protein to the elastin. No significant lipid transfer occurred from the high density lipoproteins or chylomicrons. The amount of lipid taken up by plaque elastin was strikingly higher than by normal elastin and consisted mainly of cholesterol with over 80 % of the cholesterol being cholesterol ester. The precondition for the lipid accumulation in plaque elastin appeared to be an altered amino acid composition of the elastin protein consisting of an increase in polar amino acids and a reduction in cross-linking amino acids. Subsequent treatment of lipoprotein-incubated arterial elastin with hot alkali and apolipoproteins did not reverse the binding of lipoprotein lipid to diseased elastin...|$|R
40|$|Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is {{the major}} protein {{component}} of HDL, where it {{plays an important role}} in <b>cholesterol</b> transport. The <b>deposition</b> of apoA-I derived amyloid is associated with various hereditary systemic amyloidoses and atherosclerosis; however, very little is known about the mechanism of apoA-I amyloid formation. Methionine residues in apoA-I are oxidized via several mechanisms in vivo to form methionine sulfoxide (MetO), and significant levels of methionine oxidized apoA-I (MetO-apoA-I) are present in normal human serum. We investigated the effect of methionine oxidation on the structure, stability, and aggregation of full-length, lipid-free apoA-I. Circular dichrosim spectroscopy showed that oxidation of all three methionine residues in apoA-I caused partial unfolding of the protein and decreased its thermal stability, reducing the melting temperature (Tm) from 58. 7 [*]°C for native apoA-I to 48. 2 [*]°C for MetO-apoA-I. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that methionine oxidation inhibited the native self association of apoA-I to form dimers and tetramers. Incubation of MetO-apoA-I for extended periods resulted in aggregation of the protein, and these aggregates bound Thioflavin T and Congo Red. Inspection of the aggregates by electron microscopy revealed fibrillar structures with a ribbon-like morphology, widths of approximately 11  nm, and lengths of up to several microns. X-ray fibre diffraction studies of the fibrils revealed a diffraction pattern with orthogonal peaks at spacings of 4. 64  Å and 9. 92  Å, indicating a cross-β amyloid structure. This systematic study of fibril formation by full-length apoA-I represents the first demonstration that methionine oxidation can induce amyloid fibril formation...|$|R
