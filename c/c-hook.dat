40|$|The {{incidence}} of complete acromioclavicular joint disloca-tion is 3 to 4 per 100 000, {{with up to}} 50 % of acromioclavic-ular joint injuries occurring during sports activities. The most common mechanism of injury is usually a direct blow to the lateral aspect of the shoulder with the arm in an adducted position leading to an inferior and anterior trans-lation of the scapula relative to the clavicle. Treatment of complete acromioclavicular joint disrup-tion remains controversial and ranges from rehabilitation to an extensive surgical reconstruction using tendon grafts. 8, 17, 27 For type III injuries, 31 the nonsurgical and sur-gical approaches have resulted in similar outcomes. 2, 25 However, high-grade injuries with more than 100 % dis-placement of the acromioclavicular joint are typically treated surgically. 19 More than 60 surgical techniques for acromioclavicular joint reconstruction have been described. These include rigid repairs such as transarticular pinning, acromioclavicular plates, coracoclavicular screws, and <b>C-hook</b> implants, 33 as well as augmentations like polydioxanone (PDS) cerclage, 4, 1...|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} components used Type 58 Pattern <b>C-hooks</b> for {{the belt}} attachment, and angled D-rings for the shoulder harness attachment on the ammunition pouches. There were separate {{left and right}} pouches. The first utility pouches in production, had additional belt attachments for high mounting, similar to the ammunition pouches of the Type 37 Pattern or Type 44 Pattern webbing. Later produced PLCE webbing of the Type 90 Pattern incorporates ambidextrous yoke fittings and the standard PLCE webbing belt attachments (see below).|$|R
50|$|The National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee) of the German Democratic Republic {{designed}} and introduced the Uniformtrageversuch 85-90 (UTV 85-90), resembling, {{with the exception}} of the clothing system, a modified duplicate of the British Type 58 Pattern webbing, inheriting very similar features in appearance and function. The shoulder harness was of identical design, the belt had featured the use of identical buckles, and Type 58 Pattern <b>C-hooks</b> had been incorporated in all components. Complementary items, such as pouches, had been changed in design and size, to meet Warsaw Pact requirements. The webbing system and components were produced of a more robust Nylon material, and featured the Strichtarn camouflage pattern. Whilst this late improvement was observed by the British Armed Forces, and being found to be an affront, especially against the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), no further considerations have been made, as the testing of prototypic PLCE equipment was already underway.|$|R
