2500|$|Though {{the game}} was [...] "carefully {{constructed}} to be fun and factual", {{in some cases the}} historical accuracy was sidestepped in favor of ease of gameplay, creating fun puzzles, and increasing visual clarity.

In addition, while efforts were made to convey historically accurate scenarios, they could only do so based on the available evidence which they sometimes extrapolated from. In situations where the truth is unknown, certain viewpoints were chosen. For example, while there is no evidence that Hatshepsut wore a false beard. She is often depicted wearing one in statues and hieroglyphs and the game's designers decided to include this [...] "intriguing, if debatable, element".
