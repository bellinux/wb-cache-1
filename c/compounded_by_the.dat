5|$|The longer 7.5cm {{guns were}} a mixed blessing. In {{spite of the}} designers' efforts to {{conserve}} weight, the new weapon made the vehicle nose-heavy {{to such an extent}} that the forward suspension springs were under constant compression. This resulted in the tank tending to sway even when no steering was being applied, an effect <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> introduction of the Ausführung H in March 1943.|$|E
5|$|August 30, 1999– Hurricane Dennis {{parallels}} the state offshore, and {{five days later}} it executes a loop and makes landfall along Cape Lookout National Seashore as a strong tropical storm. The hurricane drops heavy rainfall peaking at 19.9inches (506mm) in Ocracoke, while its extended duration offshore causes localized severe beach erosion. The rainfall causes flooding along several rivers, which is <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> effects of Hurricane Floyd just weeks later. Damage in the state amounts to over $50million.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy {{casualties in}} the battles. Estimates {{of the number of}} Austro-Hungarian casualties vary. Jordan states that the Austro-Hungarians suffered a total of 37,000 {{casualties in the}} battle, of whom 7,000 were fatalities. Misha Glenny states that almost 30,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers were wounded and 6,000–10,000 were killed. Horne writes that the Austro-Hungarians had 8,000 soldiers killed and 30,000 wounded in the battle, <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loss of 46 cannons, 30 machine guns and 140 ammunition wagons. Historian David Stevenson states that 4,500 Austro-Hungarian soldiers were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Crash noted how Knight Lore masking {{technique}} addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and Sinclair User appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound {{to be its}} weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later rooms of the castle require pixel-perfect precision, <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> anxiety of the running timer, and the game's animations would slow down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5000|$|H2salen is commercially available. It {{was first}} {{prepared}} by Pfeiffer.

On August 24 the Pan American Development Foundation sent food to all people living in temporary shelters and Venezuela delivered 11 tonnes of emergency food to Sud-Est in 500 family bags. Hurricane assistance was then <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> country's standard humanitarian assistance programs and became indistinct from the country's continued poverty crisis.|$|E
5|$|One of the year's best {{music videos}} was {{directed}} by Jay-Z and cost about zero dollars to make. The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's Take-Away Shows, its appeal <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shock of seeing such a notoriously manicured superstar without embellishment. It's all quite endearing and personal – two words one might not often associate with this superhumanly talented and famous couple.|$|E
5|$|Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler {{continued}} and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, {{or at least}} differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> workshop system. It {{was not until the}} late 1950s, after the research of Friedländer, Panofsky and Meyer Schapiro, that the attributions generally accepted today were established.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{dominance}} of the Gelug sect of Buddhism in Tawang, the Nyingmapa or the Black Hat sect of Buddhism was dominant and this resulted in their hegemony and even hostile approach towards the founder, Merek Lama. This problem was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Drukpas of Bhutan, who also belonged to the Nyingmapa sect, who even tried to invade and take control of Tawang. Hence, when the Tawang monastery was built like a fort structure, a strategic location was chosen from the defense point of view.|$|E
5|$|The tests {{conducted}} {{in preparation for}} the parade revealed a number of flaws in the design including poor directional stability, a cramped cockpit without heating or ventilation, poor access to the engine, inadequate fuel capacity, <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of a fuel gauge, and poor elevator control forces. Five aircraft were modified to correct these issues before resuming the factory's testing in late 1946. The modifications were not entirely successful and the lateral stability was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak. Engine problems, however, plagued the tests as the first prototype alone required four engine changes.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{significant}} {{problems with the}} casemate guns early on, however. They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that they had}} been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates.|$|E
500|$|Nine proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are called [...] "essential" [...] for humans because they cannot be {{produced}} from other <b>compounds</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> human body and so {{must be taken}} in as food.

5|$|Translation {{problems}} are <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> women's confusion over {{which type of}} FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it. Several {{studies have suggested that}} survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} {{who claimed to}} have received a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that there might have been survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished flight failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (<b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight might have been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust might have been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E
5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that ASL is often glossed in English {{due to the lack}} of a standard writing system.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E
5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E
5|$|At mid-season, WCBS {{announced}} {{that for the}} 2003–04 season it had acquired the broadcast rights to The People's Court after WNBC, which had been airing the revived series since its 1997 debut, dropped it from its lineup. WCBS announced plans to move The People's Court into the time slot that was occupied by Millionaire and the still-airing 4:30 pm local newscast once it joined the station's lineup in September 2003. This led to speculation that the syndicated Millionaire would not be returning for a second season, and BVT's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that there were}} not many time slots available for the show in New York outside of the undesirable late-night slots that syndicators try to avoid.|$|E
