5000|$|Lujiang Prison is {{a prison}} in Chaohu City, Anhui, China {{established}} in 1957 with {{an area of}} 987mu. It is a high security prison for serious offenders currently employing over 1,600. The prison {{is one of the}} largest national valve manufactures with a 40-year-old state enterprise that produces standard valves such as: GB code, English BS, American ANSI, API, AWWA, MSS, German DIN 4.0, [...] "Bai Hu" [...] brand gate valve, cut-off, <b>check,</b> <b>ball,</b> valve, water special purpose valves as well as micro anti-slow products and filters. There are a total of 100 models, 1000 specifications and valves sizes of 15-1600mm produced here. Past projects have included the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall and Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant. In 1997 it received (DNV)ISO9002 quality system authentication via Norwegian Classification Society. In 1998 it had large shares of stock in Shanghai East China Valve Ltd. [...] "Baihu" [...] was given famous provincial brand and trademark title, and a top-notch brand award in valve profession. Also labeled a high-quality product and exempt from inspection. In 1998 the prison received Anhui Province prize for quality control. Lujiang Changtai Machine Works was approved by the State Economic and Trade Commission to manage valve factory's imports and exports. Products are exported to other countries including Britain and the US. Several valves are best-selling in over 60 countries and regions, including the US, Japan, Britain, France, and Germany.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valve is a {{check valve}} in which the closing member, the movable part to block the flow, is a ball. In some <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valves, the <b>ball</b> is {{spring-loaded}} to help keep it shut. For those designs without a spring, reverse flow is required to move the ball toward the seat and create a seal. The interior surface of the main seats of <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valves {{are more or less}} conically-tapered to guide the ball into the seat and form a positive seal when stopping reverse flow.|$|R

50|$|Check valves {{are often}} used with some types of pumps. Piston-driven and {{diaphragm}} pumps such as metering pumps and pumps for chromatography commonly use inlet and outlet <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valves. These valves often look like small cylinders attached to the pump head on the inlet and outlet lines. Many similar pump-like mechanisms for moving volumes of fluids around use check valves such as <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valves. The feed pumps or injectors which supply water to steam boilers are fitted with check valves to prevent back-flow.|$|R
5000|$|Nivia makes {{hand made}} balls. A {{basketball}} starts as a blob of rubber and squeezed through a machine {{over and over}} to flatten it to 0.5 - 1mm. Then it's cut & molded into round shape. This is the bladder that holds air. Bladders are inflated and woven by nylon thread around them. It strengthens the balls and helps stay around. When the mummy-looking balls got their skins they finally starts looking like basketballs. Rough edges are smoothed and lines are drawn by hands using one careful stroke at a time. Before the balls are ready for the courts, they are checked for air leaks for 24 hrs. A sample goes through a shooting test. The ball is shot at a speed of 25 mph at an iron plate of thickness of 1 inch for 2000 times. Then its diameter is measured in several spots to see if the ball kept its round shape. Finally after quality <b>checks,</b> <b>balls</b> are deflated for dispatching to tournaments. Covering the entire processes, in every 3 seconds Nivia makes 1 ball. CNNMoney takes through the making of basketball in Nivia's factory situated at Jalandhar (Punjab), India.|$|R
50|$|A sample bailer is {{generally}} around a meter long, {{and has a}} hollow tube (the barrel) usually around 40 mm in diameter, with a 'ball check' {{on the bottom and}} an opening at the top. This tool is beat downwards into the as yet unknown obstruction using the mechanical jars and weight above of the wireline toolstring. Generally, after a predetermined amount of 'hits', hopefully allowing a usable sample of solids to fill the barrel. When the tool is pulled upwards, the solids usually (hopefully) settle the <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> onto its 'seat', which will keep the solids in the barrel during the return trip to surface, where the solids can be inspected to determine what the downhole obstruction was. This procedure can be 'hit and miss', the success depending on how readily the solid was accepted into the barrel, and if the <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> was properly seated on the return trip to surface. If the <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> is not seated (sometimes a large, hard piece of solid will sit in between the ball and seat) downhole fluids tend to 'wash' the sample out of the bottom of the sample bailer, leaving the inspectors at surface wondering if the tool actually collected a sample. Persistence {{is generally}} a good rule of thumb with this tool.|$|R
50|$|The {{governor}} {{is connected to}} the output shaft and regulates the hydraulic pressure depending on the vehicle speed. The engine load is monitored either by a throttle cable or a vacuum modulator. The valve body is the hydraulic control center that receives pressurized fluid from the main pump operated by the fluid coupling/torque converter. The pressure coming from this pump is regulated and used to run a network of spring-loaded valves, <b>check</b> <b>balls</b> and servo pistons. The valves use the pump pressure and the pressure from a centrifugal governor on the output side (as well as hydraulic signals from the range selector valves and the throttle valve or modulator) to control which ratio is selected on the gearset; as the vehicle and engine change speed, the difference between the pressures changes, causing different sets of valves to open and close. The hydraulic pressure controlled by these valves drives the various clutch and brake band actuators, thereby controlling the operation of the planetary gearset to select the optimum gear ratio for the current operating conditions. However, in many modern automatic transmissions, the valves are controlled by electro-mechanical servos which are controlled by the electronic engine control unit (ECU) or a separate transmission control unit (TCU, also known as transmission control module (TCM).|$|R
5000|$|There {{are similar}} check valves where the disc {{is not a}} ball, but some other shape, such as a poppet {{energized}} by a spring. <b>Ball</b> <b>check</b> valves {{should not be confused}} with ball valves, which is a different type of valve in which a ball acts as a controllable rotor to stop or direct flow.|$|R
50|$|Inscriptions on {{the wooden}} balls are {{nowadays}} made with a laser, to avoid any difference in weight between them. They weigh 3 g and have a diameter of 18.8 mm.

40|$|In a water {{distribution}} system, Flow Control Valve {{is used to}} control the flow rate in the pipeline connections. In this thesis, a fixed flow control valve is investigated to reduce the flow rate and set to deliver the pre-set flow of 5 - 6 LPM (litre per minute). Which helps to distribute the water for a maximum period and maintains the usage only for the drinking purpose. A geometry of FCV with a <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valve is implemented, where the <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> helps to stop the back flow of the fluid from the valve. Detailed inspection of dynamic changes in pressure and flow velocity in the valve are conducted through simulation. The study of fluid properties describes the expected design and specifies the flow structure in the valve. The results of this project demonstrate a good performance of the design-build and influence the requirements. The obtained values in the simulation, analytical and experimental results are compatible, which concludes the survey of FCV is equipped to custom...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>check</b> valves {{are often}} very small, simple, and cheap. They are {{commonly}} used in liquid or gel minipump dispenser spigots, spray devices, some rubber bulbs for pumping air, etc., manual air pumps and some other pumps, and refillable dispensing syringes. Although the balls are most often made of metal, they can be made of other materials; in some specialized cases out of highly durable or inert materials, such as sapphire. High pressure HPLC pumps and similar applications commonly use small inlet and outlet <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valves with both balls and seats made of artificial ruby, for both hardness and chemical resistance. After prolonged use, such check valves can eventually wear out or the seat can develop a crack, requiring replacement. Therefore, such valves are made to be replaceable, sometimes placed in a small plastic body tightly-fitted inside a metal fitting which can withstand high pressure and which is screwed into the pump head.|$|R
50|$|A disc or {{valve member}} is a movable {{obstruction}} inside the stationary body that adjustably restricts {{flow through the}} valve. Although traditionally disc-shaped, discs come in various shapes. Depending {{on the type of}} valve, a disc can move linearly inside a valve, or rotate on the stem (as in a butterfly valve), or rotate on a hinge or trunnion (as in a <b>check</b> valve). A <b>ball</b> is a round valve member with one or more paths between ports passing through it. By rotating the ball, flow can be directed between different ports. Ball valves use spherical rotors with a cylindrical hole drilled as a fluid passage. Plug valves use cylindrical or conically tapered rotors called plugs. Other round shapes for rotors are possible as well in rotor valves, as long as the rotor can be turned inside the valve body. However, not all round or spherical discs are rotors; for example, a <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valve uses the ball to block reverse flow, but is not a rotor because operating the valve does not involve rotation of the ball.|$|R
2500|$|... 1934 {{was perhaps}} the best season of Paige's career, as he went 14–2 in league games while {{allowing}} 2.16 runs per game, recording 144 strikeouts, and giving up only 26 walks. On July 4, Paige threw his second no-hitter, this time against the Homestead Grays. He struck out 17, and only a first inning walk to future Hall of Famer Buck Leonard and an error in the fourth inning prevented it from being a perfect game. Leonard, unnerved by the rising swoop of the ball, repeatedly asked the umpire to <b>check</b> the <b>ball</b> for scuffing. When the umpire removed one ball from play, Paige hollered, [...] "You may as well thrown 'em all out 'cause they're all gonna jump like that." ...|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{check valves}} can be {{connected}} in series. For example, a {{double check valve}} is often used as a backflow prevention device to keep potentially contaminated water from siphoning back into municipal water supply lines. There are also double <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valves {{in which there are}} two ball/seat combinations sequentially in the same body to ensure positive leak-tight shutoff when blocking reverse flow; and piston check valves, wafer check valves, and ball-and-cone check valves.|$|R
50|$|If the {{wireline}} were {{to become}} severed from the tool, a <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valve can seal the well off from the surface. During wireline operations, a steel ball sits {{to the side of}} a confined area within the grease head while the cable runs {{in and out of the}} hole. If the wireline exits that confined area under pressure, the pressure will force the steel ball up towards the hole where the wireline had been. The ball's diameter is larger than that of the hole, so the ball effectively seals off pressure to the surface.|$|R
50|$|Pumps used in {{high-pressure}} chromatography such as HPLC and {{ion chromatography}} are much like small piston metering pumps. For wear resistance and chemical resistance to solvents, etc., typically the pistons {{are made of}} artificial sapphire and the <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valves have ruby balls and sapphire seats. To produce good chromatograms, it is desirable to have a pumping flow rate as constant as possible. Either a single piston pump with a quick refill is used or a double pump head with coordinated piston strokes is used to provide as constant a pumping rate as possible.|$|R
5000|$|The {{patent for}} the Zerk fitting was granted to Oscar U. Zerk in January 1929, and the {{assignee}} was the Alemite Manufacturing Corporation (thus the eponymous {{names for the}} fittings). Alemite was already marketing <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valves to accept grease supplied under pressure from a grease gun, such as for car and truck chassis lubrication points, both for OEM installations and for aftermarket upgrade kits which would screw in as replacements for stock grease cups. But Zerk's fitting was an improved style, less vulnerable to dirt and more forgiving of angled approach. Today, many companies make these grease fittings.|$|R
50|$|The basket {{consists}} of a metal ring 18 in in internal diameter, suspended horizontally 10 ft above the floor such that {{the center of the}} ring is equidistant from each sideline and 5 ft from the end line. The basket ring has a net attached below to briefly <b>check</b> the <b>ball's</b> downward progress and indicate a score. The ring is fastened to a rectangular backboard 6 ft wide by 3.5 ft tall, though in lower levels of play or recreational use the backboard may be smaller and/or fan-shaped. The entire structure is supported from behind and anchored to the floor beyond the end line at higher levels of play; the structure may be anchored to a wall or ceiling at lower levels of play. The ring, net, and the front, top, bottom, and sides of the backboard are all considered inbounds, while the back of the backboard and the support structure - even those parts suspended over inbounds areas of the court - are considered out of bounds.|$|R
50|$|At {{the bottom}} of the tubing is the {{down-hole}} pump. This pump has two <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valves: a stationary valve at bottom called the standing valve, and a valve on the piston connected to {{the bottom of}} the sucker rods that travels up and down as the rods reciprocate, known as the traveling valve. Reservoir fluid enters from the formation into {{the bottom of the}} borehole through perforations that have been made through the casing and cement (the casing is a larger metal pipe that runs the length of the well, which has cement placed between it and the earth; the tubing, pump, and sucker rod are all inside the casing).|$|R
50|$|There are {{advantages}} and disadvantages to using bailers for groundwater sampling. Bailers are simple devices to use and are relatively inexpensive. Disposable bailers are usually cleaned to United States Environmental Protection Agency specifications and individually packaged to protect sample integrity. In addition, bailers can be lowered to any depth while pumps have sharp limitations on {{the depth of the}} well. The main drawback of using bailers is aeration of the water as the sample is obtained, which could release volatile organic compounds that need to be tested. Also, if there is a high amount of sediment or turbidity, this may interfere with the <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valve seating correctly.|$|R
50|$|Various designs {{attempt to}} improve on the basic concept {{in any number of}} ways. One common change is to use two sets of holes, each {{designed}} specifically to be efficient at capturing or releasing the gas. In this case the forward set of holes is similar to the single-hole example, but a second rearward set of holes is added, using <b>check</b> valves (typically <b>ball</b> bearings in a pit) to allow the high-pressure gases in, but not out again. The system may be arranged to allow the gases to escape through the forward set of holes before the shell reaches it, causing a partial vacuum to develop directly behind the shell, aiding extraction.|$|R
5000|$|Piston-driven {{metering}} pumps commonly work as follows: There is a piston (sometimes called plunger), typically cylindrical, which {{can go in}} and out of a correspondingly shaped chamber in the pump head. The inlet and outlet lines are joined to the piston chamber. There are two <b>check</b> valves, often <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valves, attached to the pump head, one at the inlet line and the other at the outlet line. The inlet valve allows flow from the inlet line to the piston chamber, but not in the reverse direction. The outlet valve allows flow from the chamber to the outlet line, but not in reverse. The motor repeatedly moves the piston into and out of the piston chamber, causing the volume of the chamber to repeatedly become smaller and larger. When the piston moves out, a vacuum is created. Low pressure in the chamber causes liquid to enter and fill the chamber through the inlet check valve, but higher pressure at the outlet causes the outlet valve to shut. Then when the piston moves in, it pressurizes the liquid in the chamber. High pressure in the chamber causes the inlet valve to shut and forces the outlet valve to open, forcing liquid out at the outlet. These alternating suction and discharge strokes are repeated over and over to meter the liquid. In back of the chamber, there is packing around the piston or a doughnut-shaped seal with a toroid-shaped sphincter-like spring inside compressing the seal around the piston. This holds the fluid pressure when the piston slides in and out and makes the pump leak-tight. The packing or seals can wear out after prolonged use and can be replaced. The metering rate can be adjusted by varying the strokelength by which the piston moves back and forth or varying the speed of the piston motion.|$|R
50|$|A bailer in {{hydrogeology}} is {{a hollow}} tube used to retrieve groundwater samples from monitoring wells. Groundwater monitoring wells are drilled {{in areas where}} there are underground storage tanks or where there is environmental remediation occurring. The wells are typically built out of PVC casing which is slotted to allow groundwater to flow freely through the well. Bailers are tied {{to a piece of}} rope (usually made from nylon or polypropylene) or a piece of wire (composed of Teflon or stainless steel) and lowered into the water column. Once lowered, the bailer uses a simple <b>ball</b> <b>check</b> valve to seal at the bottom in order to pull up a sample of the groundwater table. Bailers can be disposable or reusable, and they are made out of polyethylene, PVC, FEP or stainless steel.|$|R

40|$|Projecte final de carrera fet en copl. laboració amb École Polytechnique Fédérale de LaussanneThis master thesis {{presents}} {{a method for}} tracking a basketball during a basketball match recorded with a multi-camera system. We first developed methods to detect a ball in images based on its appearance. Color was used through a color histogram of the ball, manually initialized with ball samples. Then {{the shape of the}} ball was used in two different ways: by analyzing the circularity of the ball contour and by using the Hough transform to find circles in the image. In a second step, we attempted to track the ball in three dimensions using the cameras calibration, as well as the image methods previously developed. Using a recursive tracking procedure, we define a 3 -dimensional search volume around the previously known position of the ball and evaluate the presence of a ball in all candidate positions inside this volume. This is performed by projecting the candidate positions in all camera views and <b>checking</b> the <b>ball</b> presence using color and shape cues. Extrapolating the future position of the ball based on its movements in the past frames was also tested to make our method more robust to motion blur and occlusions. Evaluation of the proposed algorithm has been done on a set of synchronized multi-camera sequences. The results have shown that the algorithm can track the ball and find its 3 D position during several consecutive frames...|$|R

60|$|I {{possess a}} billiard secret {{which can be}} {{valuable}} to the Dooley sept, after I shall have conferred it upon Dooley--for a consideration. It is a discovery which I made by accident, thirty-eight years ago, in my father-in-law's house in Elmira. There was a scarred and battered and ancient billiard-table in the garret, and along with it a peck of <b>checked</b> and chipped <b>balls,</b> and a rackful of crooked and headless cues. I played solitaire up there every day with that difficult outfit. The table was not level, but slanted sharply to the southeast; there wasn't a ball that was round, or would complete the journey you started it on, but would always get tired and stop half-way and settle, with a jolty wabble, to a standstill on its chipped side. I tried making counts with four balls, but found it difficult and discouraging, so I added a fifth ball, then a sixth, then a seventh, and kept on adding until at last I had twelve balls {{on the table and}} a thirteenth to play with. My game was caroms--caroms solely--caroms plain, or caroms with cushion to help--anything that could furnish a count. In the course of time I found to my astonishment that I was never able to run fifteen, under any circumstances. By huddling the balls advantageously in the beginning, I could now and then coax fourteen out of them, but I couldn't reach fifteen by either luck or skill. Sometimes the balls would get scattered into difficult positions and defeat me in that way; sometimes if I managed to keep them together, I would freeze; and always when I froze, and had to play away from the contact, there was sure to be nothing to play at but a wide and uninhabited vacancy.|$|R
50|$|Nearly {{five minutes}} into the second half a brawl erupted between Brian Carney and Michael Crocker and in the {{aftermath}} Crocker {{was sent to the}} sin bin. A few minutes later, following a handling error by Lockyer close to the centre of his own try-line, Great Britain were awarded a scrum feed. From the scrum win the ball was moved out to left centre Keith Senior who dived over in the fiftieth minute to equalise the scores again. Long kicked the conversion successfully so the home side lead 10-8. This lead was extended with a penalty kick by Long making it 12-8. Australia later made their way down to Great Britain's end of the field and on the last tackle Brett Kimmorley from dummy-half ran up to the defensive line then threw a long cut out pass left to his halves partner Craig Gower to run through a gap and dive over the try-line untouched, equalising the score once again. With Fitzgibbon back on the field the conversion was successful so Australia were leading 12-14 with thirty minutes remaining. From the ensuing kick-off Gower knocked on and from the resulting possession right in front of Australia's try-line, Great Britain, after keeping the ball alive got it out to right winger Carney who dove over in the corner again. The video referee <b>checked</b> that the <b>ball</b> was put down properly before Carney's legs were pulled into touch and he was awarded the try, re-gaining the lead for Great Britain. Paul Deacon with his first conversion attempt for Great Britain kicked the goal from the sideline successfully, so the home side were leading 18-14 with less than ten minutes of the match remaining. Then in the seventy-fifth minute the Kangaroos were a few metres into Great Britain's half of the field and on the last tackle. They swung the ball out to the left where Craig Wing made a break and passed it back inside for Darren Lockyer coming up in support to run the remaining fifteen metres and score untouched under the posts.
