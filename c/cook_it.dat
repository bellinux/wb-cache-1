25|$|Following the {{settlement}} between Ngāi Tahu and the Crown in 1998, {{the name of}} the mountain was officially changed from Mount Cook to Aoraki / Mount Cook to incorporate its historic Māori name, Aoraki.

Signifying the importance of Aoraki / Mount <b>Cook,</b> <b>it</b> {{is the only one of}} these names where the Māori name precedes the English. Under the settlement the Crown agreed to return title to Aoraki / Mount Cook to Ngāi Tahu, who would then formally gift it back to the nation.

25|$|Three {{conditions}} must {{be present}} for oil reservoirs to form: a source rock rich in hydrocarbon material buried deep enough for subterranean heat to <b>cook</b> <b>it</b> into oil, a porous and permeable reservoir rock {{for it to}} accumulate in, and a cap rock (seal) or other mechanism that prevents it from escaping to the surface. Within these reservoirs, fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake {{with a layer of}} water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it, although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs. Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water, they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as reservoirs) by impermeable rocks above. However, the process is influenced by underground water flows, causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an oil field forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping.|$|E

25|$|Tibor, Jason and Gabrielle battled {{it out for}} an Aussie Christmas episode {{which set}} a new {{standard}} {{so far in the}} show. Gold Coast chef/teacher Jason struggled with his signature dish round with his Cafe Del Mare (seafood platter For 2) which he served cold after cooking it too early. Gabs impressed the two male judges with an old favourite, aussie burgers minus the beetroot, and Tibor went over the top with a Jurassic feast of ostrich, barbecued pears with spiced honey, walnuts and blue cheese. The secret ingredient this week was turkey, and while Jason professed his loathe for the bird, he was the only contestant able to <b>cook</b> <b>it</b> properly. Mark, Julia and Ben refused to eat Tibor's and Gabrielle's turkey (as it was medium rare) and declared Jason the winner, although Mark thought he was not the best on the day, preferring Gabrielle as a choice. Clearly Jason's food was presented well and his technique was polished thus the judges wanted to see more and gave him the chance to do so as he was put through to the semi finals.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{successful}} winter with the England Lions, Trott was named in England's squad {{for the tour}} of the West Indies. He played as opening batsman in the three-Test series. He struggled in the first Test, scoring only 0 and 4 in a match that ended in a draw. In the second Test he took advantage of favourable conditions in the first innings, making 59 in a 125-run opening partnership with <b>Cook.</b> <b>It</b> was England's first century opening partnership since March 2013. However, in the second innings he failed to trouble the scoreboard, getting bowled on the third ball he faced. England {{went on to win}} the match anyway, going 1–0 up in the series. The series ended in Barbados with a West Indies win, finishing the series 1–1. In this final match, Trott scored 0 and 9, which was one of three ducks Trott scored in his 6 innings in this series. The following day he announced his retirement from international cricket, while stating that he wished to continue playing for Warwickshire. In December 15 Trott joined Edgbaston HC on a part-time basis.|$|E

500|$|Pater Filucius (Father Filucius) is {{the only}} {{illustrated}} satire of this period suggested by the publisher. Also aimed at anti-Catholic taste and buyers, it criticizes the Jesuit Order. Kraus felt it was the weakest of all three anti-clerical works. Some satires refer to contemporary events, such as Monsieur Jacques à Paris during the Siege of 1870 (Monsieur Jacques à Paris während der Belagerung von 1870). Busch biographer Manuela Diers declares the story [...] "tasteless work, drawing on anti-French emotions and mocking the misery of French people in Paris, which is occupied by Prussian troops". It depicts an increasingly desperate French citizen who at first eats a mouse during the German siege, then amputates his dog's tail to <b>cook</b> <b>it,</b> and finally invents an explosion pill which kills his dog and two fellow citizens. Weissweiler believes that Busch wrote with irony. In Eginhard and Emma (1864), a fictional family story {{that takes place in}} the Charlemagne era, he criticizes the Holy Roman Empire and calls for a German empire in its place; in The Birthday or the Particularists (Der Geburtstag oder die Partikularisten) he satirizes the anti-Prussian sentiments of his Hanover countrymen.|$|E

500|$|Anderson met Cora Ann Cremeans in Bend, Oregon, in 1944; {{they married}} three days later, on 3 May, {{claiming}} that they had encountered each other before in the astral realm. Born in Nyota, Alabama, in January 1915, Cora {{had been exposed to}} folk magical practices from childhood; reputedly, her Irish grandfather was a [...] "root doctor" [...] who was known among locals as the [...] "druid". The Andersons claimed that one of their first acts after their marriage was the erection of an altar. The following year, a son was born, and they named him Victor Elon, with the latter being the Hebrew word for oak; Cora claimed that she had received the name in a dream. After the birth, a ritual was held to dedicate the infant to the Goddess. In 1948, the family moved to Niles, California, later that year purchasing a home in San Leandro. There, Anderson {{became a member of the}} Alameda Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, and he subsequently remained so for forty years.

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius sanguifluus are edible, and choice. This was noted by Paulet in his {{original}} {{description of the}} species, who wrote: [...] "This fungus is highly prized for use {{by those who are}} acquainted with it, it keeps well: I kept them for a whole year, it hardens without spoiling, then it takes on a taste of morels. The best way to eat is to <b>cook</b> <b>it</b> in the frying pan or on the grill with oil or butter & salt: it does not take long to cook". The mushrooms are sold in rural markets in France, Spain, Turkey, and Yunnan Province, China. They are also collected by locals in the upper valley of the Serchio River in central Italy. In Spain, where the mushroom is esteemed as a culinary delicacy in Catalan cuisine, it is known as níscalos (in Spanish) or rovelló (in Catalan). In Cyprus, it is known as γαιματάς (meaning [...] "the bloody one") and it is widely collected by the locals, but considered inferior to the saffron milk cap (Lactarius deliciosus). In India, young specimens are consumed along with L.deliciosus; and some consider L.sanguifluus to have a better flavor than its more well-known relative. Its English common name is the [...] "bloody milkcap".|$|E
500|$|The Sex Pistols {{film was}} {{completed}} by Temple, who received sole credit for the script after McLaren had his name taken off the production. Finally released in 1980, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle still largely reflects McLaren's vision. It is a fictionalised, farcical, partially animated retelling of the band's history and aftermath with McLaren in the lead role, Jones as second lead, and contributions from Vicious (including his memorable performance of [...] "My Way") and <b>Cook.</b> <b>It</b> incorporates promotional videos shot for [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] and [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] and extensive documentary footage as well, much of it focusing on Rotten. In Temple's description, he and McLaren conceived it as a [...] "very stylised...polemic". They were reacting {{to the fact that}} the Pistols had become the [...] "poster on the bedroom wall of the day where you kneel down last thing at night and pray to your rock god. And that was never the point.... The myth had to be dynamited in some way. We had to make this film in a way to enrage the fans". In the film, McLaren claims to have created the band from scratch and engineered its notorious reputation; much of what structure the loose narrative has is based on McLaren's teaching a series of [...] "lessons" [...] to be learned from [...] "an invention of mine they called the punk rock".|$|E
